0-> Pamela Jane Oresman Becomes Bride Of Keith N. Browning in Connecticut
At St. Luke's Episcopal Church in Darien, Conn., Pamela Jane Oresman, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Stephen B. Oresman of Darien, was married yesterday to Keith Nulton Browning, a son of Mr. and Mrs. Robert E. Browning of Fairfield, Conn. The Rev. Kevin D. Bean performed the ceremony. Deborah Ann Oresman was maid of honor for her sister, and Russell Edwards Browning was his brother's best man. The bride, who graduated in May from Macalester College in St. Paul, is a granddaughter of Mrs. A. Louis Oresman of New York and the late Mr. Oresman, who was a founding partner of Aronson & Oresman, certified public accountants in New York. Her father is a senior vice president of Booz, Allen & Hamilton Inc., management consultants. Mr. Browning, a product manager with Alco Controls, a manufacturer of refrigeration controls in St. Louis, graduated from the Tabor Academy in Marion, Mass., and from Cornell University. His father is a group vice president of the Emerson Electric Company in St. Louis and president of U.S. Electrical Motors in Milford, Conn. The bridegroom is a grandson of Russell Edwards of Newport, R.I., former society editor of The New York Times, and Martha Jo Swain of West Sayville, L.I., and of the late Mr. and Mrs. L. L. Browning of Maysville, Ky. He is a great-grandson of Adm. Louis McCoy Nulton, superintendent of the United States Naval Academy from 1925 to 1928 and commander of the Atlantic Battle Fleet from 1928 to 1932.

1-> Alfred A. Duckett, 67, Dead; An Author and Businessman
Alfred A. Duckett, an author who collaborated with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on a book and speeches, including Dr. King's ''I Have a Dream'' speech for the 1963 March on Washington, died of cancer Oct. 1 in the University of Illinois Hospital in Chicago. He was 67 years old and lived in Chicago and New York. Mr. Duckett also assisted Dr. King in the writing of both ''Why We Can't Wait,'' a book on the civil rights movement, and ''My Dream,'' a syndicated newspaper column. He collaborated with Jackie Robinson on the baseball player's autobiography, ''I Never Had It Made.'' Mr. Duckett also wrote ''Breakthrough to the Big League,'' a baseball- related book for young people; ''Changing of the Guard,'' about black political figures, and ''Raps,'' a collection of poetry. He operated a public relations company that represented major black entertainment and political figures. Mr. Duckett was born in Brooklyn on March 8, 1917. Poems he wrote as a student were included in Langston Hughes's anthology of black poetry. Mr. Duckett is survived by a daughter, Carolyn Holman, and two sisters, Ruth Duckett Gibbs and Dorothy Duckett Joseph.

3-> YOUR MONEY; LINKED I.R.A.'S: NOTE OF CAUTION
SOME people have opened a type of Individual Retirement Account known as either linked, tandem or Super I.R.A.'s. But these accounts are now under scrutiny by the Internal Revenue Service and should be approached warily. Among the places where the accounts have been offered by commercial banks and savings institutions to local and out-of-state customers are Illinois, Wisconsin, California and Ohio. Such accounts have been heavily advertised and promoted, particularly in the January-to-April period, when most retirement accounts are opened. However, many thoughtful savers are not waiting until next January before starting their 1984 I.R.A.'s. They know that the sooner that funds are deposited in an I.R.A., the sooner they begin to accumulate tax-deferred interest or dividends. Individuals who establish retirement accounts at banks, brokerage firms, mutual fund organizations or insurance companies can contribute up to $2,000 of earned income annually, or $2,250 when there is a non-working spouse, on a tax-deductible basis. Non-penalty withdrawals from an I.R.A. can begin once an account holder reaches age 59 1/2. The accounts that have drawn the attention of the I.R.S. pay above-market interest rates. However, the financial institution also requires that a balance equal to the amount in the I.R.A. be kept in another account that usually is a low-yielding certificate of depositor passbook savings account or even a no-interest checking account. If the amount in such a companion account falls below the linked I.R.A. balance, the interest rate in the I.R.A. generally drops to a lower level. The advantage to those who open high-yielding I.R.A.'s linked to a separate low-yielding account is that the larger return on the I.R.A. is tax-deferred. For the banks, these accounts bring in additional business at little cost. For example, if a bank would otherwise have an annual yield of 13 percent for an I.R.A. with a particular maturity, its linked I.R.A. might yield a whopping 20 percent. But at the same time, the yield on a certifcate of deposit linked to the I.R.A. might be 6 percent annually for the same maturity. ''It's intriguing,'' said Joe A. Mintz, the Dallas- based publisher of NROCA Press, a retirement planning newsletter. ''If I'm rewarded by a high interest rate, I don't see how I've done anything illegal. It's a tie-in sale, like the old days when you had to buy some kind of junky wine and they'd sell you a bottle of whisky.'' The I.R.S. may have another point of view, however. Just before the end of the peak I.R.A. selling season on April 15, its Chicago district office issued a strong warning on the accounts to financial institutions in its area. ''The Internal Revenue Service will consider interest in excess of the regular I.R.A. rate to be taxable interest earned on the companion account,'' wrote J. R. Starkey, the district director. ''In addition, for any year in which the taxpayer has contributed the maximum allowable amount to the Super I.R.A., all 'excess' interest would be considered an excess contribution to the I.R.A. subject to a 6 percent non-deductible excise tax . . . and a 10 percent premature distribution penalty.'' Mr. Starkey added: ''The offering of Super I.R.A.'s must be discontinued. Failure to discontinue these plans could result in the entire I.R.A. plan being considered as not qualifying for I.R.A. treatment in any respect.'' This approach, believed to be the first direct attack on linked I.R.A.'s by the Federal Government, applies only to the Chicago district, since the national office of the I.R.S. has not yet ruled on the matter. Shortly after the Chicago announcement was issued, a spokesman for the I.R.S. in Washington said that a statement would soon be forthcoming, but nothing has thus far been released. Now the service will only say that ''the issue is under study and something will be coming out in the near future.'' W. Wesley Howard 3d, editor of the I.R.A. Reporter, a newsletter published in Cleveland, said: ''My guess is that the national office doesn't have any choice but to go 100 percent with what the Chicago district says. I.R.A.'s lie on the fringe of pension law and for better or worse, I.R.A.'s are subject to some of the areas of law affecting pensions.'' The linked I.R.A.'s may very well be eliminated before they become widely accepted by the public. And until a final determination is made by the I.R.S., there will continue to be doubts as to the long-range viability of this marketing tool with a perceived consumer benefit.

4-> Water Restored on Rikers I.
Water service at the Rikers Island jails was nearly back to normal with a temporary hookup yesterday after being accidentally knocked out by a contractor, city officials said. Bill Andrews, a spokesman for the Department of Environmental Protection, said that the water pressure was slightly lower than normal and that crews would work over the weekend to reconnect the 20-inch main that was accidentally broken on Thursday by a contractor repairing a leaky main in Queens.

8-> LETTERS; A REPUBLICAN REVISE OF THE CARTER YEARS
To the Editor: Always it is the apostates, the Whittaker Chamberses and Jeane Kirkpatricks of this world, who burn with the hardest, brightest flames of new truth. Poor Jimmy Carter. To belittle and denounce him (and of course Walter Mondale), as Mrs. Kirkpatrick did last Monday, is the prescribed rite of passage to the new Republicanism. He must be recognized and proclaimed as the symbol of a tired, weak, bumbling national, but particularly international, policy - everything that red-blooded Republicanism stands strong against. If there was pusillanimity in Vietnam, it was the Carter policy (try that one as a creative piece of revisionist history). If there were hostages taken in Teheran (the ''most humiliating'' experience in American history), it was clearly another example of Carter's weakness. And if they were released without loss of life among them, the triumph was that of this ''strong'' new Administration. If there are unprecedented national deficits, the root cause is the Carter Administration. If enormous increases in military expenditures have nevertheless left us less prepared, the fault is Carter's. It is time to stop acquiescing to this unmitigated nonsense. The fact is that the Carter record of foreign policy accomplishments, taken with all its blemishes, was one of the stronger performances in recent U.S. history. Where are the Camp David agreements, the SALT II's and the Panama Canal treaties of this Administration? What had the Nixon-Ford-Kissinger record of cumulative disasters to compare? Or for that matter the Johnson Administration? Are we so swept by voguish notions of ''success'' and ''failure'' in foreign policy that we have taken leave of our senses? ALBERT G. SIMS Riverside, Conn., Aug. 22, 1984

10-> RESTRUCTURING OF U.S. SCHOOLS URGED BY PANEL OF EDUCATORS
A study group of the National Education Association said yesterday that the nation's public schools ''must be totally restructured'' if they are to meet the needs of the future. Teachers should make decisions that affect instruction instead of centralized school districts, the panel recommended, and schools should guarantee that students ''master'' subjects and not just pass them. The group's report urged rigorous evaluation of teachers and better training of teachers. It also called for more aid from the Federal Government, a large increase in teachers' starting salaries and a reform of local property taxes, which provide much of the financial support for schools. The report also opposed merit pay and other plans that it said might substitute for across-the-board compensation. The group's report to the National Education Association, the country's largest teacher organization, with 1.7 million members, is one of a number of reports that have been issued by various groups over the last 18 months since a Federal commission contended that ''a rising tide of mediocrity'' threatened the nation's future. Panelists' Teaching Experience The association's panel, unlike other groups that have prepared such studies, is entirely composed of people with teaching experience. ''We challenge community and educational leaders to join us in creating a specific action plan for restructuring the schools - a plan that will spell out how students should be taught, technologies that will be needed, and how schools should be staffed,'' the report said. The 18-page report, ''An Open Letter to America on Schools, Students and Tomorrow,'' is being presented to the association's 7,000-delegate Representative Assembly, which begins a four- day annual meeting tomorrow in Minneapolis. Action on the report, which must be adopted by the Assembly before it can become official policy of the association, is expected Monday. The report said the current level of Federal financing, about 6 percent of the funds that support elementary and secondary education, amounted to ''a shameful abandonment of the Federal Government's responsibility to our nation's future.'' Call for 'Fairer' Taxes As for local property taxes, the report said, ''More communities would support adequate property tax revenue for better schools if property taxes were fairer.'' It proposed that the minimum starting salary of teachers be set at $24,000 a year, nearly double the current level, to make teaching competitive with other professions that require comparable training and responsibilities. Among the problems the report cited were classes overflowing with students, constant shortages of textbooks, and work schedules that limit teachers' opportunities to work with students individually, to correct homework assignments and to consult with parents.

11-> PROSPECTS; TRUCK SALES RUMBLE UP
There has been no down-shifting in sales of heavy trucks, which are near the record set in October 1979 - and may even break it before the year is out. ''Class 8'' trucks, which have a combined vehicle and cargo weight of 16.5 tons, represent a costly investment to even the biggest motor carriers. In May, sales of these huge rigs totaled 12,443 units, second only to the record 15,227 sold four- and-a-half years earlier. Paul R. Schlesinger, who monitors the truck industry for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, pointed out that sales in May were 158 percent above the level a year ago. April's gain was 83 percent above the depressed 1983 level. ''The figures not only indicate we may see a record year for heavy truck sales, but also that the motor carriers think the economy will remain strong enough to justify their investment in these expensive rigs,'' Mr. Schlesinger said. The rapid aging of the nation's heavy-truck fleet, the better fuel efficiency of the new big rigs and the fact that carriers are being allowed to haul larger loads may also be stimulating sales, Mr. Schlesinger added.

12-> POTSINGS; SEASHORE TOWN HOUSES
A wave of condominium development is rolling along the coast of Monmouth County, New Jersey, as developers attempt to meet an increasing demand for year-round seashore dwellings in locations that have emerged as bedroom communties in the last few decades. Long Branch, which is situated on a strip of land between the Atlantic Ocean and the Shrewsbury River, is one of the areas that have experienced the greatest surge in new construction. One residential complex under construction in North Long Branch is Sea Winds, a condominium community going up on Patten Point, at 548 Patten Avenue. The community will eventually include 75 town-house-style units. The architectural firm of Tomaino & Tomaino of Deal, N.J., has designed the two- and three-bedroom units, which feature multilevel layouts with balconies and decks. Most of the units will have riverfront views, and plans call for the construction of a dock with boat slips for homeowners. The prices will range from $129,000 to $210,000. The developer of the project is John Tsakaris. Work is being completed on the first 16 units, and occupancy is scheduled for October.

13-> ON LANGUAGE; FILLER FAD
Jack Rosenthal is deputy editorial page editor of The New York Times. William Safire is on vacation. Why did interviewers interrupt Margaret Thatcher so often? The question intrigued Geoffrey Beattie, a British psychologist, so he played the television tape of an interview with the British Prime Minister for 132 people and studied their reactions. The answer, he reported last year in Nature magazine, is that she was inviting the interruptions. Speakers usually give signals that they've stopped thinking. They pause, for instance, or drop their voices at the end of a statement. Mrs. Thatcher seemed to be giving such clues at unintended moments. Although she was still in midthought when she paused, her interlocutors assumed she was finished and thought they were pushing on, not butting in. What to do? How, in such a situation, might someone signal, ''I'm not through yet''? One possibility, Mr. Beattie suggested for Mrs. Thatcher, is ''a few ums and ers .'' That suggestion may nettle parents and purists, jarred when children turn these irritating fillers into staples of teen-age speech. But it accords perfectly with an evolving area of linguistic interest called pausology, the study of what people don't say, or - you know - what they say when they're not saying anything. You know (with variants like like and like you know ) is the current filler fad, probably even more popular in teen talk than the classics like um and er . But there are plenty of others. By all odds, the most popular Federal filler these days is the word that first pops out of President Reagan's mouth whenever he answers a reporter's question. Look at the transcript of a Presidential news conference. I turned randomly to the one of Feb. 22. In one stretch of seven questions, Mr. Reagan embarked on six answers by saying, ''Well . . . .'' Miriam Eisenstein, a New York University authority on linguistics, observes that if they're not through talking, most people use some kind of utterance to show they still want the floor. That's especially true in phone conversations, which lack gestures or body language to carry the message. An editor affably interpolates you see into his conversation. An accomplished pollster regularly uses a word that sounds something like thing . A cheerful and cherubic European man says, '' Ja, ja ,'' as in ''And how, ja, ja , are the children?'' The filler need not be automatic. Sometimes, we all use conscious terms - Oh, isn't that interesting? or That's a good question - while thinking of how to frame the answer that's expected of us. Governor Cuomo used both kinds of filler in a television interview recently when asked how the Democratic electorate has changed. ''Well, it's a complicated question,'' he said, before going on to give a complicated, and interesting, answer. Pausologists have discovered instructive regional differences in the unspoken ground rules of speech. In ''Conversational Style,'' a book published recently by Ablex, Norwood, N.J., Deborah Tannen, a linguist at Georgetown University in Washington, tells about recording a dinner-table conversation involving people from California and New York. When she heard the tape, she was surprised. Not by the differences in topics: As might be expected, the Californians talked more about safe, detached subjects like automobiles while the New Yorkers plunged into personal observations and discussions of their feelings. What was startling was the confusion and even tension that arose over interruptions and delays. The tape showed that, like Mrs. Thatcher's interviewers, New Yorkers infer from a speaker's falling tone that he or she is about to stop talking. They feel free to jump in before the speaker is altogether finished. Speakers from New York, accustomed to such snappy ground rules, take no offense. Indeed, if no one breaks in, they feel abandoned. Californians, governed by more patient Western protocols of speech, wait to speak until the speaker falls wholly silent. They take it as an insult for someone to step on their lines. In other words, people can seriously misunderstand what it is they're not saying to each other. Error of Margin Polling has suffused politics not only with numbers but also with the nomenclature of numbers. Political professionals toss about terms like marginals , internals and margin of error . But as with other terms of art, the words can mean something quite different from their equivalents in plain English. Marginal is a case in point. In politics, it can mean one thing - or almost completely the other, just like the verb to table , which can mean either to put off indefinitely or to bring up immediately. In ordinary speech, marginal generally means something on the edge, of fringe importance, of dubious value. In ordinary political discourse, marginal might also mean close, as in, ''Both candidates campaigned hard there, regarding it as a marginal district.'' But in statistical usage, marginal means something like the bottom line. It refers to the totals in the column on the left-hand margin of a computer printout. Those are the numbers that tell what all the people interviewed in a survey think about a particular question. For instance, when The New York Times/ CBS News Poll asked people in April if they approved of the President's performance in office, the answer was 53 percent yes, 35 percent no, 11 percent other. That was the marginal. It contrasts with internals or partials showing how subgroups answered. That same April survey produced these internals: The President's approval rate among women was lower, 47 percent yes to 40 percent no; among men it was higher, 60 to 31; among people over the age of 64, it was 49 to 38. There is yet another kind of margin popularized by political statistics, the margin of error . It's not a hard concept, and most people think they grasp it. If an answer is 53 to 35 and the margin of error is four points, then the spread might actually be as close as 49 to 39, or as wide as 57 to 31. That's right, yet even people who understand the concept of error often fall into error. One reason is that, in fact, the size of the margin of error is not firmly fixed. It depends on the number of people interviewed and on the size of the spread. Given a sample size of 1,500 people, if the outcome is 51 to 49, the margin of error might be four points. But if the outcome is 81 to 19, error drops to two points - and if 91 to 9, to one point. The second common error about margin of error is even larger and it becomes evident with the addition of a missing word: margin of sampling error. Political pollsters sometimes dwell on that kind of error because it is measurable. But there are other objective kinds, like key- punch error, not to mention subjective kinds, like order effects or context effects. That is, people may rate the President less favorably if the rating question is asked after, rather than before, specific questions about national concerns. Thus, the way to understand error without error is to guard against taking comfort in a false sense of statistical certitude. Political statistics are invaluable. They can be quite revealing and quite accurate and will almost never disappoint anyone who masters a common-sense rule: Don't take a number too literally.

14-> Jane Marian Schmeiser Wed to Andrew Power
The marriage of Jane Marian Schmeiser, a corporate planner with the First National Bank of Chicago, to Andrew Charles Power, a management consultant for McKinsey & Company in Chicago, took place yesterday in Pittsburgh. Mayor Richard S. Caliguiri of Pittsburgh performed the ceremony at the Concordia Club. Mrs. Power, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Ronald C. Schmeiser of Pittsburgh, graduated from Harvard College and received an M.B.A. degree from Harvard University in 1982, as did her husband, the son of Mr. and Mrs. Richard K. Power of Tenbury Wells, England. He is a graduate of the Charterhouse School and Cambridge University. The bride's father is director of finance of the City of Pittsburgh. Her mother, Ethel Schmeiser, is an owner of Back Up Medical Supply Inc. The bridegroom's father is president of Paybrook Engineering Ltd., a machine-tool manufacturer in Redditch, England.

15-> Praised Dignity Wins Pace
Praised Dignity made a late rush from far back to win the $643,000 Lawrence B. Sheppard Pace for 2-year-old pacers tonight at Yonkers Raceway. The winner, who had beaten favored Ramblin Storm by a neck in an elimination heat a week ago, overcame some early trouble to score with a wide rush in the stretch. Major Force finished second, three- quarters of a length behind the winner and 1 1/4 lengths in front of Walkabout, an entrymate from the Bill Haughton Stable. Ramblin Storm, sent off at 6-to-5, faded to finish sixth after leading for most of the way. The race was somewhat marred by a messy incident around the first turn, when a series of bumps caused Supreme Dynasty to break stride, causing him to lose all chance. Praised Dignity also lost some ground, but clearly recovered well. The winner, driven by Bill Popfinger, paid $13.60 for $2 to win and paced the mile in 1:59 3/5, one second off the stakes record set last year by Trutone Lobell. ''This horse raced super his last two or three starts, and I knew the only thing that could beat us was the post,'' said Popfinger, who also trains Praised Dignity and began from post seven. ''He's the best horse I ever had at this point in his career. I would have won by more but my whip got caught on the side of the bike just at the finish.'' Half of the Sheppard purse of $643,000 - the richest offered for any horse race in New York state this year - went to the winner's owner, Irving Cohen of North Woodmere, N.Y. The bay colt, a son of Albatross and the Tar Heel mare Heel and Flo, was winning for the fourth time in eight career starts. He has won his last four starts in a row. Ramblin Storm left quickest tonight, opening an easy lead down the backstretch as Walkabout and Pudgy stayed closest in the early going, behind a pace of 28 4/5 for the first quarter and 59 for the half. The leader and favorite still looked good after three-quarters in 1:29 1/5, but turning for home he began to weaken. ''Praised Dignity can do anything,'' Popfinger said. ''He can leave, he can come from behind, and he's tough in the middle too.'' There was one false start to the Sheppard, when Slam Jam failed to get behind the gate in time and a recall was ordered. The colt, the longshot in the field at 35-to-1, then had to return to the paddock for minor equipment repairs, delaying the start by 10 minutes. The field for the Sheppard final was determined a week ago, when 48 hopefuls competed in six elimination heats. The winners, and the three runners-up with the best times, advanced to the final field of nine. Some of the more highly regarded entrants failed to qualify, including several colts from the first crop sired by Niatross. In the six heats last Saturday, the winning times ranged from the 1:59 1/5 turned in by anxious Robby to the 2:01 by Standing O. The latter was one of three colts from the Bill Haughton Stable to make the final, but Haughton was disappointed that Pollinator, a highly regarded Albatross colt that finished a close third behind Anxious Robbie - and actually turned in the third fastest time of the night - did not qualify.

16-> IDEAS & TRENDS ; Teachers Urged
To Face Change The lesson plan at last week's meeting of the American Federation of Teachers included economics and a heavy dose of practical politics in education. Albert Shanker, president of the 600,000-member federation, put the matter bluntly: ''Either we (say) we are willing to improve the profession ourselves or the governors are going to act for us.'' He was referring to state government efforts to improve the quality of teachers and the level of teaching. Self-improvement, Mr. Shanker said, means admitting that some teachers are better than other teachers and that the better ones should judge the others - in short, that educators should consider instituting peer review and ''career ladders,'' in which outstanding teachers are given more responsibilities and, with them, higher pay. Most teachers are rated - and prefer to be rated - by principals rather than by colleagues. The National Education Association, the federation's rival with 1.8 million members, has been unenthusiastic about career ladders and their close cousins, ''merit pay'' plans. (Merit pay involves singling out better teachers and rewarding them with higher salaries.) The Reagan Administration supports merit pay. The Rand Corporation of Santa Monica, Calif., coincidentally issued a report last week showing that the ablest leave teaching soonest and the worst stay longest. The report recommended that teacher salaries be raised to a range of $20,000 to $50,000. The current starting average nationally is about $14,000; more experienced teachers average $22,000.

17-> LEMON LAW CASES SEEM TO BE RISING
IT looks as though the new ''lemon law'' arbitration panel will have more work than anticipated. When the General Assembly set up the new panel to hear disputes under the ''lemon law'' revisions it passed earlier this year, it was estimated that the panel would hear about 500 cases a year, or just over 40 a month. Although the panel does not begin work until Oct. 1, it set up a phone line in July for complaints, and in its first month received more than 100. In August, it received even more. ''It looks like it's going to be busier than expected,'' said Lois Bryant, a spokesman for the Consumer Protection Department, which will oversee the panel. She said the number of cases could be as high as 1,200 a year. Wendy Cobb, the program coordinator for the arbitration panel, expects a slow start, because when the panel first begins work it can only hear complaints against vehicles bought after Oct. 1. ''What we expect is a big influx of cases by January,'' as the new vehicles are driven farther and more problems show up, Miss Cobb said. Connecticut's first lemon law was enacted in 1982. It required dealers to replace vehicles in the first 12 months or 9,000 miles after they were sold if the vehicles were out of servie and required repairs for the same defect more than four times. The law encouraged manufacturers to establish arbitration panels, but if a complaint could not be resolved, the only recourse was the courts. The new lemon law extended, beginning last July 1, the time and mileage period of the original bill to the first two years or 18,000 miles. And if a manufacturer has no state- certified arbitration program, the consumer protection panel has been authorized to resolve complaints. So far, out of about 29 car and motorcycle manufacturers doing business in Connecticut, only the Ford Motor Company has applied to certify a program, according to Garry Desjardins, the assistant attorney general in charge of lemon law enforcement. Ford operated an arbitration program voluntarily for the first year of the lemon law, Mr. Desjardin said. Chrysler has also operated its own arbitration program, and the Better Business Bureau operated a program for several other manufacturers. Both those programs are expected to seek state certification, Mr. Desjardin said. Because auto makers are not required to report complaints, Mr. Desjardin said, the state has no figures on how many refunds or replacements were made in the first year of the lemon law. A requirement for any certified program, however, is that all complaints be listed in an annual audit, Mr. Desjardins said, so by next year the number of seriously faulty vehicles sold in the state should become known. One problem with the new law, Mr. Desjardins said, is that it is being phased in. In fact, the Attorney General's office has only recently set forth what is required for a program to be certified. A public hearing on the proposed rules is to take place Friday, and they are to be adopted shortly after that. Under the new law, if a consumer buys a faulty vehicle, a decision on whether to replace the vehicle or to refund the buyer's money must be made within 60 days of the complaint being filed, whether by the consumer protection panel or by the manufactuer's arbitration program. Once the decision is made, the award must be made within 10 days, unless it involves a full refund or replacement, in which case the manufacturer has 30 days, but must lend the customer a vehicle no more than two years old. ''These are comprehensive standards meant to deal with far-reaching areas,'' Mr. Desjardins said. ''There's a lot to is. Trying to keep it all straight is confusing.'' Mrs. Bryant said if a consumer had a legitimate complaint and the manufacturer refused to make good, the consumer protection department could take action against the manufacturer under the Connecticut unfair trade practices act or ask the State Department of Motor Vehicles to revoke or suspend the manufacturer's license to sell within Connecticut. Each Complaint will be heard by a board of three arbitrators chosen from a panel of volunteers Miss Cobb is assembling. So far, 25 people have offered their time to the arbitration panel, but Miss Cobb said twice as many are needed, and she has been posting notices in town halls, libraries and centers for the elderly, seeking more volunteers. The three-member boards will rely on independent auto mechanics to aid them. The mechanics will be volunteers, Miss Cobb said, and though five have offered their services so far, ''we could use many more.'' To sit on the panel, a volunteer must be at least 18 years old and cannot be connected with the auto industry. Anyone wishing to volunteer their time can call 566-7457. For people seeking information on the lemon law, the number to call is easy to remember: (800) 538-CARS.

18-> SOVIET AND U.S. STATEMENTS ON SPACE-WEAPONS NEGOTIATIONS
Following are excerpts from the text of a Soviet Government statement issued in Moscow yesterday proposing talks on the banning of weapons in space, as distributed in translation by the Soviet press agency Tass and reported by The Associated Press, and the text of a statement issued in response in Washington by Robert C. McFarlane, the national security adviser: Soviet Statement The Soviet Government most insistently draws attention to the need to take urgent measures to prevent the militarization of outer space. The use of force in space or from space against Earth, and also from Earth against objects in space must be banned for all times. The Government of the Soviet Union offers the Government of the United States of America to begin at the level of specially appointed delegations Soviet-American talks to prevent the militarization of outer space. The question of the complete mutual renunciation of antisatellite systems should be resolved within the framework of those talks. Vienna Suggested as Talk Site These talks could be initiated in Vienna in September this year given the consent of the Austrian Government. The specific date for the opening of the talks could be agreed upon through diplomatic channels. To provide favorable conditions for the achievement of agreement and to take practical measures already now to prevent the race in space weapons, the Soviet Union also offers to impose on a reciprocal basis a moratorium on tests and deployment of these weapons beginning with the date of the opening of the talks. Naturally, other states will be welcome to join in this moratorium. Being the leading powers in space exploration, the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A. must do everything they can to insure peaceful skies for mankind and to set an example for other states in accomplishing that task facing the whole of humanity by laying the foundations for a multilateral agreement to this effect. In view of the urgency and importance of this question, the Soviet Government expects an early and positive response of the Government of the U.S.A. to this address. U.S. Statement The United States Government has taken note of the statement by the Soviet Government proposing a meeting of delegations in September to begin negotiations on ''preventing the militarization of outer space.'' The militarization of space began when the first ballistic missiles were tested and when such missiles and other weapons systems using outer space began to be deployed. The United States Government therefore draws attention to the pressing need for the resumption of negotiations aimed at a radical reduction of nuclear weapons, on a balanced and verifiable basis. Therefore, the United States Government has informed the Government of the Soviet Union that it is prepared to meet with the Soviet Union in September, at any location agreeable to the Soviet Union, and the government of the country where the meeting is held for the following purposes: (1)To discuss and define mutually agreeable arrangements under which negotiations on the reduction of strategic and intermediate-range nuclear weapons can be resumed and (2)To discuss and seek agreement on feasible negotiating approaches which could lead to verifiable and effective limitations on antisatellite weapons. We will also be prepared to discuss any other arms control concerns or other matters of interest to both sides. We will continue contacts with the Soviet Union through diplomatic channels on arrangements for these September talks.

20-> SLUMPING METS DROP 4TH IN A ROW
The sudden slide of the Mets steepened last night when they lost to the Atlanta Braves, 5-3, for their fourth consecutive defeat and the sixth in their last eight games. Only four days earlier, they had taken a lead of one game in the National League East. Now, they were two games back, in third place and losing altitude. And Dave Johnson sat in the manager's office in Shea Stadium afterward, watching the Chicago Cubs playing the Dodgers in Los Angeles on television, and he said: ''I could push a panic button and make wholesale changes, but it's too early for that.'' Early or late, the Mets were stumbling after nearly three months of sprinting. Brooks and Strawberry Back They got Darryl Strawberry and Hubie Brooks back into the lineup after injuries, but still were outhit, 15 to 6. For the second consecutive night, they loaded the bases with nobody out, and scored only one run. And Ed Lynch, one of their more reliable starters, was outpitched by Steve Bedrosian, a relief specialist making a one-night stand as a starter. They even heard booing from the 21,458 fans, especially when George Foster struck out with the bases loaded to end the fifth inning. Foster, a man with 299 home runs and three World Series rings, considered the gyrations of fortune and said: ''It's different, because I've usually been in the driver's seat. You try not to get caught up in the fans' response. You can't let them control your emotions. I remember last year I hit two grand slams in one week, then popped up to the catcher, and they booed me.'' Before the booing began last night, the Braves took a 3-0 lead in the second inning, and the Mets never quite caught up. Chambliss Is Walked Lynch invited trouble when he walked Chris Chambliss. One out later, Glenn Hubbard hit a line drive to right field that took a bad hop past Strawberry for a double and a run. Then Alex Trevino singled through the middle, and the Mets trailed by two. The Mets didn't need any omens, but they got one, anyway. Bedrosian tried to bunt Trevino to second and missed as the pitch bounced past the plate, and Trevino ran all the way to third. Then Bedrosian struck out, but Rafael Ramirez rammed a single off Lynch's glove, and the Mets trailed by three. One inning later, the Mets made a menacing gesture that was worth two runs: With one down, Wally Backman walked and, with two down, Keith Hernandez reached the right-field bullpen with his sixth home run of the season. But the Mets couldn't exploit their chance. They fell farther behind in the fourth, when Ramirez singled, took second on a groundout and scored when Gerald Perry singled to left field. The ball skidded low past Foster for an error, and Perry went to second base. And, when Dale Murphy lined a single to center, the Mets trailed by three. Bedrosian Bears Down That was when the Mets built their best chance, and wasted it. In the fifth, Jose Oquendo singled, Ron Hodges pinch hit a single, Backman walked and the bases were loaded with nobody out. One run crossed when Mookie Wilson rammed into a force-out, but that was all they got. Bedrosian, working like a relief pitcher in trouble, struck out Hernandez. Then, after Wilson stole second, he walked Strawberry intentionally to fill the bases again. But Foster struck out, and the chance was gone. ''I got Hernandez on a slider, and Foster on a high fastball,'' Bedrosian said later.'' ''And he got a big forceout on Wilson on a changeup,'' Manager Joe Torre said. ''We needed to pitch Bedrosian because Len Barker has a tender elbow, and Steve's been hit hard in his last nine games. He had to get untracked, and he really did get untracked.'' Foster to Sit Out a Game Johnson said that he would rest Foster in this afternoon's game, with Danny Heep playing left field. ''But I'm not platooning Foster,'' he said. . . . Hernandez, over his last 10 games, has been hitting .514, and has knocked in 16 runs in 18 games. . . . The Mets also lost four straight a month ago. Phillies 7, Astros 2 PHILADELPHIA, June 29 (AP) - Glenn Wilson hit a three-run homer and Ozzie Virgil hit one for two runs in a six-run fourth inning. Steve Carlton (6-4) left the game after Kevin Bass led off the ninth with a line-drive single off the pitcher's right shin. Carlton struck out 10 to increase his major league-leading total to 3,798. The victory was the 305th of Carlton's career, moving him past Eddie Plank into second place among left-handers, behind Warren Spahn with 363. Expos 7, Reds 3 CINCINNATI (UPI) - Tim Wallach homered and drove in three runs. Charlie Lea (12-2), who pitched a five-hitter, retired the last 19 batters and tied the Cardinals' Joaquin Andujar (12-6) for the league lead in victories. Pete Rose set a major- league record for most games played when he appeared in No. 3,309 against the Reds, with whom he played his first game April 8, 1963. Rose broke the mark set last season by Carl Yastrzemski of the Red Sox.

21-> Nicaraguan Dissident Denies Plan for Exile
Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, the director of a Nicaraguan opposition newspaper, said today that censorship was stifling the paper but that he had no intention of going into exile in protest. Interviewed at Miami's airport as he prepared to board a flight to Costa Rica, Mr. Chamorro said that comments he made Thursday in Washington had been misinterpreted by journalists who reported that he was going into ''voluntary exile'' in Costa Rica. Mr. Chamorro, 33 years old, left Nicaragua on Nov. 15 to attend journalism conferences in Tokyo and Madrid. He said he had told the Washington journalists that he might not return to Managua because of travel restrictions and censorship of his newspaper, La Prensa. But he said he learned today that the travel restrictions had been lifted. He added that he hoped that censorship would be eased, and he said he would probably return to Managua visiting his wife and four children, who are living in Costa Rica. ''I am not in exile,'' Mr. Chamorro added. ''I do not consider myself in exile. I never said I was not going to return. I never mentioned the word exile. I have not made a final decision, but it is likely I will return after Christmas.''

22-> THE VERDICT ON JURIES
Irving R. Kaufman's article 'The Verdict on Juries' (April 1) was an important contribution toward greater understanding of the jury system. Having served as chairman of the Jury Committee of the Appellate Divison, I am heartened by this recent writing, which shows an awareness that jury service is an important part of sound judicial functioning and an important role for citizens in a democracy. At a time when juries are frequently attacked, the article was necessary defense, and will, I hope, result in a greater appreciation of the value of juries. CAROLINE K. SIMON New York City

24-> OUTDOORS; MEMORY'S UNWRITTEN DIARY
All too often after I have recounted a tale of fishing success, my listeners show distress at my inability to remember the hour or the phase of the moon or tide - and sometimes even the month or year - during which the expedition took place. ''For God's sake,'' one of them remarked recently, ''don't you know the value of keeping a fishing journal? Think of the information you could have gathered in over 50 years of angling.'' The only journal I ever kept was a diary spanning my 11th and 12th years, and a cursory perusal of it reveals my shortcomings in such a venture and also hints at my moderate fishing skills. On April 18, 1934, my entry was succinct: ''I forgot what I did today.'' The next day's chronicle begins: ''In the morning about 4 o'clock I went down to the brook and caught one trout about 8 inches long.'' A few days later I wrote, ''Today is my birthday and I went fishing but I didn't catch anything.'' After noting that Druscilla gave me two presents at a school party and that I liked her the best, the next entry with a reference to fishing reveals that I again went empty-handed. An angling journal would unduly restrict my recounting of long-ago fishing adventures. How could I put my heart into a tale of hauling a 30-pound striped bass from the raging surf on a handline when I was 16, if a journal entry revealed that the fish was half that size? A journal would also steal the romance from past expeditions. Without being immodest, I can safely assert that I have a marvelous knack for swiftly forgetting the tedium that is part of many fishing, camping or hunting trips, and to maintain that level of nostalgic intoxication one must not become overburdened by facts. I am now thinking of a three-day Atlantic salmon trip in Canada a decade ago during which I caught one 18-pound fish. Clearly, there were long, boring sessions of casting to unresponsive fish or over barren water, but they are forgotten. What is not forgotten is the sudden weight of the unseen take - I was watching a flight of mergansers against the far shore at the moment of truth - and the glorious, silvery form of the salmon hurtling from the dark pool, which was followed by a long run, another leap and the satisfaction of putting all pressure possible on a well- hooked fish as the sun went behind the mountain and mist began to rise from the river. It may also be that because my occupation involves a rudimentary journal of many of my angling endeavors that I am averse to keeping a detailed account of all of them. When one must later chronicle a trip in which he is engaged, one tends to resist total immersion in the enterprise at hand, to think of what must eventually be written. A proper angling journal should include all pertinent information: date, time, place, wind force and direction, air and water temperature, moon phase, lure, fly or bait used, fish caught, fish lost, fish that made a pass at fly or lure but did not actually take. Marine anglers should also include the phase of the tide, and, where applicable, both they and their freshwater counterparts should note the depth at which the fish were found. Those fly fishing for trout should also make note of the aquatic and terrestrial insect life and jot down the time during which the former were emerging. There are many skilled fishermen who relish keeping such journals, and many more of equal competence who keep no records whatsoever, but who possess an uncanny ability to come up with the right approach at the right time. I have a strong tendency to persist too long with what has worked for me before. This is particlarly true when I am fly fishing for trout on a pond or lake. There have been many times when - mesmerized by the warm sun, shining water, the silence and solitude of the place and the ritual of casting - I have gone fishless for hours without changing my original fly, a fly that had produced well on a previous visit to the spot. Such doggedness is obviously asinine, but the trick is to know when to leaven persistence with innovation. Although there is a temptation to experiment with new angling techniques - an urge that is strengthened by the flood of yarns in outdoor magazines describing the brilliant results achieved with new methods - those who have fished for 30, 40, 50 years or more have learned that one should first try the traditional approach to a given species. This was brought home to me during two recent fishing trips. On the first, my companion and I discovered that bluefish - they were from three to six pounds - in a protected salt bay refused the popping plugs that are commonly used for the species when they are surface feeding. On that day, after a dozen casts over breaking fish with poppers produced nothing, we switched to slim subsurface swimming plugs such as the Rapala or the Rebel and got strikes on nearly every cast. A few days later, and before I had time to forget the details of the first encounter, I visited the same bay with a lad whose mind was not cluttered with angling minutiae. On that excursion, after trying the nearby surf with scant success, I suggested that we repair to the bay. When we got there, I spent 10 minutes rigging up - with a sinker - one of the lightweight swimming plugs I had used on my previous trip so I could cast it into the 30- knot southwest wind. Knowing nothing of my previous experience - I was purposely keeping it a secret so I could impress him with my sagacity - my companion marched into the wind-churned water with his popper - nearly all such plugs cast like a bullet - and promptly caught a blue. He beached two more before I had my lure ready and it proved inneffectual because its triple set of treble hooks immediately snagged the eel grass and that onerous seaweed Codium fragile the half-gale had blown to the windward shore of the bay. I managed to catch a few fish before darkness, but I clearly would have done better not knowing what those fish had wanted three days before, and because I keep no journal I will forget their aberrative behavior before next summer.

25-> HAPPY DAYS ARE HERE AGAIN
President Reagan claims that in 50 years the distinctions between the Republicans and the Democrats have never been greater. In truth, judging by both parties' conventions, they have rarely looked more alike. What's striking is not their divergence of positions but their convergence. All through their convention in Dallas last week, Republican speakers piously invoked the Democratic pantheon of heroes: Roosevelt, Truman, Kennedy. The President even enlarged it, referring favorably to Hubert Humphrey and Henry Jackson. In San Francisco, the Democrats, seeking a fresher image, replaced ''Happy Days Are Here Again'' as their standard convention anthem. Guess which party picked it up last week. Happy days or not, late August, after the conventions end, is always a time for both parties to rush toward the political center. This year's convergence, on the big issues of peace and prosperity, seems extraordinary. Republicans, like Democrats, cheer for nuclear arms control; Democrats, like Republicans, applaud discipline in social spending. Both sides declaim against interventionism. Both sides rail against deficit spending, differing only on whose deficits they are talking about. President Reagan complains of $260 billion in Democratic deficits over five years. Walter Mondale assails a Reagan deficit of $200 billion each year. ''For the sake of our civilization, we must negotiate a mutual, verifiable nuclear freeze before those weapons destroy us all.'' So said Mr. Mondale in his acceptance speech. ''For the sake of our children and the safety of this earth, we ask the Soviets - who have walked out of our negotiations - to join us in reducing and, yes, ridding the earth of this awful threat.'' So said President Reagan in his acceptance speech, avoiding any truculent trace of his ''evil empire'' denunciations of Russia. The August convergence of the parties is evident in another way. Without compelling issues to divide them, what are they arguing about? Issues like abortion, school prayer and tuition tax credits. These are provocative and important philosophical questions. But they're not the pivotal issues on which national elections usually turn. In the absence of powerful issues that affect the great middle, the parties struggle at the level of atmospherics and appearances. The Democratic convention tried to portray the Republicans as unfair, people who rig the rules for the rich. The Republican strategem last week was to nominate three candidates. In addition to choosing Ronald Reagan and George Bush as the nominees of their own party, they nominated someone for the Democrats as well, a fellow named Fear. Representative Jack Kemp of New York assailed the opposition for offering nothing but fear, ''fear of the future, fear of growth, fear of global leadership.'' Former President Ford said all the Democrats have to offer ''is fear itself.'' The Republican platform says it's ironic that the party of F.D.R., who said all we have to fear is fear itself, ''has itself become the party of fear.'' Then President Reagan, in his acceptance address, characterized the Democrats' idea of government as pessimism, fear and limits, contrasted with the Republican idea of hope, confidence and growth. The heavy swinging has started; the fall campaign is under way. There are, surely, deep divisions. What is the proper meaning of social and religious tolerance? Of affirmative action? Does defense spending warrant a generous margin of error? Does spending against hunger? There are differences about the parties' competence to govern and there may be differences about their competence to campaign. But, for the moment, what's striking are the similarities. Here, for anyone who doubts them, is a little test. The following statements were made near the end of the speeches accepting the 1984 Presidential nominations. Who made which? B America is a future each generation must enlarge; a door each generation must open; a promise each generation must keep. B Through that golden door our children can walk into tomorrow with the knowledge that no one can be denied the promise that is America.

26-> POP CONCERT: ROAD SHOW OPENS IN KANSAS CITY
The first show of the Jacksons' Victory Tour, a summer road show that is being touted as the most spectacular and potentially the most profitable tour in pop music history, got under way Friday soon after dark at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Mo. And the show's opening minutes certainly were spectacular. Amid swirling smoke, flashing lights and laser beams, a booming voice intoning, ''Rise, all the world, and behold,'' and a thunderous electronic sound storm, a gaggle of shaggy-haired, shambling creatures reminiscent of some of the creations in the recent fantasy film ''The Dark Crystal'' shuffled onto the stage and gathered around a sword that seemed to be imbedded in a large stone. Several of the five Jackson brothers who are performing on this tour tried to pull the sword from the stone and failed. Finally, one of them succeeded, as King Arthur is supposed to have done. And, of course, that was Michael Jackson. At the moment, Michael Jackson is the hottest property in popular music. His most recent album, ''Thriller,'' released late in 1982, has sold nearly 35 million copies worldwide. The Jacksons' new album, ''Victory,'' features Michael Jackson on only three songs; five other songs are written, produced and sung by various combinations of the other Jackson brothers - Jackie, Jermaine, Marlon, Randy and Tito. Out Front in the Spotlight But Michael Jackson has always been the focal point of the group's concerts, and he was out front in the spotlight through most of Friday night's show. Except for a brief, intriguingly eclectic set of four songs by Jermaine Jackson, whose solo career has produced several hit records, Michael was the lead singer, pace-setting dancer and all-round front man throughout the rest of the show, which did not include a single tune from the new ''Victory'' album. In fact, most of the songs were from ''Thriller'' and from the Jacksons' 1980 album ''Triumph'' - strutting, good-humored paeans to the joys of physicality. But while he plays the roles of sex symbol and entertainer with vocal performances that are finely crafted and painstakingly detailed and with the most fluid and original pop dancing since James Brown was in his heyday, Michael Jackson's songs also have their darker sides. The Sense of Dread Segments of the Jacksons' show deliberately played on the sense of dread that hovers just beneath the surface of such songs as ''Heartbreak Hotel,'' ''Billie Jean'' and ''Thriller.'' The first of these came early in Friday's show and seemed to spring to life like a switchblade knife flicking open, with lyrics to match: As we walked into the room, there were faces Staring, glaring, tearing through me Someone said welcome to your doom. Despite the audience's requests to hear what Michael Jackson referred to as ''the old stuff,'' hits from the early and mid-1970's, when the family group was known as the Jackson Five, the group compressed a few of these songs into a somewhat rushed medley. But at the end of ''I'll Be There,'' Michael Jackson stopped the show with an unaccompanied and mostly wordless vocal solo that cut to the heart of his intensity and chrisma. He moaned like a store-front preacher, showed off his vocal range and more of his deep roots in gospel music with some cascading, melismatic phrasing. Then he switched abruptly to a jazzy scat-singing style to lead into the next song, ''Lovely One,'' from the ''Triumph'' album. A Scorching Conclusion After a short breather and time for costume changes, the Jacksons returned for the show's scorching conclusion. There was more horror movie imagery, which introduced powerful, churning performances of ''Beat It'' and ''Billie Jean,'' from ''Thriller,'' and ''Shake Your Body,'' an earlier Michael Jackson hit that concluded the evening's 90-minute performance. By the end of the evening, Michael Jackson was beginning to sound hoarse and winded. But he sang and danced magnificently, with style, grace and unflagging energy. The other Jacksons sang rich, almost faultless backing harmonies, but while the new ''Victory'' is their album, Friday's show was primarily a triumph for their best-known sibling.

27-> SCHOOL CHIEF VOWS TO FIGHT SUSPENSION
NEWARK ATTORNEYS for Dr. Columbus Salley, the suspended Executive Superintendent of Schools here, have vowed to fight his suspension, even it means taking the case to the highest judicial levels. ''All we are after is the proper forum to hear the alleged charges,'' said Lawrence S. Schwartz of the Belleville law firm of Schwartz, Pisano and Simon. ''We will continue to fight all the way up to the United States Supreme Court.'' Mr. Schwartz made the announcement last week following a ruling by an administrative law judge that Dr. Saul Cooperman, the state's Commissioner of Education, did not have jurisdiction in the case. Dr. Salley's attorneys had argued that a clause in his four-year contract with the Newark Board of Education referred all contractual disputes to the Commissioner, as if Dr. Salley had tenure in his position. In his ruling, Robert P. Glickman, the administrative law judge, held that ''the Commissioner's jurisdiction is based on controversies or disputes arising under the school laws,'' and that he therefore did not have jurisdiction over a contractual dispute. The law, he wrote, is clear ''that an administrative body may not acquire jurisdiction by estoppel or consent.'' ''Petitioner's argument that the contract between Dr. Salley and the board vests the Commissioner with jurisdiction is without merit,'' Judge Glickman said in his six-page opinion. He said that the law specifically precluded Dr. Salley from acquiring tenure, and that he could not be considered a tenured position-holder, even if this had been the wording in his contract. ''It is absolutely clear, after careful reading of the petition filed by Dr. Salley, that his complaints against the board involve alleged violations of his contract with the board and alleged violations of the Open Public Meetings Act,'' Judge Glickman said in his decision. ''In order for the Commissioner to acquire subject-matter jurisdiction, the controversy or dispute by Dr. Salley must arise under the school laws. Certainly, a contractual dispute does not arise under school laws and is more properly a matter to be decided in the Superior Court.'' The judge said that, although the Commissioner had incidental jurisdiction in open public meetings questions relating to school laws, he did not have primary jurisdiction to hear those disputes. ''Putting aside the contractual and Open Meetings Act disputes, I conclude that there is nothing set forth in the petition which would constitute a controversy or dispute arising under the school laws,'' Judge Glickman said in his opinion. Mr. Schwartz said that he would file exceptions to Judge Glickman's ruling with Commissioner Cooperman. Dr. Salley was suspended, with pay, from his $72,000-a-year post as head of the 57,000-student Newark public school system on June 30 and again on July 10. He is charged with having: - Usurped the authority of the Board of Education by spending $179,000 for a summer computer camp without board approval. - Authorized the payment of $47,330 in legal fees incurred by a board member in challenging actions taken by the board. - Used school security personnel to protect his home. - Taken a partisan role in the 1983 Board of Education elections. Dr. Salley has denied the charges and has watched from the sidelines as personnel, programs and policies he had put in place were eliminated following his suspension. Three of the new board members elected this year, including its president, the Rev. Oliver Brown, ran on a platform calling for the ouster of both Dr. Salley and Prentice Thompson, director of security for the 84-building school system. Mr. Thompson was ousted last month on charges that he did not fit in with the new direction that the Board of Education and the new Acting Superintendent of Schools, Dr. Eugene Foti, were headed.

28-> SHOPPING IN FREEPORT, ME.:MORE THAN JUST L.L. BEAN
If towns had an official color, this one's would be green. There is the trademark Kelly green of L. L. Bean Inc., which has had its headquarters here for more than 70 years and has been remodeled to include an indoor pond stocked with trout. There are the newer, varied greens of the Bass shoe boxes, Dansk shopping bags and Ralph Lauren logos, all of which arrived in recent months. There is the muted blue-green paint on the unfinished minimall that may soon house discount outlets of Calvin Klein, Perry Ellis or Stetson. And there is the green of dollar bills - tens of millions of them each year - spent by the growing numbers of tourists who come to browse, to buy and to save. It isn't that shoppers have suddenly discovered Freeport: More than two million people a year have been traveling to L. L. Bean for as long as most residents remember. It is that other manufacturers have decided to open outlets in this out-of-the-way town, about an hour's drive northeast of Portland. The location is ideal for discount outlets that cannot do business near major retail centers. The stores that are opening here come not to compete with Bean, but to profit from it. 'Bean's the Key' ''Bean's the key, that's why we're here,'' said George Denney Jr., acting manager of the 6,000-square-foot Polo/Ralph Lauren factory outlet that opened on Main Street across from Bean last September. Like most stores in town, the outlet is open long hours - 9 A.M. to 9 P.M. seven days a week - because Bean is open 24 hours a day. ''There are millions of people visiting Bean,'' Mr. Denney said, ''and once they get there, they stumble into us.'' ''I didn't know any of the other stores were here, but I won't let them go to waste,'' said 16-year-old Laura Culligan, sitting on Main Street with a pistachio ice-cream cone in one hand and a newly purchased Ralph Lauren shirt in the other. She had come to Freeport from St. Paul because her father, Larry, had always wanted to visit L. L. Bean. ''I expected to find Bean in the middle of a forest,'' Mr. Culligan said. ''But it's like the whole town is a shopping mall.'' If so, it is a shopping mall with touches of New England. Though a McDonald's will soon arrive in town, it will be housed in a white clapboard house without golden arches. The streets are filled with cars from Canada and trailers from Texas, but they brake for pedestrians. Freeport is a town of bargains. Women's suede and leather Frye boots that list for $125 can be found for $49.95. Men's Bass Weejuns that regularly sell for $67 are $49.99. Ralph Lauren irregular cotton pullovers that would be $32 in perfect condition are $14. Dansk's Tivoli/Concerto plates, which list for $18, are sold here for $9. And although most of L. L. Bean's prices are the same as those in its catalogue, the building contains a factory store where floor samples, factory seconds and irregulars are as low as half price. Boutiques Have Sprung Up Not everything in town is on sale. Boutiques have sprung up among the outlets, including a shop called Christmas Magic that sells silk angels, silver bells and lacquered nutcrackers year round. There are full- price stores too, such as Cole-Haan, a shoe and fine leather goods shop, where women's pumps cost $200. There are shops like the Pantry, a self-serve gas station that sells fresh cinnamon buns and homemade ice cream inside. Things weren't always this way. In 1912, Leon L. Bean designed the rubber-bottomed, leather-topped Maine Hunting Shoe and gradually created a line of products for the outdoors. When hunters and fishermen began ringing the night bell at ''L. L.'s'' store to pick up gear as they headed north for the woods, Mr. Bean opened his store 24 hours a day. L. L. died in 1967 and since then his grandson, Leon A. Gorman, has expanded the catalogue. But while the store grew, the town remained the same: the white clapboard buildings of Main Street, the green and gold fields of the farms nearby. All that began to change two years ago, on the night a teen-ager set fire to Leighton's Five and Dime on Main Street to disguise a burglary. Edgar Leighton's landlord sold the building to a Boston developer who remodeled it, raised the rent and leased it to Dansk. Now Warnaco Knitwear sits on one end of Main Street, where the hardware store used to be, and Frye Boots sits on the other. Between them are outlets for White Stag, the Kids Stop, Post-Horn, Sawyer Sheepskin, Polo/ Ralph Lauren, Bass Shoes, Hathaway Shirts, Cannon Mills Sheets and Barbizon Lingerie, among others. ''People keep telling me what a favor the kid who lit that match did for Freeport,'' said Mr. Leighton, who has reopened his store near its earlier site and is now president of the Freeport Merchants Association. ''He didn't,'' he said. ''But what he did do is hasten what was already beginning to happen.'' Many residents, he added, mourn the quieter, quainter Freeport of a few years ago. ''There's no use looking backward,'' he said. ''What's here is here.'' What is here continues to change. The hot topic in town is who will move into the clock-tower-topped Freeport Village Square factory outlet center scheduled to open next month. Rumored tenants include Calvin Klein, Stetson and Perry Ellis. Though he would not confirm the stories, Dexter Kamilewicz of the Ram Management Company, developer of the project, said, ''Let's just say they are as interested as they can be.'' Even L. L. Bean has made changes in keeping with the new character of its hometown. Last month it put the final touches on 25,000 additional square feet, which cost $3.5 million and nearly doubled the size of the store. A Trout Pond The result is a cross between Bloomingdale's and a forest glen. The carpet is grass green with granite paths quarried in Deer Isle, Me. The walls and beams are pine, and the entire building smells somewhat like a lumberyard. There is an 8,500-gallon trout pond in the men's clothing department, with carved ducks flying overhead. A huge skylight crowns the women's clothing area. The store sells everything in the Bean catalogue and more, 45,000 items in all. Green fiberglass canoes are stacked near the front door. The book selection includes ''The Home Book of Taxidermy and Tanning'' ($10.95). The food aisles sell Natural Country Style Corn Bread and Muffin Mix for $1.65 and a pint container of maple syrup for $5. There's a Hatteras Hammock for $58 and men's chino dress pants for $32.50. There are tents, sheepskin car seats and foil-wrapped dehydrated dinners. And there is Bean's Maine Hunting Shoe. Men's range from $42.75 to $68.75, women's from $46.75 to $52.75, depending on the height. Although most of Bean's business is mail order - only 15 percent of annual sales, or $30 million, is from the store - two to two and a half million people visit Bean's in Freeport every year, most of them during the summer and before Christmas. Some, like Donald Lombardi and Patricia Amish, come for something specific. The two students from the University of Rochester Medical School were starting a bicycle trip along the Maine coast and came to stock up on supplies. 'Shopping Mecca' Others come just to have been there. ''We started out for Gettysburg, kept driving and ended up here,'' said Sally Kelly of Greensboro, N.C. Gradually, shoppers come not only to visit L. L. Bean, but its neighbors as well. Annette Born drove two and a half hours from Boston to see the ''shopping mecca'' she had heard about from friends. She started out at Ralph Lauren and was making her way down the street. ''I used to work in Maine, years ago,'' she said, ''and the only thing that was here was L. L. Bean.'' But now, she said, ''the town has gone discount, upscale discount, but discount,'' and the change suits her just fine. ''The more stores there are, the better,'' she said.

30-> SMELTER PUTTING ARSENIC IN THE AIR IS SET TO CLOSE
The Asarco Copper Smelter, the nation's biggest source of arsenic pollution, will close by June 1985 because of losses caused by low copper prices and the high cost of environmental protection, the company has announced. National attention was focused on the smelter last year when the Environmental Protection Agency asked residents of the Tacoma area if the economic benefits of continued operation of the smelter were worth a small number of arsenic-induced lung cancer cases each year. The public comments were solicited as the Federal agency prepared an arsenic emissions standard for the smelter. That standard is scheduled to be announced in August. While the copper smelting operation will cease sometime within the next year, the company announced, it said it would continue to operate an arsenic plant at the site. New Arsenic Process in Works Michael O. Varner, corporate director of Asarco's Department of Environmental Sciences, said Thursday the company was designing a new process to produce arsenic from metallic byproducts that would come from lead smelters in other parts of the country. Mr. Varner said there would be no arsenic discharges into the air or water with the new system. ''It looks like there will be a considerable reduction in the amount of emissions coming from the plant,'' said Mike Johnston, an air pollution engineering with the E.P.A. in Seattle. Lawrence Lindquist, smelter manager, said the company also hoped to find another concern to operate the sulfur dioxide plant on the property after the smelting operation closes. The closing of the operation will mean 500 of the smelter's 550 employees will lose their jobs by October 1985, Mr. Lindquist said. The remaining 50 employees will operate the arsenic plant, he said. Other laidoff employees may be offered jobs at Asarco plants in other parts of the country. Mr. Lindquist said that without the smelter the emissions of sulfur dioxide, which have been linked to acid rain in the Cascade Mountains, would be minimal. Concern Faced July Deadline Asarco faced a deadline of July 12 set by the Puget Sound Air Pollution Control Agency to commit itself to installing a new $150 million flash furnace to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions. Armand L. Labbe, Asarco vice president, said the smelter was a victim of depressed copper prices, a shortage of copper concentrates that could be processed profitably in Tacoma and ''Federal, state and local environmental regulations that require Asarco to spend in excess of $3 million in 1984-85, and to install new copper smelting facilities in 1985-87 at a cost of more than $150 million.'' ''Investments of that magnitude cannot be justified under present market conditions at the Tacoma plant, which has been operating at a loss for the past five years,'' Mr. Labbe said. The announcement surprised regulatory agencies. James Tucker, a spokesman for the Puget Sound Air Pollution Control Agency, said the company's announcement left his agency with a ''lot of unanswered questions'' that would not be resolved until a meeting with Asarco officials next month. Mr. Johnston, the E.P.A. official, said his agency would have an ''internal chat'' about Asarco's announcement. Major Impact on Economy The closing of the smelting operation will have a major impact on the Tacoma and state economy. Asarco said the smelter annually spends some $30 million for supplies, fuel and services. Asarco last year paid some $2.2 million in local and state taxes. The Federal agency had projected that two Tacoma area residents each year would contract lung cancer from the smelter's arsenic emissions if additional air pollution controls were not installed. The agency is reviewing its computer-based health risk projections after strong criticism from Asarco. A $1.4 million study is being conducted to determine why some children living near the smelter have unusually high levels of arsenic in their hair and urine. The company has long contended that its emissions pose no harm to area residents. The Tacoma smelter is the only producer of arsenic in the United States. The arsenic is used in pesticides, wood preservatives, glass and electronics.

31-> HELPLESS, ANGRY, INSOMNIAC SOULS
ACQUAINTED WITH THE NIGHT And Other Stories. By Lynne Sharon Schwartz. 226 pp. New York: Harper & Row. $13.95. LYNNE SHARON SCHWARTZ has never been kind to psychiatrists and their ilk. In her three novels - ''Rough Strife,'' ''Balancing Acts'' and ''Disturbances in the Field'' - she showed obvious, and contagious, glee in scoffing at the psychobabble that reduces struggling souls to mere neurotic cases. In her first collection of stories, however, Mrs. Schwartz seems to have decided to take the troublesome doctors more seriously, with disappointing results. She devotes the first and longest story in ''Acquainted With the Night'' to exposing their pernicious patter - a task that took her a few well-launched, one- line dismissals in the novels. She then spends many of the remaining 15 stories examining characters who, although they don't actually visit therapists, nonetheless sound a lot like stifled products of therapeutic culture - quite different from the vigorous characters of her novels, especially the best of them, ''Rough Strife.'' Caroline and Ivan, whose turbulent but lasting marriage Mrs. Schwartz anatomized in that novel, were strong-willed, philosophic types. They aimed to understand loss in a world where, in the words of Heraclitus, one of Mrs. Schwartz's favorite philosophers, ''everything flows and nothing abides; everything gives way and nothing stays fixed.'' Loss is the theme of her stories too, but the flatter characters in them have less energy to face the flux; they're more inclined to denounce or deny their losses. Irony and poignancy are the sharp tools of Mrs. Schwartz's novelistic trade at its best. A blunter tone of helplessness and anger dominates the stories, blurring passions and perceptions. The opening story, ''The Age of Analysis,'' centers on Paul, the adolescent son of a psychoanalyst father and a psychotherapist mother and the patient of a succession of their colleagues; the outside help has been hired to cure the uncontrollable rages with which he periodically disrupts his parents' methodical, unemotional lives. At first the story promises to be the parody one might expect from Mrs. Schwartz; she shows her usual acute ear for the clunky labels the doctors apply to every feeling, and she gives Paul some purgative outbursts. ''Deal with! Deal with!'' he yells at the analyst who's doing her best to calm his hysteria at the news of his parents' separation, the crisis on which the story turns. ''Is all of life one long process of dealing with things? Is that all there is to it? Hell!'' Yet Mrs. Schwartz also seems to be aiming for a more ominous drama; she writes Paul several disturbingly violent scenes, and she stages a minor breakdown for his brittle Anne Hulbert is a senior editor of The New Republic. mother. Those twists don't add up to character or plot development; they simply make the story drag on too long, diluting both the satiric overtones and the dark undertones and turning it into dull melodrama. None of the characters in the stories that follow are possessed by Paul's fury. But Mrs. Schwartz continues to be fascinated by lessser degrees of the same seething violence beneath apparently subdued surfaces. In several stories, she departs from her usual realism to introduce fantasies that end with explosions of primitive passion. Those outbursts don't seem to fuel vision and vigor the way the fierce eruptions between Caroline and Ivan of ''Rough Strife'' did. Instead, the violent images that crowd Vera's head at the close of ''Plaisir d'amour,'' for example, prompt only a brief and frightening release, not enlightenment; her journey from repression to harsh catharsis is one that doctors could easily diagram, but it proves harder for a writer to bring it to life. Mrs. Schwartz deftly ushers us into her character's fantasy world; a recently widowed and quiet woman, Vera invents a chastely amorous couple whose placid activities absorb all of her attention, distracting her from loneliness and also from the attentions of another man. The story ends, however, with a jarring turn. Vera's pure pair suddenly become mercilessly lustful in a scene that seems a contrivance rather than the culminating revelation of deeply buried fears and desires. If none of Mrs. Schwartz's other characters are as frenzied as Paul, few are as vapid as his parents and analysts either. Yet many of them seem to settle for empty denials or facile declarations of their dilemmas. It's hard to tell whether Mrs. Schwartz means some of her protagonists to be as self-conscious and superficial as they often sound, or their carefully controlled stories to be as anticlimactic as they sometimes feel. In both ''Life Is an Adventure, With Risks'' and ''The Death of Harriet Gross,'' the narrators meditate on their losses - a daughter who almost drowned in the one story and a childhood friend who died in the other - only to close with stagy pronouncements. ''It is too horrifying to confront those words on the page: I almost lost her,'' proclaims the mother whose child was saved. ''I deny the death of Harriet Gross,'' announces the bereft friend, ''and will deny it as long as I live.'' Similarly, in ''Grand Staircases,'' a better story full of the introspective accuracy Mrs. Schwartz has showed in her novels, there is a disappointingly false final note. Wryly reflecting on her friendship-love affair with a man who is trying to be faithful to an architect off studying grand staircases in Europe, the narrator looks into the man's eyes and, realizing both how much and how little she knows of him, she sees ''in the recesses of the irises, grand staircases to remote, inaccessible chambers.'' But then she tries to talk about her sudden discovery - and the metaphor and the mystery collapse in therapeutic cliche: ''I told him what I had been thinking, about the nakedness and the closeness.'' It's in the final, title story, ''Acquainted With the Night,'' that Mrs. Schwartz at last sustains the wry tone and the sort of spiritual struggle at which she excels. Alexander Smith awakens in the middle of the night, tortured by a dancing mote in his eye and plagued by anxious thoughts. Mrs. Schwartz leads us on a sympathetically comic, impeccably paced tour of his insomniac soul. A successful architect and well-meaning husband, Alexander desperately conjures up his losses and fears, his sins of commission and omission - a bribe taken, a college girlfriend abandoned, his wife betrayed, and finally perhaps his own heart betrayed. He finds them all distressing, yet none damning enough to account for his spiritual unease. ''It was something more, something beyond everything he had thought of, cosmic, even. But what? What?'' he wearily wonders as light seeps into the room and he finally falls asleep. He doesn't try to deny the unnerving mystery or escape it in fantasy. He sleeps on it, resting up for another day in an unreliable world where the necessity of doubt and the desirability of endurance rank among the few sure, hardly solacing, things.B

32-> MAJOR NEWS: IN SUMMARY; INVESTIGATORS FIND NO CASE AGAINST MEESE
After a five-month inquiry, an independent counsel last week reported that he had found no evidence that Edwin Meese 3d, whose nomination to be Attorney General is stalled in the Senate, had broken any Federal laws. The investigation, overseen by Jacob A. Stein, a Washington defense attorney, was prompted by the revelation - after confirmation hearings had concluded - that Mr. Meese had failed to report a $15,000 interest-free loan to his wife from a friend on the financial disclosure reports he was obliged to file. Mr. Stein was also directed to investigate other questions that were raised during the confirmation hearings about Mr. Meese's financial affairs and whether he had helped arrange Administration jobs for several people who had loaned him money. In their examination of 11 specific allegations of possible misconduct, Mr. Stein and his investigators questioned 200 witnesses and called 45 of them to testify before a Federal grand jury. In his 385-page report, Mr. Stein said there was ''no basis with respect to any of the 11 allegations for the bringing of a prosecution against Mr. Meese for the violation of a Federal criminal statute.'' He noted that, because he had to limit his inquiry ''to the sole question of whether the evidence warrants prosecution under Federal criminal statutes,'' he could not accommodate the requests of Mr. Meese's attorneys and some Democratic critics to say whether Mr. Meese was ethically fit to succeed Attorney General William French Smith. Mr. Meese, who is President Reagan's counselor, asserted in a statement read to reporters that the Stein report ''cleared the air.'' Further, he said, it ''affirmed what my family and I have always known: that we have lived honorable lives, that we have paid our debts with our own money, and that we have never taken advantage of official position to obtain private gain.'' It seemed likely nonetheless that - assuming Mr. Reagan is re- elected and resubmits the nomination - Mr. Meese won't breeze through the Senate Judiciary Committee. Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio and Mr. Meese's most vocal critic on the panel, said there were inconsistencies between the Stein report and testimony heard by the committee. The Senator, as he has for months, called for Mr. Meese to ask the President ''to withdraw his name from consideration for attorney general.'' But Mr. Reagan stood his ground, calling Mr. Meese ''one of the most decent and honorable men I have ever known'' and predicting that he would be ''a truly distinguished attorney general.''

33-> PRECINCT TRIES FIXED SHIFTS TO CUT STRESS
When Police Officer James Gonzalez volunteered for the 115th Precinct in Queens, he was feeling the strain. After three years on the force, he had learned to live with the danger and disasters he met on the job. What wore him down, he said, were his rotating shifts. Rescheduling work hours is standard procedure in the New York Police Department. There are three shifts, or tours, round-the-clock: midnight to 8 A.M.; 8 A.M. to 4 P.M., and 4 P.M. to midnight. All police officers work five days a week, but it is rarely the conventional Monday through Friday work week. And every week, the tour for each officer's squad is changed. Regular Hours ''Going round-the-clock takes its toll on your body,'' said Officer Gonzalez, who is 30 years old. ''You never get a chance to adjust. And your mind - you can't clear it. Physically you're run down completely, and mentally, it's depressing just to think about the tours.'' Now, however, Officer Gonzalez is working regular shifts. So are the 158 other officers who volunteered to work in the 115th Precinct, which has its station house on Northern Boulevard at 92d Street in Jackson Heights. They are part of an experiment to reduce some of the stresses that psychologists say, in the worst cases, have contributed to high rates of alcoholism, suicide and divorce among police officers across the country. For one year, the precinct's officers, under special union contracts, will work fixed eight-hour tours with steady partners. Officer Gonzalez, for example, will work the 4 P.M. to midnight shift in a 16-man squad. Like the other officers in the precinct, he was asked which tour he wanted. Some officers were given their second preference, but no one was forced to take a tour he did not want, precinct spokesmen said. Twenty-nine officers work the midnight tour until 8 A.M.; 33 work the day tour from 8 A.M. to 4 P.M., and 48 work the evening tour. ''This beats rotating shifts,'' Officer Gonzalez said, echoing other officers. ''Now I can get my life into some kind of normal pattern.'' Lieutenants on the Streets The new station house, which opened in January, cost $3.9 million to build over two years. The precinct covers about 12 square miles in a high-crime area in Corona, Elmhurst and Jackson Heights. As part of the experiment, the officers work under a ''platoon command'' system that frees supervising lieutenants from much desk-bound administration and gives them a more active leadership role. In other precincts, lieutenants are rarely seen on the street with other officers. To limit the number of applicants, the precinct asked for volunteers primarily among new graduates of the Police Academy in Queens. A minority of those who volunteered had requested transfers from other precincts in Queens and other boroughs. Most of the officers are in their 20's, and about 80 percent have been on the force less than four years. Before the experiment began, each officer was asked to answer questionnaires prepared by the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit agency in New York that is monitoring the experiment. Stress Levels Monitored The testing, which is being repeated now and will be repeated again after one year, will be used to determine whether there has been any change in stress levels. The same tests are to be administered to a group of officers selected at random from other precincts. ''The preliminary results are extraordinary,'' said Michael J. Farrell, associate director of the Vera Institute. ''Sick-day reports, emergency days, vehicle accidents among members - all the organizational indicators of morale and attitude - are exceptionally low. It looks good so far.'' The precinct experiment resulted largely from a study on police stress carried out in 1981 by Rohrer, Hibler and Replogle Inc., the New York-based pyschological consultants. The study, paid for with Federal money and conducted with the cooperation of the New York Police Department under former Commissioner Robert J. McGuire, concluded that ''stress and its effects pervade the department.'' Among the study's top recommendations was an approach to stress that emphasized prevention. ''One of the things the police force can experiment with is better ways of scheduling police work so that it interferes less with the family and the time rhythms of the worker,'' said Dr. Paul D'Arcy, a director of the research. Goal Was Equal Staffing The practice of rotating shifts was originally devised to insure that all tours were staffed with equal complements of officers, according to Philip Caruso, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association. But departmental policies on tours of duty have gradually changed. Viewed as a way to inhibit police corruption at one time, later they were seen as a bar to positive community relations. ''Now we are going back to an even older theory that the familiarity is important to the community,'' Mr. Caruso said. In more concrete terms, steady tours mean that an officer like James Gonzalez can attend college part-time to earn a master's degree, and Lieut. Charles DiRienzo can spend more time at home with his children. But many police officers gave professional reasons for preferring the new system. ''When you work with the same people and the same partner all the time, you know the people and even the vehicles that belong and don't belong,'' said Officer Gonzalez.

34-> IN SHORT
FICTION * BLACK WATER: The Book of Fantastic Literature. Edited by Alberto Manguel. (Clarkson N. Potter; paper, $11.95.) In the foreword to this nearly 1,000-page anthology, the editor Alberto Manguel defines ''fantastic literature'' as ''the impossible seeping into the possible, what Wallace Stevens calls 'black water breaking into reality.' '' This broad definition allows Mr. Manguel to include everything from the ecstatic animism of Cynthia Ozick's ''The Pagan Rabbi'' to the visceral horror of Poe's ''The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar.'' Especially welcome is the generous selection of fiction from Latin America, the current capital of the fantastic. The lead story is the late Julio Cortazar's ''House Taken Over,'' a brilliantly deadpan haunted house tale; also outstanding are Horacio Quiroga's ''The Feather Pillow,'' a bloodcurdling monster story, and Virgilio Pinera's ''Insomnia,'' a tour de force about the relationship between sleep and death. A number of the more ghostly pieces are from neglected British masters: It is good to have L. P. Hartley's ''A Visitor From Down Under'' back in print, a story featuring a frozen ghost who delivers chills that are quite literal; an equally superb choice is Walter de la Mare's hauntingly ambiguous ''Seaton's Aunt,'' which does for the traditional vampire tale what ''The Turn of the Screw'' did for the traditional ghost story. Instead of simply prefacing these stories with a single breezy introduction - the usual procedure for putting together a supernatural anthology - Mr. Manguel has introduced each of these 72 imaginative selections with informative, pungent commentary. This is an uncommonly satisfying collection. -- Jack Sullivan * THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE. By Susan Howatch. (Simon & Schuster, $19.95) Once again, Susan Howatch is rattling the bones in the closets of Britain, this time at Oxmoon, the Welsh estate of the Godwins, an Anglo-Welsh family whose lineage reaches to the days of William the Conquerer. In 1913, when this generational saga begins, Robert Godwin has only just started to restore a family fortune much diminished by his profligate father. Robert's widowed mother is left to guide the moral development of her five children. Wielding Victorian precepts like a sword, she ''draws the line'' against any passion that may threaten to invade their lives. The children oblige by becoming as priggish as possible, a misfortune for child and reader alike, since Miss Howatch has chosen to subdue her own narrative voice and relate this tale in the voices of the children and grandchildren. Robert, the eldest son, is the first to explain his parents' need for conformity and respectability: Their recent past was riven with ''Sodomy, adultery and murder; robbery, madness and lust,'' a heritage their children will not easily escape. In time, they too, will encounter murder and madness as they vie for ownership of Oxmoon. If their struggles seem lacking in drama, it is because too many of the book's major events are reported after the fact; thus the story is robbed of color and immediacy. This is partially compensated for by the thorough re-creation of a distant place and time. Finally, we may not care whether the Godwin grandson can redeem himself or his family in the late 1960's (he does). But we are not likely to forget details such as the moment when Robert's valet presents him with his morning copy of The Times, neatly ironed. -- Barbara Helfgott * ANTICIPATION. By Frederick Ted Castle. (McPherson, cloth, $22.50. Paper, $12.50) An experiment is as rich as its effect. The wondrous quality of joyous digging in language and intellectual play that permeates Frederick Ted Castle's first novel is half the story. Or, rather, it is the only story in ''Anticipation,'' a novel in which everything that happened to Mr. Castle in the year 1963 is put down in brilliant, funny and parodistic turns. Mr. Castle's novel has a tradition - it stems from the discursiveness of Laurence Sterne (it apes ''Tristam Shandy'' in substituting photographs for blank pages) and James Joyce (it pays allegiance to ''Ulysses'' in its parodies of early literature and contemporary antinovels and high - or low - romance). For extra measure, there are diagrams, letters and notes in poor handwriting, as well as long passages of undistinguished elementary French. But, unlike Sterne and Joyce, and even the French antinovels of the 1960's, ''Anticipation'' lacks a real narrative. For some readers the unity of a writer's brilliant wandering thoughts on the human condition - and especially his own - may prove enough compensation; Mr. Castle is extravagant in spending his talents of wit and invidious humor in this provocatively experimental novel in which everything happens in the mind. Still, others will insist that Mr. Castle's previous neglect is justified. (He wrote this novel in the mid-1960's.) ''Anticipation'' will become an addiction for a few and a throwaway for others, yet it will last. It is a presence one wants to have around, but its waywardness excludes it from mainstream literature. It has everything but a center; it is a magnificent sideshow. -- Martin Tucker * THE ALAMO TREE. By Ernest Brawley. (Simon & Schuster, $17.95.) To the North American mind, Mexico has always seemed a blend of the exotic and the squalid. ''Such barbarous names, such barbarous places,'' broods a character in Ernest Brawley's third novel. ''The Alamo Tree'' serves up this blend in the form of a family chronicle. Named after a relative of the American elm, the alamo is a sacred tree that crops up in the story as a sort of all-purpose symbol for the family. The book tracks the rise and fall of three intertwined families' fortunes. The O'Hares, transplanted Irish-Americans, are behind a resort hotel boom in Acapulco and Puerto Vallarta. The Carrizos, native-born mestizos, rise from the peasantry to become corrupt public officials who fatten upon ''la mordida,'' the little bite. The Martinezes, swamp-dwelling Indians, are shrimp fishermen until they become involved in the cultivation and export of marijuana. Thus Mr. Brawley, ''a Californian from an Anglo-Mexican family,'' has peopled his novel with representative types, examples of Mexico's three classes - the rich, the poor and the foreign born. ''The Alamo Tree'' could almost double as a social history of Mexico between the administrations of Plutarco Elias Calles (1924-1928) and Jose Lopez Portillo (1978-1982). But Mr. Brawley is not really a social historian; he discerns no pattern or principle within the Mexican experience. He has chosen to write about this period in Mexico and these characters for the same reason he has chosen to write a family chronicle. Both the subject and the form are loose enough to allow a number of alternating stories - sexy, adventurous, magical - without demanding the logic of plot or message.-- D. G. Myers * SILVER WINGS, SANTIAGO BLUE. BY Janet Dailey. (Poseidon/Simon & Schuster, $15.95.) In only 10 years of writing and with more than 100 million copies of her books in print worldwide, Janet Dailey is easily one of America's best-selling authors. ''Silver Wings, Santiago Blue,'' like its predecessors, combines romance and adventure - there is risk to life, limb and, especially, heart - but is rooted in historical fact. For a brief period during World War II the United States Air Force used female volunteer pilots, who became known as WASPS (Women Airforce Service Corps) and eventually wore uniforms of ''Santiago blue.'' Begun in late 1942, when the Allied air situation seemed dire, the program was terminated two years later, after the House of Representatives refused the WASPS a military commission. In the interim, the women were trained to ferry airplanes from point to point, tow targets for gunnery and artillery practice, and perform other needed and dangerous noncombat duties. This tale focuses on five young heroines, women sharing a section of barracks, as well as a love for airplanes and the need to prove their competence to men convinced ''it ain't natural'' for women to fly. They are Cappy Hayward, an Army brat; the sexually liberated Marty Rogers; Mary Lynn Palmer, a Southern innocent; Eden van Valkenburg, from New York's upper crust; and the Jewish Rachel Goldman. The best scenes involve flying, its techniques and procedures, and the feelings it inspires (the author is herself an amateur pilot). On the ground, the main characters fall in love or lust, but there is little emotional development, for they are essentially one-dimensional. The prose is purple, not always grammatical: ''Swallowing the hot rush of temper''; ''Eden prowled the room like a cage-crazy tigress''; ''All six of them invaded the shop, splitting to go down the aisles.'' The idea of a novel about women pilots is interesting, but the book disappoints. -- Miriam Berkley NONFICTION * THE SPOT: The Rise of Political Advertising on Television. By Edwin Diamond and Stephen Bates. (MIT, $17.50.) ''The Spot'' is a careful history of political commercials, showing that despite all the claims of innovation and brilliance with which producers surround their spots, what will be aired this fall is evolutionary, not revolutionary. As the Reagan campaign spatters the airwaves with television commercials that look like those from an investment house and proclaim that everything in America is wonderful, another campaign comes to mind. In 1956, President Eisenhower's campaign for the first time went beyond just straight speeches into the television camera and showed such proofs of success as housewives in the kitchen with new appliances. And as the Democrats try to make corruption and unfairness charges stick to the Reagan Administration, the negative political commercials invented in 1956 will have their descendants on the air too. Edwin Diamond, who heads the News Study Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Stephen Bates, a media researcher at the Institute of Politics at Harvard, examine famous political broadcasts - from Richard Nixon's Checkers speech in 1960 to Lyndon Johnson's ''daisy'' commercial in 1964 - and with the less remembered elements of campaigns before and since. They carefully trace, and usefully illustrate, the history of the ''polispot,'' as they call the political spot advertisement. But the major disappointment of this book is that it enumerates but does not analyze. The last chapter is spent raising, though rarely answering, questions about the effect of television commercials on politics in America. What the authors have done is excellent spadework for other analysts who will offer bolder conclusions than their own: ''In the end, we are willing to leave the polispots and the media campaigns to the knowing judgment of the audience." -- Adam Clymer * JACK TARS AND COMMODORES: The American Navy, 1783-1815. By William M. Fowler Jr. (Houghton Mifflin, $19.95.) After winning independence, the new American Republic simply dispensed with its Navy because of its cost and because of fears of dangerous foreign entanglements. This proved to be a short-sighted decision, as William M. Fowler Jr., a professor of history at Northeastern University, shows in ''Jack Tars and Commodores,'' a well-researched early history of the American Navy and of the political maneuvering that led to its re-creation. After the Revolution, American shipping was regularly preyed upon with impunity by the British, the French and the states of the Barbary Coast. The outraged American Government could do nothing to aid its citizens whose ships and crews were being seized. In 1793, Congress reluctantly voted to build six frigates. In 1794, France and the United States drifted into the so-called Quasi War (a series of hostilities that lasted until 1800). The American fleet, finally launched in 1797, successfully protected American trade in the West Indies and won several battles with French warships. After the Quasi War, the Barbary states, especially Tripoli, began seizing American ships in the Mediterranean. In 1801, President Jefferson dispatched the fleet, and despite some incompetent commanders and the loss of the frigate Philadelphia, the Navy eventually stopped the depredations of the Barbary states. During the Napoleonic Wars, Britain constantly violated American neutrality by impressing American seamen into the Royal Navy. So, in 1812, an angry Congress declared war. To the surprise of the Royal Navy, the American fleet quickly won a series of victories, and when the Americans won control of the Great Lakes, a British invasion from Canada was prevented. The achievements of the American Navy in its first three decades splendidly vindicated those who had argued for its re-creation. -- Ronald Bailey * GOD AND THE POETS: The Gifford Lectures, 1983. By David Daiches. (Oxford University, $29.95.) David Daiches, the renowned critic and literary historian, was invited to present these lectures at Edinburgh University in 1983. In them, he examines how various poets, from biblical times to the present, have struggled with, celebrated and communicated their belief (and nonbelief) in God in their poetry. The scope of ''God and the Poets'' is remarkably extensive, and Mr. Daiches manages to include original and perceptive interpretations of the Book of Job and medieval Hebrew poetry, as well as of the poetry of Milton, Robert Burns, Emily Dickinson, Wallace Stevens and Edwin Muir, among many others. In the final chapter, ''Poetry and Belief,'' he explores the many reasons why readers of poetry can be so profoundly moved by the religious (or atheistic) works of poets whose beliefs they may not share, or may even vigorously oppose. These lectures offer much pleasure to the reader by providing specific (and often surprising) insights into the works of individual poets, as well as a historical overview of God's significant place in poetry through the ages. In addition, they possess the authentic sound of Mr. Daiches's voice; although not exactly informal, they are graceful, fluid and extremely accessible. - Janice Eidus * SALADIN IN HIS TIME. By P. H. Newby (Faber & Faber, $23.95.) For half a century after the First Crusade (1095-1099) had established Frankish states in Palestine, the Islamic world was too divided to mount a war against the Christians. A Kurd named Saladin finally drew the Moslems of the Fertile Crescent together to reclaim much of their land. Dante, Sir Walter Scott and other Westerners glorified this Moslem leader's fairness, even generosity, in battle, fascinated by what they saw as Christian virtues in a heathen. Later writers debunked this myth of a selfless hero, declaring Saladin's motivation to be personal ambition. Now, in ''Saladin in His Time,'' the historian P. H. Newby, argues that Saladin ''served his own interests, while serving the interests of Islam as a whole.'' Mr. Newby states that Saladin's shrewd politicking was necessary to unify Islam and that only a unified Islam could successfully oppose the Christians. Thus Saladin's first campaigns were against fellow Moslems. This internecine fighting and Saladin's aversion to plundering and killing when not militarily warranted contravened the warrior code of the era, disgruntling his brethren and surprising his foes. Saladin's generosity, Mr. Newby suggests, partly accounts for his minor stature among the heroes of Islam, and for this reason, his exploits did not earn a place in ''The Arabian Nights.'' But it is a delight that Mr. Newby has resurrected the tale of a man who won the admiration of his enemies. - Linda Robinson * THE BREZHNEV POLITBURO AND THE DECLINE OF DETENTE. By Harry Gelman. (Cornell University, Cloth, $29.95. Paper, $9.95.) Can the superpowers ever achieve real detente? Or was the brief period of seeming cooperation they enjoyed in the early 1970's merely an illusory interlude, unlikely ever to be repeated? These are the questions that Harry Gelman, a senior staff member in the political science department of the Rand Corporation, poses in ''The Brezhnev Politburo and the Decline of Detente.'' His answers, based on a detailed examination of how the Politburo made foreign policy in the 70's, amount to a grimly pessimistic vision of continued and unstinting rivalry. On the apparent equilibrium of the early 1970's, he quotes a prominent Soviet bureaucrat quoting Marx: ''In politics you may conclude alliances with the Devil himself if you are certain that you can cheat the Devil.'' To explain the decline of detente, Mr. Gelman shows how the bitter jockeying for power that goes on inside the Kremlin has helped push the leadership toward a more hard-line and adventurous foreign policy. He also paints a dark psychological portrait of the top Soviet leaders' deeply defensive attitudes, their ''compulsion to attack'' the United States and their driving need to shore up their own legitimacy by both ideological and military conquest. As for the future, he sees scant hope that the Kremlin will abandon its efforts to win what he suggests it sees as an everlasting ''zero- sum'' game. How does Mr. Gelman know what he knows? It is often hard to tell. He is careful, even painstaking in his analysis, but he does sometimes seem to strain to make his points, arguing from spotty evidence and relying heavily on his own assertion that the men in the Politburo will not be happy until they have ''supplanted'' the United States. His last, predictive chapter seems particularly vulnerable, an airless projection of the present onto the future that leaves virtually no room for chance or change or effective American policy. In this, Mr. Gelman sometimes seems the captive of his own bleak vision. He has, nevertheless, in his sober, scholarly way, drawn a vivid and deeply troubling picture of the way the Soviets think. - Tamar Jacoby * THE WRITER'S ART. By James J. Kilpatrick. (Andrews, McMeel & Parker, $14.95.) ''The Writer's Art'' offers an honest, forthright and at times charming look into American usage. It is a kind of rugged American's version of H. W. Fowler's classic ''Dictionary of Modern English Usage.'' But the book is fun to read precisely because of its absence of literary pretensions (its title notwithstanding). James J. Kilpatrick, a syndicated political columnist, says that his purpose is ''to venture a few suggestions, based on a lifetime as a writer, on how good writers can get to be better writers,'' and most of his tips are clearheaded and sound. One wonders, however, whether ''Keep it simple,'' ''Have something to say'' and ''Take your time'' really tell anyone anything new about writing well. But when Mr. Kilpatrick ventures into the subject of cadence and the importance of the way words sound, my interest perks up. As he writes, ''We ought never to be embarrassed, in the privacy of our chambers, to 'sound out' a sentence.'' Hear, hear! He tells aspiring and accomplished writers alike to ''Write verse. It is the finest discipline ever devised for writers who would hone their skills with language.'' But he disappoints when he adds, ''Mind you, I'm not talking about free verse. It was Robert Frost who once defined free verse as playing tennis with the net down.'' Mr. Kilpatrick is more kindhearted when he shares the discoveries he has made in a wide range of sources. We learn, for example, that ''exosculate'' means ''to kiss heartily.'' And a sentence from the offices of I.B.M. - ''Meetings on equipment acceptance provide a severe test of our synchronized organizational parallel reciprocal monitored time-phased capability'' - makes the advice to keep it simple shine anew. - Andy Brumer Dishonored Prophets ''First we would like to acknowledge the experts through the ages, without whose definitive pronouncements our modest study would not have been possible,'' begin Christopher Cerf and Victor Navasky in THE EXPERTS SPEAK: The Definitive Compendium of Authoritative Misinformation (Pantheon, Cloth, $19.95. Paper, $9.95) , their collection of all sorts of ''disinformation, misunderstanding, miscalculation, egregious prognostication, boo- boos, and occasionally just plain lies.'' What follows is a selection of purely literary foolishness from this entertaining volume: * ''I'm sorry, Mr. Kipling, but you just don't know how to use the English language.'' - The editor of The San Francisco Examiner, informing Rudyard Kipling that he needn't bother submitting any more articles to the newspaper, 1889. * ''My dear fellow, I may perhaps be dead from the neck up, but rack my brains as I may I can't see why a chap should need thirty pages to describe how he turns over in bed.'' - Marc Humblot, a French editor, in a letter of rejection to Marcel Proust, 1912. * ''You're the only damn fool in New York who would publish it.'' - Alfred Harcourt (president of Harcourt, Brace), commenting on Harrison Smith's decision to publish William Faulkner's ''The Sound and the Fury,'' 1929. * ''(T)his is a long, solemn, tedious Pacific voyage best suited, I would think, to some kind of drastic abridgement in a journal like the National Geographic.'' - William Styron, while a McGraw- Hill editor, rejecting Thor Heyerdahl's ''Kon- Tiki,'' 1947. * ''(Your book) had no reader interest.'' - A letter to Frederick Forsyth from the British publisher W. H. Allen, rejecting ''The Day of the Jackal,'' 1970. * '' 'Scruples' is a ridiculous title. Nobody will know what it means. We've got to get Crown to change it.'' - Howard Kaminsky (president of Warner Books) after Warner had purchased the reprint rights to Judith Krantz's novel, 1981. * ''(W)e can confidently say of American fiction that, while it may not be national, and may not be great, it will have at least the negative virtue of being clean.'' - Bliss Perry, editor of The Atlantic Monthly, 1902. -- Charles Simmons

35-> MUSIC: THE CLEVELANDERS
While the Cleveland Orchestra may no longer be the nonpareil ensemble it was in the 1960's, it remains an admirable organization, with a lush string section and an aggregate of first-chair players that can rank with the finest in the world. The orchestra's concert at Carnegie Hall Wednesday evening, the first of three New York performances under the direction of Erich Leinsdorf, was short and sweet: Bach's Cantata No. 202 ''Weichut nur, betr"ubte Schatten,'' which is one of the ''Wedding'' cantatas, and Mahler's Symphony No. 4 in G. Much of the evening's delight came from the soprano Kathleen Battle, who worked her customary miracles. Her voice - rich, pure, beautifully trained - has an ecstatic sweetness that calls to mind Elisabeth Schumann. The Bach cantata was exemplary, if somewhat romanticized; Mr. Leinsdorf, leading from the harpsichord, provided crisp, elegant continuo, conjuring misty sonorities from the massed strings, while John Mack piped a seamless oboe obligato. In addition to the angst, chinoiserie, sardonic l"andler and skysearching adagios that make up Mahler's compositional bag of tricks, the Fourth Symphony has an inner serenity that sets it quite apart from anything else the composer wrote. Mr. Leinsdorf opted for a straightforward, unsentimental approach to this masterpiece, playing down not only the music's phantasms, but also, unfortunately, much of its charm. For the most part, the orchestra played skillfully, although Daniel Majeske, the concertmaster, attacked the pizzicato passages in the second movement with unwonted fervor. Miss Battle sang the finale, a child's enchanted description of heavenly reward, with radiant awe.

37-> M.T.A. VOTES TO EXTEND 63RD ST. LINE
After years of building the 63d Street subway line without knowing where to end it, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority decided yesterday to connect it to local tracks in Queens. Under the plan, the 63d Street line between midtown Manhattan and Queens - New York City's first new subway tunnel in more than 50 years - would be hooked up with the tracks that now carry GG trains. Except for building nothing further, the choice was the cheapest and quickest of the options the M.T.A. board has been considering for more than six years. The 14-member board unanimously approved the plan. Without the connection, the 63d Street subway, which is not scheduled to open until late next year, would stop just across the East River in Long Island City, and fewer than 220 passengers an hour would use it, according to M.T.A. estimates. With the extension, 16,500 passengers are likely to use the tunnel during rush hours, and crowding on the E and F lines will be reduced, officials said. Cost of $222 Million Under the plan approved yesterday, the M.T.A. will build a 520-foot rail connection from the end of the 63d Street tunnel, at 29th Street in Queens, to the existing GG tracks under Northern Boulevard. ''I suppose in a world where dollars did not make any difference, the original plan would have been the best,'' said M.T.A. Chairman Robert R. Kiley, ''but since that's not the case, the local option offers the most benefit.'' In the late 1960's, when the 63d Street subway line was conceived, it was supposed to stretch to the far reaches of Queens. Such a project would now cost the M.T.A. more than $1 billion to complete. The M.T.A. decided to reconsider the plan in 1978. The alternative that was approved will cost about $222 million, Mr. Kiley said, and the M.T.A. must now find the money to pay for it. He said that the board, which controls an $8.5 billion budget for long-term improvements to the city's aging transit system, had not considered using any of that money for the project. ''Our primary goal must be to improve the existing system,'' he said. Fares to Be Retained Mr. Kiley said that the M.T.A. would apply for Federal aid to build the subway extension, but that money for such projects had been cut in the Reagan Administration's proposed budget. ''I don't think construction is going to start soon,'' Mr. Kiley said. It will take about eight years to build the rail connection, M.T.A. officials said. At its monthly meeting, the M.T.A. board also gave final approval to 1985 budgets that will keep the current fares on the city's buses and subways as well as on the Long Island Rail Road and the Metro-North Commuter Railroad. The local connection that the board approved would connect the 63d Street tunnel to the GG tracks at a point between the Queens Plaza station and the 36th Street station. The new line, to be called the K line, would make all the GG stops in Queens between 36th Street and Continental Avenue. From Continental Avenue to Court Square, the GG line would no longer exist. Passengers on the GG line who wanted to go between those two points would have to get off at Court Square and walk through a 300-foot free-transfer tunnel to board an E or F train at the 23d Street-Ely Avenue station. About 50 residents of Brooklyn attended the meeting at 347 Madison Avenue to voice their objections to this aspect of the M.T.A.'s choice. The group objected because they said the tunnel would be a haven for criminals looking to prey on passengers. In response, the board adopted a resolution to further study that aspect of the plan. The East River tunnel that will carry the K line has been under construction since 1971. It has been plagued by delays, the most recent of which was caused by water leaks in equipment rooms and by a labor strike that affected the delivery of concrete. The opening date has not been set, but M.T.A. officials said they expected to start sending trains through the tunnel late next year. Until the rail connection is finished, the K line will stop at 21st Street in Queens. Last spring, the M.T.A. issued a report describing the five options it had been considering. They ranged from building nothing more - the tunnel would have ended at the 21st Street station in Queens - to spending $1 billion to complete the original plan. Over the summer, the options caused controversy. Two of them, often called the ''Montauk options,'' were vigorously opposed by several Queens community groups from Glendale, Maspeth, Ridgewood and Forest Hills. Those options would have had subways running along infrequently used Long Island Rail Road freight tracks. The communities felt that the added trains in their neighborhoods would be dangerous. Several politicians had opposed the Montauk options, including Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, a Republican from New York and a member of the Appropriations Committee. Mr. D'Amato had vowed he would do all in his power to make sure the Federal Government did not help pay for the Montauk options. Mayor Koch, who supported the local option, directed the four board members whom he appoints to vote for the local connection.

38-> WHAT'S NEW IN EUROPE
Paris: Orangerie opens as a museum; wine-bar chains A crop of new museums is gradually making its appearance in Paris. Already opened, though not yet widely known, is the new museum at the Orangerie, just across the Tuileries Gardens from the Jeu de Paume. The Orangerie, which has been used for occasional exhibitions in the past, now has its own permanent collection, thanks to a handsome gift from Domenica Walter that includes a fine collection of canvases by Renoir, Cezanne and other Impressionists. Another museum that is making a reputation for itself these days is the Carnavalet in the Marais quarter, which specializes in exhibitions dealing with the city of Paris. From November to January it will house a show on Paris as seen by such famous photographers as Henri Cartier-Bresson. Next on the schedule is an exhibition devoted to Paris, or Lut ece, as the city was called in Roman and Gallic times. Next year a show devoted to the city's grand boulevards is planned. April will likely see the opening of the Picasso Museum at the H^otel Sale, a restored 17th-century palace on the Rue de Thorigny in the Marais district. The museum will house the collection of masterpieces that the French government accepted from Picasso's heirs in place of inheritance taxes, as well as pieces from his personal collection of primitive art. The museum will also feature exhibits devoted to Picasso's relationship with the world of letters, ballet and the theater. Some tips for getting in and out of Paris: Don't forget that France's superfast TGV express train is a shade more prestissimo than last year, thanks in part to some new track between Lyons and Marseilles. The Paris- Lyons run now takes only two hours, and the trip between Paris and Marseilles is down to just under five hours, about 30 minutes less than a year ago. Orlybus is the name of a new bus service which the Paris transport authority has just introduced between Orly Airport and the Place Denfert-Rochereau in Paris's 14th arrondissement. A bus leaves every 15 to 20 minutes and takes no more than 30 minutes to reach its destination. The new service is ideal for passengers with light luggage who know their way around Paris, because they can easily change to the subway at Denfert-Rochereau, avoiding the likelihood faced by the regular airport buses of getting stalled in heavy city traffic on their way to the Invalides terminal. The fare is about $1.30. PAUL LEWIS The wine bars of Paris appear to be expanding, amoeba-like, into chains. There is no McDonald's of wine bars yet, but Nicolas, the big wine company and owner of Jeroboam, one of the newer places, has ambitious plans. Things are booming at Jeroboam, a handsome wine bar and restaurant in the Rue Monsigny, not far from the Opera. Nicolas acknowledged that Jeroboam was a pilot operation that could be cloned endlessly if it proved to be successful. It has proved immensely successful but no others have appeared so far. Which is not the case with L'Ecluse, a mini-chain with five wine bars in the city. Willi's has two, and Le Pain et Le Vin has one location in Paris and is about to open another in Grenoble. The original L'Ecluse opened six years ago on the Quai des Grands-Augustins. That first outpost was situated on the site of a cafe where Juliette Greco, Jacques Brel and George Brassens sang in the 1950's. Georges Bardawil, who saw the wine bar as a outlet for expressing his enthusiasm for Bordeaux wines, offered a simple menu of cold cuts and irresistible desserts. He soon found he had a flourishing business. Since then four others have opened in Paris and there are plans for Geneva and Brussels. (The Paris locations are 15 Quai des Grands- Augustins, 15 Place de la Madeleine, 64 Rue Francois I, Rue Mondetour, and 2 Rue du General Henrion-Bertier, Neuilly-sur-Seine.) Customers of Bloomingdale's in New York will remember the always-packed L'Ecluse that was part of the store's French festival last year. Mark Williamson learned a bit about the wine business working here for Steven Spurrier, Paris' best-known wine merchant. Thus prepared, he opened Willi's four years ago at 13 Rue des Petits-Champs. The specialty is Rhone wines, and elegant but simple meals are served. A second Willi's is now open at 18 Rue des Halles, near the site of the old Les Halles market. The third chain-in-the-making, Le Pain et Le Vin, is owned by four men who also own restaurants in Paris. At this busy wine bar, which is at 1 Rue d'Armaille and has a good view of the Etoile, the menu includes a daily hot dish and a selection of sandwiches and salads.

39-> IDEAS & TRENDS
Across Canada With the Pope Pope John Paul II arrived in Canada last week for a 12-day visit that will take him from the Maritime Provinces across the country to the Northwest Territories and, judging from his first few speeches, over several ideological boundaries as well. In Quebec, where he celebrated a mass attended by 250,000, he quoted St. Peter no fewer than 10 times, perhaps sending a message to the church's liberal theologians. In Montreal, the subject was women and their importance to the church (although some may have seen a different message in his beatification of a nun who founded a religious order dedicated to service to priests). ''We cannot leave God at the schoolhouse door,'' he said the next day in Newfoundland, where he called for public financing of religious schools and condemned capitalism for stressing ''the profit motive of the few rather than the needs of the many.'' In Halifax, the emphasis was on the ''need to revive the faith.'' In Toronto, he delivered an indirect but firm endorsement of the Solidarity labor movement in Poland. Along the way the Pope ran into a group of Polish sailors, who gave him a ''Gdansk Yacht Club'' T-shirt, and cheered up a group of hospitalized youngsters. He was guarded at all times by the largest security force in Canadian history, a reaction to the bombing of a Montreal train station two weeks ago. The Pope's concern for his Canadian flock was underscored by a report distributed by the church stating that not more than 30 percent of Quebec Catholics practice regularly. But in stressing such themes as divorce, abortion and state aid to religious education, he also seemed to be delivering a message south of the border, where the role of church and state has become an issue in the Presidential campaign. When he was asked whether the United States should be paying attention to his remarks, he replied: ''I hope so.''

41-> NEW YORK DAY BY DAY ; Erin Remembered
Straying far from City Hall, the first mayoral candidates' forum, on Thursday night, often dwelled on international issues. Paul O'Dwyer, one of the questioners, asked three prospective mayoral candidates - City Council President Carol Bellamy; Assemblyman Frank J. Barbaro, Democrat of Brooklyn, and Herman Badillo - to identify countries that seriously violated human rights. Mr. Barbaro began ticking off a list while Mr. O'Dwyer, a longtime activist for a united Ireland, waited patiently for him to mention Northern Ireland. Finally, another panelist mentioned the magic words. As the audience laughed, Mr. Barbaro sheepishly told Mr. O'Dwyer, ''I think you know where I stand on Northern Ireland.'' Mr. O'Dwyer, not so sheepishly, shot back, ''It shouldn't be a private matter.''

Renting Within the Family Question: We bought a 5 1/2-room co-op on East 72d Street for our son while he was in school. When he graduates, he wants to pay rent. How much must we charge to be able to deduct depreciation? . . . C. D. Lido Beach, L.I. Answer: Section 280A of the Internal Revenue Code says that for an owner to rent to a family member the owner must charge a fair rental or no depreciation will be allowed and deductions will be limited to real estate taxes and mortgage interest. Lawrence Batdorf, a spokesman for the Internal Revenue Service, says an agent auditing your return would look at similar rentals and consult real-estate agencies. At one agency, J.I. Sopher & Company, the general manager, William Robertson, said a 5 1/2-room apartment in a standard luxury apartment building on East 72d Street could rent for between $2,000 and $3,000 a month; in a prewar co-op, for $4,000 or more. For a copy of Publication 527, ''Rental Property,'' write I.R.S., Box 1040, Methuen, Mass. 01844. A Bothersome Banner Question: A flagpole has been welded above my window flying a huge flag advertising a first-floor shop. The flag drifts in front of the windows of my rent-stabililzed apartment. What can I do? . . . B. T., Manhattan Answer: A spokesman for the Department of Buildings points out that constructing a flagpole requires a building permit and that the pole can project out to within two feet of the curb; however, a flag promoting a business is the same as a business sign, which in your neighborhood can project just 18 inches from the building. A check of the department's records shows no application for a permit for a flagpole or a sign at your address. To file a complaint call the Complaint Desk at 566-2384. Martin A. Shlufman, the state's deputy counsel for rent administration, says that depending on how much window is blocked, you could argue that you are suffering a dimunition of services, a determination that might be made by the district rent administrator and could result in a rent reduction or other action by the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal. Your district rent office is at 2 Lafayette Street. You could also call the Central Complaint Bureau of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development at 960-4800 to have an inspector determine if your light and air is obstructed. A Working-Abroad Sublet Question: Can I maintain my rent-controlled apartment while I'm sent overseas on a company assignment for two or three years? . . . G. C., Manhattan. Answer: Yes, if you maintain the apartment as your primary residence and you intend to return within a definite period of time, according to Howard Malatzky, assistant deputy counsel in the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal. But you would be able to sublet only if your original lease gave you that right. Mr. Malatzky recommends that you notify the landlord of your plans. David Abrams, a partner in the firm of Richenthal, Abrams and Moss, which represents many owners, said an owner would ask for proof from an employer that you are being assigned temporarily; and he would try to gather information about your move, including whether you are paying New York City taxes or whether you are exempt from those taxes.

44-> OBSERVER; BILLING THE HOST
New Jersey's social life promises to become almost unendurable once people there begin adapting to this week's state Supreme Court ruling on who can be sued in drunken-driving cases. In that insouciant manner which courts often affect when blandly decreeing social revolutions, the Jersey court said it ''senses that there may be a substantial change occurring in social attitudes'' toward alcohol, as a result of which society is now ready to change its ways, ''whether it means a small change or a significant one.'' And so, said the court, henceforth if you have guests in your house, serve them a drink and let them drive away, you will be in big trouble if they have an accident. In fact, you will be liable for injuries the accident causes. Is the social change likely to result from this ruling ''a small change or a significant one''? Let's try to imagine some typical Jersey people coming to grips with what their Supreme Court has decreed. Many Jersey people will simply stop serving alcohol when guests are in the house, and a large percentage who do so will discover that without alcohol both they and their guests are extremely dull. The guests will leave gratefully after the first glass of ginger ale. The host will gratefully bless them for leaving, then turn off the house lights and pour himself some whisky to drink in dark solitude. Why drink with the lights out? Because you don't want passing friends to notice you're in. If they ring the bell and see you have the alcohol out, you've got to offer them some too, don't you? Anything else would be socially swinish. So you give them a drink, they drive away and, if they have an accident, you get the shirt sued right off your back. That's why you drink in the dark. The first change we can expect, then, in Jersey social life is a big increase in secret solitary drinking. Since most of it will be done in blacked-out houses, New Jersey's consumption of electrical power will probably drop, and the power companies, pleading a loss of revenue, will persuade the utilities commission to let them raise prices. The rise in the price of electricity will cause the usual anguish, and many secret, solitary drinkers will increase their alcohol intake. Since the increase will occur in darkened houses, it will result in an increase in broken arms, legs, necks and spines as drinkers become befuddled about the location of coffee tables, sofas, television sets and cellar stairs. The sharp rise in fractures will disclose a dangerous shortage of orthopedic devices, physicians and hospitals. The Legislature, politically sensitive to the immense secret-solitary-drinker bloc, will have no alternative but to raise taxes to repair the deficiency. The tax increase is bound to have evil effects on the large population of social drinkers, those who refused to turn secret and solitary when the Jersey Supreme Court turned their hosts' parlors into free-fire zones for the pain-and-suffering lawyers. These social drinkers, decent folks who hated the idea of seeing their hosts financially destroyed, will probably have restricted themselves to a half-glass of beer at first. The news of taxes rising again, though, will create thousands of crises in New Jersey parlors. Suppose you are a New Jersey host and notice your guests are suddenly all asking for full glasses of beer or bourbon and soda without the soda. You would be foolish not to take action. I foresee a variety of actions being taken, all resulting in unhappy reactions. Action One: Host tells guest, ''You've had enough, Arnie. I'm cutting you off.'' Reaction One: Guest punches host's nose, claiming insult to his alcohol capacity. Action Two: Host serves additional drinks, then - to prevent guests from bankrupting him by driving away - sneaks outside and slashes guests' car tires. Reaction Two: Sued by guest who fell into open manhole while walking home because of four flat tires, host is held liable by New Jersey Supreme Court not only for injuries to drunken guest, but also for damages to underground water main caused by guest's fall. Action Three: Host grants guests' pleas for more drink, then orders them at gunpoint into his cellar where beds are prepared so they can spend the night comfortably without threatening host with financial ruin by driving home. Reaction Three: Chastened by this ugly incident, host and guests all resolve next morning to give up drinking forever. By sundown all decide instead to move out of New Jersey.

45-> Police Borrow More Tickets
Friday the 13th was a lucky day for motorists in this coastal community, although not many of them knew it. ''People just don't think it happens, but we ran out of tickets,'' Lieut. John Foster said. The last ticket was written about 4 P.M. Friday, but Lieutenant Foster warned motorists not to get cocky. Huntington Beach was seeking ticket books from other cities.

46-> FROM THE MAILBAG: CHEERS, BRICKBATS
The more interesting letters from readers accumulated during the year seem to fall into four categories: questions, amplifications, criticisms and corrections. Take the reader who was appalled by my use of the expression''to gild the lily,'' a corruption of the line in Shakespeare's ''King John'': ''To gild refined gold, to paint the lily.'' The criticism took the form of a poem: 'Tis hard indeed, 'tis very hard To note the oft-misquoted Bard, Whose lily ''gilded'' remains ''unpainted'' By those who, otherwise, are sainted And for whom we sound the clarion Including, too, the Burros, Marian. ''De Gustibus'' - that's Latin - she may know, And even how to serve shad roe, But when it comes to Shakespeare, Will, Her English Lit is aught but nil. Then there are those who disagree with my point of view. Vehemently. In response to a column on a prohibition on cigar and pipe smoking in restaurants, one person wrote: ''Anyone who becomes so possessive as to claim airspace apparently thinks the world owes them something.'' Another writer defended the practice of giving women menus without prices. ''What's ludicrous about a restaurant's giving a woman a menu without prices?'' she said. ''I earn about twice as much as my husband, and I like receiving the ladies' menus. I also like having the door opened for me and being sent flowers.'' But the letters that cause the most anguish are those that insist a recipe is wrong and has forced the reader to throw out many dollars worth of ingredients. After more than 20 years of writing recipes, I believe that the home cook is more often at fault - like the reader who complained about a recipe for pumpkin cheesecake, saying: ''The cake looks beautful and the baking time was fine. The problem is it has no flavor.'' A Defect in the Spices The writer said she thought it might not have had enough sugar or enough spices. There is nothing wrong with the recipe, but, more than likely, something is wrong with her spices - their age. Spices, especially if they are stored where it is warm - say, near the stove - lose their potency in a matter of months. The spices in some home kitchens, on the shelf for years, are almost devoid of flavor. The writer probably needs new ones. For every complaint or criticism there are also letters saying a column has struck a responsive chord. They are my favorites. A column entitled ''A Latchkey Child Learns to Cook'' prompted a woman to write: ''Your story parallels mine so closely. We did not receive our pressure cooker via parcel post, but it must have been the same type (very sensitive). I did not make Hungarian beef stew, but I made many other recipes. And yes, I learned to 'pluck a chicken,' which I never liked.'' To this day I believe I am a very good cook because I was a latchkey child.

48-> FILM VIEW; COCKEYED AT 'RED DAWN'
As Leo McCarey's ''My Son John'' epitomized the anti-Communist paranoia of the 1950's, with sometimes unintentionally funny results, ''Red Dawn,'' John Milius's shoot-'em-up World War III fantasy, provides an unusual glimpse into the mind of a certain kind of contemporary archconservative. It's not, heaven knows, the intellectual kind of archconservative. Rather, it exposes for all to see the cockeyed nightmares of those on the lunatic fringe, the self-styled patriots who might even embarrass the members of the John Birch Society. It's a movie that says that guns don't kill people, but people who kill people, without going that one step further to acknowledge that it's people with guns who kill people. ''Red Dawn'' is one of those rarely terrible movies that you cannot afford to miss - technically proficient, emotionally infantile and politically nuts, though not, I think, especially dangerous. It's too ludicrous. ''Red Dawn'' seems also to be the work of a man who is sick and tired of being on the receiving end of criticism aimed by the world's have-nots at the world's haves. Don't these people realize that it's not easy being rich and powerful and right? How about a little sympathy for the big guy? To provide answers to these and a lot of other questions you perhaps never thought to ask, Mr. Milius, with Kevin Reynolds, has written an apocalyptic fable designed, among other things, to refurbish the United States's international image by showing it to be, in awful fact, the world's most misunderstood underdog. There is no other way to interpret this vision of World War III, set in the small town of Calumet, Colo., at the foot of the Rocky Mountains, in which most of middle America has been occupied by ''the armies of Cuba and Nicaragua, sweeping up through Mexico,'' apparently disguised as tourists and gardeners. The armies of Cuba and Nicaragua? From the way Mr. Milius sees the balance of power, you must assume that the armies of Grenada are holding the Gulf Coast from Florida to Texas. However, the armies of Cuba and Nicaragua don't defeat us all by themselves - Mr. Milius isn't quite that paranoid. They are a part of a giant Soviet invasion force that, through one ruse and another, has defeated the United States military, leaving the fate of America in the hands of a few teen-age guerrillas in Calumet, Colo. It seems that there is a small zone called ''F.A.'' (Free America), though exactly where this might be I couldn't figure out while watching the movie. I also had trouble understanding just how Mr. Milius's war was initially fought. A few lines of exposition at one point indicate that nuclear weapons have knocked out New York and Washington and some other major cities, but that both sides early understood that further use of nuclear arms was impractical, so that, as one character says, ''It's just the same old conventional war all over again.'' ''What about Yurp (Europe)?'' one boy asks. ''Theyre sitting this one out,'' says a kindly old man played by Ben Johnson. ''I guess they figured they'd been through two already and that was enough. Not England, though, but they can't hold out forever.'' I really don't think that Mr. Milius is as mindlessly chauvinist as his movies, including ''The Wind and the Lion,'' would indicate. But his thinking is so small and wishful that it amounts to a huge distortion of the possibilities as well as of the facts. ''Red Dawn'' understands that nuclear weapons can cause horrendous destruction, but it's also airily confident that after a few cities have been destroyed, the combatants will come to their senses and return to the use of ordinary airplanes and tanks and rockets, as long as they last and, after that, one character says wistfully, ''maybe swords.'' That is probably the key to the dreams of Mr. Milius, who is a chivalrous though completely mixed-up romantic at heart, wanting to return to a 19th-century America inhabited by medieval knights. I know that doesn't make sense, but sense is not what ''Red Dawn'' is all about. It's both aggressively inflammatory in its predictions about the course of the Red Menace in the 1980's, and sloppily sentimental in its treatment of its teen-age guerrilla-patriots, six young men and two young women who talk, dress and behave very much in the manner of kids who might well have had posters of Che Guevera on their bedroom walls. They are a physically tough, incredibly effective commando group but - this is their human side - they also are given to manly hugs of encouragement and tears from time to time, even though the father of two of the boys has forbidden them ever to cry again. Mr. Milius couldn't very easily make an adventure film - which ''Red Dawn'' means to be - romanticizing six teen-age Cuban guerrillas in their Marxist war against the Batista dictatorship. He's done the next best thing. He's co-opted the romance of guerrilla war by reversing the roles of Cuba and America, which is neither easy nor plausible. There's something extraordinarily peculiar about the sight of six ordinary American teen-agers acting as if they'd learned their lessons by studying Fidel Castro's guerrilla tactics, an irony of which Mr. Milius is very much aware. About the only interesting character in the film is the Cuban officer in charge of the pacification of Calumet, Colo., and the surrounding territory. This fellow, named Bella and played by Ron O'Neal in the film's only decent performance, is murderously efficient at first but he finally comes to loathe his role as occupier when he's more used to being a liberator. Just how this can be coherently interpreted in the context of the rest of the film, I don't know, since ''Red Dawn'' would, in every other way, appear to support a United States occupation of all of Central America, in this fashion to prevent the armies of Cuba and Nicaragua from sweeping up through Mexico to take over Calumet, Colo. A group that calls itself the National Coalition on Television Violence, formed because its members feel that the ratings of the Motion Picture Association of America are inadequate, has come out with an official statement calling ''Red Dawn'' the most violent movie ever made. By this group's count, the film, which runs 114 minutes and has a PG rating, averages 134 acts of violence an hour. This may be true, but the violence in ''Red Dawn'' is mostly so impersonal and conventional - so obviously the work of special effects experts - that the movie seems less violent even than Mr. Milius's earlier comic-strip of a film, ''Conan the Barbarian.'' Of far greater concern than its violence is the manner in which ''Red Dawn'' makes small and comprehensible a war that many experts believe would be the last. It doesn't exactly defuse healthy anxiety. It ignores it by substituting for a vision of the possible holocaust a contemporary cowboys-and-Indians yarn that, like many of our earlier cowboys-and-Indians movies, is not without its racist undertones. Because the troops occupying Calumet, Colo., are mostly Cuban and Nicaraguan, they frequently speak in Spanish that is solemnly translated by English subtitles. Watching the film, as I did 10 days ago, in the Embassy 2 Theater on Seventh Avenue, with an audience that included a number of people who clearly understood the Spanish without the subtitles, I had the unsettling feeling that Mr. Milius's vision was not having quite the effect he intended. Though the audience was caught up in the melodrama of the physical action, it did not automatically view the Cuban and Nicaraguan soldiers as the demons they were supposed to be. To a lot of people in that audience, the occupation of the United States by Latin Americans, no matter what their politics, was certainly not a fate worse than death. Maybe Mr. Milius should get around more. America is a lot less homogenized than he seems to understand. The projection equipment at the Embassy 2 also had the effect of making its own comment on Mr. Milius's view of the future. Though the director apparently did not intend that we should feel that nuclear weapons had poisoned the atmosphere or had created a screen between earth and sun, the film I saw was so dimly lit that even scenes shot in broad daylight looked eerily dark. Because there wasn't enough light coming from the projector, the entire story appeared to be taking place during the last days of autumn, just before the coming of the nuclear winter.

Registration includes lunch and costs $12 at the door, or call 693-1400. ELIE WIESEL TO SPEAK It would be prudent to reserve tickets for 'An Evening With Elie Wiesel' in advance. Mr. Wiesel, whose novels, plays, essays and historical tracts, particularly those related to the Holocuast, have achieved wide acceptance among Christian as well as Jewish theologians, will speak at 7 P.M. next Sunday inthe Mount Vernon High School. As a child he was taken from his home in Hungary to the Auschwitz concentration camp, then to Buchenwald, and finally to freedom in Paris, where he worked as a journalist. Among many awards he has received are the 1968 Prix Medicis for 'Beggar in Jerusalem,' the National Jewish Book Council Award in 1964 and 1973, and the Jewish Heritage Award for Literature in 1966. He is currently Andrew Mellon Professor of Humanities at Boston University and chairman of the United States Holocaust Memorial Council in Washington. Patron tickets admitting two people cost $25, general admission is $5 and students will be admitted for $2.50. The telephone number is 664-0500. CHILDREN'S PROGRAMS Absorbing programs for children have been planned at the Hudson River Museum inYonkers, some of them related to current exhibitions. A drop-in Saturday morning film festival features movies about the arts. Eight films include 'The First Moving Picture Show' in which animated subjects are made of clay; 'Hands,' an introduction to film aking for young audiences: and films about collage, mask making, writing poetry, and telling stories. Admission is $3 and sessions last from 10:30 A.M.to noon. Museum Magic is an after-school program for children from 6 to 12 years old, and attendance is required from 3:45 to 5:15 P.M. on Thursdays for eight weeks. Each session takes its theme from the adult art and science exhibitions on view and relates them to children. For example, a tour of the 69th Annual Art Show will be accompanied by a discussion in the gallereis of the methods used by the artists to create three dimensional illusions. Afterward the children willmake their own collages and constructions inthe museum workshops, using the same materials. A visit to the Planetarium - where myths based on ancient Greek and American Indian interpretations of the constellations will be explained - will be followed by a workshop in which the children will write their own myths and illustrate them. Nature walks to observe the fall foliage inpreparation for creating their own landscape paintings is another scheduled session. The fee for eight weeks is $50. The museum also has an upstate excursion for adults scheduled from 8:45 A.M. to 4:45 P.M. Wednesday to the 200-acre Storm King indoor-outdoor sculpture museum, and the Boscobel Restoration, with lunch at the Plumbush Restaurant in Cold Spring, N.Y. Storm King has a special showing of Isamu Noguchi and Louise Nevelson sculpture plust its permanent collection of Calder, diSuvero, Moore and David Smith. The tour of Boscobel, an 1804 Federal-style mansion, includes inspection of Duncan Phyfe furniture, the Orangerie, the carriage house and an opportunity to purchase some freshly picked apples int he gift shop. Cost of the package, including luch and bus transportation from the museum is $48. Call 963-4550 for more information or to register for the children's or adult's programs. KINGSTON'S 300TH Kingston, New York's first state capitol, will be celebrating its 300th birthday Saturday. Walking tours of eight fully restored historic homes still in use will be conducted from 10:30 A.M. to 4 P.M., guided by costumed docents and beginning at the Old Dutch Church, reputedly the oldest continuing congregatin in America. The spire is visible from Esit 19 fo the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway. The tour represents a compendium of American architecture from pre-Revolutionary War days through Federalist, Georgian and Art Deco periods. In addition visitors can tour the Senate House where the first state consitution was signed and a museum maintained by the Daughters of the American Revolution. Included in the $6 tour ticket is a short film about the Revolutionary War, a display of children's crafts and games and a shuttle bus to and fromthe rondout waterfront, another historic location now being restored. Revitalized by an influx of hightech industry, tourism and artists from Woodstock, the city has also restored a turn-of-the century shopping district where a number of new restaurants have opened. COMMUNICATING The Institute for Single Parent Family of 132 Pondfield Road in Bronxville will hold a workshop on 'Communications: Pathway to Relationships,' from 6:30 to 9:30 P.M. Tuesday at the Bronxville Feild Club, on Locust Lane. Co-sponsored by the county's Department of Community Mental Health, theprogram will feature talks by Dr. Robert Marantz, former director of the Human Sexuality Center of the Long Island Jewish-Hillside Medical Center; and Joan Lakin, author of 'Who Will Take the Children.' It is the contention of the institute that 'in our society we are taught how to talk and express ourselves in an articulate way, but there are few practical courses teasching about intimacy, conflict, anxiety or happiness.' Registration for a fee of $15, or $10 for studnets and the elderly, can be arranged by calling 779-8093.

50-> MAJOR PARTIES WATCHING 7 HOUSE RACES IN STATE
Democrats and Republicans have identified seven Congressional races in New York State as critical and potentially close contests in which incumbents are jeopardized or party control of a seat could change. Of the seven seats, five are held by Democrats, one by a Republican and one by the only Conservative Party member of the House of Representatives. Five are upstate or in the suburbs, where both major parties expect President Reagan to make a strong run that could affect the House races and threaten four Democratic incumbents. Democrats hold 20 of the 34 seats in the New York delegation. 3 Contests Have Priority Aides to the national and House campaign committees of both major parties say the most critical elections, in general order of priority, are these: - The 20th Congressional District in Westchester County, where Joseph Dioguardi, a Republican-Conservative, and Oren J. Teicher, a Democrat, are making their first runs for office. They are seeking the seat being vacated by retiring Richard L. Ottinger, a Democrat who won the district for his party in 1974. - The predominantly Republican 34th Congressional District in western New York, where Representative Stanley N. Lundine, a Democrat, faces a challenge from Jill Emery, a Republican making her first run for office. She is the wife of James L. Emery, the Republican candidate for lieutenant governor in 1982 who now is the administrator of the St. Lawrence Seaway. - The 15th Congressional District in Manhattan, centered on the East Side of Manhattan, where a Republican, Representative Bill Green, faces a strong and well-financed challenge by Democrat Andrew J. Stein, the Manhattan Borough President. Potential 'Switch Seats' The campaign committees consider the following contests less critical but potential ''switch seats'': - The First Congressional District in eastern Suffolk County, where Representative William Carney, a Conservative who runs with Republican endorsement, narrowly won the Republican primary and now faces his strongest Democratic opponent in four elections, Assemblyman George Hochbrueckner. - The Third Congressional District, along the North Shore of Nassau and western Suffolk Counties, where Representative Robert Mrazek, a one-term Democratic incumbent in Republican territory, is being challenged by a well- financed political newcomer, Robert Quinn. - The Ninth Congressional District in Queens, the home district of Geraldine A. Ferraro, where City Councilman Thomas J. Manton, the winner of a four-way Democratic primary, is confronting Serphin R. Maltese, the Conservative Party's state executive director. Mr. Maltese is running with Republican and Right to Life Party endorsements. - The 28th Congressional District in the Catskills-Southern Tier area, where Representative Matthew F. McHugh, a Democrat who was first elected in 1974 after Watergate, faces another strong Republican challenge, as he has in every re-election campaign. His opponent is Constance Cook, the former state senator. Republicans are on the offensive generally because they anticipate that President Reagan will run strongly outside New York City. One sign of their optimism is Mr. Dioguardi's prominent use in his campaign literature of a photograph of him with President Reagan in the White House library. Mr. Quinn, Mr. Mrazek's opponent, is using a similar photo that was taken during a Republican ''candidates school'' in Washington. Mr. Carney, the Conservative-Republican, is using a more informal photograph of the President and himself seated on a wall at Camp David, the Presidential retreat. Republicans Mention Mondale In contrast, Walter F. Mondale, the Democratic Presidential candidate, is mentioned more by Republicans than Democrats. ''If you listen to my opponent, you'd think my name is Mondale Downey,'' said Representative Thomas J. Downey of the Second District in Suffolk County, a safe Democratic seat despite a Republican majority in enrollment. ''If someone asked me if I were tied to the national ticket,'' said Mr. Hochbrueckner, Mr. Carney's Democratic challenger, ''I'd say that I'm running for Congress, I'm not running for President.'' Democrats are counting on New York to follow its recent Presidential election history, in which the state has delivered relatively small pluralities for candidates even when they are winning an electoral vote landslide nationally, and in which the national vote has had little effect on other contests. The largest Presidential pluralities in the state in the last 20 years were Lyndon Johnson's 2.6-million plurality over Barry Goldwater in 1964 and Richard Nixon's 1.3-million margin over George McGovern in 1972. In 1964, seven Republican House members in New York lost their seats, and in 1972 no House incumbent was defeated. The Democratic and Republican national committees and their House campaign counterparts will provide varying amounts of money and aid to these targeted districts, with the maximum allowed by law being about $50,000 in cash and mailing contributions per candidate.

51-> THE MAN FOR THE SEASON
As a student at Montclair State College, presently enrolled in a psychology-of-sport course, I thought it was interesting to see the difference in Darryl Strawberry's confidence from this year to last ('Darryl Strawberry: The Man for the Season,' by Jane Gross, Feb. 26). Strawberry had a rough initiation to the Major Leagues last year, due largely to the psychological adjustment and to the problems of dealing with the media bombardment that comes with playing in the big city. Now, with a productive rookie year behind him that included many honors, if Darryl Strawberry can give us half of what is expected of him, he could indeed be 'the man for the season.' STEVEN M. JOHNSON Nutley, N.J.

52-> SUPPORT GROWING FOR SALES TAXES
IT may be only a penny on the dollar, but it's adding up to $100 million this year in additional Nassau County revenues. Some of that seems headed for garbage. The penny increase has been a relatively easy way for the county to balance its budget and avoid a property tax increase. It has been so successful that other counties throughout the state, including Suffolk, Westchester and Erie, have sought, or considered, similar relief. And if Governor Cuomo, as expected, signs legislation recently approved by the State Legislature, Nassau will continue to reap the added revenue for at least another few years. In addition, the county's towns and cities will begin to receive a direct share of those pennies to help solve their mounting garbage disposal problem. The same legislation carries a quarter of a penny sales tax increase for Suffolk County. However, the members of the Suffolk Legislature would have to muster the 10 votes necessary to put it into effect. As proposed by Suffolk County Executive Peter F. Cohalan, the county would use the revenue to help ease the tax burden in the Southwest Sewer District and other sewer districts throughout the county. Opponents in Suffolk, meanwhile, have urged the Governor not to sign the measure. They say that the sales tax increase discriminates against those residents living outside a sewer district. However, the Governor is expected to approve it and leave its use to local discretion. The sales tax in Nassau is currently 8.25 percent, the same as in New York City. The Suffolk sales tax is 7.25 percent. It would increase to 7.5 percent. Assemblyman Arthur J. Kremer, a Long Beach Democrat and chairman of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee, led the initial opposition to the measure in Albany. He argued that the sales tax revenues should not be used indiscriminatly by local lawmakers to plug budget gaps. He came around to supporting the legislation only after local leaders agreed to earmark the income for specific expenditures. In the case of Nassau it's waste disposal; in Suffolk it's sewers. ''We also had requests for sales tax increases this year from Westchester and Erie,'' Mr. Kremer said, ''but they did not follow through. Apparently their problems were not as serious as they originally thought.'' ''A lot of local governments are looking at sales tax revenues as a politically acceptable means to balance their budgets,'' he added. As for Nassau and Suffolk, Mr. Kremer noted that they were under 1990 deadlines to close their landfills. By that time, he said, they must have available, alternative means of disposing of their solid wastes. ''I see the sales tax being used to begin solving that problem now,'' he said. ''The three towns and two cities in Nassau will be able to see where that additional revenue is going, as opposed to just more budget balancing.'' He said the latter did not ''make for good government,'' in that it ''makes governments lax and unwilling to address their long-range problems.'' Under the measure, a full penny of the tax would be continued next year in Nassau, with three-quarters of the revenue going into the county's coffers and one-quarter going, for the first time, to towns and cities to defray garbage-disposal costs. In 1986, the tax would be reduced to three-quarters of a cent, with the county's share dropping to half a cent. The towns and cities would continue to receive their one-quarter cent. The tax would expire at the end of 1986, unless extended by new legislation, which Mr. Kremer said was ''very possible, so long as the revenue went for a specific need, like solid waste disposal.'' Nassau County Executive Francis T. Purcell said that in order for the county to agree to give up part of the penny tax revenue, Mr. Kremer promised that the county would benefit from additional revenue-sharing funds from the state. ''He told us that would make up the difference,'' Mr. Purcell said. ''That, along with the normal increase in sales tax revenues should help us,'' he added. ''If the economy continues to be healthy, we won't have as big a budget gap as we anticipated.'' He said the share of sales tax revenues going to the cities and towns represented ''a tax cut for local taxpayers.'' He added that the county was in the process of a number of cost-cutting measures, including an early-retirement offer to about 2,000 county employees, with between 700 and 800 employees expected to take advantage of the plan. Mr. Purcell warned that an alternative to the sales tax was an increase in property taxes. ''The sales tax is the least onerous,'' he said. Peter King, the Nassau County Comptroller, said that by the time 1986 comes around, the Board of Supervisors ''will have to decide whether it truly intends to phase out the sales tax or go for another extension.'' ''When the sales tax increase ends, we'll either have to increase the property tax or reduce spending,'' he said. ''And if we're going to reduce spending, we better start thinking about where we're going to make the cuts now.'' ''I personally feel it's better to extend the sales tax and produce a reduction in property taxes,'' Mr. King said. He noted that sales tax revenues ''have been strong so far this year'' and were ''well above the first five months of last year.'' ''If the Long Island economy continues to grow at the present strong rate,'' he said, ''Nassau County can only benefit.''

53-> Jerome Murphy, A Lawyer, Wed To Lisa D'Amato
Lisa D'Amato, a daughter of Senator and Mrs. Alfonse M. D'Amato of Island Park, L.I., was married yesterday to Jerome C. Murphy, a son of Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Murphy of Rockville Centre, L.I. Msgr. Edward L. Melton performed the ceremony at St. Agnes Roman Catholic Cathedral in Rockville Centre. Lorraine D'Amato was maid of honor for her sister. Daniel Murphy was best man for his brother. Mrs. Murphy, who graduated from Hofstra University, is an analyst for the Northville Industries Corporation, a petroleum concern in Huntington Station, L.I. Her father, a Republican, is serving his first term in the United States Senate. He was formerly the presiding supervisor of Hempstead, L.I. The bride's mother, Penelope D'Amato, is a computer instructor at Nassau Community College in Uniondale, L.I. Mr. Murphy, a graduate of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, received a law degree from Brooklyn Law School. He is an associate with the law firm of McCoy & Agoglia in Mineola, L.I.

54-> SPORTS PEOPLE; ;
Manager Whitey Herzog of the St. Louis Cardinals had reason to despair. Preliminary X-rays indicated that his all-star shortstop, Ozzie Smith, hit on the right wrist Friday night by a pitch thrown by Ed Whitson of the San Diego Padres, would be sidelined four to six weeks with a broken bone. Herzog mulled calling up Jose Gonzalez from Louisville to share the position with recently acquired Chris Speier, but he wasn't happy. ''I don't think Chris is capable of playing every day,'' said Herzog. ''You don't replace an Ozzie Smith. He's the best that ever played at that position.'' But yesterday, more extensive examinations showed that Smith suffered only bruises and should be able to play in a few days after the swelling disappears. Smith is having perhaps his best season - in his last 34 games, he batted .343 to raise his 34 games, he batted .343 to raise his season average to .254. . . . Fred Breining, the right-handed pitcher acquired from the San Francisco Giants in the trade for Al Oliver, has appeared in only four games this season for the Montreal Expos. It is doubtful he will make any more because he is scheduled to have arthroscopic surgery on his injured right shoulder this week.

ANYONE in a position of authority in a co- op or condominium soon discovers the difficulty of finding volunteers for a board or committee. Officers frequently find that they must struggle to fill vacancies. ''It has become a major problem,'' said Irene Soskin, secretary of the New Jersey Chapter of the Community Associations Institute, a national network of unit owners and professionals involved in all forms of community ownership. Mrs. Soskin is also past president of her own condominium - Winston Towers 200, a 617-unit high-rise condominium in Cliffside Park, N.J. As a result, officers who have successfully recruited fellow residents find themselves much in demand for how-to speeches to lesssuccessful officers. Booklets on recruiting volunteers are being prepared, and the subject seems to be discussed whenever co-op or condominium leaders get together. These are some of the successful officers' ideas and recommendations for recruiting volunteers: Invite the rental tenants in the cooperative or condominium to serve on certain committees; create more single-project posts for those reluctant to accept the responsibility of being an officer; actively recruit specific individuals, and create incentives and rewards that encourage people to serve. Officials at the institute's headquarters in Arlington, Va., say it is vital to foster more active participation by renters. ''These people are a resource that should n't be ignored,'' said James Dowden, the association's executive vice president. ''It helps spread the burden over a wider group.'' By participating, renters tend to become more responsible, and the hostility and caste system that often develops between renters and owners is eased. But he recommends that renters not be allowed to serve in a policy-making position nor permitted to make up the majority on any committee. The officers of Concord Village, a 1,022-unit co-op in Brooklyn Heights, recently decided to solicit help actively from renters, who occupy 12 percent of the units. ''Opening up some of the positions to tenants was a way of helping us out of a problem,'' said Jessica Conforte, past president, ''as well as making the tenants more interested in the building.'' One of the first to serve was Diana D'Ambra, a financial analyst with Salomon Brothers, who agreed to fill a vacancy on the finance committee. ''It seemed like an interesting intellectual exercise,'' she said. ''And it also looked like a good place for contacts because we had such high-powered people in the building. I also felt that the concerns of tenants needed some representation.'' Although Mrs. Conforte conceded that there was initial uneasiness with the idea, Miss D'Ambra said she was warmly received. She developed a sense of belonging that eventually led her to buy a co-op there rather than elsewhere. Officers say the incentive for tenants to take these positions - the opportunity for career enhancement or wider recognition - should not be underestimated. Mrs. Soskin, the New Jersey officer, said she had used her administrative experience as president of a large condominium as an added credential when she recently sought the chairmanship of the Social Studies Department at Pelham High School, where she had taught for a number of years. She believes she won the appointment largely because of that experience. As another incentive, officers can offer to help pay for a prospective volunteer to learn skills for the job. Bobbi Hendler, vice president of a 198-unit co-op in the Inwood section of Manhattan, said her board had recruited volunteers by paying their admission to conferences of the Council of New York Cooperatives, a network of 400 building officers that regularly offers workshops on leadership skills. ATANGIBLE gesture of gratitude can also sweeten the task. ''Board members should not be afraid of giving themselves an annual dinner or some sort of social celebration on the house,'' said Robert J. Huhtanen, professional manager of 25 condominiums in the Hartford area. ''They've earned it, and it makes for a more enjoyable experience.'' Boards should also honor outgoing officers with a plaque, he said, or a certificate of appreciation. ''People are very proud of these awards,'' he said. ''They become a motivation.'' Mr. Huhtanen has found that starting giving someone a small, one-time project frequently leads to their serving as a regular officer. This was the case with Mark Savory, a management consultant and a unit owner at Talcott Glen, a 124-unit condominium in Farmington, Conn. ''Being an officer looked like too much work,'' he said. So he agreed instead to work on a budget committee that met only four times a year. His experience, he said, persuaded him that he had overestimated the time needed to serve as an officer. He is now on the board of directors. Approaching people personally seems to work too. ''It's no good sending around forms asking for assistance and expecting people to offer,'' Mrs. Soskin said. ''They're too afraid of being turned down. You have to call them up individually and suggest a job that matches their skills. It's flattering to get that sort of call. It's hard to say no.'' She said she thought more people would come forward if co-ops and condominiums tried to lessen the level of abuse that officers frequently encounter. ''We become sitting ducks,'' she said. ''We are blamed for everything.'' To remove officers from that fear, she said, her condominium has instituted a series of formal, parliamentary procedures for handling complaints. Each of the building's 31 floors elects two floor delegates. Any problem that cannot be solved by calling the managing agent must first be taken to one of these representatives, who also sit on a building-wide congress. ''Now if a board member gets a call,'' Mrs. Soskin said, ''it can be redirected to the agent or the floor delegate without anyone feeling slighted.'' Officers said they had found that the individual with time to spare does not necessarily make the most effective committee member. ''It's better to look for a Type A personality,'' said Harvey Owen, president of an eight-unit brownstone on the Upper West Side, ''someone who cannot relax and likes to see things done right. You can easily spot them at meetings. They're always the ones with the questions.''

56-> MR. FIX-IT ; TURNAROUND MAN AT MONGOMERY WARD
STEPHEN L. PISTNER doesn't mind turning things upside down. For three years, as Montgomery Ward & Company's chairman and chief executive officer, the aggressive and intense Mr. Pistner has jostled, prodded and virtually turned the venerable Chicago company on its axis to bring it into the late 20th century. Now, finally, his efforts seem to be paying off. In 1983, after three years of losses, the century-old company earned $40 million after taxes on sales of $6.1 billion - a puny return but a profit nonetheless. And in 1984, ''we will be clearly stronger than last year,'' said the 52-year-old former salesman. The better outlook was welcomed at Montgomery Ward's Chicago headquarters - but even more so at its parent, the Mobil Corporation. Ten years ago, the huge oil refiner paid $1.7 billion for Montgomery Ward and then threw another $600 million at it to keep creditors away. In recent years, the word in the retailing industry was that Mobil had gotten a bad deal when it bought Montgomery Ward - and that it was looking for a buyer. Now, Mr. Pistner's success at turning the company around appears, finally, to be stilling long-denied rumors that Mobil would sell Montgomery Ward. ''We have no plans to sell Montgomery Ward,'' a Mobil spokesman said late last week. ''We're obviously very pleased with the progress they have made.'' It may be, analysts speculate, that Mobil may just be waiting until Ward's bottom line improves so that it could earn a good return on its investment when it decides to sell. Or, say some merchants close to Mr. Pistner, he ultimately may want to buy Montgomery Ward himself as head of an investing group - but only after bringing the company to the 2.5 percent net profit level on sales that he is seeking. Last year, that profit level was considerably below 1 percent. Mr. Pistner, for his part, only smiles at that idea. His attempts to strengthen the company, however, are far less enigmatic. ''What we are involved in these days is a progressive turnaround,'' said the ebullient Mr. Pistner in an interview last week. Walter F. Loeb, retail analyst for Morgan Stanley & Company, New York, estimates that the company should have a net profit of about $100 million this year, or two-and-a-half times what it had in 1983. He believes that there is ''a place for Montgomery Ward as a promotional mass merchandiser, and the company is showing it under Pistner.'' Under Mr. Pistner, who has cut staff and stores, Montgomery Ward is moving to consolidate - and strengthen - that place. The native of St. Paul is now pushing one of retailing's most innovative strategies - and with some apparent success. Montgomery Ward has concentrated on seven popular merchandise categories, which include automotive products, appliances and home furnishings, with the intent of selling as many of those products as possible in its stores and then opening specialty stores that would carry those goods. The program expands inventory and space for those items. It has been started already in automotive products and electronic goods, but so far, no specialty stores have been opened. ''The result,'' Mr. Pistner said, should ''give us specialty businesses as good as the best appropriate specialty stores'' in a particular city or town. The program has already drawn approval. ''It will allow Ward's to better compete with the specialty retail chains, which are rapidly growing,'' Jeffrey M. Feiner, retail analyst for Merrill Lynch, said. Mr. Pistner, who is earning a reported $1 million a year, is also pushing a related effort to sell more appliances. Long a major retailer of its private-label lines of appliances, the company is now moving to sell more brand-label goods. It now offers Maytag washers and dryers, which have lifted sales by 13 percent in the major appliance business. In addition to taking an offensive stance with its new plans, the company is also instituting corrective measures, most noticeably in the Montgomery Ward catalogue business and the Jefferson Ward discount subsidiary. ''In catalogue, sales are up but it can do better,'' Mr. Pistner said. ''We are giving it a lot of attention.'' Jefferson Ward, he said, ''has made progress as an upscale discounter, but it still needs more focusing.'' MR. Pistner, a workaholic who starts his day with breakfast meetings and goes on through business dinners and often has weekend business meetings, has received general plaudits for his efforts. ''He has made exceptional progress,'' said John Landschultz, an analyst with Mesirow & Company, the Chicago brokerage. ''Mr. Pistner has generated a fundamental process in revamping the company, starting with the basics.'' Ward's past problems, he said, ''were a function of not only a difficult economy but, I think, of a company that was meandering without a delineated objective.'' That has changed. ''In hard goods,'' Mr. Landschultz added, ''he is doing it better than almost anyone else, and giving the customer good merchandise at a decent price. I believe he will achieve a lot over a period of time.'' In the three years since Mobil hired him, Mr. Pistner has cut the staff by 23,000 people, to 74,000, reduced the number of warehouses to 33 from 150 and pared the truck fleet to 3,100 from 4,200 vehicles. The New York buying office has been strengthened. And merchandising, buying and advertising have moved back to the central office in Chicago from the field. ''Pistner's aggressive nature has resulted in some people leaving the company, and also in jarring the old- line Ward mentality,'' said Mr. Feiner of Merrill Lynch. ''But the jarring was necessary.'' The cuts were complemented by an effort to change employee attitudes. The principal emphasis, Mr. Pistner said, has been on ''changing the environment from a credit-dominated business into a marketing and merchandising-oriented business.'' In order to do that, he said, he first had to ''change the attitude of people as to what our purpose is, what we are and want to be, and express it through their responsibilities.'' Sales productivity has risen as the number of stores was cut. Ward now has 20 fewer stores than it did in 1980 after closing more than 50 and opening others. At the same time, sales per square foot rose to $160 in 1983 from $150, while sales per employee jumped to $77,000 last year from $54,000. The company is showing other signs of success. Its ''Chamber of Horrors,'' a hall in the Chicago headquarters for products that were performing poorly in the stores, has been closed. It had been opened to dramatize to buyers the need to insure product quality, but management recently decided it was no longer necessary. Mr. Pistner, who is divorced and lives in a midtown Chicago condominium, has three children, two sons and a daughter all in their 20's. When he has some free time, he tends to the roses on his terrace garden, enjoys trap and skeet shooting and exercises on a stationary bicycle. He is also a board member of the Lyric Opera of Chicago and a trustee of the Orchestral Association of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. After receiving his pyschology degree in 1955 from the University of Minnesota, Mr. Pistner became a salesman for Victor Business Products, Chicago, and soon emerged as its top salesman. He moved to a sales job at the Burgess Battery Company and then to sales manager of Electronics Associates, a St. Paul electronics wholesaler. After being named its president, he bought the company, gave it a new strategy, renamed it as Team Electronics and sold it in 1970 to the Dayton-Hudson Corporation. In 1973, troubled by the lagging fortunes of its Target discount stores division, Dayton-Hudson assigned him the task of reviving it. His award for reviving the division was the presidency, four years later, of Dayton-Hudson. Despite the problems he faced at Target, he said he was not prepared for the ''magnitude'' of turning around Ward's. ''It's been a totally different experience, requiring a mind-boggling set of changes,'' he said. ''I used to think I had already earned my Ph.D. in corporate management, but I am really earning it now.''

To the Editor: In his review of ''Hilaire Belloc'' (Sept. 2), Wilfrid Sheed referred to the late Lady Juliet Duff as a ''social nitwit.'' I find this remark offensive and inaccurate. Lady Juliet was a friend of many prominent writers, painters and theatrical personalities for more than four decades. She was charming and intensely loyal to these and a host of admirers. She was also an intimate and devoted friend of Winston Churchill, a man not noted for his tolerance of nitwits, social or otherwise. TRUMBULL BARTONNew York

60-> WHAT CONSTITUTES A CIVIL RIGHT?
Morris Abram devotes much of his article to denouncing those who regard what he calls ''economic entitlements'' (shelter, day care for children, health care) and affirmative-action programs as civil rights. The basis of his argument is that none of these desiderata ''are to be found in the Constitution.'' I might remind Mr. Abram that he has forgotten what Chief Justice John Marshall once forcefully urged ''we must never forget,'' namely that ''it is a Constitution we are expounding.'' At various stages of our history, when many new social, economic and political demands first arose, they were rejected by the Morris Abrams of their time, as beyond constitutional purview. All that Mr. Abram is doing is attempting to buttress the Administration's destruction or evisceration of the civil- rights gains of the last three decades by utilizing the same tortured construction of the Constitution relied on by successive generations of slave owners, segregationists and other antilibertarian forces in our pluralistic society. Be patient, minorities, he urges, because ''greater speed'' in attaining ''racial justice'' may require us to ''turn . . . our backs on the Constitution.'' WILLIAM M.

61-> BUSINESS PEOPLE; MSI Data Fills Post Of President and Chief
Charles S. Strauch has been named president and chief executive officer of the MSI Data Corporation, the company said yesterday. The appointment is effective immediately. Mr. Strauch, 49,, succeeds William J. Bowers, the co-founder of the company, as chief executive officer. Mr. Bowers, who is 55, will remain chairman of the MSI board. The office of president has been vacant since February 1983, when Donald Brosnan left the company to become an independent consultant. Based in Costa Mesa, Calif., MSI is the leading manufacturer of portable data collection systems used for inventory control, meter reading, cost estimating and other functions. The titles of president and chief executive officer are not new ones to Mr. Strauch. From August 1983 until his appointment yesterday, Mr. Strauch has been president and chief executive officer at Computer International, a private Los Angeles company. Before joining that company, for 15 months Mr. Strauch was president and chief executive officer at Magnuson Computer Systems in San Jose, Calif. From January 1979 through March 1982, Mr. Strauch served as president at the Memorex Corporation. Before that, he spent 12 years with Gould Inc., leaving as executive vice president responsible for electronics and the company's electrical businesses. Mr. Strauch, who has a bachelor of science degree from Lehigh University, was traveling yesterday and could not be reached for comment. Reflecting increased competition and a rise in spending on research and development, MSI recently reported a sharp drop in earnings for its first quarter, which ended June 30. Its net income was $247,000, down sharply from the $868,000 it earned during the similar period a year ago.

62-> Denis Watson Leads by Two
Imagine a miner who is allergic to coal dust, an auto mechanic who is allergic to oil and grease, a jockey who is allergic to horse hair. That is about what it is like for Denis Watson when he practices his trade - playing golf. The 28-year-old native of Zimbabwe who now lives in Florida has been allergic to grass, tree leaves and about anything that grows and is green most of his life. Yet he chose professional golf as a career. Lately, he has been doing well at his job despite his allergies, and today he remained in the lead after the third round of the NEC World Series of Gold at the long Firestone Country Club's South Course. Watson, who set a course record of eight-under-par 62 Friday to take the second-round lead, shot even par 70 today for a nine-under-par total of 201 for three rounds. This gave him a two- shot lead over Bruce Lietzke, who bogeyed the last two holes today. Lietzke had 69 for 203. Two Tied at 206 Peter Jacobsen and Bob Eastwood were tied at 206, with Tom Kite and Craig Stadler at 207 in this field of 41 golfers. This is one of the prize fields on the tour whose competitors are winners of specific golf events around the world, including the year's PGA Tour events. It is similar to the MONY Tournament of Champions with the addition of the foreign tournament victors. Watson qualified for this $700,000 event by winning the Buick Open two weeks ago. Speaking of his allergies, Watson said: ''I'm getting control of this thing. I've been on medication over a year now, and believe me I've put up with a lot of misery. ''I used to take all these drugs and things for it. But I found I had a hard time with all the drugs I tried for it. I lost balance and coordination. I didn't have too much trouble in Europe, because the pollen doesn't fly around so much over there.'' On Tour Three Years Watson has been a full-time member of the PGA Tour since 1981. ''There's really not all you can do but get on a desensitization program,'' Watson said. ''The desensitization program is that I take a shot every few weeks.'' His 62 was a record that surprised almost everyone, including Watson. ''You dream of those rounds,'' he said. ''You don't expect to make them.'' This was accomplished with Firestone South set at its full length of 7,173 yards. It was a score that players such as Jack Nicklaus have not been able to make in years of playing in this tournament here. The course was set at slightly more than 7,000 yards today, as the 16th was shortened from 625 yards to 575 and No. 5, a par 3, was shortened from 234 to 181 yards. ''I was pretty nervous going into the round today,'' Watson said. ''After the 62, I was sort of shocked.'' Played Consistently Today But Watson did not do what other golfers have done after a record round and balloon to a dozen or more over par. Instead, he played steadily and carded two birdies and two bogeys. All the rest were pars. His best hole today was the second, where he scrambled hard for a par on the front nine's only par 5. He began by hitting his drive left, as he said he had wanted to. But it went just a bit too far that direction, clipped a tree limb and kicked way left into the rough along the left side of the third fairway. No. 3 is a hole that comes back parallel to No. 2. He had a poor lie in deep grass, and huge trees blocked him from getting back to the second fairway. So he hit a 6-iron out and up the third fairway. Then, after a lengthy study of his third shot, he hit a wedge high over big trees to the fringe of the green. From there, he chipped close enough to sink one putt and save par. Lietzke, who led the first round and has been second since, could have been tied for the lead after the third round, as he got three birdies and 13 pars before teeing off at No. 17. He landed in a greenside bunker there on his second shot, got out but two-putted for bogey 5. Then Lietzke drove a bunker at No. 18, came out to another greenside bunker, blasted free to within 10 feet, but missed that putt for bogey 5. Tom Watson, this year's winner of the Tournament of Champions, scored 77 today for 218, too far back to contend in the final round Sunday. That seven-over round was the highest for Tom Watson on this course since his final-round 78 here in 1972, his first World Series. He won this tournament in 1975 and 1980.

Gordon Sinclair, the irreverent Canadian newsman who became a folk hero to many Americans in 1973 when he scolded the world for being ungrateful to the United States, died Thursday, two days after suffering a heart attack. He was 83 years old. In 1973, when the United States was battered by the energy crisis, Watergate and the Vietnam War, Mr. Sinclair told off the world in a broadcast for turning against the United States after accepting billions of dollars in American aid. The broadcast was made into a record that he said brought him ''the biggest mail of my career.'' ''This Canadian thinks it's time to speak up for the Americans as the most generous and possibly the least appreciated people in all the world,'' the broadcast on June 5, 1973, said. Mr. Sinclair had a career that included interviewing Adolf Hitler and posing nearly nude for a takeoff on a Playgirl magazine centerfold. He wrote eight books. Mr. Sinclair is survived by his sons Gordon, Donald and Jack, and his wife, Gladys.

The Labor Department said that with overall civilian unemployment receding, many jobs are available but have no takers. The computerized list, which will be compiled in Albany, will provide free guidance to job seekers at employment bureaus in their areas. Mr. Donovan said the jobs available ''are mostly in the professional and highly skilled categories with salaries and wages ranging from $7,100 up to $70,000, with a median of $21,000.''

To the Editor: I read the article ''On Hallowed Ground'' with great interest. It was surely a well-written and moving story, except for one thing; the author states that ''in one of the cruel jokes of the war, the conquerors of the heights discovered the Germans had already dismantled the guns and removed them to the safety of a nearby apple orchard.'' One of the curious ironies of journalism is that stories are frequently left unfinished. Companies D, E and F of the Second Ranger Battalion had two missions: one was to find and destroy six 155-millimeter coastal guns and the second was to set up a roadblock to prevent the Germans from using the coastal road to consolidate their forces. The guns were missing from the German emplacement on the Pointe du Hoc. Companies D, E and F became engaged in fierce firefights with the Germans and a part of Company D set up a roadblock as planned. First Sgt. Leonard Lomell and Staff Sgt. Jack Kuhn of Company D started looking around. They found five 155- millimeter coastal guns some 300 yards inland from the road. The guns were operable and pointed directly at Utah Beach with ammunition at the ready. While Sergeant Kuhn covered, Sergeant Lomell smashed the gunsights with his rifle butt and used thermite grenades to destroy the traversing mechanisms. Two runners, Gordon Luning and Harry Fate of D Company were sent from the roadblock, by different routes, to inform Col. James Earl Rudder (commander of the Second Ranger Battalion) who immediately sent a dispatch to General Bradley : ''Mission accomplished - many casualties.'' All of this happened before H-hourx4 on D-day. For confirmation, readers may refer to Small Unit Actions, Historical Division, United States War Department and to General Order No. 28, June 20, 1944, Headquarters, First United States Army, ''Award of Distinguished Service Cross to First Sgt. Leonard G. Lomell for extraordinary heroism in destroying a machine gun nest . . . he penetrated enemy lines and discovered five 155-millimeter guns . . . and successfully destroyed them.'' The ''safety'' of those guns was very temporary and the Ranger mission was accomplished. Those Rangers who fought and bled and died on Pointe du Hoc did not do so for a cruel joke. CHARLOTTE E. LOMELL (Mrs. Leonard G. Lomell) Toms River, N.J. Bouillabaisse To the Editor: If John Vinocur ever decides to abandon his present enviable position, it seems to me he has two new career choices available: food writer or mystery writer. As I read his tantalizing article, ''Cherchez la Bouillabaisse'' (Travel, April 29), I found it evoked the work of both the late Joseph Wechsberg and Georges Simenon. I found myself once again striding around the Marseilles waterfront with Inspector Maigret on one of his infrequent trips out of Paris (although I can't recall which one). Mr. Vinocur has the same ability as Mr. Simenon to bring to life for the reader the raw vibrancy that evidently permeates Marseilles, at least for someone who has never visited the city. I was also reminded of one of Mr. Wechsberg's articles in his book, ''Blue Trout and Black Truffles,'' in which he described a visit to a restaurant in a town on the Bay of Biscay. The host restaurateur was such a purist he insisted the only true bouillabaisse was that prepared from fish caught before dawn in the bay. The soup had to be prepared immediately on return to port and eaten as soon as it was ready. I think most people would prefer to follow Mr. Vinocur's suggestions. It is to be hoped we will soon be favored with another of his articles in the Travel Section. JACQUELINE F. TEMPLE New York Polar Bears To the Editor: If Douglas Martin wants to take a real Polar Bear Express (Travel, June 3) he should take The Hudson Bay, a train run by Via Rail Canada from Winnipeg to Churchill, Manitoba. This is much more satisfactory than the Polar Bear Express, which doesn't go near polar bears and only goes to Moosonee, which doesn't have any moose. Churchill is the site of the National Geographic television documentary on polar bears; they walk right down the main street there. The Hudson Bay has sleeping cars with upper and lower berths, roomettes and bedrooms; a diner with complete meal and beverage service and a lounge with snack and beverage service. You leave Winnipeg at 5:45 P.M. on the first day, and arrive in Churchill at 7 A.M. on the third day. MICHAEL E. TSCHEEKAR Westchester, Calif. Talkeetna To the Editor: David Eames's article on the Talkeetna Roadhouse (Travel, June 3) brings back the fall of 1975, when Verna and Carroll Close ran it. It was then also a welcome place to stop on a rainy, cool evening. Mrs. Close offered little in conversation and a limited menu after dinner hours. Soup that ''most folks like,'' and three kinds of sandwich: ham, cheese, or ham and cheese. Being expansive and planning to spend the night, we ordered the combination - one thin slice each of ham and cheese, fried in Crisco, served on thick slices of heavenly home-baked bread. Breakfast was another thing. Mr. Close - in his 70's with a shock of snowy hair and arms loaded with wood he just split for the stove - enters. He feeds the fire, then starts the mountain of hashbrowns. People from far and wide troop in and are told ''not to leave any spaces'' in the row of assorted chairs lining each side of the long table.

72-> MONDALE TOUCHES ALL BASES BUT DOESN'T MANAGE TO SCORE
WASHINGTON THE selection of a running mate is traditionally a way to heal a party's wounds. But last week the process itself emerged as a potential threat to Democratic unity and Walter F. Mondale's hopes for a peaceful convention. Throughout the spring, divisions grew naturally out the primary process. But this new strain is mainly of Mr. Mondale's own making. It was the former Vice President who invited the parade of Vice Presidential aspirants, in which last week Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro of Queens, Mayor Henry Cisneros of San Antonio and Governor Martha Layne Collins of Kentucky make the trek to North Oaks, Minn. The ostensible reason was to give Mr. Mondale a chance to look over the field - seven so far. But the process has prompted intense lobbying from factions eager to influence him and may, in the end, limit his freedom of choice. In the boldest pressure tactic, the National Organization of Women passed a resolution that raised the possibility of offering a candidate from the floor if Mr. Mondale chose a running mate who, in NOW's view, lacked credentials as a feminist. Southern state chairmen pressed Mr. Mondale to pick a moderate Southerner, such as Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas. The Rev. Jesse Jackson argued that Mr. Mondale ought to consider blacks other than Mayors Wilson Goode of Philadelphia and Tom Bradley of Los Angeles, who were interviewed two weeks ago. Some party leaders saw the efforts to influence the selection process as a threat to Mr. Mondale's control of the convention and, by extension, to his effort to project an image of leadership. Governor Cuomo, Bert Lance, the Georgia party chairman, and John R. Reilly, the Mondale adviser in charge of the Vice Presidential search, were among those urging him to make an early selection before things got out of hand. Meanwhile, Mondale campaign aides were able to get a group of prominent Democratic women, who met with Mr. Mondale on Wednesday, to issue a statement suggesting that NOW has been overzealous in its efforts. This deflected the most combative pressure group, but Mondale aides were unable to tamp down the criticism that flowed from editorial pages and party councils. Some Democratic strategists worried that, by adopting the interviewing process devised by Jimmy Carter in 1976, Mr. Mondale was reminding voters of his Carter connection, which is one of his biggest liabilities. Another main theme of the criticism was acidly summarized by Senator Gary Hart of Colorado. He told the Denver Post that the make-up of the interview list suggested that the process had become ''a little bit like pandering.'' Mr. Hart, perhaps eager to sustain his own Vice Presidential prospects, later tried to explain away his remarks. But he had zeroed in on a major defect. By including blacks, womens and Hispanics, Mr. Mondale hoped to achieve what Mayor Bradley called ''an historic breakthrough'' in ticket making. But he also strengthened the perception of himself as a candidate with an irresistible urge to cater to constituency groups. Although the Vice Presidential question dominated his week, Mr. Mondale also found time to try once again to bring Mr. Jackson securely into the Democratic fold. But the civil rights leader's mood and his vision of his political future were even harder to read than usual. In a two-hour meeting with Mr. Mondale in Kansas City, he spoke of his dedication to defeating President Reagan. But he resisted suggestions that he distance himself further from Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader and Jackson supporter whose anti-Semitic remarks have disrupted efforts to solidify Democratic support among Jews. The Mondale-Jackson meeting seemed a success to some reporters and to people who sat in and a stand-off to others. Thus it underscored the problem that Mr. Jackson represents for Mr. Mondale and the Democrats. That Mr. Jackson could be a formidable force in the fall campaign no one doubts. But Mr. Mondale's advisers came away from Kansas City still worried about whether that force can be blended into a smoothly running Democratic effort. ''His middle gear is broken,'' lamented one Mondale adviser, referring to Mr. Jackson. The post-primary period has been a busy but not necessarily productive time for Mr. Mondale. The running- mate search has generated plenty of headlines and television pictures. It has also dramatized Mr. Mondale's political liabilities and frayed the party unity it was designed to promote. And the weeks of heavy publicity have not improved Mr. Mondale's standing in the polls. The New York Times/CBS News Poll last week showed him trailing Mr. Reagan by 15 points. With the approach of the convention, a week when Mr. Mondale will have the political spotlight, his task is to show that he can can convert that exposure into political gains.

76-> REGISTRATION DRIVES RESULT IN POLITICAL SHIFTS
THE 1984 election year already marked by historic firsts nationally - is producing a number of footnotes to the county's political history. During a year in which a major political party for the first time nominated a woman for Vice President and saw a black candidate seek nomination for President, there have been a series of developments that could affect the county's political structure in future years. For the first time since the 1950's, Democrats outnumber Republicans among registered Westchester voters. In addition, more people have requested absentee ballots - about 24,000 - than ever before and about 58,000 people had registered to vote between last Dec. 5 and Oct. 5, with thousands more expected to register by the end of last week. About half of the new registrants did not state a party preference. According to statistics provided by the Board of Elections, as of Aug. 13, there were 158,999 Democrats registered, 155,535 Republicans, 8,573 Conservatives, 3,112 Liberals, 1,309 Right-to-Life and 112,382 independents. The figures do not include the 25,000 people who registered during the last six weeks. Some political observers attributed the recent trends to the extensive voter-registration drives aimed at the poor and minorities. Others believe changes in the county's demographics, which show a growing number of single people and young professionals, have also contributed to the changes. But perhaps more than any other single factor, they say, is the candidacy of the Rev. Jesse Jackson, a Democrat, and the Democratic Party's nomination of Geraldine A. Ferraro as Vice President - both actions are believed to have spurred more people, especially blacks and women, to register. Although most of the voter-registration drives in the county were nonpartisan in nature, minorities and the poor have historically voted Democratic and with a significant increase in registration by minorities the Democratic Party has become the beneficiary. Thomas F. Carty, chairman of the county's Democratic Committee, said he was elated by the party's increased strength, but worried by the increasing numbers of independent voters. ''We hope to identify this large bloc of independents and try to get them to vote Democratic,'' Mr. Carty said. Whether the increase in Democratic registration will necessarily translate into more Democratic victories in the county is uncertain. There has been a large ''cross- over'' vote in the county, especially during Presidential election years. However, Mr. Carty said he was confident that the new Democratic voters would go for the Mondale-Ferraro ticket. ''I don't believe we'll lose them to cross- voting,'' he said. ''We'll lose, if we can't convince them to stay to vote for the whole ticket.'' Throughout the summer, volunteers were walking the streets, at shopping malls and libraries; unemployment offices and health centers seeking nonregistered voters and registering them. Organizations that have traditionally carried out voter-registration drives were very visible again this year, among them the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the League of Women Voters, the Urban League and the Black Women's Political Caucas. But for the first time, a joint project of the Human Service Employees, the United States Student Association and the National Student Educational Fund directed a nationwide campaign designed to add, nationally, as many as five million voters, mostly from poor and minority groups. The drive, known as ''Freedom Summer '84, was held in commemoration of the voter-registration drive in Mississippi in 1964. The earlier campaign to register blacks sparked violence in Mississippi, a state that was then the most segregated in the South. Three young civil rights workers, Andre Goodman, Michael Schwerner and James Chaney, were killed in Philadelphia, Miss., and the summer of 1964 would later become known as Freedom Summer. The 1984 drive, which began June 4 and reached a peak on Oct. 4, was unusual because it attempted to reach recipients of Government services by using the volunteer efforts of Government workers who belong to the Human Services Employees group. They registered people when the clients visited local social service agencies for food stamps, health care or unemployment compensation. More than 4,500 new voters were added to the county's rolls through the Human Serve Fund's efforts alone, according to Richard Evers, who has spent the last five months registering voters in the county for the Human Serve Fund. He said that about 75 percent of the new voters had registered as Democrats. The fund, which had set of goal of registering a million voters on Oct. 4, was awaiting the results of its nationwide campaign by midweek. But initial results were impressive. In New York City, more than 50,000 new voters were registered on Oct. 4, according to Ken Grossinger, state coordinator for the Human Serve Fund of New York. Mr. Grossinger said the results of the Freedom Summer movement challenged the theory that the lack of voter participation was the result of voter apathy. ''This clearly demonstrates that voter participation, or lack of it in New York, was not so much a question of apathy or low education, but more a question of access,'' Mr. Grossinger said. ''If opportunity is extended to them, they will register.'' The test now will be to get voters to the polls on Nov. 6. Many of the groups involved in voter registration are now beginning ''get out the vote'' drives. ''We're going to mail every new registrant a letter explaining that they have registered and ought to vote,'' Mr. Evers said. ''The focus of the follow-ups is voter education. For instance, we plan to enclose a picture of a voting machine, so people who may not be familiar with it, will be when they cast their vote.'' In addition, a number of organizations have made arrangements to provide free transportation to and from polling places for the elderly. Others plan to telephone new registrants before Election Day to remind them to vote or are arranging to have interpreters available for new voters who do not speak English or may have trouble understanding the language. With thousands of new voters, and thousands more expected, the county's Board of Elections has been working overtime for the last few weeks processing applications. ''We're 7,000 voters behind,'' Antonia D'Apice, Commissioner of Elections, said on Oct. 5, the day after the extensive statewide campaign. ''We've been averaging 1,200 new registrations a day in the past few weeks.'' ''It's been six-day work weeks,'' Mrs. D'Apice said, adding that the staff took off for Columbus Day last Monday after having worked more than 8 hours last Saturday. ''After a while you reach the point of diminishing returns. It's better to take a rest now, to face what coming.'' Mrs. D'Apice said the backlog was not because of a lack of staffing or antiquated equipment - factors cited for massive delays in New York City - but because of the last-minute ''deluge'' of registrations. She said the process was often slowed because some applications required more detailed work than just ''jotting down the name on a computer.'' ''We have to determine whether a person was ever registered before,'' she explained, by way of example. ''If a telephone number is on the application, we may have to call the person to clarify any discrepancies. A lot of times it is little things, like penmanship. Mrs. D'Apice said the County Executive's Office had ''loaned'' the Board a number of typists and word processors to help it through this busy period. ''With the additional help, we're in control of the situation,'' she concluded. ''I assure you, that everyone who has registered to vote will get a chance to vote.''

77-> CRITICS' CHOICES ;
Dance Theater Workshop is calling it ''a special dance event.'' And Cydney Wilkes's program on Wednesday at the Workshop's Bessie Sch"onberg Theater may very well be that. Miss Wilkes, who has danced with Johanna Boyce and Kei Takei, is a compelling performer who blends physical precision with a stage presence that is both veiled and poignantly open. And the new dance she will present is called, intriguingly, ''Girl Dances for Screaming Ladies'' and is set to a sound score that includes Eskimo throat songs or chanting. The program will also include ''16 Falls in Color,'' a conceptual dance with a clear plastic house for a set. You could get a whole education in dance without straying from Lincoln Center this week, given the imaginative range of dance programming offered by the free Lincoln Center Out-of-Doors Festival. The emphasis is on folk dancing (and music) today. There will be performances by the Kenneth Rinker and Rod Rodgers companies on Tuesday, representing very different kinds of modern dance. Michiyo Tanaka and Dancers follow on Wednesday, with New York's own William Carter and Gail Conrad on Thursday and Friday, respectively. The fare promises to be exotic when the Chinese American Arts Council presents ''The Magic of Chinese Theater'' on Saturday afternoon, to be followed by modern dance from Joan Miller's Dance Players. And the week will come to a close with a bang when the zany and inspired Pilobolus Dance Theater returns for a rare visit to New York that night.

81-> LATIN PLAN ON DEBTS REPORTED
The governments of four heavily indebted Latin American countries are discussing a proposal to extend repayment of their foreign debts over 15 years, according to reports here and in Bogota, Colombia. The draft proposal, circulating within the governments of Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico, would seek to repay the debt over a period of nine years after a six-year grace period. But Brazilian officials were quoted today in Rio de Janeiro as favoring a ten-year rescheduling, with a five-year grace period. The proposal would also seek a repayment schedule similar to a graduated mortgage, with smaller payments at the outset that would gradually increase, and it called for interest rates to be fixed for each country ''according to the circumstances surrounding each one and its possibilities of recovery.'' Terms More Lenient The terms of the proposal are considerably more lenient than those that have been negotiated to date by the Latin American governments with their foreign creditors. Mexican and United States officials said today that they believed that the draft, which was published by the independent Colombian news agency CIEP, would be discussed at a meeting of Latin American officials that is planned for late next month. A Mexican official said today that the proposal ''is not ours'' and had no official backing, but added, ''It does have some very interesting things in it.'' The official also said it was possible, however, that the four countries would come up with an acceptable joint economic position before the economic summit conference of the industrial countries, to be held in London early next month. A United States official in Bogota said, ''There is no doubt there's something to the draft.'' But he added that he did not know ''how closely followed or believed in it is in all parts of the Government.'' Rate Rises Cited As interest rates in the United States, including the prime rate, have risen sharply in recent weeks, the four Latin American countries been making increasingly strong statements about the need to establish repayment programs that would avoid further damage to their economies. Many of the loans carry interest rates that are adjusted to reflect changes in the prime rate. In a statement last weekend, the presidents of the four countries said democracy in the region was being ''seriously jeopardized'' by events outside their control. The statement, the first joint action by the Latin American countries to seek more favorable terms in repaying their debts, was subsequently endorsed by Peru, Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile and the Dominican Republic. The region's foreign debt stands at more than $340 billion. 'Debtors' Cartel' Feared The action raised new concern among bankers that the countries would establish a ''debtors' cartel'' to give them additional leverage, but Brazilian officials denied any such plans were in the offing. As published in Bogota, the draft also proposed that payments should be based on the export incomes of the individual countries, and that they should not absorb more than is ''compatible with the maintenance of adequate levels of internal productive activity.'' It argues that the current payment plans have turned Latin America into a ''net exporter of capital.'' The proposal also calls for sharp reductions in interest rates, as well as in the commissions paid when debts are renegotiated. It said the developed countries should accept this potential loss ''within the framework of a concerted effort intended to restore the rhythm of development of the world economy.'' The meeting next month of regional finance and foreign ministers will, in more general terms, seek a common response to rising world interest rates and related foreign debt issues, according to officials in Rio de Janeiro. Perhaps most significant, the decision to bring together finance and foreign ministers at the conference appears to reflect the growing political dimension of the debt problem, a result not only of widespread public opposition to austerity programs worked out with the International Monetary Fund, but also of the perceived threat to democracy posed by prolonged recessions. Japanese Aid for BrazilTOKYO, May 24 (AP) - Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone today of Japan offered President Joao Baptista Figueiredo of Brazil a financial package totaling $740 million to help Brazil's ailing economy. Mr. Figueiredo said he ''welcomes'' the aid package, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said.

82-> MEDICAL STUDENTS LEARN TO UNDERSTAND THE AGING
''The average doctor is just terribly indifferent,'' 89-year-old Cecilia Kemberton said to the first-year medical student seated at her side. ''They don't seem to have that sympathy , if you understand.'' She studied him intently. ''But David here, now, I think David is very sympathetic.'' Her smile seemed to fill her living room. ''He is patient, too, and a good listener - no, an intelligent listener. It is very important to remember what Shakespeare said: 'Listen much, and talk little.' '' Mrs. Kemberton did most of the talking, and the medical student, David Goodrich, did most of the listening. He did not mind. ''Often I think the listening is the most important part of what I'm doing,'' he said. Mr. Goodrich was participating in a program intended to raise medical students' consciousness about the needs, feelings, problems and strengths of older people. ''I tended to shy away from getting involved with elderly people,'' he said. ''I suppose it's the stereotype that society has of the elderly. But I've learned so much, and my viewpoint has changed completely.'' Immersion in Gerontology For the past six weeks, 19 students who have finished their first year of medical school have immersed themselves in the Gerontology Internship Program at the Cornell University Medical College in Manhattan, the teaching affiliate of the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. Staff members say the program is the first of its kind in the city and possibly in the country. Working out of five neighborhood social agencies, they have visited older people in their homes and helped them do the complicated paperwork for medical and other benefits. The students have also run errands, shopped, and helped people with check-cashing, bill-paying and banking. They have arranged medical and dental visits, and have even stood in lines for them for hours at government agencies. Most of the students' social-work clients are in their 80's, and many are what those in the field of aging call frail and disadvantaged, those whose health is vulnerable and who live on little money. The summer project was coordinated under the medical school's public-health department. ''We wanted to give medical students some exposure to old people who are not lying half- dead in hospital beds,'' said Alice Ullmann, clinical associate professor of social work in the medical college's departments of public health and medicine. ''We wanted to capture the students before they became doctors,'' she added. ''In their next year of training, the doctors will become really preoccupied with the medical aspects of their education.'' In medical school older people have often been dealt with ''in a lecture hall, and not in real life,'' said Dr. Hirsch S. Ruchlin, professor of economics in public health at the medical school and the program's co-director. ''Doctors need to change their mind-set and focus not simply on diseased organs, but on a person who exists in a social environment.'' ''And the way that mind-set can be changed,'' Professor Ullmann said, ''is for a student to form a relationship with an older person.'' Those relationships have been important to both the medical students and their clients. One of 22-year-old Cara Calvelli's clients has been Rose Sokel, who is nearly blind. The 62- year-old Miss Sokel hadn't been to a doctor in 14 years. ''We kept talking to her,'' said Miss Calvelli, who was assigned to work at the Stanley M. Isaacs Neighborhood Center on East 93d Street. ''Now Rose has agreed to have an operation for her cataracts.'' ''Then maybe I'll be able to see this little girl,'' said Miss Sokel, smiling, as the two sat on a park bench. Miss Sokel turned in the direction of a visitor. ''I think she'll make a great doctor, don't you?'' she asked. The students' help has amounted to more than companionship. ''One of the first clients I saw had a huge pile of forms on her desk, and tears in her eyes,'' said 23-year-old Benjamin Smith, a student from Manhattan. ''And she said, 'Can you help me?' ''Now, look, I have problems just balancing my own checking account - but I waded in, and soon it got so I had memorized the telephone numbers at Medicare Part A and Part B. Now when I call, before I can say my name they say, 'Oh, hello, it's you, Benjamin.' '' As part of the internship, the students have also participated in weekly seminars and discussion groups with medical school faculty members and other expert guests. The students each received a stipend of $1,500 for the six-week program, money from the Isaac H. Tuttle Fund and the New York Community Trust. Agencies participating in the program include not only the Stanley M. Isaacs Center but also the Burden Center for the Aging on East 85th Street, the Lenox Hill Neighborhood Association on East 70th Street, Search and Care Inc. on East 88th Street, and the Goddard-Riverside Community Center on Columbus Avenue on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Praise for the Agencies ''The agencies deserve the credit for making the program work,'' said Professor Ullmann. ''They've created a situation where the students are truly able to help their clients. And I think those in the agencies have the feeling they have contributed to the students' medical education in a real way.'' The students did not approach their clients specifically as doctors in training. ''We played down the fact that we were medical students,'' said 23-year-old Steven Kaplan, one of the students. ''We couldn't help with their medical questions anyway. As a result, I found myself looking at things from the patient's point of view.'' ''Just explaining is so important,'' said 21-year-old Elizabeth Zeidman, another of the students. ''If I hadn't gone with one woman on a CAT scan and explained the whole procedure to her, she'd have just left.'' Changing the Quality of Life Much of medical education, said Mr. Goodrich, ''is based on the acute- care model.'' He added: ''But the elderly are dealing with chronic problems where there is no 'magic bullet.' Perhaps doctors can't cure chronic problems, but they can really change patients' quality of life.'' Professor Ullmann is not trying to give students ''unrealistically positive experiences,'' she said, adding, ''Some of this has been quite frustrating and depressing for the students.'' Mr. Goodrich agreed: ''Some of the experience has been unpleasant. No one likes growing old, and you can't help but share their sadness.'' Nevertheless, the medical students said it would be hard for them to leave many of their clients. ''I'm going to keep involved,'' Mr. Goodrich said of Mrs. Kemberton, an educator who founded a women's liberal-arts college. She is a ready source of amusing stories - including the way she once gave Ziegfield girls tips about how to be proper social hostesses. ''We've become very attached,'' Mr. Goodrich said.

Olvier Bernier's most recent book is ''Louis the Beloved, the Life of Louis XV'' (Doubleday). A ferocious horde of exotic warriors covered with jewels but armed with the finest weapons; a small wall-girt city, the outpost of Western civilization on the Danube: It was the stuff from which epics are made. And when in 1683 the Turkish army, sweeping in from the East, sat down to besiege Vienna, it was the very survival of Europe that seemed at stake. From everywhere, volunteers rushed to join Emperor Leopold I's army, but among that often flashy crowd, no one had more ardor, more intelligence or a better understanding of strategy than a former Frenchman, Eug ene de Savoie-Carignan. Prince Eugene, as he was later called, was the son of a rather stodgy prince of Savoy and the dashing Olympia Mancini, the boldest of Cardinal Mazarin's nieces. He was raised at the French court, and destined for the church; but when, in his teens, he decided that war was what really attracted him, he asked Louis XIV for a regiment. The King refused, so the young man went off to join the Imperial army before Vienna. Austria thus gained not only one of the greatest generals of the age but also the builder of its first Baroque palace, the Belvedere. In fact, if today Vienna is still in part a Baroque city, it is largely thanks to Prince Eugene. As he pushed the Turkish armies farther and farther away, it became clear that Vienna was at long last secure, and many of the great families - among them the Liechtensteins, the Schwarzenbergs and the Kinskys - felt safe enough to leave the enclosure of the city's narrow walls. They immediately started to build in the suburbs, and again, it was Prince Eugene who led the way. In 1699, the year of the Peace of Karlovich, he bought a large tract of land sloping down from a gentle hill; he then sent for Dominique Girard, a French landscape architect and one of Len^otre's pupils. The result was a formal garden, which remains in the heart of today's Vienna, with straight avenues of carefully pruned trees, ornamental sculptures and grand allegorical fountains, reminiscent of nothing so much as Versailles. When he came to build himself a palace, Prince Eugene also knew just what he wanted: something as close to the Sun King's great hive as possible. He chose a local architect of genius, Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt, and what he got was the finest achievement of the new Viennese architecture. The key word here is Viennese. Hildebrandt, far from copying Versailles, produced an ensemble that embodied bold new principles: While Versailles, huge and solemn, utterly dominates its surroundings, the Belvedere is defined by the two buildings that face each other across the great formal garden. In a stroke of genius, Hildebrandt made them different, yet harmonious. The Lower Belvedere, at the foot of the hill, is a long, low building whose central portion rises up to create one huge reception room, while its single-story wings look like nothing so much as an extended garden pavilion. The Upper Belvedere, at the top of the hill, is the kind of castle one expects to find in the Brothers Grimm, a tall, wide, white stucco building flanked and bracketed by octagonal wings with a strong, forward-moving center adorned with columns and balconies, all crowned with green copper roofs and enlivened with red window- frames. Cheerful and dignified, the Upper Belvedere defines the courtly atmosphere in which its colleague across the way plays the role of a charming country retreat. Nothing could be more typical of the city and the Austrian monarchy than this blend of the awesome and the amiable; and thanks to Hildebrandt's flair, nothing could be more successful. The Upper Belvedere, today a museum of modern art, was completed in 1723 and unfortunately remodeled in the 19th century. The grand staircase remains, however, with its early-Rococo stuccoed ceiling and supporting figures of straining athletes. So does the two-story central salon with its heavy pilasters, gilt-bronze capitals and lumpy mythological ceiling - the proof that, indoors at least, it did not pay to imitate Versailles. In the Lower Belvedere, an enchanting suite of rooms has been preserved. There is the great central hall, the Marmorsaal, with its white and maroon carved marble frames, trompe l'oeil architectural views, vases of flowers and putti. Two stories high, it is an undoubtedly formal space but, unlike its equivalent in the Upper Belvedere, it is also oddly inviting, a room playing at being awesome. In a side wing, a suite of three rooms shows us the house as it was when Prince Eugene lived there. A corner salon is entirely frescoed with birds, flowers and grotesques; this leads into a long gallery whose wide French windows open onto the park. The lush and the simple unite to create an impression of coolness and openness: The floor is laid with white marble while maroon marble frames, pilasters and niches set up a formal decorative scheme; the walls and ceiling, stuccoed in white on white already hint at the grace of the Rococo. The last room is dazzling, with tall mirrors set between golden walls on which rich bouquets of flowers and grotesques have been painted in warm colors while at regular intervals carved plinths support pieces of Chinese porcelain. The gold is endlessly reflected in the mirrors, creating a series of apparently limitless spaces - yet, far from being overwhelming, this Goldkabinett merely creates a feeling of mellow and welcoming splendor. The Emperor Joseph I also longed for a Versailles of his very own and asked his favorite architect, Johann Bernard Fischer von Erlach, to design a country palace. Fischer complied on a scale which struck terror into the heart of his patron, and no wonder: The proposed building could have contained Versailles several times over. After a moment of panic, however, the Emperor asserted himself, and told Fischer to come up with something smaller. The new plan was much more reasonable but even then it was never built, and it was only in the 1740's that the young Empress Maria Theresa saw to the construction of Sch"onbrunn Palace. Fischer's design was substantially modified: The advancing lateral wings, the rhythm of curved and square windows, the giant pilasters are still his, but the roofline, shorn of its proposed statues, sports a simple balustrade. Balconies break up the facade, while the central pavilion marches forth amiably, reaching out to the courtyard by a sweeping double staircase. The final effect is impressive but not overwhelming, a feeling reinforced by the cheerful yellow of the stucco. Here, indeed, is the true Austrian Baroque, a style in which French and Italian influences merge to produce a look both grand and inviting. The Baroque put its stamp on many another building. From the library wing of the Hofburg to the Liechtenstein Gartenpalais, from the Chancellery to the Palais Lobkowitz, every turn of Vienna's narrow streets brings us before yet another proof of the style's conviviality. And then, of course, there are the churches. The most impressive and, at first sight, the oddest of these is the Karlskirche. Designed in 1713 by Fischer von Erlach at the order of Emperor Charles VI, it is nothing so much as the most successful piece of trompe l'oeil ever devised. Since the Emperor's dignity required the most imposing of buildings - while his finances demanded something the size of a small hut - Fischer produced a truly awesome scheme: An enormous portico, complete with pediment and sculpture, is flanked by adaptations of Trajan's column carved, in a continuous band, with the story of Charles VI's triumphs and topped by little tempietti. On either side, a curved wing leads to a three- story pavilion set upon a monumental archway. The height of the building is imposing, made even more so by the apparently enormous dome that soars over the church. A careful look, however, will reveal that all is illusion: The dome, which is really quite small, only looks huge because we are led by the grand, formal facade to expect it to rise from the back of a very long nave; but, in fact, since the ground-plan consists of a simple oval, the dome is really set just behind the portico, and would not seem big at all if only we realized how close to us it is. We not unreasonably expect the interior of the church to be as wide as its facade, but when we enter it we discover that the facade, except for its very center, is no more than a screen. The actual interior space is small, made lively, intimate and warm by its curved shape and Rococo decorations. It is the genius of the Austrian Baroque that, with a limited number of simple forms, it can create an apparently endless series of illusions. The Peterskirche, just off the Graben, is a good example of this. Built by Hildebrandt in 1702 to an oval plan, its interior is dominated by a huge oval dome within which Rottmayr's frescoes create more movement and excitement than most of us see in a lifetime. On the walls, colored marbles highlighted with gilt lead the eye to the side chapels with their twisting columns. Wherever we look, color and motion greet our eye. Entrancing as all this may be, there is an even easier way to immerse ourselves in the world of 18th-century Vienna. Near the Belvedere rises the Palais Schwarzenberg, designed by Fischer, Hildebrant and others. Begun in 1716, it has kept its lush design, its 19-acre garden and its gilded, frescoed salons. It is now a hotel where, for the (fairly steep) cost of a room, we can live in one of the city's great monuments, wander through its marbled, mirrored galleries and feel that when Vienna finally burst forth into the age of display, it also showed us that life could grand and highly comfortable at the same time. Grand Hotels A Venerable Quartet IMPERIAL HOTEL, 16 K"artner Ring (telephone: 65-17-65), an antique-filled, converted 19th-century palace, is two blocks from the Vienna State Opera and one block from the Musikverein; the concierge and ticket agent are particularly adept at securing tickets for performances and galas at either establishment. Double rooms are about $150; the royal suites, with three or four bedrooms, sitting rooms and painted ceilings, can run up to $2,000 a day. HOTEL BRISTOL, 1 K"artner Ring (52-95-52) is another former 19th-century palace with touches of art nouveau and Biedermeier furnishings in most of the bedrooms. Double rooms are $104 to $144 for two, about $325 for a suite with two bedrooms and a salon. HOTEL SACHER, 4 Philharmonikerstrasse (52-55-75), just behind the State Opera, is decorated with antiques, oil paintings and sculptures; the dining room has red silk brocade walls. Doubles are $140 to $150; suites range from about $300 to $450 a night, for the largest available, with two bedrooms and a salon. HOTEL IM PALAIS SCHWARZENBERG, 9 Schwarzenbergplatz (78-45-15), is installed in a wing of an 18th-century Baroque palace with gardens and mirrored galleries. There are only 44 rooms; reserve well in advance. Rates vary with the season; doubles average about $165. All of the hotels have restaurants with Viennese specialties; that of the Hotel im Palais Schwarzenberg has been awarded a Michelin star for its version of Viennese nouvelle cuisine, with seasonal game preparations a specialty. Dinner for two, with wine, is about $80.

87-> BIG LOSERS UNDER PLAN COULD BE SHAREHOLDERS
The biggest losers under the Federal rescue plan for the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company will probably be the bank's shareholders, who could ultimately find their stake virtually wiped out. Depositors and creditors, including bondholders, are not endangered by the plan. But stockholders, whose chance to reap substantial investment rewards is always offset by the risk of complete loss, were given no protection. Shareholders were, however, given an option to buy special new shares of the restructured Continental, which would be unencumbered by a huge portfolio of problem loans. But analysts said such an investment would be highly speculative and require shareholders to put up additional money for the opportunity. An Immediate Reduction Under the plan, current stockholders would have their interest in the bank holding company immediately cut to 20 percent, reflecting the 80 percent equity stake the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation will claim as part of its rescue package. In addition, their shares, which traded for as much as $26 each as recently as last year, could be worth as little as one-thousandth of one cent if F.D.I.C. losses on Continental's problem loan portfolio run above a certain level. This would mean that an investor who bought 1,000 shares of Continental last year at $26 each could find the $26,000 investment worth as little as one penny. The alternative, however, ''is far worse,'' said Continental's outgoing chairman, David G. Taylor. If stockholders fail to approve the plan next month at a special meeting, he said, the F.D.I.C. would declare the bank insolvent, a move that would wipe out stockholder equity and eliminate any chance for shareholders to profit from a turnaround. Indeed, speculators bid up the price of Continental stock yesterday on what analysts said was the prospect that the F.D.I.C. loan losses would not end up so large that they would wipe out stockholders and that options to buy stock in the new Continental would prove of significant value. In trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Continental's shares rose 87.5 cents, to $3.75. F.D.I.C. Option If the F.D.I.C. cannot collect on at least $2.7 billion of the bank's problem loans during the next five years, it could buy out the 40 million shares now outstanding for one-thousandth of one cent each. Moreover, some investors appeared to be enticed by the opportunity being offered to Continental shareholders to buy ''rights'' to buy special new shares at an exercise price of $4.50 a share during the first 60 days of the restructuring, and $6 in the following 22 months. Lawrence Cohn, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said the restructured bank should be ''pretty profitable'' because it will have a huge capital base and virtually no nonperforming loans. But he warned that the stock rights were a speculative investment and difficult to value. Continental employees will also be among the losers in the bailout plan. Staff reductions are considered imminent, but how many of the 11,000 employees would be let go ''is difficult to forecast,'' Mr. Taylor said.

88-> PEKING MAKES FRANK FILM FOR CHINA ON HONG KONG
A new documentary color film that will open here next month starts with a look at Hong Kong's British past and ends with a glimpse of its future - a red flag fluttering against the backdrop of the colony's skyscrapers to the rousing strains of a patriotic song, ''Heart of the Chinese Nation.'' For an hour and a half, the movie offers the fullest and most candid look at Hong Kong that has been allowed to mainland Chinese. Called ''One Hundred Days in Hong Kong,'' it was prepared in anticipation of the Chinese- British joint declaration initialed Wednesday that will return the British colony to Chinese rule in 1997. In the film, which a Chinese crew spent about 100 days shooting last year, Hong Kong is presented as a city beset with social ailments and inequities but also charged with an invigorating work ethic and vibrant affluence. The film is part of an effort by Peking to prepare the Chinese people for the return of Hong Kong in less than 13 years. Not many years ago, the colony was disparaged and accused of capitalist exploitation and bourgeois decadence. The Government is now trying to explain why Hong Kong is being allowed to retain its old habits, which conflict sharply with the Communist system of the mainland. Anticipating the Questions Major Chinese newspapers printed the text of the joint declaration, which says that the disparities between Hong Kong and the mainland will be tolerated for 50 years after China regains sovereignty. On Friday, People's Daily tried to anticipate awkward questions in a point-by-point commentary on the agreement. It noted that Article 31 of China's Constitution permits special administrative regions, such as Hong Kong will become. The newspaper said that status would have no effect on the nature of the country. While Article 33 of the Constitution declares that all Chinese citizens are equal before the law, the Communist Party newspaper said, this does not mean that all laws are equal. Legislation can differ depending on the area, situation and people, it said. The Chinese leaders are counting on the people to accept such logic and to view Hong Kong with national pride rather than envy. Explanations of the new policy on Hong Kong to officials at lower levels have reportedly already begun. ''I think people will understand,'' a senior Chinese journalist said. ''They know that Hong Kong is a problem left over from history with its own special characteristics.'' In the documentary, Hong Kong is a place where people dress colorfully, live jammed together amid spectacular high-rise buildings and lead a frenetic life. Problems Are Shown The film details Hong Kong's problems, from crowded tenements and traffic accidents to crime and drug addiction, to make clear that the territory is not the paradise that some Chinese imagine. Few Westerners are apparent except for some bargain-hunting tourists and a plump blonde woman being pulled in a rickshaw. Nothing is said about Hong Kong's Chinese millionaires. The interviews come from the working class. They include a bus driver whose wife sews at home to make ends meet, a fisherman living on his cramped boat and a 15-year-old drug addict undergoing therapy. But the film has gone beyond Marxist stereotypes to suggest that mainland Chinese can learn from the diligence and enterprise of Hong Kong. One man is shown running a flourishing shoe factory with his family. At a printing shop, the narration explains that the boss does the work. Life in Hong Kong is tense, and time and money are valuable, it goes on to say. To prove the point, there are shots of people gulping down fast food and of hectic trading at the stock market. The film also visits Hong Kong's automated subway system and its bustling container terminal. It lingers over the displays of electronic goods in a store and freshly baked buns in a bakery. The narration explains that in Hong Kong's markets, things are fresh and the service is good. They often are not in China's state-run stores. But the audience is shown that the mainland supplies most of Hong Kong's produce. Director Wanted Realism The director, Gao Zhongming, said in an interview that he wanted to give Chinese a realistic picture. ''During our three month's stay in Hong Kong,'' he said, ''we tried to put into film all of the things that we saw and let the audience arrive at a decision about what kind of a place Hong Kong is.'' Mr. Gao said he went to Hong Kong in August 1983 with two cameramen and a sound technician. After their three months there, two months were spent editing the footage from about nine hours to an hour and a half. The film avoids the questions about Hong Kong's future that tied up British and Chinese negotiators for two years. And the visitors did not try to interview Hong Kong government officials or ethnic Chinese members of its unofficial legislature. ''At that time, we did not think we should talk to them,'' Mr. Gao said. There are some inevitable references to colonialist shackles, but curiosity about Hong Kong's achievements has set the film above the usual bland travelogues shown in China. ''I don't know what Chinese audiences will think, but this film will provide examples for people to modernize China,'' Mr. Gao said.

90-> LETTERS TO THE CONNECTICUT EDITOR
No Such Thing As Too Many Swans What is the magic number that suddenly creates an ''overpopulation'' of mute swans as mentioned in the article, ''State Studies Swan Population'' (Aug. 12). Who decides this magic number, and why? The State Department of Environmental Protection, of course, which publicized its four-year study of mute swans in Connecticut with the goal of a ''swan management plan.'' D.E.P. biologist Gregory Chasko claims that Connecticut's swan population hovers around 1,400 and that ''if you plot the numbers, there's definitely an ascending curve.'' The fact is, the D.E.P.'s own bird counts show that the mute swan population is decreasing. In a September 1982 letter to our office from D.E.P. Commissioner Stanley J. Pac, the official swan count was 1,827. Therefore, in the last two years, the swan population has descended at a rate of 23.4 percent while swans have remained on the protected list. Wildlife populations are self-regulating and don't require ''management'' by bureaucratic agencies. Mute swans, unlike other waterfowl, apparently don't migrate across state lines and therefore do not come under Federal Fish and Wildlife Service jurisdiction. They are, instead, a state responsibility - that means the State Department of Environmental Protection. In 1980, this public agency, charged with protecting wildlife, started mounting a campaign to soften the public to the idea of controlling and possibly hunting our state's magnificent wild mute swans. D.E.P. officials began declaring in news articles that the so-called ''overpopulation'' of mute swans was creating ''problems,'' that the swans are ''aggressive'' and ''dangerous,'' and that the D.E.P. was getting great numbers of ''complaints'' about the swans. Friends of Animals wrote and asked the D.E.P. for a detailed list of the specific complaints it had received. For one year (July 1979 through June 1980), the D.E.P. listed 42. Of the total 42 ''complaints,'' 31 were reports about injuries inflicted on the swans by people. This is how the D.E.P. creates justification for management, for controls, for hunting. The D.E.P. has too long represented solely the interests of hunters who are about 5 percent of our population. But hunters claim that mute swans destroy the food and habitat of some of their favorite targets - ducks - driving them away from hunting grounds. So the D.E.P.'s Gregory Chasko circulates press stories about how ''aggressive'' the swans are. Indeed, these birds will defend their nests and young from harassment by people in just the same way that human parents would. D.E.P. biologists should be educating the public to enjoy these magnificent birds - and to leave them alone when that is what the birds need. Instead, the D.E.P. uses these birds' natural instincts to build a case that they're ''dangerous.'' Friends of Animals believes that there are never too many mute swans. We believe the majority of Connecticut residents feel that way. We urge them to write to D.E.P. Commissioner Stanley Pac to insist that mute swans be kept on the protected list, that is, protected by law from hunting, harassment or tampering with their nests.

92-> IN HOUSTON, TEXANS TAKE ON A BEER WITH HALF THE PUNCH
The state of Texas seems to have been fashioned by nature as the perfect place for beer drinkers. Big, brawny and sunburned, it is the only state, according to Texans, that has no law forbidding drivers to have an open beverage at hand. The image of the urban cowboy behind the wheel of a pickup truck with a gun rack in the back and a six-pack of long-necked bottles iced down in the front is more than a Hollywood fantasy. Texas is second only to California in the amount of beer it puts away, and it is thus no surprise that it is among the nation's hottest test markets for new beers. In Houston Thursday, the Stroh Brewery Company, the nation's third-biggest brewer, started distributing its newest beer, a brand called Schaefer L.A. The initials stand for low alcohol; the beer has half the alcohol content of regular beer, 1.8 percent as against 3.6 for regular Schaefer. 'The Biggest Light-Beer State' A low alcohol beer in macho Texas? Indeed, says John Bissell, the gray-suited marketing vice president for Stroh Brewery. A lot of those cowboys in the pickup trucks with the oversize tires, chrome running lights and bumper stickers that proclaim ''Oilfield Trash and Proud of It'' are actually drinkers of light beer, the kind lower in calories, and the same sort of people who would drink a beer with half the alcohol taken out. ''Texas is by far the biggest light-beer state in the country,'' said Mr. Bissell, whose market analysis showed that while about 17 percent of the beer sold nationally falls in the ''light'' category, Texans drink nearly twice as much, about 30 percent. No one seems quite sure why two-fisted Texans seem to like low- calorie beer, but Mr. Bissell suggests one reason is they drink a lot of it: heavier beers tend to blunt a man's thirst, not quench it. Coors a Western Standby Too, Westerners have traditionally favored light-flavored beers. Coors, a Western standby that went national only under duress, is positively airy by Eastern standards, and brisk-selling Lone Star Light delivers only an anemic 68 calories. Who needs a fat cowboy? Or cowgirl? Sixty percent of light beer drinkers are women. ''Although we don't know where the L.A. business is actually going to come from,'' Mr. Bissell said, ''we believe they are the same people, those who are concerned with fitness and health and those considerations.'' The L.A. designation is in dispute. Anheuser-Busch, which entered the low alcohol market earlier, called its beer L.A. and challenged Stroh's label in court. The suit is pending. Six-Pack Is a Warm-Up Mr. Bissell, sipping the low-alcohol brew out of the can, mentioned another reason a low-alcohol beer might go over well in Texas, where a six-pack is but a warm-up for serious work on a hot day. ''Part of it is that it reduces some of the worries about drinking too much, especially if you're going to drive or something like that,'' he said. ''The really devoted beer drinker, we think, will drink this occasionally because it's a way to say, 'Normally I'd have to stop, but I can have another couple of these.' It's part of Texas.'' Schaefer's slogan, he noted, is, ''The one beer to have when you're having more than one.'' Mr. Bissell does not think Schaefer will run into image problems with a low-alcohol beer. ''It has been a big thing in Australia for some time now,'' he said, ''and nobody down there is a sissy.''

93-> LETTERS; Bike Touring
To the Editor: I limped up the steps into the house and very carefully settled in the easy chair, so as not to further insult an area already sorely challenged. You see I had just completed a two-day guided bicycle tour through the area featured in your article, ''What's Doing in the Connecticut River Valley'' (Travel, Aug. 19). My tour, a roundabout for beginners and intermediates organized by Vermont Bicycle Touring of Bristol, Vt., was based in Lyme, N.H. at the Loch Lyme Lodge (1784), which had a beautiful lake setting, rustic cottages, and meals that were both plentiful and wholesome. The multitalented leaders of my tour led us in early morning stretching exercises, fine-tuned our bicycles (both those who brought their own and those who rented bikes from the tour operator), taught us bicycle touring techniques, and coaxed and cheered us up hills we had never imagined conquering. They were also there to make minor repairs throughout the trip, as well as to direct us to the best general stores, picnic places and restrooms. The 20 or so congenial people on my tour - singles, couples, families - were of varying degrees of skill and fitness. JOYCE D. YAFFEE, Reading, Mass.

94-> COSMOS DEFEAT JUVENTUS, 2-1
Giuseppe Damiani of Italy and Wladyslaw Smuda of Poland, both of whom are coveted by the Cosmos, made special appearances here tonight as guests of the Cosmos in their 2-1 victory over Juventus. Smuda played the whole game, and Damiani was replaced by Dragan Vujovic in the 57th minute. The Cosmos want to sign both Damiani and Smuda to regular contracts. But the team may have difficulty getting the two stars as a result of the latest collective bargaining agreement with the players union. ''We want the two players,'' Giorgio Chinaglia, the president of the Cosmos, said. ''Some people in the league talk about rules and regulations. I'm talking about survival.'' Chinaglia, who took control of the Cosmos from Warner Communications July 25, said he was particularly pleased that his first home game as president of the Cosmos was a victory against one of the world's premier teams. Moyers and Davis Score The Cosmos were slightly better than Juventus, the champions of Italy for 21 years, including this season. Steve Moyers opened the scoring in the eighth minute, and Rick Davis scored the winner on a penalty kick with five minutes left after Claudio Prandelli had tied it for Juventus in the 51st minute. Davis has signed two 15-day contracts with the Cosmos. In his first game back since he left for the St. Louis Steamers of the Major Indoor Soccer League, Davis got a rousing ovation from the crowd of 36,724. He played the entire game. ''All three players did well for us and we're determined to sign them to long-term contracts,'' said Peppe Pinton, the general manager of the Cosmos. ''Giorgio wants to sign them and he should not be denied that right.'' The three-year agreement that was signed in April stipulates that each team in the league is allowed two new foreign players in the next three years. Ted Howard, the executive director of operations for the North American Soccer League, said he would meet with Pinton to discuss the ramifications of signing two foreign players at this time. Won't 'Cripple' Cosmos Pinton said the present ownership of the Cosmos was not involved with the league when it signed the agreement with the players union. He said the Cosmos would not do what is dictated to them by other teams in the league. ''The league must understand the Cosmos will take a leadership role, not what Tulsa or Minnesota want,'' Pinton said. ''We can't cripple the franchise. The league has been telling me we can sign only one player. These two players are very good and they're so inexpensive.'' Chinaglia and Pinton said the Cosmos would not have to pay a transfer fee for Damiani and Smuda. They said Damiani had been promised his transfer by A. C. Milan at no cost to the Cosmos, while Smuda, who played for Verona in the Italian League last year, was a free agent. ''These two players are much better than some of the players we have now, and they'll cost us much less to have them on the team,'' Pinton said. Damiani confirmed after the game that he could come to the Cosmos at no cost for a transfer fee. He said he was looking forward to joing the Cosmos, but emphasized he was not interested in playing indoors, which is what the Cosmos want to do in the winter. ''He's a good player,'' Chinaglia said about Damiani. ''He's got a good reputation in Italy, and I thought he also did well when he played here with the world all-stars.'' Damiani, 34 years old, was one of the forwards in a selection of stars from around the world that defeated the Cosmos, 3-1, here last month. Smuda is a 29-year-old member of the national team of Poland.

95-> FOOD; SORREL'S SWEET SOURNESS
IN MY YEARS AS A FOOD writer, I have witnessed a remarkable broadening of taste in the American palate, especially when it comes to herbs. When I first began my career, basil was an all but unknown quantity in this country, and then along came pesto sauce. Shallots, fresh thyme and tarragon once seemed almost too ''fancy'' for native taste. Today, of course, it is not at all uncommon to see fresh coriander leaves and the excellent Italian green known as arugula in markets that deal in fresh produce. Still, I am amused to think that this nation is by and large unfamiliar with one of the most easily cultivated and tastiest herbs - sorrel or sour grass. It is, as the latter name implies, quite pleasantly acid in flavor; the word sorrel derives from an old Teutonic word meaning sour. It is said that the ancient Romans consumed a great deal of sorrel because it offset the richness of their daily diet. In thumbing through books on herbs, I turned to one of my favorites, ''Herbal Delights,'' written by Mrs. C. F. Leyel and published in London more than 40 years ago. In it, she notes that sorrel symbolizes affection in spite of its sour nature. Sorrel is usually available until early fall. Salmon with sorrel sauce 1/4pound fresh sorrel 1 1/2pounds skinless, boneless salmon fillets, skin and bones reserved 2tablespoons finely chopped shallots 1/2cup dry white wine 1/2cup finely chopped tomatoes 1cup heavy cream 2tablespoons butter 1/2cup cubed, skinless, seedless tomato flesh Salt to taste, if desired Freshly ground pepper to taste 2tablespoons finely chopped parsley. 1. *Pick over the sorrel. Discard any tough stems and blemished leaves. Rinse the leaves and pat them dry. Pack the leaves closely and cut them crosswise into very thin strips. This is called a chiffonade . There should be about two cups or slightly more when loosely packed. 2. *If there are any bones in the fillets, carefully remove them with pliers. Cut the fillets on the bias into about 14 thin slices. 3. *Put the reserved fish skin and bones in a small saucepan. Add one tablespoon of the shallots, the wine and chopped tomatoes. Bring to the boil and let simmer five minutes. Add the cream and cook about five minutes. Strain through a fine sieve, pushing the solids with a rubber spatula to extract as much liquid as possible. There should be about one and one-quarter cups. 4. *Heat one tablespoon of the butter in a saucepan and add the remaining one tablespoon of shallots. Cook briefly and add the sorrel. Cook, stirring, until wilted. 5. *Add the cream mixture, the cubed tomato flesh, salt and pepper. 6. *Heat the remaining tablespoon of butter in a stick-proof skillet. Sprinkle the salmon with salt and pepper and place, a few pieces at a time, in one layer in the skillet. Cook one and one-half to two minutes, depending on the thickness of the slices, turning once. 7. *Pour the sorrel sauce into the center of a warm platter and smooth it over. As the salmon pieces are cooked, arrange them neatly, slightly overlapping, on the sauce. Sprinkle with parsley. Serve immediately. Yield: Four to six servings. Chicken with sorrel sauce 1/4pound fresh sorrel 2whole skinless, boneless chicken breasts, each split lengthwise in half Salt to taste, if desired Freshly ground pepper to taste 1/2pound fresh mushrooms, thinly sliced, about 3 cups 3tablespoons butter 1tablespoon finely chopped shallots 1/2cup heavy cream 1/8teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg. 1. *Pick over the sorrel. Discard any tough stems and blemished leaves. Rinse the leaves and pat them dry. Pack the leaves closely and cut them crosswise into very thin strips. This is called a chiffonade . There should be about two cups or slightly more when loosely packed. 2. *Pat the chicken breast halves lightly with a flat mallet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. 3. *Prepare the mushrooms and set them aside. 4. *Heat one tablespoon of the butter in a saucepan and add the shallots. Cook briefly, stirring, and add the mushrooms. Cook until the mushrooms give up their liquid and the liquid evaporates. Add the sorrel and cook, stirring, until the sorrel wilts. Add the cream, nutmeg, salt and pepper. Cook about two minutes. Set aside. 5. *Heat the remaining two tablespoons of butter in a heavy skillet and add the chicken breast pieces. Cook, turning the pieces occasionally, until cooked through, about six to eight minutes. 6. *Pour the sorrel sauce into a heat- proof dish and bring to the boil, stirring. Arrange the chicken pieces on top. Spoon the sauce over the chicken and serve. Yield: Four servings. Sorrel and buttermilk soup 1/4pound fresh sorrel 3cups fresh or canned chicken broth 3egg yolks 1/2cup heavy cream 1/8teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg Salt to taste, if desired Freshly ground pepper to taste 2cups buttermilk. 1. *Pick over the sorrel. Discard any tough stems and blemished leaves. Rinse the leaves and pat them dry. Pack the leaves closely and cut them crosswise into very thin strips. This is called a chiffonade . There should be about two cups or slightly more when loosely packed. 2. *Bring the broth to the boil and remove it from the heat. Set aside. Do not let the broth cool for an extended period. 3. *Put the yolks in a saucepan and add the cream, nutmeg, salt and pepper. Beat briskly with a wire whisk and pour in the hot broth, beating constantly. 4. *Place the saucepan on the stove and heat briefly, stirring with a wooden spoon. Bring the mixture barely to the simmer and remove immediately from the heat. Do not let the mixture boil or it will curdle. Immediately pour the mixture into a mixing bowl to prevent further cooking from retained heat. 5. *Pour in the buttermilk and stir. Let cool. Chill thoroughly. Add the sorrel. Pour the soup into the container of a food processor or electric blender and blend. Serve. Yield: Four to six servings. Poached eggs with sorrel sauce 1/4pound fresh sorrel 4tablespoons butter 2tablespoons flour 2cups fresh or canned chicken broth 1cup heavy cream Salt to taste, if desired Freshly ground pepper to taste 1/8teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg Pinch of cayenne 8cups water 2tablespoons white-wine vinegar 8eggs, at room temperature 8thin slices white sandwich bread. 1. *Pick over the sorrel. Discard any tough stems and blemished leaves. Rinse the leaves and pat them dry. Pack the leaves closely and cut them crosswise into very thin strips. This is called a chiffonade . There should be about two cups or slightly more when loosely packed. 2. *Heat one tablespoon of the butter in a saucepan and, using a wire whisk, stir in the flour. When blended, add the broth, stirring rapidly with the whisk. Let simmer about 10 minutes or until reduced to about one and one-quarter cups. Stir in the cream, salt and pepper and bring to the boil. Let simmer about five minutes or until reduced to one and three-quarter cups. 3. *Meanwhile, heat one tablespoon of butter in a saucepan and add the sorrel. Stir until the sorrel is wilted and remove from the heat. 4. *Scrape the sorrel mixture into the sauce. Stir in the nutmeg and cayenne. 5. *Bring the water to the boil in a saucepan or deep skillet and add the vinegar. Carefully break the eggs into the simmering liquid, keeping them separate.

96-> POLITICS; DEMOCRATS JOIN BEHIND JUDGES
PROMINENT Democrats from outside Long Island as well as Island Democrats and some Republicans have joined in the effort to elect two Nassau Democratic judges who were denied bipartisan endorsement by the Republicans. The decision by Nassau and Suffolk Republicans to withhold the usual bipartisan endorsement for the two judges seeking re-election could give the Republican a clean sweep of judicial offices in the two counties in the November election. The Democratic jurists considered vulnerable are County Court Judge Alfred Samenga and Family Court Judge Marilyn Friedenberg, both of Nassau. Another Democrat, Supreme Court Justice Frank P. DeLuca of Suffolk, who is running in both counties, has also been denied renomination by the Republicans, but the independent group has not involved itself in his campaign. A $100-a-person fund-raiser for Judges Samenga and Friedenberg tomorrow evening at the Nassau Bar Association headquarters in Mineola has among its sponsors Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Lieut. Gov. Alfred B. DelBello and Jonathan B. Bingham, the former Bronx member of the House of Representatives. Such high-ranking figures are not usually involved in judicial elections. Long Island sponsors of the fund raiser include Rocco Campanero, president of the Long Island Federation of Labor, and several former judges - Charles Margett, Mario Pittone, Joseph A. Suozzi and Elizabeth Bass Goulding. John F. English, one of the Island's leading attorneys and a former Nassau Democratic chairman, has been a key figure organizing the campaign for Judges Samenga and Friedenberg. However, the independent committee is not supporting Justice DeLuca, who was publicly admonished in July by the State Commission on Judicial Conduct for intervening in a criminal case by meeting the sentencing judge in an automobile on the Long Island Expressway. ''We haven't taken a position on that,'' said Mr. English of the Supreme Court contest. Joseph N. Mondello, the Nassau Republican chairman, broke the tradition of bipartisan endorsement for competent sitting judges, saying that the voters should have a choice. Privately, Nassau Republicans said that Republilcan leaders saw the opportunity to win three judgeships in two counties dominated by Republicans. William M. Blake, the Suffolk Republican chairman, went along with Mr. Mondello in the case of Justice DeLuca. Both Democrats and Republicans agreed that a sweep of the Island by President Reagan could influence the judicial races. Mr. English said that Judges Samenga and Friedenberg ''have a pretty good chance unless there is a Republican landslide.'' He pointed to the endorsement of the two Democrats by the Conservative and Liberal Parties. President Reagan will also be at the top of the Conservative ticket. Justice DeLuca has been endorsed only by the Liberals. He is running on the Democratic line for State Supreme Court along with a Nassau Democrat, District Court Judge Myron Steinberg, who also has Liberal endorsement. Their Republican-Conservative opponents - Nassau Family Court Judge Patricia Collins and Suffolk District Court Judge Harry Richard Brown - were selected at judicial district conventions last week. The Samenga and Friedenberg supporters are making an issue of what they say is political intrusion in the courts, and as a result Mr. Mondello's political prestige will be on the line in the two judicial contests. A victory for the two Democrats would be a setback for the new Nassau Republican chairman, who is attempting to strengthen his position after succeeding one of the most powerful political leaders in the state, Joseph M. Margiotta. Mr. Mondello said that the break in the bipartisan endorsement tradition has ''got to make the judges a little sharper - it's not a lifetime appointment.'' He added that the judicial candidates were actively campaigning. ''It's good for the judges; they meet people and it improves their compassion.'' He said that the Nassau Republican organization would distribute brochures just before the election that will include biographies and photographs of all the Republican judicial candidates.

97-> PREDICTING THE QUALITY OF THEIR LIVES
SELECTIVE NONTREATMENT OF HANDICAPPED NEWBORNS Moral Dilemmas in Neonatal Medicine. By Robert F. Weir. 292 pp. New York: Oxford University Press. $27.95. LAST January the Department of Health and Human Services released rules for the treatment of severely handicapped infants. In July, as the result of a suit brought by the American Hospital Association, a United States District Court invalidated the rules. The decision is under appeal. In issuing the rules, the Reagan Administration hoped to end an ethical and political controversy triggered by the death, in April 1982, of a Down's syndrome baby whose parents had refused to allow surgeons to try to remedy a defect in the baby's digestive system. Without surgery, the baby could not take in nourishment and so was bound to die. Later, after months of litigation, the Administration failed in an attempt to gain access to the medical records of a Long Island child - Baby Jane Doe - born with spina bifida (a defect of the spine that leaves a child partially paralyzed and sometimes mentally retarded as well). Baby Jane Doe's parents had also refused to let doctors treat her. Although ''Selective Nontreatment of Handicapped Newborns'' was written before the Department of Health and Human Services' rules were released, it shows that their thrust is at odds with the thinking of most of those who have discussed the issues involved - a group that includes pediatricians, lawyers, philoso Peter Singer teaches philosophy at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. He is the author of ''Animal Liberation,'' ''The Expanding Circle: Ethics and Sociobiology'' and other books. phers and theologians. Robert F. Weir comes from this last group - he is a professor of religious studies at Oklahoma State University - and his book provides evidence that the policies supported by pro-life groups are rejected by many religious writers. ''Selective Nontreatment of Handicapped Newborns'' is to a large extent a survey of current opinion on the ethical issues raised by the treatment - or nontreatment - of severely handicapped infants. Since the issues are complex and Mr. Weir does not always succeed in translating academic writing into straightforward prose, the book does not make easy reading. But it allows us to gain perspective on the national debate about the treatment of newborns and enables us to see how extreme the Reagan Administration's position is when compared with the positions of those who have thought deeply about the matter. In a chapter on pediatricians' opinions, Mr. Weir presents seven different views on how severely disabled newborns should be treated. Such doctors as Raymond Duff and Anthony Shaw believe pediatricians should give considerable weight to parents' wishes and are prepared to withhold treatment from infants with Down's syndrome and other complications and from those with severe cases of spina bifida. Norman Fost takes a much stricter line against nontreatment and holds that infants with Down's syndrome or spina bifida should be treated, even if their parents are opposed to life-saving surgery. Yet Dr. Fost grants there are some infants who are ''so impaired that it is difficult to agree that they have any interests,'' and, in these cases, he would apparently accept a parental request that nothing be done to prolong life. C. Everett Koop, the Surgeon General of the United States and one of the architects of the Reagan Administration's attempt to tell doctors how they are to treat severely handicapped infants, disagrees not only with Dr. Duff and Dr. Shaw, but also with Dr. Fost over the extent to which a doctor should be prepared to continue treating the most severely handicapped infants. Mr. Weir quotes Dr. Koop as saying that these infants should be treated because ''each newborn infant, perfect or deformed, is a human being with unique preciousness because he or she was created in the image of God.'' IN a later chapter, Mr. Weir attempts to classify the diverse positions taken by philosophers and theologians. According to the Administration, doctors are entitled to withhold treatment only on the basis of a ''medical'' judgment that the treatment would be ''futile.'' To withhold treatment because an infant is so severely disabled its life could not be of a minimally satisfactory quality is, in the Administration's view, a form of ''discrimination'' against the handicapped. Again, Mr. Weir's survey shows this position is too extreme for any serious ethicist to defend. Mr. Weir takes, as a leading representative of the view that all nondying infants should be treated, the Christian theologian Paul Ramsey. Even Mr. Ramsey, however, has sufficient compassion to acknowledge that in the case of a child born with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (an incurable condition involving mental retardation, uncontrollable spasms and self-mutilation) treatment may properly be withheld because there can be no effective relief for the ''insurmountable pain'' brought on by the condition. This is, of course, a quality-of-life judgment, and although it is one most reasonable people would share, such judgments are ruled out by the Government regulations. Other philosophers and theologians, as Mr. Weir shows, would allow nontreatment - or, in some cases, euthanasia - in a much wider range of cases. Virtually all take quality-of-life prospects into account. The Jesuit theologian Richard McCormick, for instance, is prepared to say that life is a value to be preserved ''only insofar as it contains some potentiality for human relationships'' - a condition that would clearly leave the way open to withhold treatment from some of the more profoundly retarded infants. Joseph Fletcher, the theologian whose advocacy of ''situation ethics'' created a stir among Christians some years ago, is even more explicit in saying that decisions to treat disabled infants should be based on estimates of their future quality of life. There is, he says, no point in prolonging the life of an infant who will end up spending all his or her days in an institutional ''warehouse'' for the mentally or physically handicapped. If it is the consensus of the theologians that quality of life may, at least sometimes, be taken into account, many of the secular philosophers discussed by Mr. Weir are even more strongly of the opinion that it is a mistake to believe that every life that is biologically human must be preserved. For instance, Michael Tooley, an American philosopher now teaching in Australia, argues that to have a right to life it is necessary to be able to desire to continue living and this in turn requires a degree of self-awareness no newborn infant possesses. Thus for Mr. Tooley humans are born without a right to life and acquire one only as they come to see themselves as separate beings with a past and a future. Mary Anne Warren, of the philosophy department at San Francisco State University, holds roughly the same position. Mr. Weir sets out his own position in the last two chapters. In his view, newborn infants are not persons and do not have the moral status of persons, but they are potential persons and for this reason have value and deserve to be protected from harm. Presumably this means, however, that a newborn infant does not count for more than a newly fertilized embryo, for an embryo is also a potential person. Moreover, Mr. Weir does not explain why we should value potential people, given that we do not generally think it a good thing to produce more of them. But in failing to explain this, he is keeping company with so many others who have assumed potential persons have value without troubling to explain why. In any case, Mr. Weir thinks potential people have a prima facie claim to life and therefore to the medical treatment necessary to prolong life. There are, however, some anomalies so severe that, in his view, prolonged life is not in the best interests of the child. In these cases, he holds it should be permissible to withhold treatment. (Mr. Weir might also have done more to defend his opinion that an infant's prima facie claim to life can only be overriden in the best interests of the infant himself. And if the claim is not absolute, why should it never be legitimate to override it in the interests of parents, or in the interests of siblings, or even because treatment would place an inordinate demand on limited medical resources?) If it is sometimes right to decide a child is better off dead and to withhold medical treatment to achieve this end, is it ever right to kill? It is, after all, often more humane to give a lethal injection than to allow an infant to die from dehydration and starvation. Mr. Weir accepts the view that when life-prolonging treatment is not in the best interests of the child - but the withholding of such treatment will lead to the child's enduring prolonged suffering before it dies - it would be right to take active steps to end the child's life painlessly. The final question Mr. Weir considers is how these decisions are to be made. He advocates a hospital ethics committee that would arbitrate in any disagreement between parents and physicians and would examine reports of unjustifiable nontreatment. The committee would also be involved in the rare situations in which doctors and parents think euthanasia is appropriate. In supporting the idea of an ethics committee, though with reservations about the ways in which it would make decisions, Mr. Weir may seem to be in agreement with the Federal guidelines, which encourage hospitals to set up Infant Care Review Committees. There is, however, a significant difference: the committees Mr. Weir proposes would squarely face quality-of-life questions and make decisions on that basis; the committees proposed by the Reagan Administration are expressly barred from taking such factors into account. IF ''Selective Nontreatment of Handicapped Newborns'' makes it clear that the Government's rules will not be the last word on this difficult ethical issue, then it is also true that the book will not have the last word either. Mr. Weir does more to set out the current state of the debate than to establish a position of his own. The development of medical technology over the past decade has made it possible to save many severely handicapped newborns who would previously have died, but it has done so at enormous cost, both in financial terms and in terms of human suffering. We will have to find a better way of making these decisions than the old practice of leaving it all to the discretion of doctors, or the new attempt by the Federal Government to impose its view on society. Those who seek this better way will find that Mr. Weir has provided a valuable starting point from which further progress should prove possible.B

98-> EL SALVADOR'S MILITARY TRYING TO WIN PEASANTS AND BATTLES
The colonel and the peasant stared into the dark, listening to the murmur of soldiers settling into bivouac. A soldier had toppled a hen from a tree branch with a slingshot, and the officer and farmer were waiting for their chicken dinner. The colonel asked if people in Joateca, a town in the northern province of Morazan, supported the left. ''Yes,'' the old man replied. ''Many?'' the colonel inquired. ''Yes,'' he answered. The officer is Lieut. Col. Domingo Monterrosa, the commander of the eastern region of El Salvador, and he wants those civilians back on his side. He and his peers did not always know how to bring that about or whether, in fact, it was necessary. The province has generally been under guerrilla control and the army has just begun visiting it again. Troops Promise Help In 1981, the 44-year-old commander's troops were involved in a military operation in which some 500 civilians reportedly died in El Mozote, an abandoned village that can be seen from the farmer's porch in Joateca. Now, with visits and promises of help, Colonel Monterrosa and his troops are trying to win popular support in these small towns. The commander's evolution seems to reveal how the Salvadoran Army's attitude and approach have changed after five years of fighting a civil war. The army has a long and brutal history that will not be easily overcome, but there are signs that the arrogant and often insensitive army that ruled El Salvador for more than 40 years has progressed. A Salvadoran political analyst who has been a harsh critic of the army concedes: ''In general its performance in terms of the people has improved a few notches.'' Some Problems Remain The improvements have just begun. Human rights abuses still occur, incompetent commanders remain and the army, ever suspicious of the left and the new civilian Government, could still block peace negotiations. Moreover, while the army has demonstrated more concern for civilians, it has yet to investigate and prosecute officers for human rights abuses. This attitude of the military has stymied the justice system because civilians are afraid to testify against anyone who might be related to someone in the military for fear of retribution. ''It's crazy to think they have suddenly seen the light and they all got converted,'' Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering said. ''But I look at it as a real slow process in which real steps have been made, and those are very important.'' Question of Army Survival Many army commanders reacted to the unrest of the 1980's with brutal force. Civilians were often caught in crossfire or simply considered the enemy. Human rights abuses spiraled, and in less than a year more than 10,000 civilians were killed. Church officials and human rights groups attribute many of those deaths to the army, the three security forces and the civil defense troops. All of these groups are under the command of the armed forces. United States pressure and the realization that the army needs civilian support to survive the threats of the revolution has changed the army's style of fighting. Troops who visited guerrilla- controlled areas only for military operations now visit towns regularly and compete with the left for support of the peasants. Colonel Monterrosa and other officials have changed from assailing the left as subversives to sometimes referring to them at town meetings as ''Salvadoran brothers who have taken the wrong road.'' The army that ignored the popular vote and stole the 1972 election from Jose Napoleon Duarte supported his election on May 6 and at least for the time being is working with him. To Americans, military support of a civilian President might seem ordinary. In El Salvador, it was precedent- breaking. ''It is something you take for granted,'' a Government official said. ''You can't imagine how hard it was and what that means for the country.'' Military Works on Image Now more conscious of the military's international image, Colonel Monterrosa has been a pace-setter in the military in showing the new style to foreign reporters. He has opened his barracks to the press, and reporters often travel with him during military operations. Even his colleagues who used to shun the press now take reporters' calls and sometimes acknowledge shortcomings in fighting the war. ''It is not Monterrosa who has changed,'' one of the planners of a 1979 coup said. ''It is the institution that has changed.'' It is a change that seems to have been provoked by the army's desire to survive. ''Survival is the key,'' an American official said. Survival is the motive that is uppermost in the minds of the officer corps. If the United States requires the army to rid itself of extremist officers to survive, those officers will apparently be sent to foreign posts, as many have been in the last year. In the same respect, if the army begins to feel too threatened by the civilian Government, it could quickly reassert its authority. When officers staged the coup in 1979 and gave power to a military-civilian junta, the military was full of internal dissension. The coup jolted the officer corps, provoking internal bickering and making officers suspicious of each other and of the civilians who were clamoring for a revolution. Pressure for Change The more moderate officers wanted change, right-of-center officers opposed change and a larger group of neutral officers, including Colonel Monterrosa, saw a need for change but were suspicious of any move that would diminish the power of the military and threaten its stability. The more moderate officers won the first battle and were represented on the civilian-military junta by Col. Adolfo Arnoldo Majano. The civilians included Guillermo Ungo, now the political leader of the left. Civilians such as Mr. Ungo, Colonel Monterrosa said, ''were very quick and had a lot of political experience.'' The army's representatives, he said, were ''very inexperienced'' politically. ''My feeling was that those with a lot of experience could have sufficient ability to fool the other members,'' Colonel Monterrosa said. The feeling was shared by a majority of the officer corps and, prodded by the extreme rightists, Colonel Majano was eventually pushed out. United States pressure, which became exceptionally vocal in the last year, reaching a peak when Vice President Bush visited El Salvador at the end of 1983, eventually provoked a transfer of extreme rightist officers to foreign consulates or to the Inter- American Defense College in Washington. Military's New Outlook The ouster of both more moderate and rightist officers has left a more professional officer corps. This group of officers is tied to United States aid and appears less likely to stage a coup, but it also seems unafraid to exert its power. Mr. Duarte is well aware that he needs the army's support before he can open talks with the leftist rebels, and the army is still uncertain about talks with the left, even talks to bring the left into future elections. ''Just as the guerrillas look at the Vietnamese process as a model, so the army looks at the Vietnamese process, and for reasons that have nothing to do with reality, the end results do not look too appealing,'' Ambassador Pickering said. At the time of the coup, the military not only faced internal rivalries but also confronted deep and persistent social unrest, much of it directed at the entrenched and brutal power of the army. Colonel Monterrosa said the depth of the social unrest was new to the army, and he concluded that there could have been ''confusion and doubts, including those that cause misbehavior.'' The right-of-center commander's troops were not immune to this reaction. In December of 1981 his Atlacatl Battalion killed nearly 500 civilians in the area of El Mozote in northern Morazan, according to reporters who went to the scene three weeks after the operation. The United States Embassy's investigators never reached El Mozote. Colonel Remains Sensitive Colonel Monterrosa, who said he was not in El Mozote with his troops, remains sensitive about the topic. ''Do you want me to say I killed a lot of civilians?'' he asked during one interview. His troops, he said, marched up through northern Morazan in 1981 and asked civilians along the road if there were guerrillas up ahead. ''They said no,'' he said, ''and we walked right into an ambush.'' When the topic of El Mozote came up in another interview, he said that ''a lot less'' than 500 civilians were killed. ''There were some 90, something like that.'' He said that when there is bombing and artillary fire, civilians sometimes ''stay in between the two sources of fire and can't get out.'' A Government official said El Mozote was in a gray area between a clear abuse of human rights and what happens in a war. Another Government official said that in the beginning, the army had no idea how to fight a civil war. Tactically, he said, the army ''could not deal'' with the enemy being other Salvadorans. The change, the apparent new confidence in the military and the realization among military officers that they need civilian support has come slowly. As the internal politics have settled and the left has grown stronger, the commanders have begun spending more time in the field, and instead of dealing only with the wealthy landowners - long a tradition in the military - commanders and soldiers have slowly begun to acquaint themselves with the peasants and farmers. Bringing Grain and Doctors ''Someone doesn't have to tell them now that there are people out there without food; they can see it,'' a former officer said. Not only do they have more contact with the people, but they also seem to have learned lessons from their opponents on how to fight a war. By demonstrating a different attitude with the civilians, the left has been able to win support from people who provide them with food as well as intelligence on army movements. Colonel Monterrosa says he needs civilian intelligence support to win the war. ''It is the most important'' kind of intelligence, he adds. The armed forces' forays in guerrilla-held territory used to be purely military. Now they sometimes have a civic component. When Colonel Monterrosa walks into a town such as Joateca now, he calls a town meeting and talks to the people about the left and democracy. He also asks what they need and follows up the requests by bringing bags of grain or doctors. Regaining the confidence of people who see the left more often than they see the army is a slow process. But it is a process that seems to have some effect. Contrast Is Visible There is a marked difference in the relationship between the army and civilians in northern San Miguel, where the army has been visiting for eight months, and the relationship in Joateca in northern Morazan, where the visits have just begun. In northern San Miguel, soldiers have girlfriends in the towns and civilians are unafraid to approach Colonel Monterrosa and ask favors or simply chat. In Joateca, many people are still aloof. At one point in Colonel Monterrosa's speech he tried to prod the small gathering into blaming the rebels for their isolation by asking why they did not have electricity, a mayor, a post office or telephone service. After a long pause and a second try, a man in the group finallly answered: ''We don't know.'' The colonel's town speeches do not acknowledge past errors but look to the future. ''We are not an army that is at the service of any bourgeois or privileged group,'' he told the people in Joateca as his soldiers painted over the slogans the left had painted on the walls of the mayor's office. They replaced them with slogans of the armed forces. ''We defend all the people of El Salvador - that is to say, we defend the rich, we defend the poor and we defend all of the civilians in this country,'' he said. ''We believe in democracy.''

100-> DESPITE BOOS, STEVE ROGERS IS STARTING TO MASTER HIS FATE
Given his pitching success and his status as the senior-most player, Steve Rogers has been a man of distinction with the Montreal Expos. Now he has gained another distinction. ''They're booing me at home on the introductions,'' Rogers said. ''Theyre not doing that to anyone else.'' For many of Rogers's teammates, the booing comes when they fail to get a hit or make an out when the Montreal fans expect it. Those reactions have occurred with increasing frequency this season because the Expos have plodded through a disappointing year. The Expos, the team that has repeatedly failed to live up to its image as the best in the National League, have been even worse this year, never seriously challenging the Chicago Cubs and the Mets for first place in the Eastern Division. Rogers, in particular, has had a poor season, and that's why much of the fans' derision and displeasure focus on him. Furthermore, his season - and theirs - could prompt the Expos to make Rogers one of the first players to depart in what figures to be an off-season shake-up. ''This is the first year that the team hasn't been able to count on 250 to 275 innings from me,'' said Rogers, whose spring training was wiped out by a shoulder ailment. ''Without that assurance, I fit less into their long- term scheme of things. Have I contemplated being traded? I'd be a fool to say I haven't. Actually, you have to look at the next week. Teams in the pennant race are out there looking. I heard that California was going after Don Sutton and making no bones about it.'' This is the time of year when teams in pennant races reach out and try to find the extra player who could make the difference. Sutton, in fact, served that purpose for the Milwaukee Brewers in 1982 after they acquired him from the Houston Astros Aug. 30. If the Expos were to trade Rogers in the next week or before next season, he thinks that his new team at least would get a healthy, effective pitcher. ''At the all-star break,'' he related, ''if someone made an offer for me, it would have been for a box of broken bats. I feel I've had to have changed that by the way I've performed.'' Rogers, who won 36 games the previous two seasons and led the league with a 2.40 earned run average in 1982, has won 5 times and lost 12 this season, compiling a 4.85 e.r.a. and walking more batters (59) than he has struck out (46). He even lost his spot in the starting rotation for two and a half weeks. However, in his last 32 innings, a total covering one relief appearance and four starts, the 34-year-old right-hander has compiled a 2.25 e.r.a. ''I was messed up the first half,'' said Rogers, who allowed San Deigo just one run in eight innings in beating the Padres Friday night. ''After the first few starts, I honestly felt like I could get people out, but I kept trying to get more out of my arm to get back quickly to where I used to be. I kept trying to throw 90 when I had only 85 stuff.'' His fastball still hasn't returned to that 90-mile-an-hour level, Rogers explained, but he thinks he is pitching more intelligently. His results would seem to indicate that he is doing something right, and pennant-contending clubs could be impressed. Before the Expos could trade him, though, they would need Rogers' approval. ''At least I have control over my destiny,'' he said, which is more than he had earlier in the season. If the Toronto Blue Jays had to select one day as the high point of their season, it might have been Aug. 14, the day they won a doubleheader from Cleveland while Detroit was losing two games to California. The combination sliced the Tigers' lead over the Blue Jays to seven and one- half games. If the Blue Jays had to select one week as the worst of their season, it might have been the week immediately following Aug. 14. For in that period, the Blue Jays lost five games on the field to the Indians and five games in the standing to the Tigers. The day after they swept the Indians, the Indians snatched two games from the Blue Jays, romping by 16-1 and squeaking by 4-3 in 13 innings. In that second game, Toronto scored a run in the top of the 10th and had two out with no one on in the Cleveland half. But a single and three consecutive walks, two by Jim Gott and the third by Jimmy Key, handed the Indians the tying run. The next day Dave Stieb left after eight innings with a 5-2 lead, but the Indians rallied for four runs against Dennis Lamp in the ninth, the last two on Andre Thornton's two-out double, and won, 6-5. ''We needed one out and then three outs to win two games and we lost both,'' lamented Bobby Cox, the Blue Jays' frustrated manager. ''We've lost games late all year long.'' The next time Stieb pitched against the Indians, last Tuesday, Cox left him in the whole game. So what happened? Working with a 1-0 lead, Stieb gave up a run in the seventh, then a two-run homer to Jerry Willard in the ninth for a 3-1 loss. The following night the Blue Jays didn't wait until the ninth to lose. Jim Clancy, Toronto's starter, pitched to seven batters in the first inning, gave up six runs and was the loser in the 13-3 game. ''We had a perfect opportunity to cut down the Tigers' lead after we won that doubleheader,'' Cox said. ''Now if we're going to be in it, we have to go on a 12- or 13-game winning streak immediately.'' The Blue Jays are not the only team unable to handle progress. The Oakland A's won five straight around the All-Star Game break and climbed two games from first in the American League West. Then they turned around and lost five in a row and dropped six games behind. More recently, they reeled off 12 victories in 15 games and reduced their deficit from 8 games to 4 1/2. So what happened? They lost the next 7 games and tumbled back to a 9-game deficit. The Los Angeles Dodgers, apparently guilty of mammoth miscalculation, threaten to finish with an under- .500 record for only the second time in 16 years and the farthest from first place since they ended up 20 games back in 1975. Their mistake: They decided the young players were ready, and the young players obviously are not. With that plan in mind, over the last few years, the Dodgers have been shedding their veteran players, including Ron Cey and Steve Garvey. Infield partners for 10 years, Cey and Garvey are on their way to the playoffs as opponents while their former teammates prepare to stay home. Cey leads the Chicago Cubs in home runs with 21 and is second in runs batted in with 78. Garvey leads San Diego in r.b.i. with 69 and is second in homers with 18. Without Cey and Garvey last year the Dodgers won their division, but this season they have had trouble at their old positions. At first base, where Garvey used to play, the Dodgers have started Pedro Guerrero, Greg Brock, Franklin Stubbs, Rick Monday, Mike Marshall and Sid Bream. At third, Cey's old position, the Dodgers have started German Rivera, Guerrero and Bob Bailor.

101-> CAPITAL STYLE
One could say we're members of the Amtrak set-not the jet set,'' quipped Arlen Specter, Republican Senator from Pennsylvania, who travels each week between the Senate's nine-room English Tudor family home in Philadelphia and their six-room condominium apartment in the Georgetown section of the nation's capital. ''Arlen says it's like playing house,'' said Joan Specter, who juggles the role of Senator's wife with not one, but two, full-time jobs. ''In some ways the Washington apartment is just a way station for Arlen during the week.'' Mrs. Specter, a former food writer for the Philadelphia Bulletin, also ran a cooking school for 13 years. She was recently elected to her second four-year term as a member of Philadelphia's 17-member City Council. And she owns and operates a Philadelphia bakery, Joan Specter's Dessesrts, which distributes several thousand frozen pies to restaruants and retail markets in 20 states each week. The Specters, whose two sons are grown, have worked out their dual lives and dual abodes nicely. All it takes is a double dose of high-voltage energy, two wardrobes and a propensity for leaping out of bed at the crack of dawn. And, added Mrs. Specter, a husband who is a good housekeeper. ''Arlen,'' she said, ''is immaculate-not a dish out of place.'' Senator Specter, a former Phiuladelphia district attorney who was elected to the United States Senate in 1980, spends weekends in Philadelphia and the week in Washingtron, heading to the capital each Monday morning, sometimes by train, sometimes catching a plane to stop off for meetings along the way with constituents in Pittsburg or Scranton. Joan Specter joins her husband in Washington midweek, either on Tuesday or Wednesday night, depending on what is on the Washington social agenda. She returns to Philadelphia on the 7 A.M. Metroliner Thursday morning. When the couple first loooked about for a permanent residence in the capital, convenience and security were their top considerations. ''We wanted to live in a part of town where there was a lot of activity-good restaurants that we could walk to,'' explained Mrs. Specter. What sold them both on their Washington pied-a-terre-a 15-minute ride from the Senator's Capitol Hill office-were the windows that lined five of the six rooms. ''I love the sun,'' said Senator Specter, ''And at night I open the blinds, settle down with a martini and look out at the lights of Kennedy Center and the monuments,'' The cool beige living room walls and the sofa and banquettes covered with pongee-colored corded silk serve as a backdrop for items collected on travels abroad. The handmade salmon and beige rug in the foyer is from Brazil, the calligraphy prints from China, and the clay pots in the taupe and charcoal den are from Peru. Centered on a circular glass dining room table is a Dale Chihuly blown-glass suclpture in gray and greeen touched with burgundy. 'That,'' said Mrs. Specter, ''is something I coveted for a long time,and Arlen bought it for my birthday. I was shocked-it was not inexpensive.'' There are Chinese screens, pastel rugs, porcelain lamps, a mahogany Chinese altar table, two red laquered stools and quilted, Chinese-patterned pillows in rose, chocolate brown and cream. ''I've always liked the Oriental look,'' she said. 'I had picked out a gorgeous red laquered sideboard for the dining room, but I knew it would chip easily and I just didn't want that aggravation-I wanted this a worry-free apartment.'' The Specters also wanted entertaining space with a variety of seating areas. ''I wanted the apartment to breathe,'' said Mrs. Specter, who restructured the apartment with the aid of Carl Steel, a Phiadelphia designer. They transformed the original three-bedroom apartment with narrow foyer into a one-bedroom apartment that doesn't, she said, ''feel scrunchy.'' The foyer was enlarged by removing three of the four closets, and the living room now flows through a curving archway into an adjoining library, with wet bar, that is still largely unfurnished. Dividing their time between two cities, ''makes for a stimulating life,'' said Mrs. Specter. ''It's fun developing friends in another city and moving in a different social circle. We don't have embassy parties in Philadelphia, nor the kind of conversation that you find in Washington.'' Winding up a Senate session can mean all-night debates with 5 A.M. votes. But even during the slower periods, there are the obligatory social ''drop-bys'' which mean that the Senator frequently doesn't get back to his apartment until 8 or 9 o'clock at night, when he will fortify himself with a late supper from a larder that includes ''sardines, cheese and thinly sliced bagels, or somtimes I'll make some chili,'' he said. The refrigerator is also stocked with beer and white wine for Senator Specter's pizza parties, to which he will invite a dozen friends or visiting constituents for pizza ordered from a nearby restaurant. Dessert is always Joan Specter's double chocolate mousse pie or peach almond cream pie, a supply of which is stashed in the freezer. ''I invited some staff from my office one night, and it worked out so well that now its a regular routine,'' he said. ''When Joan entertains, it's a masterpiece. She couldn't get away with this kind of an evening. It has to be strictly my idea.'' As for that ''immaculate touch,'' Senator Specter said he makes the bed in a minute and a half flat, and he finds that doing his own laundry has its advantages. ''It's a pleasure to do it because I keep things straight,'' he said, casting a meaningful grin at his wife. ''I don't end up with just one sock.''

102-> 'MASQUERADE' SEQUEL: THE TITLE IS THE PUZZLE
Britain began its quest today for Kit Williams's newest treasure. Mr. Williams's first book, ''Masquerade,'' inspired a worldwide search for a jeweled golden hare buried, it turned out, in a public park near Bedford. Published four years ago, it sold two million copies, almost half of those in the United States, for its publisher, Jonathan Cape. Mr. Williams's new book began selling here today. It is, like ''Masquerade,'' half children's fable and half treasure hunt. Unlike ''Masquerade,'' it has been published without a title. Hidden in the story - a pleasant tale of bees, changing seasons and, improbably enough, the London Symphony Orchestra, with 16 illustrations - are clues to the book's missing title. The books sells for $:5.95 (roughly $8.20) in England and $10.95 in the United States. Puzzle Is Easier This Time The puzzle is easier this time, and Mr. Williams expects that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of readers will crack it. (In two and a half years, only two men, a pair of British physics teachers, were able to solve the riddle in ''Masquerade.'') A British bookseller sent in the correct answer a day before the book went on sale. Mr. Williams has invited readers to find the title and express it without using the written word; correct answers, he suggested, might be knitted and photographed. The answer he judges to be most creative will receive a mahogany bee box, which, in addition to holding the only titled copy of the book, is home to a queen bee of 24-karat gold made by Mr. Williams. (The author, much wiser for the 30,000 letters from ''Masquerade'' readers that flooded his home in the Cotswolds, has directed that solutions be sent to Jonathan Cape's warehouse in Grantham and has limited the competition to one year.) Jonathan Cape is counting on a publishing phenomenon akin to the success of ''Masquerade.'' It has ordered an initial press run of 350,000 copies for the new book, sold 200,000 of those and the American rights to Alfred A. Knopf Inc., organized a 10-month tour through England of the book's illustrations and considered an exhibition next year of the more creative solutions. The first press run for ''Masquerade'' was only 60,000 copies and no major American publisher would take it on (the rights eventually fell to Schocken Books, which lost the new book because Mr. Williams was dissatisfied with the printing quality in some editions of ''Masquerade''). The strategy behind the new book reflects, in part, the huge response to ''Masquerade.'' At the peak of the ''Masquerade'' frenzy Mr. Williams received cakes, nine-foot-long poems and ''wonderful 'Masquerade' musicals from little old ladies,'' he said. ''Having got all this stuff, I was just amazed,'' Mr. Williams said. ''It seemed people were just bursting with creativity.'' The new competition, he said, is a chance for readers to display the same talents. ''People's imaginations, that's what I'm after,'' he said. Mr. Williams, 38 years old, is a bearded, elfin man who laughs easily and enjoys playing the eccentric ham in the many interviews and radio and television appearances that have followed ''Masquerade.'' ''The six months I have to do for the publicity and all the razzmatazz are fun,'' he said. The story for his new book grew out of an idea Mr. Williams had for a film, which itself has not been started yet. In the fable, Mr. Williams personifies the four seasons and describes the final hours of spring as the first day of summer breaks. This inner story is framed by an analogous tale of a beekeeper who celebrates summer's first day by opening his hive. The life of the bees within the hive forms a third strand of the story, and bees of one sort or another are the most important theme in both story and illustrations. (Mr. Williams has begun keeping bees himself and an elaborate bee garden fills his backyard.) Framed by Marquetry The illustrations themselves are magnificent combinations of oil paintings, intricate marquetry and an occasional jeweled bee. Each painting is framed by marquetry of varying shapes and veneers; about 100 different woods were used in all, although native English woods like oak, elm and ash predominate. Some illustrations feature ebony, ceramic, iron and ivory and in one composition, Mr. Williams uses a trompe-l'oeil effect to extend a porch scene from the painting into the frame. ''When the picture was finished, it was sort of sad to be finished,'' he said. ''It wanted to go on just a little bit.'' Mr. Williams, who was reluctant to start ''Masquerade'' seven years ago, says this book may be his last. It has taken four and a half years and has left him little time for other projects. Currently, he is experimenting with round, three-foot-wide paintings, but does not expect that this will evolve into a formal showing. ''I don't know whether artists should bother people with their experiments,'' he said.

103-> ISRAEL OPPOSES U.S. MISSILE SALE
Israel will oppose the Reagan Administration's plan to try again to sell Stinger antiaircraft missiles to Saudi Arabia, a spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said tonight. The official said there was a danger that weapons, which are accurate and deadly, might reach Palestinian guerrillas. The missiles are mobile and easy to handle. The spokesman, Avi Pasner, said in a telephone interview that ''we shall certainly take the matter up.'' He declined to go into details. The White House could handle the proposed $140 million transaction by notifying Congress of the planned sale 30 days in advance or by invoking a special provision that allows the President to provide military equipment to another country immediately when he deems it to be in the national interest. He said when the Israelis invaded Lebanon in 1982 to rout the Palestinian terrorists they discovered that American weapons that had been sold to Saudi Arabia had been channeled to the P.L.O. 'A Very Dangerous Situation' ''A very dangerous situation would be created if the Stingers fall into irresponsible hands,'' he said. The official said Israel had always opposed the sale of advanced equipment to Arab countries that are in a state of war with Israel. He said the Saudis had taken part actively in all the Arab wars against Israel. He acknowledged that participation had been limited but said ''the reason was that they didn't have the weapons to participate. ''Now they are being given the weapons,'' he said. Mr. Pasner dismissed the argument that the Saudis needed the weapons to protect oil tankers in the Persian Gulf. ''We know from past experience the Saudis never turned their arms against anybody but Israel,'' he said. Ehud Olmert, a Likud member of the Parliamentary Foreign Affairs and Security Committee, presented similar arguments in an interview but he added the Saudis already had other air defense missiles.

104-> HIROSHIMA BALLET COMES TO HUNTER
TOKYOIn 1952, on a stage in Hiroshima, a Japanese dance troupe performed a new ballet based on a blunt antinuclear theme. The message was not unusual, certainly, in the first city to have an atomic bomb dropped on it. But the dance company was hardly typical. Everyone - the dancers, the producer, the choreographer, the arranger - had survived the blast that destroyed Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945. By 1952, some were dying from the aftereffects, even if they did not know it. The dance, ''No More Hiroshimas - A Lone Star Shining,'' was performed 11 times in Japan through the mid-1950's and was then quietly retired. The performers wished to get on with their lives. Besides, like many other Hiroshima survivors, they no longer cared for steady reminders of what they had gone through. But in the nuclear-conscious 1980's, ''No More Hiroshimas'' has found new life. After 27 years on the shelf, it was performed once last year in Hiroshima, and now it is leaving Japan for the first time, for four performances this weekend - tonight through Sunday - at the Hunter College Playhouse in Manhattan. Many of the original Hiroshima dancers are dead. But some of their children have banded together to perform in New York, joined by four men and women from the 1952 production. Any profits from the four performances at Hunter will go to the United Nations World Disarmament Campaign. 'Shadowed by Prosperity' ''I think it's important to raise nuclear awareness, especially among young people,'' the producer, Hideo Kimura, said, explaining the ballet's revival. ''In Japan, the attention paid to the nuclear crisis is low, shadowed by the prosperity we have these days.'' Referring to Hiroshima's baseball team, he added, ''People probably pay more attention to the Carp.'' How the ballet will be received in New York is a question, Mr. Kimura acknowledged; not even many Japanese have had an opportunity to see it. But after last year's performance, the reviewer for Ballet and Dance, a small Japanese magazine, wrote: ''The full-house audience, including foreign tourists who had been to the atom-bomb museum, did not move long after the fall of the curtain. Some of them were in tears.'' The dance is set in Hiroshima 10 years after the war, but it contains a 15-minute flashback to the events of that clear Aug. 6 morning that suddenly turned to fury. How vividly Mr. Kimura should show the bomb's immediate effects was a problem, he said. Originally, the segment dealing with the explosion was longer and more graphic. ''After the first performance, people asked me to make it more 'artistic,' less detailed,'' said Mr. Kimura, who was 29 years old when the blast occurred, about half a mile from the room in which he was sitting. ''I also thought maybe it was too cruel. I hurt myself too much showing the effects.'' Project for the Family For the producer, ''No More Hiroshimas'' has been a family project. His wife, Sumiko Furutsuki, and her sister Mineko did the choreography in 1952. Mineko died from bomb-related illnesses in 1970, and Miss Furutsuki last year. Now Mr. Kimura's daughter, Kimiko Furutsuki, who has adopted her mother's family name for professional purposes, is responsible for the dance arrangements. Mr. Kimura wrote the basic story, he said, in the late 1940's. It came to him during one of his frequent meditations at the so-called Atomic Bomb Dome, a gutted building capped by a circular shell, which is the only structure from 1945 still standing in central Hiroshima. However, he could not translate his idea to the stage until 1952 because of restrictions placed on material of that sort during the United States occupation of Japan. After 1956, Mr. Kimura retired his ballet and turned his attention to forming the International Artists Center, a Tokyo-based company that promotes cultural exchanges with other countries. The death of Mr. Kimura's wife last year triggered his desire to revive ''No More Hiroshimas,'' but actually, he said, he had already begun to consider it. ''The relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States has been getting worse and worse,'' he said. ''I felt the earth was in a sorry state, just as in the cold war days when I staged the ballet the first time. So I started thinking about doing it again.'' 'Not Quite Strong Enough' His main problem, the producer said, was that the new dancers, lacking the experiences of their parents, ''did not seem quite strong enough'' in their performance. So he took them to Hiroshima's Peace Museum, showing them the photographs of the nuclear disaster and emphasizing little details, such as the way the victims walked on Aug. 6 with their arms stretched out in front because of the pain. ''For the younger generation,'' Mr. Kimura said, ''the fate that is theirs from Hiroshima may be good. Because without that tension they will - as I said - just enjoy the Carp, just lead the easy life.'' Performances at the Hunter College Playhouse, Lexington Avenue and 68th Street, are tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 P.M., and Sunday at 2. Tickets are $10 to $30; to charge, 724-9500. Information: 581-3644 or 333- 5096.

105-> CRITICS' CHOICES ;
Twenty-two years after its conception, nearly two years after its theatrical release, 17 months after winning eight Academy Awards, the motion picture ''Gandhi'' will be shown on television this week for the first time. Broadcasts of Richard Attenborough's epic film biography of Mohandas K. Gandhi, the father of modern India, are scheduled for Saturday at 11:30 A.M. on Showtime and 8 P.M. on Cinemax and Showtime. Three hours, 20 minutes in length, ''Gandhi'' traces the career of the great Indian political leader from 1893, in his days as a lawyer in South Africa, to his death at the hands of an assassin six months after his nonviolent reistance had won the Indian subcontinent freedom from the British Empire in 1947. At the Academy Awards ceremonies in 1983, ''Gandhi'' swept the major prizes - best picture, best actor (for Ben Kingsley, in the title role), best director (for Mr. Attenborough) and best screenplay (John Briley), as well as taking honors for art direction, costume, cinematography and film editing. Despite these and numerous other laurels bestowed upon the film, it is possible to criticize ''Gandhi'' for a certain blandness and for a reverence toward its central figure that overlooks or slights his quirks and flaws. But balanced against such drawbacks are a superb performance by Mr. Kingsley, the ambitious political and historical reach of the film, the spectacular canvas upon which its signal events unfold, its capacity to touch the emotions and, perhaps most important of all, the story it imparts to new generations: of a single, frail human who demonstrated against enormous odds that great goals could be attained by nonviolent means.

106-> CRAFTS; THE MORRISTOWN CRAFTMARKET: SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE
AS SURE a sign of fall as the equinox, the annual Morristown Craft Market will settle in here next weekend at the National Guard Armory. For the eighth consecutive year, 135 top-level craft artists were selected by a professional jury to show and sell original handmade objects in clay, wood, fiber, glass and leather. This year's exhibitors were chosen from almost 1,000 applicants across the country. Although the jurying process and the quality of applications parallel those of the nation's most respected fairs, certain aspects of the Morristown event make a special appeal to the general public. As a strictly retail venture, it is aimed more toward collectors' impulse buying than to wholesale clients. Also, to accommodate the casual shopper rather than the buyer on a business trip, the selling area is scaled so that it can be seen comfortably in an afternoon. A first-time visitor should be warned not to look for $5 mugs, although a table around which to design a room might be found. The lineup of exhibitors promises that knitted woven and appliqued wearables styled for cool weather will be the dominant offering. However, domestic textiles such as woven rugs and pillows - even silk hammocks - also will be available. Ceramics will include a wide range, including Martin Bjurlin's technically awesome, double-walled, overscaled urns and Pat Fahie's playful, brightly colored cups, which are not for drinking. There will be a large assortment of leather bags for day and evening wear, as well as gold and silver jewelry to satisfy different sensibilities. Wooden objects will vary from classic boxes and exotic materials to pull toys and a ''fool the eye'' breakfast for two in which Michelle Holzapfel has faithfully translated into different woods croissants, coffee cups and napkins on a tray. The breakfast piece was given a $250 ''award of excellence'' at a preview showing of works by almost all the fair exhibitors at the Morris Museum of Arts and Sciences. That award, bestowed by Hortense Green, crafts coordinator of the State Council on the Arts, and Marion Filler, a columnist for The Morristown Daily Record, and a ''popular award'' to be determined by visitors' ballots were instituted this year to help ''bring home'' the donation of proceeds from the fair to cultural endeavors. The CraftMarket is sponsored by the Kiwanis Club of Randolph Township. Since the fair's establishment, that organization has contributed more than $150,000 to civic and cultural projects in the state. The museum preview, which continues through Tuesday, struck this viewer as disappointingly unspirited. A scrutiny of the works one by one suggested that, in general, the fault was not in them, but in the thrift-shop style of presentation. Vessels are lined up against the wall without regard to their relative importance. Cases are crammed with incongruous items, and the challenge of displaying wearables was not confronted thoughtfully. For instance, Thomas Hoadley's masterful vessel in ''nerikomi'' - a Japanese technique of layering colored clays to achieve surface pattern - is tucked away in a corner, while a case in the center of the gallery is filled with another artist's less-developed work in that technique. Tacked to the wall on hangers or limply draped on dress forms, fine garments like Elizabeth Garver's asymmetrical silk jacket and Susan Neal's richly textured woven coats seem deprived of life. Granted, there are implicit difficulties in displaying, on a short-term basis, a medley of disparate objects selected for their individual merit rather than in relationship to each other. And admittedly, a few of the works submitted for the preview were not of ''museum quality.'' Diana Willner, an established professional, should have known better than to present a museum with a ready-made beret with a few washers stitched to it. The ''Iguana Fountain'' by Natalie and Robert Surving represents the kind of commitment that one expects to see in a museum, but it might be more effective lost in garden foliage. Still, it seems that the museum could have better served itself, as well as those who have espoused the cause of showing crafts in museums. The question is not that of ''function versus art.'' No apology is necessary for Jonathan Kline's impeccably detailed basket made of twigs of natural black ash, Maureen and Michael Banner's miniature container in sterling silver, ebony and rosewood or Peter Szymkowicz's geometric double bowl carved from Norway maple burl. The problem, rather, seems that the installation lacks imaginative vision. The preview will remain on view at the museum, at Columbia and Normandy Heights Roads in Morristown, through Tuesday. Hours are 2 to 5 P.M. today and 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. tomorrow and Tuesday. On Friday, the CraftMarket will have a wine-and-cheese opening from 6 to 10 P.M. and an entrance fee of $6. On Saturday and Sunday, the hours will be 10 A.M. to 6 P.M., with admission fees of $3 for the general public and $2 for the elderly. Children under 12 will be admitted free. There is ample free parking adjacent to the armory, which is on Western Avenue in Morristown. Travel information can be obtained by calling (201) 538-7778 between 10 A.M. and 6 P.M. from Friday through Sunday. Events Calendar Through Friday - Nonwoven art rugs in limited editions by Susanna Cuyley and Flicka McGurrin. Bloomingale's at the Short Hills Mall. Today through Oct. 11 - Braided wall pieces by Laura Chenicek. Summit Art Center, 68 Elm Street, Summit. Hours: 9 A.M. to 5 P.M., Monday through Friday; weekends, 2 to 5 P.M. Reception: Today, 2 to 5 P.M. * The address of the Lee Sclar Gallery was given incorrectly last week. It is 14 South Street, Morristown.

110-> FUTURES/OPTIONS ; Grains, Soybeans Rise; Meat Prices Are Mixed
Grain and soybean futures prices rose sharply yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade. Victor Lespinasse, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said corn prices were buoyed by an Agriculture Department report Thursday that corn acreage as of June 1 was about 1.5 million acres less than analysts had expected. Further support came from indications that few traders who have sold futures contracts for delivery in July plan to deliver the product in the next few days, Mr. Lespinasse said. The situation was particularly acute in soybeans and the July contracts for soybeans and soybean oil soared. Soviet Wheat Purchases Wheat prices were supported by unconfirmed reports that the Soviet Union was buying American wheat, the analyst said. Those reports were underscored by dry conditions in Soviet growing areas, sources said. The forecast for dryer-than-normal conditions in the United States next month gave additional support to prices, Mr. Lespinasse said. Wheat settled 3 1/2 cents to 6 1/4 cents higher; corn was 5 cents to 9 1/2 cents higher; oats were 7 1/4 cents to 8 1/2 cents higher, and soybeans were 17 cents to 30 cents higher. Livestock and meat prices were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Frozen pork bellies recovered from five straight sessions of sharply lower prices. The August contract was slightly lower, however, with pressure from weaker wholesale cash prices, which have fallen 10 cents a pound since June 21. Contracts for delivery next winter rose, however, as indications that feed corn prices are headed higher prompted concern that pork bellies could be in short supply then, said Bob Kuhn, a livestock analyst in Chicago wth Dean Witter Reynolds. Live hog prices also increased, and advancing values of live hogs and most pork products on wholesale cash markets encouraged buying. Live cattle were mostly higher and feeder cattle lower. Strong demand, coupled with indications of a possible shortage of supplies, supported the live contracts, Mr. Kuhn said. He noted that feed lot operators appear to be sending the animals to slaughter before they reached their heaviest possible weights because of the high cost of feed corn. ''If the feed lot operator has to pay more for the feed he can't afford to pay as much for the feeders,'' he said.

111-> COLLEGE BASKETBALL; SYRACUSE TRIUMPHS
The sophomore guard Dwayne Washington returned to last year's form, scoring 21 points as Syracuse routed Maine, 84-65, in the first game of the Carrier Classic tournament tonight. The Orangemen (3-0) assured themselves of their eighth consecutive trip to the final of the eight-year- old tournament. Syracuse will meet Lamar, a 91-74 winner over Bowling Green tonight, for the title Saturday. Rafael Addison and a freshman, Michael Brown, each scored two baskets early in the second half to help Syracuse overcome a sluggish start. Syracuse held a 39-32 halftime lead, but Addison scored 10 of his 16 points in the first 12:19 of the second half and Brown finished with 12 points, his first double-figure performance for the Orangemen. Illinois 72, Columbia 48 CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) - Tom Schafer and Ken Norman combined for 50 points to help Illinois (8-1) in the opening game of the Illini Classic. Illinois, with a substantial height advantage over Columbia (1-3), got the bulk of its scoring from its forwards and centers. Columbia's tallest player is 6-foot-7. Iona 81, Bucknell 68 NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y., - Rory Grimes scored a career-high 25 points to lead Iona (4-0), the defending champion, over Bucknell (1-4) in the opening round of the seventh Manufacturers Hanover Classic. Grimes raised his career total to 1,001 to become the 15th Iona player to reach the 1,000 plateau. The Gaels (4-0) will oppose Idaho State in tomorrow's title contest. The Bengals advanced with an easy 92-68 triumph over Wagner. Iona, which enjoyed a 36-30 lead at halftime, never trailed. L.I.U. 68, St. Francis 63 By United Press International Andre Ervin's tip-in with 2:34 remaining broke a 62-62 tie and led Long Island to the E.C.A.C. Metro Conference victory at home. The Blackbirds (3-2) trailed by 34-33 at halftime and 50-45 midway through the second half before outscoring St. Francis, 23-13, down the stretch. Walter Jordan led L.I.U. with 20 points. Chris Phillips paced St. Francis (1-4) with 18 points. La. Tech 73, Louisville 64 BOWLING GREEN, Ky. (AP) - A junior guard, Wayne Smith, scored 24 points and a senior forward, Willie Simmons, added 20 points and blocked seven shots to lead Louisiana Tech in the first round of the Wendy's Classic tournament. Tech (4-0) took the lead for good with 7:31 left in the first half. Louisville closed to within 2 points on a 3-point play by the guard Jeff Hall with 11:04 left. But then Tech when on an 8-2 surge.

112-> DELBELLO QUITTING NO. 2 ALBANY POST FOR INDUSTRY JOB
Alfred B. DelBello today announced his resignation as Lieutenant Governor of New York. Mr. DelBello - who has been in public office for 20 years, as Mayor of Yonkers, as Westchester County Executive and as Lieutenant Governor since 1982 - said he was leaving Feb. 1. He will become president of a new company that sells waste-disposal, resource-recovery and pollution-treatment plants to local governments. ''It will offer me and my family the opportunity, maybe, to have a little more normal life than we've had for the past two decades,'' Mr. DelBello said as he made the announcement at a late-afternoon news conference here with Governor Cuomo at his side. No Provision for Replacement The State Constitution makes no provision for replacing the lieutenant governor, whose primary job is to replace the governor if he leaves office, becomes incapacitated or leaves the state. Thus, the resignation means that a Republican, Warren M. Anderson, majority leader of the State Senate, will become first in line. With a Presidential bid by Governor Cuomo possible, Mr. DelBello's departure makes choosing his successor in 1986 particularly critical, politicians said. (Page 26.) Mr. DelBello, who is the second New York lieutenant governor to resign, described his resignation as ''the most difficult decision of my career.'' Both he and Mr. Cuomo, who had a strained relationship in the early days of the administration, said they had been getting along well in recent months. Mr. Cuomo said Mr. DelBello, who celebrated his 50th birthday last month, would have been his choice as running mate for re-election in 1986. In a capital where political surprises are not uncommon, Mr. DelBello's announcment surprised almost everyone and set off a flurry of speculation about its impact on both government and politics. ''Should I drop dead on the basketball court tomorrow, he becomes governor,'' Mr. Cuomo said of Mr. Anderson. ''Therefore the Democratic Party is assigning special guards to me, and to Warren.'' Both Mr. Anderson and Mr. Cuomo said they did not expect Mr. Anderson, if he became acting governor, to exercise his powers in ways that would create problems for Mr. Cuomo. ''One does not do things like that,'' said Charles Dumas, Mr. Anderson's spokesman. ''Only in California.'' He was referring to the confrontation that developed in California five years ago when the Republican Lieutenant Governor, Mike Curb, sought to exercise the full powers of Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, when Mr. Brown was out of state pursuing the Democratic nomination for President. Met Over Negotiations Mr. DelBello is joining the Signal Companies of La Jolla, Calif., 54th in Fortune magazine's ranking of the 500 largest companies in America. Signal expects revenues of about $6 billion this year. Mr. DelBello is to be president and chief executive of a new subsidiary, the Signal Metro Technologies Corporation. Paul Montrone, Signal's vice president, said the company got to know Mr. DelBello when the Lieutenant Governor negotiated an agreement with the company to build a plant in Peekskill, N.Y., that burns garbage to produce power. Mr. DelBello said he saw no conflict of interest in working for a company that he had once negotiated with as a government official. ''That's history,'' he said. A statement from Signal said the Peekskill plant was ''the most technolgically advanced'' in the world. The company said it believed there was a market for at least 100 such plants in the United Staes in the next few years and that it intended to sell many of them. Mr. DelBello said his contract with Signal extended beyond Mr. Cuomo's term of office, which ends Jan. 1, 1987. But Mr. DelBello would not say how much beyond that the contract runs. He declined to say how much he would be paid. The lieutenant governor is paid $85,000 a year. ''I'm looking at this as a total commitment to private life, the private sector,'' Mr. DelBello said. ''I'm not anticipating running for office again,'' Mr. DelBello, who irritated Governor Cuomo earlier this year by suggesting that the Governor run for President, said today that he had told the Governor ''I'll help him with any of his political campaigns.'' Next in line for the governorship after Mr. Anderson, who is 69 years old, will be the Speaker of the Assembly, Stanley Fink, 48, a Brooklyn Democrat. Repeat Role for Anderson Should Governor Cuomo leave office before next August, an election would be held for both Governor and Lieutenant Governor next November. Should he leave office after that, the election would be held in November 1986, as it would be if he served out his term. In either case, Mr. Anderson would serve as Governor until the election. Senator Anderson served once before in the dual role of majority leader and first in line to be governor - when Nelson A, Rockefeller, a Republican, resigned as Governor in December 1973 to become Vice President and was succeeded by his Lieutenant Governor, Malcolm Wilson. Mr. Wilson lost a bid to Hugh L. Carey for election to Governor on his own. The State Constitution makes no provision for replacing a lieutenant governor who leaves office while the governor continues to serve. Governor Cuomo noted that when he was Lieutenant Governor to Mr. Carey he had pointed out this problem, but no changes were made. Aside from being first in line of succession to the governor, the lieutenant governor has few formal powers. He presides over the Senate but can only vote in the event of a tie. The majority leader of the Senate is President Pro Tem, which establishes him as next in line of succession. The lieutenant governor often represents the governor. Mr. DelBello said earlier this year that that role was ''sort of fun.'' He had been particularly active representing Mr. Cuomo in economic-development and trade missions, including a trip to the Far East. Mr. DelBello is the second Lieutenant Governor to resign. Frank C. Moore left in 1953 in a political dispute. He had anticipated receiving the Republican nomination for Governor to succeed Thomas E. Dewey. When Mr. Dewey's organization backed another candidate, Mr. Moore resigned and became head of a foundation.

113-> PROSPECTS IN THE METROPOLITAN AREA
WITH one of the nation's lowest rates of unemployment and highest rates of economic growth, Connecticut is offering job-seekers the broadest and most appealing opportunities in recent memory. The unemployment rate, which is about three percentage points below the nation's as a whole, ahs been lower than that of any other heavily populated state all year long. Only a handful of rural states that benefit from seasonal upswings in agricultural hiring have had lower unemployment rates in recent months. What this means for job-seekers is that somewhere in Connecticut there is likely to be an opening for applicants with almost any tupe of skills. 'I can't think fo a single field that is saturated,' said Richard Fix, a spokesman for Connecticut's Department Labor. State and corporate officials say computer experts and electrical engineers are in such great demand that nationwide recruiting efforts have failed to fill al the vacancies. 'Even if you can find these people, it's not surprising to see them move on very soon because they've gotten a better offer from somebody else,' said Richard Whitmyer, a spokesman for the United Technologies Corporation. United Technologies is the largest of mroe than a dozen major military contractors operating at nearly peak capacity in Connecticut, where dozens of other high-technology companies are expanding their operations and competing for skilled workers. 'There is certainly no oversupply of qualified people,' said Ralph Crump, the chairman of Frigitronics Inc., a manufacturer of eye-care products. 'A good engineer is going to have a lot of choices in Connecticut.' The service industries account for more than 20 percent of the state's employment, or about 313,000 of 1.4 million jobs, and the nubmers are still increasing. Health- and business-related service jobs are expected to shoulder much of the growth. Among those most ardently sought to fill jobs are salespeople knowledgeable in the securities industry and financial services, said Patricia Mochel, a career counselor at the University of Connecticut's business school. She said many new sales jobs were being created as insurance companies, banks and securities concerns expanded into new financial services. Mrs. Mochel and ther university officials said recruiters representing 400 corporatins had visited the main campus at Storrs last year, twice the number that visited the year before. Theya dded that, in contrast to most other graduating classes, most members of the class of 1984 had jobs immediately upon graduation or shortly thereafter. Mr. Fix said that all tpes of health-care workers were in demand. Also being sought, he said, are tool-and-die makers, auto mechanics, retail-sales personel, secretaries and clerical workers. One result of the state's low unemployment rate is that many employers are offering more on-the-job training. At the James River Corporation's Norwalk division, for example, Nancy Frankland, wh is in charge of hiring secretaries, said she had been fillingjob vacancies all summer. 'We used to require word-processing experience,' she said. 'But now we are much more willing to train.'

115-> The Mathematics Of Chaos
It was very exciting to see James Gleick's article, ''Solving the Mathematical Riddle of Chaos'' (June 10). It was particularly gratifying to me, since I've been laboring in this fascinating discipline since 1963 and would thus seem to predate the pioneers featured in the article. Similarly, Rene Thom in the mid- 1960's introduced his ''catastrophe theory,'' whose name alone suggests its intimate link to chaos. Like M.I.T.'s Dr. Richard J. Cohen, I was initially concerned with finding a way to diagnose hidden heart disease far enough in advance so as to make the ''catastrophic event'' not so inevitable - or, at least, not so catastrophic - for millions of Americans. Once I discovered how to do this, my theories of pattern recognition (as good a formal name as any for ''the new discipline with just a nickname'') were applied beyond the detection of preclinical heart disease to such real- world purposes as submarine detection, nondestructive materials testing and gait analysis. But I wonder if today's layman realizes how possible it still is for someone to achieve a technological or diagnostic breakthrough, only to see it go unrecognized for years, if not forever. I can only hope that the growing excitement over chaos study, so ably described by Mr. Gleick, may eventually result in the widespread adoption of pattern- recognition technology. JOSEPH R. LUNDY, Professor of Biomedical Science, The Cooper Union, New York City

116-> G.M. DEAL DESIGNED TO HOLD PEROT STAFF
When a company considers taking over a high-technology concern, it often fears that valuable employees will take their highly marketable skills elsewhere. Now the acquiring company has what may prove a helpful precedent in its effort to stem the exodus, Wall Street analysts said yesterday, in a new type of security to be offered as part of the General Motors Corporation's proposed acquisition of Electronic Data Systems Inc. Analysts were intrigued by the the innovative features of the security, which is part of a cash-stock option under the $2.5 billion takeover proposal announced Thursday. The security would essentially allow E.D.S. employee-stockholders to continue to participate in the growth of the data-processing company alone without their interest's being diluted by the G.M. connection. 'No Downside Risk' In addition, the security package would provide holders with a guaranteed minimum return on the stock for seven years. By one estimate, the guarantee would amount to a present- value return of 17 percent a year before taxes. Thus, in the words of one analyst, it gives holders ''unlimited upside potential with no downside risk.'' ''It appears to be structured to provide an incentive for the employees, and keeping employees is certainly a critical consideration for success in a merger like this,'' said Rick Sherlund, an analyst at Goldman Sachs & Company. E.D.S. says that about 6,000 of its 14,000 employees own stock in the company. ''People are going to be looking very closely at this in terms of other deals,'' said Scott M. Smith, an analyst at The Gartner Group, a Stamford, Conn., research firm. Acquisitions of data processing companies have always been viewed as problematic because of the difficulty of retaining employees - the key asset of many of these companies - after a merger. Systems analysts, programmers and other skilled employees are in great demand and if the merger deal does not argue for their staying, they could easily find work elsewhere. As one securities analyst remarked, ''You've got to offer an incentive to keep these employees because these guys are getting calls from other employers all the time.'' Mr. Smith said G.M.'s proposed acquisition ''broke down a psychological barrier'' that data processing companies could not be acquired ''because the people were unacquirable.'' The new security and the proposed organizational setup, he added, might help keep employee-stockholders from otherwise walking out the door. Perot to Stay On Under the proposed merger accord, Electronic Data would continue to operate largely as an independent unit. The company would remain in its Dallas headquarters with H. Ross Perot, its founder, continuing as chairman. John R. Edman, G.M. vice president of finance, said the idea for the new security - called G.M. Class E common stock - grew out of discussions between G.M., its investment banker, Salomon Brothers Inc., and E.D.S. representatives on how to structure a merger that would maintain the ''entrpreneurial spirit'' that built E.D.S. into a leader in data processing. Under terms of the takeover, E.D.S. stockholders would be offered the alternative of $44 a share in cash, or $35.20 in cash plus one-fifth of a share of the new Class E stock. The Class E stock would be backed up by a contingent seven-year promissory note that would guarantee a minimum return on the stock. Holders would also have the right after three years to cash in the contingent notes early, but at a substantial discount. The notes would be nontransferable. Thus the initial holders - many of whom are likely to be employees - would be the only ones to be guaranteed. G.M. officials said dividends on the stock would be related to the earnings of E.D.S and recommended by the E.D.S. board. However, the G.M. board would still have final dividend approval. Analysts said there were also other uncertainties regarding the value and potential of the stock, given that while intended to operate as a separate entity, the company would still come under the scrutiny of the G.M. management. ''When you spend a lot of money for a toy, you want to play with it,'' said Mr. Smith of the Gartner Group.

117-> DOW DECLINES BY 7.28; UNION CARBIDE DOWN
Stock prices finished moderately lower yesterday, with Union Carbide again holding the spotlight as its price continued to drop. The Dow Jones industrial average finished the session down 7.28 points, to 1,163.21, its lowest close since Aug. 2, when it ended at 1,134.61. In the general market, declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered those that rose by 803 to 682 as volume contracted to 81 million shares, from 96.6 million shares on Thursday. Reflecting the downward trend, the exchange's composite index lost 0.22, to 93.52, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 0.50, to 162.26. Prices Higher at Opening Prices opened higher after the Government reported that the unemployment rate in November fell to 7 percent from 7.3 percent in October. The news stimulated buying from traders who were encouraged that the slowdown in the economy might be ending. However, prices began to retreat in the afternoon as bond yields rose. Hugh A. Johnson, senior vice president of the First Albany Corporation, said that the selloff ''dramatizes how much equities are hostage to interest rates.'' Many investors are fearful that the recent decline in interest rates is ending because the Federal Reserve may resume tightening its monetary policy in view of the jump in the money supply figures in recent weeks. Late Thursday, the Fed reported a $2.2 billion rise in the money supply for the week ended Nov. 26, which followed an unexpectedly large $6.7 billion increase the week before. 25.73-Point Drop for Week For the week, the Dow fell 25.73 points after declining 31.36 points in the preceding week. Volume on the Big Board this week advanced to 442.9 milllion shares from 411.7 million shares last week. Union Carbide again topped the most-active list on the exchange, dropping 1 3/4 points, to 37. This brought its loss for the week to 11 3/4 points. The stock has been under pressure since the start of the week following the news of the disaster at its plant in Bhopal, India, that killed more than 1,200 people. Claims resulting from the lethal gas leak at the plant could amount to hundreds of millions of dollars and could exceed the company's insurance coverage, according to some lawyers. Another market depressant was the continuing weakness in International Business Machines, a bellwether stock, which fell 1 3/8, to 117 1/8. The stock lost 4 5/8 points for the week. Marsh & McLennan was down 1 1/8, to 52 1/2, in active trading. The company said it had no explanation for the weakness in its stock. However, there were reports that the company is one of Union Carbide's insurers. Gold Issues Decline Weaker bullion prices abroad sent the gold mining issues lower. ASA fell 1 3/4, to 52 1/8; Homestake Mining 1/2, to 23 1/4; Campbell Red Lake 1/2, to 19 5/8, and Dome Mines 1/4, to 7 3/8. Phillips Petroleum advanced 3/4, to 53 1/2, and Mesa Petroleum added 3/8, to 21. Phillips is fighting a takeover attempt by investors led by T. Boone Pickens, chairman of Mesa. ITT was heavily traded and rose 7/8, to 32. The stock has been strong this week, buoyed by the news that Irwin L. Jacobs, the Minneapolis businessman, was buying the stock and planned to seek the liquidation of some of ITT's holdings or the company itself. British Telecom gained 1/2, to 11 1/8, as it closed out its first week of trading. Manhattan Industries tumbled 2 1/8, to 13 1/2. After the close, the apparel manufacturer reported that its third- quarter net dropped to 15 cents a share from 78 cents the year before. On the American Stock Exchange, the market-value index was down 0.36, to 202.01. Shaer Shoe, which reported a sharp drop in its latest quarterly earnings, fell 2 1/2, to 9 3/4. In the over-the-counter market, the Nasdaq composite index lost 0.13, to 238.94.

119-> AROUND THE NATION; Balloonist Leaves Maine On Solo Flight to Europe
Joe Kittinger sailed his ''Balloon of Peace'' across Newfoundland today and headed toward Greenland, hoping to become the first person to make a solo balloon flight across the Atlantic. The helium-filled balloon, which is 10 stories high, was traveling about 30 miles an hour. Mark Kirkham, a flight spokesman at the Rosie O'Grady Balloon of Peace trans-Atlantic operations center in Bedford, Mass., said: ''We'd like to get him to much higher speeds. But in order to catch the wind velocity, he must get to higher altitudes.'' The balloon was reported headed toward Greenland at an altitude of 10,000 feet, about 6,000 feet short of the height needed to catch upper level winds that could propel his craft to speeds in excess of 60 miles an hour. The trip is expected to take from three to six days.

120-> No Headline
What Constitutes a Civil Right? There are a number of puzzling aspects to Morris B. Abram's article ''What Constitutes a Civil Right?'' (June 10), among them how he can be so certain that the Constitution protects political rights and not social and economic rights, when the language of the document itself - which he never discusses in detail - is perfectly opaque, and courts and commentators have struggled over the issue for decades. Somewhat more troubling, however, is his resurrection of the old canard that when courts or administrative agencies overturn purportedly objective tests for employment or admission decisions - tests passed at markedly different rates by applicants of different races or genders - the qualifications for the job or school in question have somehow been lowered. Hiring on the basis of an applicant's score on a test that is not related to ability to do the job is no less pernicious than hiring on the basis of other factors, such as race or religion, that are not related to ability to do the job.

121-> 2 CARTER HOMERS BEAT YANKS, 6-0
Pardon Joe Carter when he says he'd never seen Ron Guidry before today. He is only 24 years old and, up until this year, he spent all of his career in the minor leagues. For that matter, when Guidry was a Cy Young winner in 1978, Carter was spending the summer in Oklahoma City, waiting to enter Wichita State University after just finishing high school. As for Guidry, he may hope never to hear the name Joe Carter again. Carter, traded to the Indians in June from the Chicago Cubs organization, smashed two homers off the Yankee left-hander, including a grand slam, and drove in Cleveland's other two runs in a 6-0 victory that ended a streak of 11 consecutive Yankee victories over the Indians. Carter gave Cleveland a 2-0 lead in the fifth with his third career homer and followed that the next inning with his four-run smash to the bottom of the upper deck in left field. ''It was a thrill to accomplish all that,'' said Carter, part of the trade that sent the pitcher Rick Sutcliffe, now 10-1, to the Cubs. ''But, over all, it was good just to beat them.'' Yankee Barrage Ends For the previous two days, the Yankees had overrun the Indians with 26 runs and 40 hits in victories of 6-4, 10-1 and 10-1. Backed by Carter's offensive output, though, the Indians' Bert Blyleven silenced the Yankees. The veteran righthander didn't allow a man to third base until the ninth, when he gave up singles to Rick Cerone and Don Mattingly, and he otherwise kept them off balance with a good mixture of fastballs and curves. ''I tried to pitch them differently than I've seen in he last couple of days,'' said Blyleven (12-5), who now accounts for 25 percent of Cleveland's victories. ''I knew I had to keep their leadoff hitters, Willie Randolph and Bobby Meacham, off the basepaths, the way their other guys were hitting.'' Specifically, Blyleven was trying to avoid extensive damage from Don Mattingly, Dave Winfield and Don Baylor, the 3-4-5 hitters who had destroyed the Indians most of the season. Randolph and Meacham, in a collective eight times at bat, only reached base once. The other three went a collective 2-for-10. ''You don't want those guys to beat you,'' said Blyleven, who stopped the Yankees for only the ninth time in 34 games since the All-Star break. No Answer for Carter Meanwhile, Guidry had no answer for Carter, who played for three years in Chicago's minor-league system before he was dealt here June 13. After making a sensational catch in left field in the fifth, robbing Steve Kemp of at least a double, he came up the following inning and riveted Guidry's 1-0 offering far over the wall in left. In the sixth, with the bases loaded and one out, he expected the Yankee manager Yogi Berra to lift Guidry (10-9) in favor of the reliever Mike Armstrong. ''I was looking at Yogi,'' recalled Carter, who heard the Cleveland Coach Bobby Bonds yelling at him from the bench. ''Bobby said, 'Hurry up, get up there before he changes his mind.' It was just one of those situations. With Guidry the veteran, and me the rookie, they probably figured he could get me out.'' Carter picked on Guidry's first pitch this time, a slider, and drilled it down the line in left. Berra was now out of the dugout, eager to make the change, and had to wait at the third base line for Carter to come around on his grand slam trot. ''I guess I didn't see him then,'' said Carter, ''I was too excited.'' Good Statistics Carter, playing with the Cubs' Class AAA affiliate in Iowa at the time of the trade, was leading the American Association with 66 runs batted in. . . . Guidry, on the road this year, is 2-8 with a 5.81 earned run average. He finished the season against the Indians with a 9.28 e.r.a. . . . Berra said he'd seen Guidry get out of many similar jams before and thought it was too early to make the change for Armstrong. . . . Blyleven, now with 43 career shutouts, entered with the best strikeouts-to-walks ratio among all active hurlers with at least 2,000 innings pitched. He had fanned 2,605 and walked 921 in 3,328Y innings, or 2.83 strikeouts for every walk. He fanned five today and walked none. No. 2? Tom Seaver, with 2.761. . . . The Indians haven't been above seventh place in the A.L. East at this time of the season since 1971. . . . The Yankees have now been shutout 12 times, the most since being blanked 14 times in 1975.

Two emergency radio call boxes have been placed on the Mid- Hudson Bridge to offer people contemplating suicide a chance to seek help. Officials said today that it was the first such arrangement in the country. If the program is successful in Poughkeepsie, it will be expanded to the four other bridges over the Hudson River operated by the State Bridge Authority, according to Gordon K. Cameron, executive director. Dr. Kenneth Glatt, Commissioner of the Dutchess County Department of Mental Hygiene, said the system had already saved one person, an intoxicated man who was pulled from the railing of the bridge Aug. 11 after using the phone. Dr. Glatt said the man, who was not identified, caught emergency psychiatric workers at St. Francis Hospital in Poughkeepsie by surprise when he called and threatened to jump. The hospital notified the City Police Department and officers picked up the man. Most Are Ambivalent The system had not been publicized then, and was not officially in operation until today. ''It is generally accepted clinically and has been found to be true by the numerous telephone hot-line services that sprung up in the early 70's, that most people who attempt suicide are ambivalent right up to the last,'' said Dr. David Sherwood, a clinical psychologist with the Mental Hygiene Department. ''In other words, there is a part of them that wants to live and some that wants to die,'' he said. ''We are offering them a last-resort type of alternative to killing themselves.'' The two call boxes, one on each side of the bridge over the Hudson River that connects Poughkeepsie with Highland, are situated one-eighth mile onto the bridge, a location police have identified as the most likely place for someone to jump, Dr. Sherwood said. An average of four people each year are reported to have killed themselves by jumping off the 135-foot-high bridge, and more do so, Dr. Sherwood said, but are not reported. Since discussions on the project began six months ago, Mr. Cameron said, two people have jumped off the bridge to their deaths, including one man who leaped off the bridge while workers were installing the phones. First Such Attempt The State Bridge Authority also controls and operates the Rip Van Winkle Bridge at Catskill, the Bear Mountain Bridge below West Point, the Kingston-Rhinecliff Bridge and the Newburgh-Beacon Bridge. Dr. Sherwood said he had contacted the managers of most of the major bridges in the country and a clearinghouse on suicides in Denver, the American Association of Suicidology. He said he had determined that this was the first such attempt to help potential suicides at the last moment. Julie Perlman, executive officer of the Suicidology Association, said that, as far as her 18-year-old organization could determine, this was the first time crisis intervention phones had been placed at the likely site of suicides. ''Oh, absolutely it will help,'' she said. ''People who are suicidal are also ambivalent. They want to live and they want to die, so, if you can catch them at the point they want to die and offer them help right at that point, it can only be helpful.'' The phones are accompanied by signs urging people considering suicide to call and assuring them help is available 24 hours a day.

125-> MAILBOX; Boyhood Echoes Of Jersey City
To the Sports Editor: For 100,000 of us ex-patriots of Jersey City, Frank Borsky's remembrance of Roosevelt Stadium (''Part of an Era Will Fall With Roosevelt Stadium,'' The New York Times, July 1) was a touching and bittersweet memento of our youth. On summer afternoons we would swim in the shadow of that magnificent structure that hung over Newark Bay. We'd catch crabs despite the pollution, and at night, wait in front of the bleacher entrance until the third inning, when it was traditional to let the kids in free. Roosevelt Stadium was our sports palace, playground and pride. Opening day was a holy day of obligation and we, urban Huck Finns, were devout and faithful. As at any good Irish wake, we'd like to say to the people of Jersey City and to Mayor McCann ''sorry for your troubles.'' Yet in our hearts we'll wonder what kind of a society we live in that has so little respect for tradition and destroys the structures that house them, such as the Polo Grounds, Power Memorial, the Helen Hayes Theater, and now, at the young age of 47, Roosevelt Stadium. JOHN P. GALLAGHERGlen Rock, N.J.

126-> WASHINGTON WATCH; Wine Bill's Prospects Improve
Prospects for Representative Tony Coelho's bill to help American wine producers sell their product abroad look brighter, after a turnabout by farmers. An early version of the California Democrat's bill would have raised barriers against imported wine, and farmers had feared that other countries would retaliate by restraining imports of American crops. A new version, however, omits the restraints. Instead, it orders the Government to investigate cases of unfair-trade practices by other nations against imports of American wine, and it directs the President to demand bilateral negotiations to halt the practices. Failing there, the new bill would require that the restraints be considered by the multinational General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The change in the bill prompted an opponent, the American Soybean Association, to shift its position. The association's members report sales to Europe of about $4 billion annually. Mr. Coelho, who represents California's San Joaquin Valley and is chairman of the Democratic Campaign Committee, has lined up 330 of the 435 Representatives as co-sponsors of the bill, and 58 of the 100 Senators are also backers. That could prove enough clout to overcome resistance in the Senate Finance Committee and a possible Reagan veto. The Administration opposes attempts to resolve trade disputes involving individual industries, although it has sometimes done so. It prefers multilateral trade liberalization. That, it contends, permits compromises over a broad range of products, for the advantage of all industries. The European Economic Community is also anxious about the legislation. ''If this bill were to be passed into law, the consequences for exporters on both sides of the Atlantic could be grave,'' said Sir Roy Denman, the Common Market's Washington emissary. Europe's concern could be unnecessary, said Arthur H. Silverman, Washington counsel to the Wine Institute. Europeans have already acted to reduce barriers, he said, and ''if the European Community follows through, we would not anticipate the bill applying to the Community at all.''

128-> AMUSEMENT PARK SAFETY STIRS A FEDERAL DEBATE
A spate of amusement park accidents, including the Great Adventure fun-house fire that killed eight people in New Jersey and recent fatalities on park rides, has stirred support in Congress for reinstating Federal jurisdiction over safety at the parks. The Consumer Product Safety Commission has jurisdiction over the safety of traveling amusement rides, but Congress lifted its juridiction over permanent installations in 1981. ''I am very adamant that we have jurisdiction over fixed-site rides,'' said the commission chairman, Nancy Harvey Stoerts. ''This issue is critical. There have been 12 deaths already this year and the average is 7. ''The consumer assumes that these rides are safe and that they are inspected by someone other than the operator and, indeed, they are not.'' Mrs. Stoerts has endorsed separate measures submitted to Congress by two Illinois Representatives, Paul Simon, a Democrat, and Henry J. Hyde, a Republican, and by Representative Frank J. Guarini, Democrat of New Jersey. One Commissioner Opposed Opponents of the measures include the amusement park industry and at least one member of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, Terrence M. Scanlon. Mr. Scanlon asserted that there had been an actual decline in amusement-ride deaths, which suggested that the states and ride owners were doing a good job of protecting the public. It is a ''regulatory mirage'' to assume that the Federal Government can assure that amusement rides are safe, Mr. Scanlon said. He insisted that the states had the primary responsibility, with 25 of them passing safety laws themselves. Each side cited statistics to support its argument, and everyone agreed that the figures were uncertain. Joel I. Friedman, a commission official who deals with statistics, said that the amusement ride fatalities had been counted by a routine review of death certificates that the commision buys from local governments and that the records cannot be complete because the budget does not permit purchase of all such documents. Based on those incomplete figures, the number of deaths vary widely, from one each in 1975 and 1982 to 18 in 1978 and 12 so far this year. About 6,700 Injuries in 1983 While Mrs. Steorts and another member of the commission, Stuart M. Statler, cited commission statistics to support their position that Federal inspection was needed, the industry said the figures showed that a Federal role was not necessary. John Graff, executive director of the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions, pointed to a commission finding that there had been 6,763 amusement-ride injuries in 1983, and interpolated that half of them had occurred in parks and half in traveling attractions. He compared that with the 200 million visitors to amusement parks and concluded that the commission's own data, which he did not accept as accurate, had shown that the chance of injury in amusement parks was one in 50,000. Mr. Statler challenged that view. ''The industry disparages 10,000 injuries and 10 deaths each year,'' he said. ''To recall that Peter, Paul and Mary song, how many deaths does it take before too many people have died?'' Mr. Graff said of proposed Federal safety inspection, ''I don't see how it could be effective.'' He noted that 25 states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, required state inspection of rides and that, because amusement parks are clustered and not spread evenly among the 50 states, most parks are in states where there are inspection laws. 'Hard to Be Carefree' ''It is critical to our industry that our rides be safe,'' Mr. Graff said. At a hearing called to discuss his bill, Representative Simon said, ''When we as parents take our children to these amusement parks, we are invited to check our worries at the gate. But it's hard to be carefree when there is mayhem on the midway that no agency is responsible for correcting.'' Representative Guarini called for an even broader measure than that offered by Mr. Simon and Mr. Hyde, saying that there should be Federal inspection for all amusement facilities, not only the rides. Mr. Guarini's proposal would include such things as the fun house at the Great Adventure park in Jackson Township, N.J., where fire killed the eight teen-agers May 11. Commissioner Scanlon said the Federal Government had neither the resources nor the expertise to perform such inspections. ''It can be done for far less money by the states and local jurisdictions,'' he said. 'It Is Just Nonsense' Chairman Steorts responded, ''It is just nonsense what Scanlon is saying. We have the expertise. The consumer needs protection, and we can give them that protection.'' Commissioner Statler said, ''The industry says the commission could not inspect every ride, and they are right. I want the authority to investigate accidents to avoid similar accidents.'' This is already being done by the industry, Mr. Graff said. ''When there is an accident it is incredible to believe that such an investigation is not held,'' he said, adding that while the cause was being determined, other similar rides or attractions were routinely shut down voluntarily by their owners. He asserted, ''It is critical to our industry that our rides be safe. There is no reason to believe that a Federal program would reduce the odds of injury.'' That is the position taken by Commissioner Scanlon. When asked about the 25 states that have not enacted amusement-ride safety laws, Mr. Scanlon responded: ''I think we have to tell them that it's in their best interests to protect the public through state programs. If they still don't in a couple of more years and accidents increase, then there might be a Federal role, but not today, when the number of accidents is decreasing. This is a classic case of how far some regulators want to go.''

129-> MISS PETERSON IN FRONT BY 3
Lauri Peterson came inches of an ace worth $5,000, shot a women's course record of seven-under-par 65 and assumed a three-stroke lead over Nancy Lopez today in the third round of the Jamie Farr Toledo Classic golf tournament. The 24-year-old Arizona State graduate, seeking her second pro victory in 10 months, made up eight shots on the first nine holes and 10 strokes in all on the 36-hole leader, Dianne Dailey. Miss Peterson, playing the front side at the Glengarry Country Club in five-under 31, posted a 54-hole total of 205, or 11 under. However, she was challenged by Miss Lopez, who was bidding for her 29th career victory. Starting seven shots behind, Miss Lopez went six under in a six-hole stretch to pull even. But Miss Peterson regained the lead with birdies on the 14th and 15th holes, and stayed on top the rest of the way. Miss Lopez shot a 66, and stood at 208 heading into the final round, with the first prize $26,250. The previous course record was 68, shared by Misses Peterson and Dailey in the first round Thursday. Playing head-to-head with Miss Dailey in the last threesome of the cool, cloudy day, Miss Peterson birdied five of her first nine holes. But the most spectacular came at No. 8. Her tee shot hit in front of the hole, bounced once in the cup and came out 15 inches past the hole. She tapped in the putt to take the lead for the first time. Had she aced the 182-yard hole, she would have earned a $5,000 bonus in the $175,000 tournament. Miss Dailey, who has not scored a victory in her five pro seasons, started the round with a two-shot lead. She struggled to a 76 and fell to fourth place with 213. Miss Lopez birdied holes seven, eight, 10 and 11, then got an eagle three on the 432- yard 12th. Marlene Hagge, at 50 the oldest active player on the tour, was third with 70 for 211.

How the Law Has Failed OTB To The Sports Editor: The New York Times performed a public disservice when it published a column condemning the state's Offtrack Betting Corporation (''A Question of Simulcasting,'' July 7), because the condemnation is based on factual errors and an apparent ignorance of the subject matter by the writer, Steven Crist. Mr. Crist's assertion that OTB should not be permitted to run simulcasting is based largely on two major criticisms of the offtrack betting operations: 1, that ''OTB storefronts in New York City do not offer the amenities of even a bus station. No chairs, no food or drink, no bathrooms, sketchy and untrustworthy information about the races, long lines, slow and rude cashiers,'' and 2, ''the 5 percent surtax, imposed in 1974 to help OTB meet operating costs.'' Let me take the second point first. The 5 percent surtax on winnings was imposed on OTB by the State Legislature at the request of the city administration in 1974 to help close the city deficit. The law does not permit OTB to use any portion of surcharge revenue for OTB operating expenses. It must be distributed to local governments, including New York City. It is common knowledge in the racing industry that OTB officials vigorously opposed the surcharge in 1974, and it is a matter of public record that OTB has had legislation introduced annually to reform the surcharge with a view toward its ultimate elimination. The reason OTB does not offer the amenities cited by Mr. Crist also has its basis in state law. In addition to being subject to the state's ''antiloitering'' laws, specific prohibitions were included in the OTB law in 1970. We were barred from selling food and drink, installing vending machines and selling publications of any kind. It was the intention of the Legislature to make OTB as sterile as possible, obviously to minimize any adverse impact on the race tracks. To put in chairs, rest rooms and the other amenities would have been to fly in the face of both the spirit and the letter of the law. Of course there may be long lines on occasion, just as there are at the race track windows, theater box offices, subway token booths, bridge and tunnel toll plazas or any facility that experiences peaks and valleys of public demand. Mr. Crist concludes that OTB has failed its customers. Rather, it is the laws governing it that have failed OTB, and nowhere is this more evident than in the simulcasting bill recently passed by the Legislature. This bill is so tentative in its approach and places so many financial and operational obstacles in the path of simulcasting into OTB offices in New York City that it is uncertain that we will be able to provide this desirable service to our customers in any meaningful way during the next year.

131-> UNITY SPURS GIANTS; JETS EYEING HOLMES
The Giants are not yet a Super Bowl team. So far they are not even a playoff team. They are merely a team with a 6-4 record, tied for their division lead and playing well. But they are also a team full of promise, a team that shows signs of coming together. Witness some of the results of their upset victories the last two Sundays over the Washington Redskins and the Dallas Cowboys, the traditional leaders of their division: - Immediately after the Redskin game, the Giants' five wide receivers sat around the locker of their senior member, Earnest Gray, held hands, and shared their happiness. - Four members of the offensive line had lunch together today in Westfield. ''It was nothing special,'' said Billy Ard, one of the four. ''But maybe it says we're getting close, that there's a mood about us and it's positive.'' - When the Giants reached their locker room in Dallas after their 19-7 triumph over the Cowboys on Sunday, Coach Bill Parcells was soon drowned out by choruses of ''Two days off, two days off.'' Parcells agreed, and for the second straight week he gave the players not only Tuesday off but also Monday. Butch Woolfolk, the running back, said the enthusiasm on the sideline had reflected the mood of the team. ''When the defense is on the field,'' he said, ''the offense usually sits down. In the last few games, one unit has been standing and yelling encouragement when the other has been on the field. Yesterday we got so loud that one coach yelled, 'Shut up, I can't hear the play!' '' Enthusiasm is one trait of a successful team. The refusal to panic is another. Brad Benson, the offensive lineman, said the Dallas game had provided a good test for the Giants' confidence. ''We were behind when we came out in the second half,'' he said. ''But things remained calm in the huddle. Nobody said, 'What are we going to do?' In the past, that happened.'' The last time the Giants started a season with a record as good as 6-4 was 1972. Since then, they have won more than six games only in 1981, when they were 9-7 and reached the playoffs. Still, although the offense moved the ball when it had to and the defense put heavy pressure on the Cowboys' quarterbacks and contained their running game, Parcells said, the team did not play so well as the statistics would indicate. ''We made some mistakes we weren't hurt by,'' said the coach. ''We let them out of some long-yardage situations like first and 20. We turned a couple of receivers loose and didn't throw to them. That didn't happen last week. You start adding that stuff up, and you may have a problem.'' This Giant team, like others in recent years, has relied on its defense. Over the last four games, Parcells noted, the defense has given up less yardage and has been putting increasing pressure on the opposing quarterback. The timing is good, because next Sunday the Giants play the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (3-7) in Florida. Though they beat the Bucs here six weeks ago, 17-14, they allowed James Wilder to run for 112 yards on 24 carries and to catch 4 passes for 65 yards. The Bucs are sound defensively, and they have a premier defensive end in Lee Roy Selmon. William Roberts, a rookie, opposed Selmon in the first game and did not embarrass himself. Now, with Roberts still not at full strength after spraining his right foot, the Giants will start for the third straight week with Benson replacing Roberts at left tackle and Chris Godfrey replacing Benson at right guard. On the following Sunday, they play the St. Louis Cardinals, who share the division lead. The temptation is to look past the Bucs to the Cardinals. Parcells said this would not happen, ''because they have a work ethic, and I think they will stick with it.'' He has also said he will remind his players, most of whom have enjoyed little previous success in the league, where they come from. ''I don't think we need any reminders for Tampa,'' said Benson. ''I've been here eight years, long enough to realize where we come from. I never had an opportunity like this before.'' Parcells insisted it was just that, an opportunity. ''They don't pay off early in the race at Aqueduct,'' he said. ''We're not anywhere near the finish line.'' McGriff Has Injury Parcells said he did not yet know the extent of the back injury to Curtis McGriff, the defensive end, or whether McGriff will be available Sunday. All other players are expected to practice Wednesday. . . . Andy Headen, the outside linebacker, is ready to practice, though no decision has been made whether to reinstate him this week from injured reserve. . . . Parcells had special praise for the performances Sunday by Godfrey, Byron Hunt, Leonard Marshall and Lionel Manuel.

132-> ATTACK IN GULF SAID TO KILL 11 ON GERMAN SHIP
Britain said today that 11 crewmen were killed by an Iraqi missile attack this week on a West German oil-supply vessel in the Persian Gulf. A Foreign Office spokesman said the 500-ton Seetrans 21, which is registered in Panama, was struck by what was thought to be an Exocet missile fired from an Iraqi warplane on Wednesday night about 50 miles from the Iranian oil terminal of Kharg Island. Gulf shipping sources in Bahrain have said the ship was attacked Thursday by Iraqi gunboats. Among the dead were three British divers, the ship's West German master and chief engineer and several Filipino seamen, the Foreign Office said. Iranian helicopters rescued two Britons from the blazing vessel. On Friday, the British Government summoned Iraq's Ambassador in London to register what it called a strong protest over the attack. According to the London-based Lloyds Shipping Intelligence, the Seetrans 21 was the 43d vessel to be attacked in the gulf since the start of Iraq's blockade of Kharg Island. Bonn Protests Attack BONN, Sept. 15 (Reuters) - Bonn followed Britain's lead today in protesting to Iraq against the sinking of the West German-owned ship Seetrans 21 in the Persian Gulf last Wednesday. The Bonn Foreign Ministry said the Iraqi Ambassador, Abdul Karim Mohammed al-Tai, was summoned to receive a protest from State Secretary Juergen Ruhfus. Iraqi Foils Hijacking Attempt TEL AVIV, Sept. 15 (AP) - An Iraqi security guard apparently foiled the attempted hijacking of an Iraqi jetliner over Jordan today, an Israeli radio monitor reported. He said his information was that at least three would-be hijackers and the guard were wounded in the incident. Details were sketchy and it was not clear what type of plane was involved, how many people were aboard or the reason for the seizure attempt. Michael Gurdus, an official monitor for Israel radio and television, quoted the pilot of the jetliner as telling the Amman airport control tower at 9:20 P.M. local time that he was headed for Baghdad instead of Amman as previously advised. He said he expected to land in the Iraqi capital about an hour later. The pilot told the control tower that one of the assailants had a Lebanese passport and a second person had a Cypriot passport, Mr. Gurdus reported. The third person was not identified, and no further details were given.

133-> CABLE CAR RAMMED, KILLING 1 AND INJURING 30
A speeding automobile struck a cable car full of tourists on one of San Francisco's steepest hills today, killing the driver of the car and injuring about 30 people on the cable car, the police said. The driver apparently was intent on commiting suicide, officers said. The impact of the collision sent the cable car careening into several vehicles before coming to halt two blocks down the Hyde Street hill, the police said. The car was demolished but the cable car sustained only minor damage, the police said. The automobile, traveling down the Hyde Street hill at up to 50 miles an hour on the wrong side of the street, smashed head on into the climbing cable car, investigators said. Officers said they were puzzled that there were no skid marks, indicating the driver of the automobile apparently did not try to stop. Driving on Wrong Side of Street ''There's speculation it may have been a suicide,'' a police spokesman said. ''The auto was on the wrong side of the steet and the crash appeared to be deliberate.'' The cable car, carrying mostly tourists, rolled out of control about two blocks down the hill before the operator, or gripman, was able to bring it to halt, the police said. The passengers and the gripman suffered a variety of injuries, the police said. Mission Emergency Hospital treated 14 people for minor injuries and Mount Zion Hospital handled 7 more. Most suffered bruises, strains and cuts and were released. Nine other passengers were treated at the scene by paramedics or taken into nearby homes for first aid, the police said. The identity of the driver of the automobile had not been determined, the police said. System Reopened in June It was the first serious accident involving a cable car since the system reopened June 21 after a two-year renovation project. Witnesses said the automobile appeared to be waiting at the top of the hill for the cable car and that the driver gunned his motor and started downhill when the cable car was moving slowly up the steep grade. The collision was so powerful that it jolted passengers off the cable car, said Mike Harris, a witness. A second witness said several passengers either jumped or fell off the derailed cable car. ''I looked up and it just kept on coming,'' she said. ''People were falling off.''

134-> AROUND THE WORLD; Kenyan Civil Servants Ordered to Join Party
President Daniel arap Moi ordered all civil servants today to join his ruling Kenya African National Union, the country's only legal political party, the state radio said. The move followed the expulsion Friday of 15 party members, including former Constitutional Affairs Minister Charles Njonjo. The developments were seen as part of Mr. Moi's efforts to consolidate his position since a coup attempt was foiled on Aug. 1, 1982. Mr. Moi said that state employees must register with the party by Jan. 1 and that only party members would be considered for future government job vacancies. The directive left unanswered the question of whether civil servants expelled by the party for political reasons would lose their posts.

135-> BACK IN CITY, FRESH AIR CHILDREN SAVOR THE MEMORIES
Kihien Tyson's face was full of disbelief. ''They wanted me to put goat's milk on my Cheerios,'' he said. ''Who puts goat's milk on Cheerios?'' Kihien, a 12-year-old from Brooklyn, was recounting some of the experiences he had during his seventh summer visiting a family in Eastham, Mass., as part of the Friendly Town program of the Fresh Air Fund. Nearly 14,000 underprivileged New York City children visited a family in the country or stayed at a Fresh Air Fund camp this summer. They are now home, having returned with gifts, new clothing, photographs and, most of all, memories. First Drive-in Movie ''The family I stayed with treated me like a queen,'' said Geniva Allen, 12, of Queens, who spent the summer in Brewster, Mass. ''I had my own room, and they took me all over - Provincetown, Quincy Market in Boston, a playhouse, even a drive-in movie. I had never been to a drive-in before.'' Chiwale Shannon, 9, of Manhattan, spent his third summer with a family in Oswego, N.Y. ''They treat me like part of the family, which is really nice,'' he said, ''except that means I have to do all sorts of chores, like loading the dishwasher and cleaning my room. I don't like that part too much.'' Madelyn Toro remembers the first summer she spent on her host family's farm in Pembroke, Mass., seven years ago. ''It was a big shock at first having to feed the goats and the chickens,'' she said, ''but now I'm really good at it, and they trust me just like another member of the family.'' Madelyn, 12, of Brooklyn, returned home this month with a bag full of toys, jewelry and new clothes. ''I can't wait to show these to my mother,'' she said. 'Like a Second Family' A horse figures prominently in Lucinda Davis's recollections of the seventh summer she spent with a family in Oswego. Her host family owns a stable, and this year they gave her a horse named Little Bit More to care for on her own. ''He's mine,'' she said proudly, as she showed off pictures of the horse. Lucinda, 12, lives in the Bronx. Her host family has invited her to stay with them every summer until she is 16, and she said she is considering living with them and going to college upstate after she finishes high school. Last year, they visited her family in the Bronx. ''We really are close - it's just like having a second family,'' she said. The Friendly Town program arranged summer visits this year for 11,300 children between the ages of 5 and 12 in 13 Northeastern states and Canada. During their first summer with a host family, children stay for two weeks, but if they are invited back in future years they may stay the entire summer. This summer, more than 2,500 underprivileged city youngsters spent two weeks at one of four Fresh Air Fund camps in Fishkill, N.Y. The camps, one of which has special facilities for the disabled, share many special features, including a planetarium, a wildlife refuge, a model farm and wilderness trails. Extension of Program Jenny Morgenthau, executive director of the Fresh Air Fund, said this summer had been ''terrific.'' New programs included counselor training for girls and artists-in-residence at several of the camps, she said. Next year, according to Miss Morgenthau, the fund plans to extend its programs year-round to offer camp stays for underprivileged teen-agers during school vacations. So far, the fund has raised $1.8 million of its $2 million goal, she said. It costs the Fresh Air Fund $98 to send a child to a host family in the country and $489 to send a child to camp. Tax-deductible contributions may be sent to the Fresh Air Fund, 70 West 40th Street, New York, N.Y., 10018. Additional information about being host to a child next summer is available from the fund at (212) 221- 0900.

136-> ABOUT LONG ISLAND
THE world holds no object as absurd, impractical and downright frivolous as a spike-heeled sandal. I just bought another pair. As a rule I buy such things in a desperate flurry, hours before I am due at a dressy event, when I realize that none of my dressy footwear is wearable. But this time I had no such excuse: I was, quite simply, seduced by the glamour of them. I don't suppose I'll wear them very much, because they hurt. High heels, for me, present a trade-off as clear-cut as any moral in a turn-of-the- century children's book. They'll make you feel glamorous, but before very long your feet will make you pay. In fact, I was looking for some comfortable, practical shoes to wear to work this fall. The store, which was having a clearance, had nothing left in the practical line but hot pinks and 5-narrow sizes; but it had scores of sexy sandals at exceedingly low prices. I tried on a glossy black patent pair, just for fun. It was witchery, or maybe just the tiny floor-level mirrors: my legs suddenly looked model-long and dancer-shapely, just like those lithe ladies in the stocking ads that one occasionally sees on television. My legs were tottering, not doing high kicks. Disregarding that, I fell for the illusion, bought the shoes and wore them home. By the time I got there, I was hobbling. I knew it would happen; it always does. In one version of the Cinderella story, one of the ugly stepsisters cuts off her toes so she can get the glass slipper on. (Believe it or not, it almost works. The Prince takes a while to notice and has to turn back for the right girl.) I look at a pair of heels and see glass slippers, but my feet know better - they see me as the stepsister. Maybe I'm too old to learn to wear high heels. I can't even say why I keep trying, unless it's the inspiration of those glamorous television dancers. If they can whirl in heels, my feet should be able to cope with a few hours' standing around at a party. They've been pampered; ''You want to ruin your feet?'' my parents said, buying me yet another pair of unfashionable saddle shoes. The high school required young ladies to wear heels for graduation. I was thrilled at the prospect. At the ceremony, though, I was sure I'd twist an ankle, wobbling up the aisle in my little Queen Anne pumps. Then came women's liberation, and I heaped scorn on high heels as a male-inspired torture device, as crippling as the corset of another century. It's been a while since battered sneakers, T-shirts and blue jeans were the mainstays of my wardrobe. And even then, I remember, I was extremely impressed by an elegant woman in black- strapped shoes with silver heels. On closer acquaintance, she turned out to wear jeans almost as often as I did, but I guiltily admired her ability to put on glamour along with her high-heeled shoes. She could walk in them, though. It is a skill, I'm told, that comes with practice. I've never had the hardihood to inflict much practicing on my feet. Still, as any child knows, there is a strong pleasure to dressing up, marking a departure from the humdrum with a special costume. And for women, I have come to acknowledge, there is nothing like high-heeled sandals to set an occasion apart from the ordinary. They change my gait from a swinging stride to a swaying mince; they lift my mood as well as my heels. They are glamorous, and reflect their glamor upward. Or so I feel, at the start of an evening. The sorcery holds for an hour or so. Then there's soreness in the ball of the foot, and an ache in the arch; the leg muscles start to tremble; it all builds until each separate bone is grinding against its neighbor. I come down to earth, put my precious sandals in a corner and walk around the party in my stocking feet. It wouldn't be glamour, after all, if it lasted very long. My mother used to say, putting my hair up in prickly curlers before sending me off to bed, you must suffer to be beautiful. And all the curls would be flat by lunchtime.

137-> CLEMSON TOPS THE TOP 20
-0 and beat Nebraska, 22-15, in the Orange Bowl, has a major-college football team finished with a undefeated and untied record. Clemson also finished with the No. 1 ranking for the first time. But there was a dark cloud above Clemson as it was undergoing a National Collegiate Athletic Association investigation. Clemson was eventually placed on a two-year probation for recruiting and other violations. That probation period ends Nov. 25, but the Atlantic Coast Conference, after an appeal by Clemson, voted by 5-2 to extend the punishment and bar the Tigers from a bowl game this coming winter and from appearing on live television this season. The A.C.C., however, could do little to weaken the Clemson team this season, or strengthen its schedule. As a result, the Tigers appear to have the best chance of any team in Division I-A to go undefeated and untied. Since a won-lost record is the most important element used in voting for the final ranking, Clemson is picked here as the No. 1 team in the nation for 1984. Auburn, which may actually have the best team, is the No. 2 choice simply because the Tigers have a more testing schedule than Clemson. Auburn begins its season tomorrow night in the second Kickoff Classic at Giants Stadium against Miami, which was voted the top team last season in the news-agency polls. Auburn was No. 1 in The New York Times's final computer ranking. Texas and Florida State, both on the road. are among Auburn's nonconference games and the Southeastern Conference, its league, one of the strongest in the nation. Implying that the S.E.C. is stronger than the neighboring A.C.C., Pat Dye, the Auburn coach, said, ''Clemson is like an S.E.C. team playing in the A.C.C.'' The S.E.C. may have more strong teams than any other conference in the country and the South may have more strength than any other region. Miami and Florida State, both independents; Auburn, Florida, Alabama, Tennessee and L.S.U., all S.E.C. members, and Clemson, the A.C.C. favorite, are all excellent teams. And Coach Joe Morrison is building South Carolina, another independent, for the future. Although there is no room for L.S.U. in the preseason Top 20, the Tigers could be the biggest surprise of the season under a new coach, Bill Arnsparger. Put them down as tied for No. 21 with Brigham Young. Florida needs to prove finally that it can make it through a season with its excellent talent before getting a preseason Top 10 nod. Mike Eppley, the Clemson quarterback who excels in basketball and baseball as well, was rated No. 3 in passing efficiency by the N.C.A.A. last season. William (Refrigerator) Perry may be the best middle guard in the nation, at 6 feet 3 inches and 315 pounds, and he will be joined by his little brother, Michael, a defensive tackle, who is 6-1 and 265 pounds. Danny Ford, the Clemson coach, has strength on both sides of the football and no opponent to give him sleepless nights other than Georgia, Sept. 22, at Athens. Clemson hasn't lost an A.C.C. game in three seasons and plays all seven conference foes this fall. Appalachian State, Virginia Tech and South Carolina complete the schedule. For Auburn, Bo Jackson is a superb running back in the wishbone and a Heisman Trophy candidate as a junior. There is added running talent there with Brent Fullwood. There appears to be a quarterback problem with the departure of Randy Campbell, but Dye said that Auburn would be better at quarterback this season than last, though he has not named his starter yet. ''We're a better team right now than last year at this time and we have the depth to get through this season with the schedule,'' Dye said. Miami might have the best sophomore quarterback in N.C.A.A. history in Bernie Kosar. And he may be able to help the Hurricanes overcome the difficulty of having to play four games in 20 days, all on the road, including the first two in six days. Jimmy Johnson, the new head coach, inherits an offensive line of returning starters to ease the task for Kosar first against Auburn tomorrow and then against Florida Saturday night. Then comes Michigan, Florida State, Notre Dame, Pitt and Boston College among others. Alabama has considerable strength because more than a dozen starters are return for Coach Ray Perkins's second season as successor to the late Paul (Bear) Bryant. These returnees were among the Crimson Tide that upset Southern Methodist in the Sun Bowl. But Alabama needs a quarterback to replace Walter Lewis. The top candidate is Mike Shula, whose father, Don, is the coach of the Miami Dolphins. Ricky Moore and Kerry Goode should provide the running attack. Nebraska lost four players who signed professional contracts worth a total of $10 million, led by the tailback Mike Rozier, after narrowly missing the final No. 1 ranking last season. But Coach Tom Osborne's system is perpetual, and Jeff Smith will replace Rozier. With only U.C.L.A. and Oklahoma as the strongest opposition - eight weeks apart - Nebraska could get the top spot it let slip away in the Orange Bowl last Jan. 2. Pitt, which is pushing the left tackle Bill Fralic as a Heisman Trophy candidate, will be tested quickly by Brigham Young on Saturday and by Oklahoma on Sept. 15. If Coach Foge Fazio can get the Panthers through those first two games successfully, they could have their best record since 1976 when they finished No. 1. Penn State could be as low as No. 3 in the East, behind Pitt and Boston College, which rates higher because of its senior quarterback Doug Flutie. The little magician has another solid team with which to work and the usual difficult schedule. Penn State and Florida State are two independents that do not appear to be Top 10 teams although each has a an outstanding running back: The sophomore D. J.Dozier at Penn State and the senior Greg Allen at Florida State. But the Nittany Lions and the Seminoles could be among the Top 10 after the bowl games. West Virginia lost Jeff Hostetler at quarterback, but still has Paul Woodside place-kicking, which is one of reasons why the Mountaineers won't drop off much. Syracuse should improve, and Navy has Napolean McCallum, its best running back since Joe Bellino. Rutgers has a new coach, Dick Anderson, and the same problem, trying to convince the best New Jersey players to stay home. Army has a long road back. Iowa and Ohio State are the best in the Big Ten with Michigan third. Coaching gives the Hawkeyes a slight edge over the Buckeyes, although Ohio State has one of the biggest group of experienced returnees in the nation, including Mike Tomczak at quarterback. Iowa has Chuck Long back at quarterback. He was rated the No. 2 passer in efficiency last season. U.C.L.A. and Arizona State should be the best in the Pacific Ten. The Bruins, like Clemson, have a favorable schedule, but the Sun Devils may get the edge when these teams meet at Tempe, Ariz., on Oct. 27. Arizona State also has Luis Zendejas, the place-kicker, who will be seeking the N.C.A.A. record for career total points. At Notre Dame, it could be Coach Gerry Faust's last chance to quiet his detractors. Improvement is expected this season because the team is seasoned and the schedule seems comparatively lighter. Next season, which is Faust's final year of a five- year contract, the schedule will be stronger. Allen Pinkett, the junior tailback, could earn the school's first Heisman Trophy since the quarterback John Huarte in 1964. Oklahoma has recovered from the departure of the tailback Marcus Dupree after last season's Texas game and must now return to winning convincingly. The Sooners will depend on Spencer Tillman, whom they hope will make everyone forget Dupree. Coach Jackie Sherrill finally seems to have a quarterback in Kevin Murray. The Aggies could finish second to Texas in the Southwest Conference and maybe better. The Longhorns are rated highly, but they have many defensive questions.

138-> JACKSON ABROAD: A LEGIMATE VOICE
To the Editor: It was a surprise to see your July 6 editorial condemning the Rev. Jesse Jackson for ''collaboration with the enemies of democracy in embarrassments of the Government of the United States,'' a surprise because The Times has long been a chief source of embarrassment to the Government, and the Government's foreign policy has itself lately been an embarrassment. But behind your editorial is a more sinister theory - that the Government should have a monopoly on discussion with other governments. I can hardly believe that a newspaper so long dedicated to the free flow of ideas, and to reason, endorses such a view. You have no complaint with the substance of Mr. Jackson's talks. The Times has long supported the freeing of political prisoners and has made identical pleas for negotiation between the U.S. and its adversaries. The whole weight of your argument rests on the assertion that Mr. Jackson's method undermines the Government's ''authority.'' In what sense? Does Mr. Jackson encourage disobedience of the laws, threaten manipulation of the nation's wealth or subvert the loyalty of the armed forces? A man undermines government authority only when he acts with a different will. Mr. Jackson's only crime has been to speak with a different voice. The thrust of your editorial is to erase the distinction between reasoning and conspiring with a foreign government. I can think of no distinction more vital to international affairs. If the governments of the earth had to depend solely on one another for persuasion, without the constant and incalculable activity of private citizens, I doubt whether at this point there would be an earth left. Even The Times tries to reason with foreign governments, by way of editorials. If the Soviet Government, in response to your numerous criticisms, were suddenly to release the dissident Anatoly Shcharansky to the custody of your Moscow bureau, would you not take the prisoner? Mr. Jackson's conduct has been entirely analogous. Equally specious are the recent attempts to trap Mr. Jackson in the conceptual morass of the Logan Act. It is argued that he ''negotiates'' with foreign powers. Does ''negotiate'' mean anything more than ''reason with''? If it does, then Mr. Jackson is innocent of the offense. If it doesn't, then the attempt to define the offense is an attack on free discourse - of which The Times has always been a warm friend. MIKE SHENEFELT New York, July 8, 1984

141-> IN SWABIA, MEALTIME IS SP"ATZLE TIME
In other places the staple may be potatoes, but in Swabia in the southwest region of West Germany it is sp"atzle - fat, irregularly shaped noodles served with meat, in soup or topped with melted cheese and onions. The distinctive taste and texture of sp"atzle results from a time-consuming process; soft egg dough is sliced into thin strips that are whisked from the cutting board into boiling water. Labor-saving devices abound, but the best sp"atzle, say the people in Swabia, are made by hand. Sp"atzle making has a venerable history in Swabia, which roughly corresponds to the W"urttemberg (lower) section of the state of Baden- W"urttemberg. A 14th-century law book shows the Duke of Swabia holding a sp"atzle board as the symbol of his domain. Over the centuries, the origin of the word sp"atzle (pronounced SHPAYTS-il) has been forgotten; some believe that the term comes from the German Spatz, or sparrow, while others say that the root is the Italian spezzare, which means to cut in pieces. The ingredients for sp"atzle sound like those for noodles, yet Swabians insist that to group sp"atzle with noodles is nothing short of blasphemy. Sp"atzle are made from flour, eggs and water beaten together until the dough is smooth and bubbles begin to form on its surface. Once the prepared dough has been spread on a sloping board, the experienced sp"atzle maker slices it into thin strips and with the same motion slides the ribbons of dough into a pot of boiling water. Since sp"atzle dough is wetter and airier than noodle dough, the result is lighter and less chewy. For sp"atzle dough, the key is the more eggs, the better, and the best sp"atzle are made with no water at all. The Swabians, however, are well known for their thriftiness and view sp"atzle made without water as an unjustifiable extravagance. By tradition, many Swabians add an extra egg or two to the dough as a Sunday treat. For visitors, there is an advantage in the Swabians' tendency toward thrift - even the finest regional cuisine comes at affordable prices. The only rule that limits the versatility of sp"atzle is not to serve them dry. Sp"atzle appear under cream sauce and brown gravy, beside pork chops, veal cutlets and steak and accompanied by lentils and frankfurters. K"assp"atzle is a main dish of sp"atzle oozing with melted cheese and sauteed onions. Krautsp"atzle is sp"atzle baked with sauerkraut. The proper wine to have with sp"atzle in whatever form, says Rolf Schlegel, the chef at Zum Ochsen in the village of Setten im Remstal near Stuttgart whose cooking is renowned throughout Swabia, is a light W"urttemberger red, such as a Trollinger. As if governed by some alliterative justice, the main city of Swabia and the capital of sp"atzle is Stuttgart, and often the most savory sp"atzle and most reasonable prices are found in the city's Weinstube, or taverns, some of which have their own vineyards in the rolling hills nearby. At Weinstube Kochenbas, for example, the atmosphere is unimpressive and the selection limited, but the sp"atzle superlative - light and yellow with egg. Each day the menu changes, but dependable favorites are pork roast ($4.50), Sauerbraten or pickled beef ($5) and mixed grill ($5), all served with sp"atzle and salad. Kochenbas also makes a slightly sour German potato salad ($1.50) that is quite popular. On warm days the restaurant expands from cramped quarters onto a small enclosed terrace. More space and a more extensive menu are provided by Weinstube Stuttgarter St"affele, where the sp"atzle are also handmade. In addition to K"assp"atzle ($3.50), Krautsp"atzle ($3.50) and sp"atzle with lentils and frankfurters ($4), St"affele serves Lebersp"atzle ($3.50), which have a smoky, sausage-like flavor and are made from a dough containing ground liver. Unlike most Weinstube, St"affele offers a menu that includes not only entrees but also appetizers and desserts. A full dinner with wine costs about $13. Visitors with cars can make the short drive from Stuttgart to one of Swabia's most renowned restaurants, the Zum Ochsen, in a half-timbered 18th-century building on the village square in Stetten im Remstal. There Mr. Schlegel personally oversees the sp"atzle making. According to him, the quality of Swabian cooking can be discerned from the length of the sp"atzle. Short sp"atzle are those that have stuck together and had to be shaken apart. Zum Ochsen offers not only traditional Swabian fare but also dishes that combine the flavors of regional cooking with the tenets of nouvelle cuisine. Among specialties are veal shank with sp"atzle ($7), p^ate of Lake Constance eel ($7) and veal heart with Dijon mustard sauce ($10). Prices for a full dinner begin at $22. While Swabians generally serve sp"atzle instead of potatoes, every rule has its exception - in this case the Stuttgart specialty Gaisburger Marsch, which combines sp"atzle and potatoes with meat broth, beef chunks and finely sliced vegetables to form a hearty soup. The name Gaisburger Marsch comes from the Gaisburg section of Stuttgart, where the dish was created at the B"acka- Schmiede, a now defunct tavern. Before World War I, officers from a nearby military base were permitted to leave camp for meals and at midday used to close ranks for the so- called Gaisburger Marsch to the B"acka- Schmiede. On cool days, Gaisburger Marsch ($7) is served at Weinstube zur Kiste, a small tavern with a devoted clientele. At Weinstube Zaiss, a slightly grimy tavern with its own vineyards, Gaisburger Marsch ($2) is available from noon to 2 P.M. on Saturdays. ''Sp"atzle making is an art that for outsiders is almost as impossible to learn as our language,'' one Swabian wrote in the early part of this century. While Swabish, the local German dialect, is something one either learns as a child or probably not at all, the art of sp"atzle making can be mastered in later years, especially with the help of a sp"atzle machine. Sp"atzle machines run on human energy only; their advantage is that they require relatively little dexterity to produce edible results. The most popular version is the Sp"atzleschwob, which resembles an oversize garlic press. The Sp"atzlehobel is a grating board straddled by a small box. As the box is pushed back and forth over the grate, the sp"atzle drop into a boiling pot. While sp"atzle made with a machine tend to be heavier than those made by hand, the main objection to them seems to stem from esthetic rather than gastronomic concerns. ''Really they taste just about the same,'' one Swabian admitted. ''The problem is that they are boring - all the same shape.'' Sp"atzle machines are available in the kitchenware sections of Stuttgart's major department stores, Kaufhof and Hertie. The press runs about $14 and the grate about $5. Sampling in the Stuttgart area Weinstube Kochenbas33 Immenhoferstrasse, Stuttgart (telephone 602704). Open from 11:30 A.M. to 3 P.M. and from 5 P.M. to various closing times, depending on the day.

142-> Numbers Games
To the Editor: Norman Kotker's ac count of a wheelchair visit to Rome, ''Counting Steps, When Steps Count'' (Travel, May 13), illustrates his inimitable way with words and numbers. We recall his dealings some years back with another cumbersome vehicle, ''Statistical Abstract of the United States.'' In the course of research, Mr. Kotker discovered that the numbers of married and unmarried men and women simply did not correlate. His findings, entitled ''Spouse Leak,'' appeared in the March 8, 1958 issue of The New Yorker. ''Oh, by the way, it turned out that the Capitoline Museum has XLIII steps to climb, not L.'' That is scholarship with the Kotker touch - meticulous, offbeat and funny. CAROL and EDWARD BERNINGER Short Hills, N.J.

143-> IDEAS & TRENDS; FEDERAL COURTS OFF LIMITS TO TV
The 26 judges who make the rules decided last week that the Federal court system is not ready for television. The ''alleged public benefits,'' said a report to the Judicial Conference of the United States headed by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, ''are outweighed by the risks.'' They pointed to ''potential psychological effects'' on jurors, lawyers and witnesses ranging from ''encouraging histrionics to producing inhibition.'' The conference rejected a petition by 28 news organizations, which had argued that video coverage would increase public understanding. The judges, detecting ''a great potential for miseducation and presentation of distorted images,'' reacted unfavorably to the experience in 41 states that permit some television coverage in state courts. Coincidentally, a pro-television view was elucidated last week by Federal District Judge Pierre N. Leval in New York. He was bound by the conference rule, he said, but would have preferred to allow television coverage of the forthcoming trial of the libel suit against CBS brought by Gen. William C. Westmoreland in connection with a 1980 documentary on the Vietnam war. Lawyers on both sides in the Westmoreland case were also willing to accept camera coverage. Judge Leval cited the importance of the issues the case raises, improved and unobtrusive camera techniques, and an opportunity to correct what he described as ''rather low esteem'' for judges - by showing ''how painstakingly and how fairly Federal judges conduct court business.''

145-> BEAUTY; FEET CARE: A YEAR-ROUND TASK
REVEALING SUMMER sandals highlight the need for year-round foot care. Yet the feet are often neglected until it is time to replace boots and shoes with scanty warm-weather footwear. Then, for a quick make-over, many women head to the pedicurist. Placing unswerving faith in soothing foot baths, glossy nail polish and pumice stones, they hope, in one miraculous hour, to undo the ills brought on by months of poorly fitted shoes, tight stockings, poor hygiene and lack of care. As resilient as they are, however, the hardworking feet must be cared for regularly to look and feel good. Common ailments such as calluses, corns, blisters, ingrown toenails and bunions can be treated successfully, if not prevented, with appropriate attention from a podiatrist. In many ways, the feet reflect the health of the body. In addition to readily betraying poor hygiene or obesity, they mirror conditions such as arthritis and the circulatory problems typical of diabetes. While heredity may ultimately determine the foot's health, there is no doubt one's chances of developing certain problems are affected by care. The feet are subjected daily to the equivalent of thousands of pounds of pressure in the course of walking on hard, unyielding surfaces. And sports bring on further abuses. Of all the foot disorders, skin problems such as corns and calluses are the most common and the No. 1 reason for visits to a podiatrist, according to Dr. Barry H. Block, author of ''Foot Talk,'' (Arbor House, New York, 1984). ''Most of these,'' he says, ''are either preventable or curable.'' Corns and calluses are thick pads of dead skin that form in response to repeated friction or pressure. If the skin is irritated or rubbed, usually by a poor-fitting shoe, cell growth is stimulated to protect the foot from trauma. If the cause is not eliminated, however, what is initially an asset becomes a liability. The corn or callus grows to the point where it causes pain as it presses upon sensitive underlying tissue. Calluses tend to form over flat areas such as the ball or heel of the foot. Cone-shaped corns with tips pointing into the tissue generally develop over bony prominences such as on the tops of the toes. Corns can also develop in the moist area between the toes - where they are called soft corns - when the bones of the toes rub together. But the real problem is not the callus or corn, says Dr. Joseph C. D'Amico, chairman of the division of orthopedic sciences at the New York College of Podiatric Medicine who is also in private practice in Manhattan. ''The problem is what is going on underneath.'' Wearing shoes that fit properly and do not irritate the feet often can prevent the growth of corns. If they do develop anyway, the corns can be protected temporarily by a round Band- Aid or a flannel pad. Soft corns can be loosely wrapped with strands of lamb's wool or cotton. However, while a bandage may take pressure off one area of the foot, it will take up space in a shoe and cause pressure in another area. For temporary treatment, a podiatrist will cut away the upper layers of the corn. In some cases, he may recommend the use of an orthotic device - a mold in the shoe - to redistribute weight on the foot. If the problem is caused or aggravated by calcium deposits or bony prominences beneath the corn, these can be surgically removed, most often in a doctor's office. While it is best to have corns and calluses treated by a medical expert, podiatrists offer these suggestions for those who opt for home care: Soak the feet in warm, soapy water for 10 to 15 minutes. Gently rub calluses with a pumice stone. Remove dead skin with a firm brush. Massage moisturizing cream into the skin. For the treatment of corns, Dr. D'Amico recommends putting one or two drops of oil on the corn after soaking the feet. Instead of a pumice stone, he advises using a luffa or buff puff to remove dead skin. Then the feet should be lubricated with a cream or lotion. Those who suffer from corns and calluses are advised not to use razors or sharp instruments to remove them. Over-the-counter corn medications are also potentially hazardous. These contain strong acids that can destroy healthy tissue along with the corn. Experts say home treatment of any foot problem should never be attempted by those with diabetes, any dermatological condition on the foot, circulatory problems, poor vision or unsteady hands. Since the development of calluses is often connected to the structure of the foot and the gait, they can be more difficult to prevent than corns, Dr. Block writes in his book. To absorb and cushion the way you walk, he and others recommend that special insoles be worn in the shoes. Two of the best, they say, are Spenco (nitrogen impregnated foam) and P.P.T. (a porometric material). The first is an over-the-counter product sold at sporting goods stores; the second is available through health professionals. A bunion is an enlargement of bone at the side or the top of the big toe as a result of the dislocation of the big toe joint. The problem is due to faulty foot structure; however, tight, narrow shoes enhance one's predisposition. While orthotics can help slow the rate at which bunions develop, correction generally requires surgery. Blisters form as a result of irritation and pressure commonly caused by ill-fitting footwear, wearing shoes without socks, or faulty foot function. To reduce moisture in shoes that often leads to blisters, powder the feet with talc or cornstarch before putting on socks. If a blister develops, it can usually be treated at home. First swab the area with alcohol. Then with a needle cleansed with alcohol, puncture the blister from the side. Gently press out the fluid. Do not remove the skin of the blister, however. Swab the blister again, preferably with an antibiotic ointment, and cover with a sterile bandage. Ingrown toenails are not nails that grow inward but rather short nails that press into the surrounding skin. The area may get red, swollen and painful. Generally, they develop on the big toe when toenails are cut too short or when the corners are angled or rounded too closely. The problem is aggravated by pressure from walking and from tight shoes. To prevent ingrown toenails, nails should be cut straight across and should extend a bit further than the end of the toe. If an ingrown toenail develops, see a podiatrist if there is any sign of inflammation. If not, soak the foot in warm water to soften the nail. Then, carefully slip a small bit of sterile cotton under the nail so that it will be directed to grow outward. The cotton should be changed daily. Regular care of the feet is important not only to treat foot problems but to prevent them. Podiatrists suggest washing and drying the feet thoroughly at least once a day. Powder the feet and sprinkle additional powder in the shoes. Use antifungal powder if you are prone to fungus infections; if not, use cornstarch. O SOFTEN THE SKIN, massage cream into the feet at night after bathing. If perspiration is a problem, an antiperspirant can be used on the bottom of the feet. For an odor problem, use a deodorant. Massaging the feet is a good way to relax them and aid circulation. Also, elevating the feet relaxes them and boosts circulation. So does exercise. Dr. James E. Bates, president of the Pennsylvania College of Podiatric Medicine, recommends exercises such as picking up marbles or towels with the toes and keeping them clinched for the count of 10.

146-> THE WORLD ; Beirut EmbassyIs Found Lax
President Reagan last week accepted responsibility for the bombing of the United States Embassy in Beirut Sept.20 and indicated the case was closed. The next day, it was reopened by both Democrats and Republicans of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, which accused officials of ignoring warnings of terrorist attacks. The committee did not present the same picture of faulty intelligence that Mr. Reagan had offered as an explanation of why the embassy was caught off guard by the attack, which killed two Americans, seven Lebanese employees and between five and 15 other Lebanese. ''The probability of another vehicular bomb attack'' against an American installation in Beirut - there had been two others - ''was so unambiguous that there is no logical explanation for the lack of effective security,'' the committee said. The President had pointed to the ''near destruction of our intelligence capability'' before he took office. The United States reportedly has information implicating a terrorist group known as Hezballah, or the Party of God, in the various attacks on American installations. The group, based in the Lebanese town of Baalbek, was said to have been supplied with explosives by Iran. The Administration has insisted that adequate measures were under way when the embassy was hit. The work was 75 percent complete, according to the State Department, which said that ''if there was negligence involved, we will find it.''

147-> THE WORLD ; A Peace BidIn Mozambique
Mutual interest led South Africa's white rulers and Mozambique's black Marxists to agree in March not to support rebellion against the other. But the war by the Mozambique National Resistance against President Samora M. Machel's Government continued and Mozambique was starting to have second thoughts about its pledge to deprive the African National Congress of a principal base against South Africa. After more hard diplomacy, South Africa announced last week it had arranged a truce between the Mozambique Government and the insurgents. In return for recognition as Mozambique's leader, Mr. Machel agreed to allow the rebels to sit on a cease-fire commission and to accept South African troops in his country to monitor the agreement. How effective the agreement would be remained a big question. No date was set for the end of the eight-year conflict. Shortly after the announcement in Pretoria, one of the Mozambique delegates, Evo Fernandes, predicted the conflict would ''continue and may escalate.''

148-> TRAVEL ADVISORY;
At first glance, the prospect seems incongruous: island-hopping by bicycle. But actually it's feasible. Nobody is using the bikes to cross the waters between Moorea, Tahiti and Huahine on a tour of French Polynesia scheduled to leave Los Angeles March 2, and to return March 17. The bikes come into play, as they should, on land, where the participants, based at one hotel on each island, will explore the surroundings by means of a series of 15- to 30- mile day trips. On Moorea, for example, one day will be spent circumnavigating the island; on another, the cyclers will venture into the mountainous interior. During four days on Tahiti, riders will visit ancient temples, lush forests, waterfalls, beaches and museums. Leisurely outings and plenty of free time are planned for Huahine before the group returns to Tahiti for an optional 71- mile ride around the island. Based on double occupancy, the land portion of the tour is priced at $1,390 ($1,175 for those taking their own bikes), including accommodations, breakfasts and dinners, group activities, interisland boat travel, guides and tips. Round-trip air fare from Los Angeles is estimated at $730. More information is available from Off the Deep End Travels, as the tour operator is known (Post Office Box 1196, 1028 S.W. Depot, Gainesville, Fla. 32601; 904-373-6833).

149-> NBC'S HEAD SAYS TV VIEWERS SPURN QUALITY SHOWS
Grant Tinker, the chairman of NBC, got up from his desk in his office on the sixth floor of the RCA building in Rockefeller Center. Behind him hung a huge framed blowup of the dictionary definitions of the word ''tinker.'' He sat on a couch and stretched his legs; across the room from him, three television sets were tuned to the three networks' evening-news broadcasts. Mr. Tinker, lean, white-haired and exactly as tanned and wrinkled as a 58-year-old man would like to be, stared a little wistfully at the three screens. ''You know,'' he said, ''in the beginning, nobody had seen any of it before. Some people would watch test patterns. Ed Sullivan, 'Your Show of Shows,' 'Philco Playhouse,' 'Playhouse 90' - they were more important than what we've got. It was more of an event. Now, we are taken for granted. As we should be.'' Grant Tinker, the man who helped revitalize the situation comedy with ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show,'' who put ''Lou Grant'' and ''Rhoda'' into production and who founded the company that now produces ''Cheers,'' ''St. Elsewhere'' and ''Hill Street Blues,'' has been the chief operating officer of NBC for three years. When he took on the position, after NBC's now-semi-legendary disastrous slump under the leadership of Fred Silverman, it seemed like the right appointment at the right time. And in many ways, for the network, it has been: morale is better, management changes have been put into effect, the profits of the company are up dramatically and, apparently, rising. It may have been the right appointment at the right time for NBC, but whether or not it was the right appointment for Grant Tinker - or at least the man who has committed his career to getting good television programming on the air - is another thing altogether. Speaking on the eve of a new television season, Grant Tinker, the chairman of NBC, has a bleak view of the state of network television and of what viewers are willing to put up with. It is fair to say that he feels constricted by the boundaries of his business and is even critical of some of the programming his own network has chosen to start the new season with. The blame, he said in a recent interview, has to be shared by the three networks, which as businesses look to profits above all else; by overused, worn-out suppliers of shows whose creative inspiration ceased to contribute to the industry, by his account, a long time ago; and, perhaps most of all, by the audience, which swallows much of the worst programming that is fed to it. ''We're all doing the same shows,'' Mr. Tinker said of the three networks. ''I think it is criminal of people to stare at television so uncritically.'' Mr. Tinker, a former producer who says he has lost none of his enthusiasm for television but is perplexed, not to say frustrated, by its limitations, ascribed the dearth of good programming to what he called a depressing and unwitting partnership between producers and audience. Not only is there a lack of ''creative people to bring you something better,'' he said, but bad programming is accepted by all too many television viewers, of whom he said, ''They're such a disappointment.'' ''To the bulk of the audience,'' he added, ''bad programming may not be a problem.'' Mr. Tinker, who produced a number of highly praised television series, took control of a network in disarray in July 1981. NBC has continued to rank third in the network ratings during his tenure, and its programming, while having its peaks and winning more Emmy Awards than the other two networks - it picked up 11 awards this week, to CBS's 10 and ABC's 5 - has only sporadically gained viewer loyalty. The new crop of NBC programs for the 1984 fall season have, in their initial broadcasts, garnered some excellent ratings. ''The Cosby Show,'' a situation comedy with Bill Cosby as a New York obstetrician and father of four, finished first in the Nielsen ratings last week, with extraordinarily high viewership in large cities, and received very good reviews. But a number of the other new NBC programs are not the kind of entertainment that Mr. Tinker has been associated with in the past and are not the kind about which he seems to feel particularly proud. They are, he says, the product of business decisions that he calls necessary for his company, but not necessarily a good-conscience gift to the viewing audience. One of those programs, ''Hunter,'' has already been the subject of some controversy. Scheduled against the champion of Nielsen ratings, CBS's ''Dallas,'' a program that has a very high viewership among females, ''Hunter'' is a program tailored to appeal to young male viewers in the style of what television believes young male viewers respond to: car chases and shootings. ''Hunter'' had high ratings in its two-hour premiere last week, out of its time slot, but the series is not the kind of programming Mr. Tinker created when he was selling to the networks rather than overseeing one. ''I think if you put 'Lou Grant' somewhere in the schedule now,'' Mr. Tinker said, ''it wouldn't work. The audience has changed some - and not for the better. I don't know why. It has something to do with the maturing of the medium. A very big part of the audience has never been without television. They settle for it, and take it for granted. ''The audience,'' he continued, ''won't make the effort to follow a 'Lou Grant' or to laugh at a literate comedy. And the kind of programs the three networks put on certainly doesn't help them.'' During Mr. Tinker's regime at NBC, the network has been singularly supportive of slow-building hits, such as ''Cheers,'' ''Remington Steele,'' ''Family Ties,'' as well as ''Hill Street Blues'' and ''St. Elsewhere,'' both award-winning MTM-produced programs. Surveying the new NBC schedule, which includes ''Hunter'' and another show with a high violence quotient, ''Miami Vice,'' as well as the return of ''TV Bloopers and Practical Jokes,'' Mr. Tinker rationalized his approval of them. ''As an executive, if I'm going to be attentive to the shareholder interest, I have to put on shows that work,'' he said. ''Shows that we just think are good won't perform.'' He went through his lineup, describing some of the new programs and generally making favorable comments about their ''execution'' rather than their content. ''There are a lot of question marks in there,'' he said, expressing frustration at what his programmers were able to put on the air. The only new program he praised for its quality was ''The Cosby Show.'' Beyond that, he said, he could ''not see anything that wauld qualify in that area. ''The truth is,'' he added, ''it's not against the law if we do not in a given year develop superior programming.'' NBC has made a strong recovery from its low point in 1981, when, under Mr. Tinker's predecessor, Fred Silverman, the network made $48.1 million in profits while ABC and CBS each made more than $300 million. Last year, NBC made $156.2 million. ''I would consider parity with the others - to be equal in profits - a success,'' said Mr. Tinker. ''A dollar measurement as opposed to a Nielsen measurement would be a success for us.'' On other fronts, Mr. Tinker expressed satisfaction in the continuing strength of ''The Tonight Show,'' starring Johnny Carson, a strong profit center for the network, and said he hoped to see a rise in ratings for NBC's daytime programming, particularly for the new soap opera ''Santa Barbara'' in which the network has made a $30 million investment. ''Even if we kept our evening ratings the same,'' he said, ''if we made daytime work, we would be earning a tremendous profit.'' Shortly after taking command of the network in June 1981, Mr. Tinker said ''it would be great if NBC really were on a roll. But, on the other hand, if in two or three years my efforts aren't rewarded, they should let someone else try. Because I only know one way to go.'' Reconsidering that remark, he said, ''Five years is what I think of as time for progress. I was underestimating the difficulties then. If, by the end of five years, we haven't come a far piece, they should pasture me out.'' Mr. Tinker said that if the network did not do any better this season than it did last year, when it lost almost all of its new programs to low ratings, ''that would be an arrestable offense. But I don't think we could match that performance.'' He said he would not cancel any of this season's programs precipitously, because he did not want to ''insult these people by jerking them around.'' In addition, if ''we really do turn in a ho-hum,'' he said, he would not ''sacrifice'' Brandon Tartikoff, president of NBC's entertainment division, who was appointed five years ago by Mr. Silverman. ''A lot of people made these decisions. We're not going to hang Brandon if things don't work.'' Mr. Tinker also said that he wanted to develop some new high-quality programming, but that there were constraints. ''I had to watch a pilot of a new program a while ago,'' he said, ''and we made the decision: It's a little too good. That's a terrible decision to make. But it just didn't work.'' He said that as the head of one of the three television networks he had an obligation to quality, but asked ''what kind of obligation does the viewer have? To watch what is good and not watch what isn't. I wish we both would enjoy a somewhat more elevated programming some of the time. But at the moment, this is the way we have to go in television to inveigle a few more viewers into the tent.'' The next day, as he was being driven to Kennedy Airport in an NBC limousine for his weekly trip to his home, Los Angeles, Mr. Tinker was asked what he thought American television would be like at the end of the century. He looked at the little color television in the back of the limousine, then smiled and closed his eyes. ''In 15 years?'' he asked. ''I don't know. Je ne sais pas. And that's the language I'll be saying it in. I'll be living in France by then.''

151-> Alta Badia
To the Editor: Now you've done it - you've blown our cover! We've been skiing in the Alta Badia (Travel, March 11) region of Italy for the last six years and it's one of the best-kept secrets of those who want great skiing without the crowded conditions of most major European ski areas. Each year we spend two weeks in Corvara, which we found by skiing there from the neighboring Val Gardena. We have never encountered another American, although I'm sure there are a few like us who have been lucky enough to find it. Reservations are very difficult to obtain because Europeans return year after year to the same hotel at the same time; we've made some wonderful friends and we look forward to seeing them again each year. The skiing is endless - from town to town - and one can ski for miles without repeating a run. The ambience is relaxed, for who can resist stopping at one of the mountain huts for goulaschsuppe and a glass of wine? You mentioned the two deluxe hotels in the area, but there are many others - our favorite is the Hotel Post Zirm, a first-class hotel with indoor pool, next to the chairlift. Their food is a marvelous mix of Italian pasta and Austrian pastry and the Kostner family who own the hotel are most congenial hosts. The Hotel Grief at the other end of town has great live music every night - and the Pizzeria Pino makes an artichoke pizza that is a masterpiece. I can't wait to go back next year! DOROTHY W. HAMMER Willow Grove, Pa.

Melbourne's Hotel Windsor Restored Constructed in 1883 opposite the Victorian Parliament House, the five-story Hotel Windsor, with its four majestic towers overlooking the Treasury Gardens, is a landmark of Melbourne sometimes known familiarly as the Grand Old Lady of Spring Street. After a century of existence, the famed old hotel has undergone an extensive restoration and renovation designed to enhance its Old World charm while modernizing its facilities and introducing such amenities as air-conditioning to its 200 rooms and suites. In the course of the $6.6 million (United States dollars), two-year renovation begun in January 1981 and supervised by the National Historic Trust, copies of three original arched Victorian colonnades were reinstated in the lobby; the grand staircase, formerly hidden beneath a carpet, was uncovered to display the original sandstone stairs and tiled landing and colorful stencil designs along the walls have been brought out from under layers of paint In the grand dining room the original domed lights, reglazed with stained glass, have been restored and new carpeting has been put down (based on photographs of the original). Cricketing memorabilia of the Melbourne Cricket Club is featured in the redecorated Cricketers Bar. In the lounge, foyer and banquet rooms, among other sites, a group of Australian oil paintings valued at more than half a million dollars have been restored. Room prices range from $80 to $90 for singles, $90 to $90 for twin doubles and $138 to $305 for suites. (Prices in United States dollars.)

154-> 'THE BRAIN' BEGINS A VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY ON PUBLIC TV
The human brain can imagine heaven and hell, can probe the outer fringes of the universe and the innermost core of the atom, but it has never been able to understand itself. This is not surprising. The three pounds of pinkish gray tissue that make up the brain constitute the most complex and potent creation that has emerged in the whole 3.5 billion years of life on earth. It would be presumptuous to think the secrets of this marvel of biology could be easily fathomed. Today, however, scientists are armed with powerful new tools - designed, of course, by the human brain. They have access to the results of decades of research all stored in human brains and in those artifacts of the brain: books, computers, films. Experts guess that more has been learned about the brain in the past 20 years than in all of human history. ''The Brain,'' WNET's new series of eight hour- long television programs that will begin Wednesday evening at 8, celebrates the unprecedented progress in chipping away at life's greatest mystery. But how does one convey to the lay television audience the realities of the brain and the excitement of scientists' new insights into its chemistry, electricity and circuitry that would make any computer designer jealous? ''The star of the show is invisible,'' says Richard Hutton, science editor of the series, stating the crux of the problem. The brain itself is certainly visible, but its outward appearance, even its interior when one slices through it, offers no useful clues at all to the prodigies that are performed within. It is no wonder that anatomists of earlier centuries made some wildly innacurate guesses concerning the role of the interior of the human head. To get around this difficulty, the producers of the series have made maximum use of what can be photographed and have devised ingenious models to simulate what cannot. To remind the viewer of the brain's incredible prowess, human activities become the graphics of the series. For instance, to illustrate the brain's exquisite control of motion and timing, footage is used of Olympics gold-medal winner Greg Louganis knifing into the water in a perfect dive. To show the havoc a stroke can play in even the most talented person, choreographer Agnes De Mille is seen shuffling haltingly down a hospital corridor. Other graphics celebrate some of the latest advances in scientific technology that make the brain more accessible to study, and incidentally, give the television viewer as close a glimpse as can be had of the brain at work - from the inside. The electroencephalogram, known by its initials EEG, is usually seen as a thicket of wiggly lines on a sheet of graph paper. These lines represent patterns of electrical activity within the brain. By using some recently developed scientific technology, the WNET series shows these traces of electical activity as shifting patterns of color that wash across silhouettes of the brain. The color patterns clarify the differences in brain activity between the normal and epileptic. They contrast the brain at rest with a brain that is coping with a new sensation. They show the brain asleep and awake. Somewhat similar in its visual properties is color footage representing positron emission tomography visualizations - PET scans - that depict chemical activity within the brain. Differences are shown between the normal brain and that of a victim of Alzheimer's disease. Just what those differences signify in terms of the chemical and physical impairments of the brain is still a mystery. But the human side of the equation is tragically clear. The series illustrates it with footage showing a woman in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. She is still coherent, can still play the organ in church, but she is losing her ability to remember even the simplest things as the devastating disease of the brain begins to smother her mind. She knows what is happening to her and that, month by month, it will inexorably get worse. ''I'm kind of hanging in there,'' she says at one point, ''but I wish I could . . . I wish you could hold time back.'' The segment illustrates part of the grand strategy behind the series, which cost roughly $6 million, was five years in production and took the efforts of more than 75 people. Scenes were photographed in exotic locales throughout the world, as well as in numerous laboratories in this country, Europe and Asia. According to the series' executive producer, Jack Sameth, the objective was to make it more than just a science series. ''What I was aiming for was a touch of the poet,'' he said. Nevertheless, the real excitement among brain scientists these days is over the chemistry and the molecules through which the brain functions in poets, athletes, scientists and everyone else. How does one illustrate new discoveries of this kind? The difficulty itself is revealed by one of the many laboratory scenes in the series. Scientists explain to the viewer that they have spent years and much effort searching for neurotransmitters, the chemicals that relay nerve impulses from cell to cell in the brain. Many hundreds of animal brains were dissected chemically in the search. At last, the scientists found and purified a chemical that seemed to function as a neurotransmitter. The harvest was a couple of teaspoonsful of clear, colorless liquid in the bottom of one test tube. To illustrate just what such a substance does in the brain is beyond the capabilities of even the electron microscope. The series resorts to some animated drawings and several key models developed by John Allison. Three are models of the whole brain shown with and without head and torso. Another model, which the producers call the nerve net, gives the viewer a sense of peering into the brain's network of interlocking nerve cells as lights flash to show signals being transmitted across synapses, the junctions between nerve cells. The actual model was a series of sliding plastic screens about 10 to 12 feet wide and 4 or 5 feet high. The model for actual nerve signal transmission across a synapse was a roughly quadrilateral structure about 5 feet by 3. Scientists believe neurotransmitter chemicals reach the synapses enclosed in minute bubble-like vesicles that apparently burst to release the chemical at the synapse boundary. Mr. Hutton said that the model builders tried all manner of ruses to depict this process, including blowing smoke bubbles into Karo syrup, but they never did get exactly what they wanted. Finally, the transmission of nerve impulses across synapses is shown as puffs of smoke. George Page, who narrates the series and has been involved with the project from its inception, said that the decision to do a major group of programs on the brain was made about five years ago because exciting new horizons in this field of science were opening up for exploration. In a project of such long gestation, however, there was the risk of seeming out of date by the time the series was completed. The producers have avoided this in part by sticking to the basic concepts of brain function as currently understood and by emphasizing landmark discoveries that are not in dispute. They have soft-pedaled some newer findings, such as the latest biological theories on schizophrenia, that might or might not stand the test of time. Much of the series, nevertheless, is likely to seem entirely new and startling to most lay viewers. For example, the evidence from ultrasound images revealing that the stage of sleep involved in dreaming, called REM for rapid eye movement, can be observed not only in adults and children but in unborn babies still in the womb. Whether such an unborn baby can actually be dreaming, and if so, of what, is one of the tantalizing mysteries of brain research the series puts before the viewer. Since the functioning of the human brain is the real essence of humanity, there is something almost eerie at times in human efforts to understand this quintessential organ of awareness. To evoke this quality, the series opens with pictures of the brain taken with the scanning electron microscope, a sophisticated device known for the sharply three-dimensional views it gives of cells and organisms that are many thousands of times too small to be seen with the naked eye. This segment, shown as a moving panorama, looks like a bird's-eye view of some alien landscape, the moon or perhaps a distant planet. But, as the narrator says, it is really the landscape of the human mind.

156-> THE WORLD ; A NicaraguanElection DealFalls Through
For a time last week, a way out of the political and military skirmishing in Nicaragua seemed possible. But the optimism died quickly as the Sandinista leadership, the political opposition, the United States and the armed rebel groups showed no hurry to compromise. In Rio de Janeiro, leaders of the Socialist International promoted a draft agreement by which the Nicaraguan Government would postpone a presidential election from Nov. 4 to Jan. 13. This would allow participation by a leading opposition candidate, who would be given access to radio and television. In return, the C.I.A.-backed rebels would cease their attacks and accept a cease-fire. But the opposition, led by Arturo Jose Cruz, could not deliver a rebel agreement, the Sandinistas rejected any thought of an amnesty and the agreement collapsed. For the moment, the election will take place Nov. 4 with no opposition of any standing to give it credibility. Well-known Socialist figures like former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt and former Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez said they were not giving up but they faced formidable obstacles. One was the Reagan Administration's basic hostility to the Nicaraguan Government, which had led the United States to reject a regional peace treaty sponsored by the so-called Contadora nations - Mexico, Panama, Venezuela and Colombia - after Nicaragua accepted it. The pact would bar outside intervention in Central America or any support for insurgent forces, while providing for free elections and other democratic reforms. The treaty would prevent the United States from helping El Salvador fight its insurgency but does not provide guarantees that Nicaragua would comply, according to United States officials. At week's end, Senate Republicans were still pushing for funds to help the Nicaraguan rebels. House Democrats remained opposed. At the United Nations, Daniel Ortega Saavedra, the Sandinista leader and presidential candidate, accused Washington of planning a military offensive for Oct. 15. The State Department called the charge ''obviously absurd.''

157-> AROUND THE NATION; Texas Governor Seeks Tax Increase for Schools
Gov. Mark White is proposing a three- year tax package of $4.8 billion to pay for improvements in the state's education and highway systems. Mr. White, at a news conference Friday, called for a penny increase in the state sales tax to 5 percent, for doubling the 5-cent-a-gallon vehicle fuel tax, adding a 5-cent tax to the cost of a pack of cigarettes, raising the liquor tax by 20 percent and raising taxes on the sale or rental of vehicles 1 percent. Raises for teachers and equal state financing for rich and poor school districts are at the heart of Mr. White's education plan. Starting pay for teachers would rise by about $4,000 to over $15,000 a year, while working teachers would receive an increase of at least 15 percent over two years.

158-> Playing 'Name That Twin'
After two years of checking beards, neck rolls, and helmet bars, Rick Hancock has thrown in the towel on seeing double. Hancock, head coach at Ward Melville High School in Setauket, L.I., coaches two sets of identical twins. Dave and Jon Ramey, guards, and Tom and Mike Kelly, receivers, are all starting seniors. As if that weren't enough, Hancock had a third set last year, Matt and Carl Wickle, who graduated. ''It didn't strike me until one day last year during a scrimmage,'' Hancock recalled. ''I kept yelling 'Hey Ramey, Ramey,' then 'Kelly, Kelly,' and then 'Wickle, Wickle.' Then I said 'Wait a minute, I got three of them.' All I needed was to line three on one side, three on the other, get a center and you've got a game.'' But the novelty quickly turned to chaos. Dave Ramey, who has played on the same team as Jon since junior high school, recalled numerous times when the coach ''would yell 'Hey Ramey go in' and we'd look at each other and wonder which one.'' Hancock tried an identification system based on attire. ''I tried to recognize one set by their helmets because one always wore a single-barred helmet and the other wore a double bar,'' he said. ''One twin in another set wore a neck roll and the other one didn't, and one had a beard growing and the other didn't.'' But the system had limited success, so Hancock tried a simpler - though certainly not any more accurate - way. ''I just called them 'Twin' whenever I wanted one to do something or whenever I saw one,'' said Hancock. ''It's hard to tell them apart so many of the players and their friends just simply say 'Twin.' '' ''I like playing with my brother because he's always around to practice with,'' said the tight end Tom Kelly. ''Many times I can tell just what he going to do and where he's going to be. But sometimes I want to be recognized individually as Tom Kelly instead of just one of the twins.'' Dave Ramey relishes the perplexed expressions of opposing defensive linemen. ''Sometimes they are not sure who they are picking up. After the game many have told us that they weren't sure which one they were hitting.'' ''It is difficult for linemen to play against them,'' said Hancock, whose team is 2-2 despite the confusion factor. ''If I kept seeing the same faces on different players I would probably take myself out the game and think that I was hit on the head too many times.''

159-> AID IN THE EIGHTIES
Jeffrey E. Garten's article 'Aid in the Eighties' (March 25) correctly warns about the perils of applying a Marshall Plan concept in an open-ended way to Central America. There are indeed differences between Europe in the 1940's and Central America in the 1980's. However, just because the region is different from Europe does not mean that a large-scale economic assistance program, tailored to the region's needs, will not be of significant value in encouraging economic development and social change. Of course, needs to be tailored to the economic realities of the region. In this regard, the Central American economies need to diversify and expand internal markets. To achieve this, the leaderships must invest in human capital, in the basic needs of education, medical care, nutrition and housing. This is why the Atlantic Council report on the Caribbean Basin of December 1983 recommended that special emphasis be placed on infrastructure development. The Kissinger Commission also emphasized infrastructure. Finally, Mr. Garten fails to recognize the fact that economic assistance stated in terms of a significant dollar commitment to the region is a political statement. It asserts America's concern for and commitment to real economic and social progress in Central America.

162-> Dickerson Seeks A New Contract
Eric Dickerson, the National Football League's season rushing record holder, will ask the Los Angeles Rams to renegotiate his contract and pay him at least $1 million a season, it was reported today. The Los Angeles Herald Examiner said the raise, if granted, would make Dickerson the highest paid running back in N.F.L. history. Dickerson was in San Francisco for tonight's game against the 49ers and was unavailable for comment. His base salary this season is $175,000. Bonuses worth about $225,000 will increase his 1984 income to $400,000, the newspaper said. The second-year player has two seasons left on his original contract, which calls for $2.2 million over four years. The contract also includes a $600,000 bonus for signing with the team, but the Rams do not begin paying the deferred bonus until 1987. The last installment is due in 1990. ''I don't like saying this because I like it here, I'm treated right and I love playing for John Robinson,'' Dickerson told the newspaper. ''But the Rams got me cheap and everyone knows it. I need to get the money now while I'm still healthy, while I'm whole. But I'd settle for a million.''

163-> HOUSE PANEL NOT REASSURED BY CARBIDE OFFICIALS
A Congressional subcommittee pressed Union Carbide officials today for assurance that the chemical disaster that struck Bhopal, India, was unlikely here, but its members appeared to find little comfort. ''The one thing I wish I could tell you is what happened over there,'' said Warren M. Anderson, the company's chairman. ''At this point, we don't know.'' Some witnesses criticized the Environmental Protection Agency, which has not established emission standards for methyl isocyanate, the chemical involved in the Bhopal disaster. Jack W. McGraw, deputy assistant administrator for solid waste and emergency response, said there were no standards because the chemical ''is never expected to be emitted into the air under normal circumstances.'' Speaking of the Indian plant from which methyl isocyanate escaped early this month, killing more than 2,000 people, and of another company plant here, Mr. Anderson said, ''We felt that plant was as safe as this one.'' Mr. Anderson and other company executives were questioned along with Government officials and area residents at a field hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's subcommittee on health and the environment. The hearing was at West Virginia State College next door to a Union Carbide plant that makes methyl isocyanate. Prospects for escape from such a leak here in the narrow Kanawha Valley, not far from Charleston, the state capital, were also discussed. Company officials spoke with an air of humility. Union Carbide teams have continually investigated the company's safety processes and reviewed the worst things that could happen, Mr. Anderson said, to guard against catastrophic results from varying combinations of extreme circumstances. Air Pollution Brings Anger But he said, ''I think Bhopal has changed the world'' and added that whatever positions had been taken on safety would have to be re-evaluated. Turning to air pollution, Representative Henry A. Waxman of California, the subcommittee's Democratic chairman, asked whether low-level emissions of toxic substances were ''killing people.'' ''We think the answer is no,'' Mr. Anderson replied. Area studies have shown a wide variety of chemical emissions in the valley's air, and one study in 1982 showed a high rate of cancer in a Charleston neighborhood bordering one plant. Mr. Waxman and other committee members questioned company officials and area residents about emergency planning. H. J. Karawan, manager of the local plant, said a regional plan in case of threat of disaster included a steam whistle to alert residents, telephone calls to the state police and a national weather station, and communication by the police with emergency agencies such as hospitals. But neither he nor others described any method of evacuating residents. A proposed evacuation plan, said Dick James, a union representative, is to ''put a wet cloth over your face and go crosswind.'' Where Plan Would Lead College officials have said they had been advised to follow such a procedure. But they noted recently that a crosswind path in the valley would lead into the Kanawha River on one side and a mountain on the other. ''I am really furious at what I'm hearing on this evacuation plan,'' said Representative Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland. Both subcommittee members and area witnesses accused the E.P.A. of laxity in setting emission standards. ''I wish I could say with more confidence that I had confidence in the E.P.A.,'' said Representive James J. Florio, Democrat of New Jersey. Mrs. Mikulski said, ''If the Department of Defense acted like the E.P.A., they would still be planning for the French and Indian War.'' One witness, Perry Bryant of the West Virginia Citizens Action Group, said that during the E.P.A.'s 14 years in existence, it had listed only seven pollutants as hazardous and had ''set standards for only four of these.''

164-> DRUG AGENT INSISTS DELOREAN PUT UP COLLATERAL FOR A DEAL
The drug trial of John Z. DeLorean returned to something approaching normal today, with a drug agent testifying rather poetically that ''drug deals are a rocky road'' and with the witness and a defense lawyer sparring over whether Mr. DeLorean had actually invested in a deal. Testimony by John M. Valestra, a drug enforcement agent, quietly ended a week that brought an inquiry by the Federal Bureau of Investigation into possible jury tampering, followed quickly by the arrest on cocaine charges of Mr. DeLorean's personal secretary at his New Jersey residence. Mr. DeLorean, a former General Motors executive who founded a company bearing his name to make cars in Northern Ireland, is being tried on charges of conspiracy to possess and distribute 55 pounds of cocaine. The defense contends that Mr. DeLorean was lured into the investigation by promises from Government undercover agents of a legitimate investment in his car company and that he tried to get out when he found narcotics were involved. The trial ended its 11th week of testimony this week. As the jury looked on, a defense lawyer, Donald M. Re, sought to make the point that by late September 1982 Mr. DeLorean had not put any money into a narcotics deal and that, in fact, there was no deal. Mr. Re said this was so because Mr. Valestra, posing as a drug czar in the undercover investigation, had promised Mr. DeLorean not only to put up the money for a narcotics deal but also to take care of getting the drugs sold. Mr. Re pointed out that, according to the Government's assertions in the case, Mr. DeLorean was to be given profits nevertheless. But Mr. Valestra insisted that Mr. DeLorean was ''entitled'' to profits for what he said was the auto executive's part of the deal. He also repeated his assertion, as he had for several days, that Mr. DeLorean put up $2 million in collateral consisting of furniture, auto parts and other hard goods, in return for a stake in a narcotics deal. At one point while he parried with Mr. Re, Mr. Valestra became philosophical. ''What's true is that dope deals are a rocky road,'' he said. ''They don't proceed on a normal course.''

165-> ELMER RIDDLE
Elmer Riddle, who won 19 games for the Cincinnati Reds in 1941 and 21 two years later, died here Monday. He was 69 years old. In all, he won 65 games and lost 52 in a 10-year major league career as a right-handed pitcher with the Reds and the Pittsburgh Pirates, to whom he was traded in 1948. His best seasons were 1941, when he had a record of 19-4 and led the National League with an earned run average of 2.24, and 1943, when he was 21-11 with a 2.63 e.r.a. Mr. Riddle was a native of Columbus and was a brother of Johnny Riddle, a catcher who played sparingly for several major league teams in the late 1930's and early 40's.

167-> POLITICS; G.O.P. UNITES AGAINST DOWNEY
REPRESENTATIVE Thomas J. Downey has been considered so strong a candidate in Suffolk's Second Congressional District that he hasn't had a serious challenge since Peter F. Cohalan, now the Suffolk County Executive and then the Islip Supervisor, opposed him in 1976 - a challenge that didn't prove to be serious on Election Day after all. But this year, if money, effort and talk are the criteria, Mr. Downey could face a serious test from a political newcomer, Paul Aniboli, a 28- year-old assistant Babylon town attorney. Even if he is unsuccessful - and even Republicans acknowledge that he is an underdog - Mr. Aniboli is keeping Mr. Downey pinned down in his district and coincidentally or not, rethinking his ambitions for the United States Senate. ''We have to take it seriously because of the size of the potential Reagan landslide,'' Mr. Downey said from Washington as Congress moved toward a late adjournment last week. However, a confident Mr. Downey added that ''this is not Cohalan.'' The Democrat said he has ''a big lead in our polls.'' Mr. Aniboli has made an issue of Mr. Downey's previously expressed Senate ambitions, but the Representative said last week that ''I can almost rule that out.'' He said he hoped that the House of Representatives would create a Select Committee on Arms Control and that he would be its first chairman. He added that a possible Senate run by Geraldine A. Ferraro in 1986, if she loses next month, had also made him rethink any Senate candidacy. ''You can run for national office from the House,'' Mr. Downey said. President or Vice President? ''I don't discount that as a possibility,'' Mr. Downey said, in a rare admission for a local politician. ''My district is as much a microcosm of the United States as I can find,'' he said. Mr. Aniboli's campaign appears different from most challenges of Mr. Downey because he is being strongly supported by both local and national Republicans who threw his predecessors to the political wolves by starving them financially. The Islip and Babylon Republican organizations, headed by the two most powerful Republican party leaders in Suffolk - William M. Blake, the Suffolk Republican chairman and still the dominant figure in the Babylon Republican Party, and Anthony Pace, the Islip Republican chairman - appear to be united rather than competing as they have in the past. Mr. Aniboli also has the active support in Washington of three influential transplanted Long Islanders. They are Richard Bond, a former Republican National Committee aide and now a political consultant; Robert Heckman, executive director of the Fund for a Conservative Majority, which has described Mr. Downey as the most anti-Reagan Congressman on Long Island, and Frank Cannon, a House administrative assistant who has helped research Mr. Downey's record. The three have provided Mr. Aniboli with access to national Republican money and political action committees. Mr. Bond said he hoped to raise as much as $250,000 for Mr. Aniboli from these out-of-district sources to match Mr. Downey's campaign war chest of at least that much. The Republican Congressional Campaign Committee has paid for the printing and mailing of a four- page tabloid-sized brochure that features a picture of Mr. Aniboli and President Reagan with a Reagan endorsement and, in large type, ''eight reasons not to re-elect Tom Downey.'' Mr. Aniboli has also printed an 11- page ''information'' booklet on the records of Mr. Downey and himself as well as the demographics of the Second Congressional District. Steve Soloman, Mr. Downey's Washington press aide who is now working out of Long Island for the campaign, said that another measure of the seriousness of the contest was that Mr. Aniboli was ''particularly strident.'' Mr. Downey said he expected to spend up to $250,000 to meet the challenge. As a member of the House Ways and Means Committee and as chairman of the Congressional Arts Caucus, the 35-year-old Mr. Downey has been able to attract considerable funds from outside the district this year and in past campaigns. Representative William Carney, who had a surprisingly close call in the Republican primary last month, has appointed Michael Forbes of Sag Harbor as his re-election campaign coordinator. Mr. Forbes formerly worked for a Democrat, Representative Samuel Stratton of Schenectedy. Mr. Forbes's appointment was designed to shore up Mr. Carney in the East End of his district,where his Republican primary opponent, County Legislator Gregory J. Blass, ran strongly. Mr. Forbes had previously worked in the campaigns of two Montauk Republicans - Perry Duryea and Assemblyman John Behan.

168-> THE NATION ; Four Poor YearsFor Blacks
Polls consistently show that President Reagan is held in low esteem by black Americans, and a report by the Center on Budget and Public Priorities, a nonprofit research group in Washington, may help explain why. The center, which frequently criticizes the Administration, said in a study released last week that Mr. Reagan's policies had devastated poor blacks and threatened the black middle class. The study, ''Falling Behind: A Report on How Blacks Have Fared Under the Reagan Policies,'' was based on recent government and private research. It concluded that blacks generally had lower incomes and higher poverty and unemployment than they did in 1980, and that the economic gap between blacks and whites had widened, with black family income declining by 5.3 percent, after inflation. Among black families, those with two parents and one income were the hardest hit, experiencing an average loss of $2,000 in disposable income. At the same time, poverty among blacks reached its highest proportion, almost 36 percent, since the Census Bureau began collecting such data in 1966. Unemployment among blacks went from 14.4 percent in 1980 to 16 percent two months ago. ''We are pursuing policies that actually make black Americans worse off and divide them further from white America,'' said Robert Greenstein, director of the center.

169-> METROPOLITAN AREA RUSHES TO ADD PRISON CELLS
Racing to catch up with a burgeoning inmate population that shows few signs of abating, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have embarked on vast prison construction programs with a combined cost of nearly $1 billion. From the tip of southern New Jersey to the northern borders of New York and Connecticut, state prisons are being built at a record pace. To accomplish this, officials are using construction shortcuts, including prefabricated structures and the building of as many as four prisons with the same basic design plan. But prison officials acknowledge that even this accelerated pace may not solve the problem of overcrowded prisons. Inmates, the officials say, are going to prison in ever larger numbers and often are staying longer. State officials attribute the rising number of inmates and longer prison terms in large part to tougher sentencing and parole laws adopted by legislatures in recent years. The more restrictive laws, according to criminal-justice specialists, reflect public attitudes favoring stricter law and order. Experiments Under Way ''It's like a big funnel,'' said James B. Flateau, a spokesman for the New York State Department of Correctional Services. ''The courts are at the larger end sending everyone in, but we're at the other end. We've got to find room for them.'' Increasingly, the three states are experimenting with ways to ease the overcrowding, such as the early release of selected nonviolent prisoners who are put on intensive supervision and the assigning of convicted persons to training and community service programs as alternatives to prison. The overcrowding in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut mirrors a national problem, according to criminal-justice specialists. The nation's penal institutions - state and Federal - held a record 454,136 inmates on June 30, according to the Justice Department, nearly 10 percent over capacity and almost double the inmate population of 10 years ago, the department said. Because it will take years before all the new prisons in the New York metropolitan area can be completed, correction officials are resorting to expedients to try to cope with the inmates they have. In Connecticut, top officials of the State Correction Department have been shuttling as many as 150 inmates a week among the 13 state prisons to fill every available bed or to relieve an facilities. Fridays are the worst days, the officials said, because they have to make sure every inmate will have a place to sleep over the weekend. ''It's that bad and that tight,'' said Raymond M. Lopes, the State Correction Commissioner. ''We play checkerboards.'' In the New York State prisons, when an inmate goes to the infirmary for an illness, his belongings go with him so someone else can use his cell. When the inmate gets out of the infirmary, room must be found for him in another cell or another prison. As a result, there are about 800 inmates ''constantly on the move'' in the state prison system, according to Lawrence T. Kurlander, Governor Cuomo's Director of Criminal Justice. It requires a computer in Albany to keep track of the widespread transfers, but state officials said this ''backfilling'' or ''double-encumbering'' of cells, as they call it, is cheaper than building another 800-bed, maximum- security prison at a cost of $80 million or more. 'Safety Valves' And Crisis Management As the overcrowding squeeze has tightened and as Federal courts have ordered limits on the inmate capacity at some prisons as a result of prisoners' lawsuits, some states have prepared emergency measures. Connecticut's General Assembly earlier this year approved legislation, described as a safety valve, to permit the release of selected nonviolent inmates under close supervision before the end of their terms if the overcrowding reaches emergency levels that have yet to be determined. The state is preparing regulations to carry out the new law, possibly as early as next spring. New Jersey also has given Governor Kean the authority to release inmates if state officials determine there is an overcrowding emergency, but the state has not used it. ''Overcrowding has turned the prison system into crisis management,'' said Robert Gangi, executive director of the New York Correctional Association, a 140-year-old public-interest group that studies criminal-justice issues. Prison officials, Mr. Gangi said, are forced to spend too much time finding room for inmates and not enough time on their rehabilitation. ''They are overwhelmed by the overcrowding problem,'' he said. State officials, such as Mr. Kurlander, readily acknowledge the dangers and problems caused by overcrowding. ''The issue of overcrowding occupies the top administrators' time each and every day to the point where it becomes difficult to manage the system,'' he said. ''They're constantly looking for bed space.'' Cause of Uprisings Overcrowding was cited as a cause of a three-day uprising at the state prison in Ossining, N.Y., in January 1983, during which 19 guards were held hostage. In September 1983, 1,700 inmates at the state prison in Attica, N.Y., staged a work strike to protest what they said were intolerable conditions, including overcrowding. While officials in the three states say they have undertaken major and sometimes politically difficult programs in the past two years to deal with the overcrowding, they still face steadily rising numbers of inmates. At the end of August, New York prisons held 33,028 inmates - 116 percent of capacity. There were 20,000 inmates in 1978 and only 12,500 in 1972. In the first five months of this year, 6,125 new inmates went into New York prisons but only 4,849 were released. At the end of August, there were 12,645 inmates in the New Jersey prison system, but 1,178 of them were in county jails because the prisons did not have enough room. The state has projected an inmate population of nearly 15,000 by the beginning of 1987. Connecticut, with 5,451 inmates at the end of August in a prison system designed for 4,322, is expected to have more than 5,900 inmates by 1987. A Trickle-Down Effect For Local Jails The overloading at the state prisons, in turn, has caused a backup of inmates in the county and local jails, particularly in New York and New Jersey, adding to the already serious overcrowding in many of those facilities. At the end of August, there were about 600 prisoners in county and local jails awaiting transfers to New York prisons. The county jails generally hold people awaiting trial or serving sentences of less than a year. Inmates with sentences of longer than one year are sent to state prisons. New Jersey's overflow of more than 1,100 state prisoners in county jails has increased slightly in recent months, although it is well under the peak of 1,700 state prisoners in county jails in 1982, state officials said. For New York State, the inmate population soared in 1980 and 1981 after the Legislature adopted a law requiring a mandatory prison sentence for a person convicted of a second felony and after upstate judges were assigned to criminal trial courts in New York City to reduce court backlogs. Average Sentence Increased Those two actions alone added about 3,000 inmates to New York prisons, according to the Department of Correctional Services. After New Jersey began imposing mandatory minimum sentences in 1979, the average length of a sentence increased to seven years from five and almost half the new prisoners coming into the state prisons, well above initial projections, are serving mandatory minimum terms, according to the State Department of Correction. In Connecticut, under a 1981 law allowing a judge to set a fixed sentence instead of a maximum and minimum term, the average sentence being served for every major offense has increased substantially, according to state correction officials. Procedural Proposals Due The increase in prison terms is prompting re-examination of the sentencing laws. A New York commission, created last year, is scheduled to recommend to the Legislature next January new procedures under which a judge would set fixed sentences. At present, a judge sets a maximum and minimum term, and a parole board decides the actual release date. Criminal-justice specialists differ, however, on whether such a change would result in longer or shorter sentences in actual practice. Earlier this year, Connecticut created a 14-member commission of state legislators to consider establishing sentencing guidelines that would allow a judge to take into account the severity of a crime and the past criminal behavior of the defendant. The guidelines, if adopted by the General Assembly, could reduce the number of persons being sent to prison for relatively minor offenses, legislators said. A $730 Million Solution In New York State Although the prison overcrowding problem had been worsening for years, it has only been in the past two years that most of the extensive construction programs have got under way in the metropolitan area. ''I think overcrowding had to almost physically happen before you could get attention,'' said William H. Fauver, New Jersey's Correcton Commissioner. ''We had been out front on this for years, but it was always seen as self-serving.'' ''It's like predicting a summer drought in December and urging people to save water,'' he said. ''They don't start saving until July.'' While costs vary from place to place, in New York State it costs about $50,000 to build one cell in a minimum-security prison, $75,000 for medium security and $100,000 for maximum security, including the cost of extra prison personnel and support services for the inmates. Despite the high cost, all three states are building new prisons and searching for additional cells at what state officials said is a record pace. New York State plans to add nearly 8,600 prison beds by 1986. Four to Open This Year ''It's historic - 8,600 new cells at a cost of $730 million,'' Mr. Kurlander said. As part of the program, the state is building four, 500-bed, medium-security prisons upstate at Coxsackie, Groveland, Attica and Albion. All four will begin opening in stages this year, with the prison at Coxsackie taking inmates Monday. To speed the construction and to save money, all four of the concrete-and-steel structures are being built with the same basic design, and all four are being built on land the state already owned adjacent to existing prisons. But while the state will open nearly 3,000 new prison beds this year, it will be losing others, starting with the scheduled closing Monday of a state-run prison on the grounds of the former Pilgrim State Psychiatric Center at Brentwood, L.I. The Brentwood prison, known as the Long Island Correctional Facility, has housed about 500 state prisoners plus an overflow of inmates from overcrowded jails in Nassau and Suffolk Counties and from New York City. Governor Cuomo, in a campaign promise to Brentwood residents, said he would close the facility at the end of this year, but moved up the deadline by three months after two inmates were killed in brawls last February. Prefabs and Conversions In Jersey and Connecticut New Jersey, carrying out a 1982 plan of Governor Kean, is in the midst of a $225 million building program to add 5,200 new prison beds by 1987. A 400-bed prison is under construction and expected to open next year in the middle of downtown Camden, and work is starting on another 1,000-bed prison in Newark. Both will be medium-security prisons. Within the last year, New Jersey also completed what its officials said is the nation's largest prefabricated prison, at Leesburg, in Maurice River Township in southern New Jersey. Built with preconstructed modular units, the 1,000-bed, medium-security prison was completed in two phases of just six months each. The cost was about half that of building a conventional steel-and-concrete prison, state officials said. Connecticut, with a prison population less than half the size of New Jersey's, opened bids in July to begin a $21 million expansion of its prison at Enfield, near the Massachusetts border. A 500-bed, minimum-security prison will be built, and the existing 550-bed, minimum-security prison at Enfield will be converted to medium security. Connecticut also has begun planning the construction of another 500-bed medium-security prison and a 400-bed jail for persons awaiting trial, but officials said no sites had yet been chosen. Actual Needs Uncertain Decisions on whether to commit large sums of money to build new prisons are complicated, according to state officials, by uncertainty over how many cells will be needed. Connecticut, for example, is projecting that its prison population will peak and begin to decline slightly in the early 1990's, mainly because of an expected population decline of men in the 18-to-34-year-old age bracket, the group that comprises the largest number of inmates. ''I don't want to build fortresses and have them empty 10 to 15 years down the road,'' Gov. William A. O'Neill said earlier this year. New York and New Jersey officials said that, because of so many variables in such things as crime rates, sentencing and parole policies, they were reluctant to project the inmate population far into the future. Both states, however, foresee increases over the next few years. ''There are a lot of unknowns,'' Mr. Kurlander said. ''Projections are just that. I've seen some that were accurate and some that were grossly inaccurate. Our best estimate is that 8,600 new cells will do the job, but every now and then I get this gnawing feeling.'' NEXT: Innovative approaches to prison construction.

The 105 schools in the nation's chief college football division overwhelmingly rejected today a proposal for a postseason championship game. The margin of the decision probably means that the schools will not even consider a championship playoff again for the next couple of years. The action came on the second and final day of meetings in this Chicago suburb by the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division I-A schools. In a straw vote by show of hands, with no official count, it appeared that about 70 percent of them opposed the idea of a single championship game that would have been played in early January, after the annual bowl games. Had there been a preference for the game, the N.C.A.A. Council would have probably submitted the proposal to the annual convention of the organization next January for a final and binding vote by the I-A schools. But after today's straw vote, John Davis, the N.C.A.A.'s secretary-treasurer and chairman of the meetings here, said, ''I don't think the council will have to even consider the issue now.'' Division I-A football is the only upper-division sport in the N.C.A.A. that does not have a national championship game, and as a result its champion is widely considered to be whatever school finishes on top in the season-ending polls compiled by the news agencies. For some time, a title game has had its advocates, who point to the additional excitement and millions of extra dollars that would be generated for college football. But opponents cite the interruption in academic pursuits that could result from a longer season for the players. And the major bowls, whose representatives here lobbied vigorously against the proposal, fear that a championship would diminish the appeal of their games. Meanwhile, Frank Easterbrook, an N.C.A.A. attorney, said the association would file papers in Federal District Court in Oklahoma City early next week as a first step to learning what role, if any, the organization may continue to play in formulating a national plan for the televising of college football. The N.C.A.A.'s exclusive control of such telecasts was struck down Wednesday by the Supreme Court. The Court left open the possibility of reduced N.C.A.A. direction, but it was left to Juan Burciaga, the Federal judge in Oklahoma City who first heard the antitrust suit that led to Wednesday's decision, to determine the extent of that direction. The meeting here adjourned today without the adoption of any alernative plan. But, with the football season only two months away, the College Football Association, a group of 63 of the nation's biggest powers, voted to have all members notify the C.F.A. leadership by July 12 whether they wanted to have this association put together a package. Schools within the Big Ten and Pacific-10 Conferences are not members of the C.F.A. But the C.F.A. also asked those schools to notify the two leagues by that date whether they would be willing to abide by a coalition plan involving the two conferences and the C.F.A. However, officials of ABC and CBS, the two major networks that have expressed eagerness to continue football telecasts under a national plan, said they wanted to wait for Judge Burciaga's decision, even beyond July 12, to see what part the N.C.A.A. would be permitted to play. Walter Byers, executive director of the N.C.A.A., said he felt that ''a substantial majority of Division I-A institutions'' would opt for whatever N.C.A.A. plan the judge might permit. In a related matter, James Zumberge, the president of the University of Southern California, announced today that U.S.C. would try to sell its television rights to the highest bidder. U.S.C. is entering the second season of an N.C.A.A. probation that was to have prohibited the Trojans from appearing on television. But Wednesday's decision has made that prohibition uncertain. The Supreme Court made clear in its ruling that the N.C.A.A. had a major role to play in enforcing intercollegiate rules. But even Byers was uncertain of the wording of the N.C.A.A. sanctions that were imposed on U.S.C. following the finding that, among other violations, its players had sold game tickets at inflated prices. If the wording of the sanctions was that U.S.C. could not play on TV at all during the probation, then presumably the school and the N.C.A.A. could be headed for conflict. It might be a different matter, though, if the sanctions said only that the Trojans could not appear under any N.C.A.A. TV plan. TV Pacts for 2 Conferences ST. LOUIS, June 29 (AP) - Sports Time Cable Network, acting on contingency plans previously arranged, said today it would televise 12 football games this fall from both the Missouri Valley and Mid-American Conferences. Larry Albus, general manager of Sports Time, said he expected to add college games to the all-sports subscription network, which serves 15 states mostly in the Midwest.

171-> AROUND AMERICA BY RAIL
Imagine sitting comfortably in bed with a glass of champagne and watching the most spectacular scenery in the United States pass by. It's possible in Amtrak's deluxe sleeper cars. On a 8,013-mile trip recently on five trains from New York to New Orleans to Los Angeles, to Seattle, to Chicago and back to New York, there were glimmering sunsets, snow- covered mountains, the rolling Pacific, waterfalls, magnolia trees, rice paddies, cactus-dotted deserts, oil derricks, llamas, logging country, miles and miles of fruit trees and flowers and much more. There were also glimpses of some of the more unattractive scenery this country has to offer - yards filled with junk metal, mountains of spent tires, monotonous stretches of warehouses, tumble-down shanties propped up alongside red clay backroads and Indian reservations, the thought of the conditions under which the Indians must live lingering in our memory long after we had passed the reservations. All of this is America, and it was a visual feast consumed aboard the Crescent, the Sunset Limited, the Coast Starlight, the Empire Builder and the Lake Shore Limited, some of Amtrak's most popular trains, which traverse more than one-third of the system's route. The trip took two weeks, allowing my husband and me a chance to spend a day or two or three at each train's destination point.Each leg of the trip began with a long walk to the back of the train where the sleeper cars are attached. This saves coach passengers from having to make their way through the sleeper section to get to dining cars and other public areas of the train, and it also assists the attendants in maintaining security. (The bedroom doors cannot be locked from the outside.) Traveling the countryside in bed is a luxurious experience. But the bedrooms, even the deluxe ones, were small. Not uncomfortably so, but compact. After all, one is on a train. To recline together in the lower berth, which unfolds level with the window (the upper berth offers an unobstructed view of the ceiling), requires a companion with a sunny disposition and an unfailing tolerance for the other person's elbows and knees. The bedrooms in the older cars that are still in use in the East have an efficient design. Not one inch of their rounded metal, Art Deco interiors is wasted. Everything fits neatly. The lower beds in the newer Superliners are wider, but the rooms, which are on the top level of the double-decker trains, were a lot less interesting with their carpeted walls. This trip is not recommended for the novice rail passenger or the hyperactive. It is a long trip, and once aboard, you have to remain aboard at least until the next stop. You are forced to relax and therein was the attraction for us. If one tires of the other's exclusive company, there's the club car with snacks and drinks and socializing, or the observation cars, where you can view the countryside en masse. The Crescent between New York and New Orleans was an old, no-frills train with an attendant who was pleasant but did not attend. Promised morning coffee did not arrive. And lunch was over two hours earlier than she had said it would be, forcing some passengers to make do with packaged sandwiches from the snack car. The case of Tattinger we had brought aboard helped the meal considerably. Nevertheless, the train left on time, arrived only five minutes late and treated passengers to one of the most unusual sights of the trip as it traversed the last 5.75 miles into the Crescent City on a trestle over Lake Ponchartrain. There was water on both sides of the track and sometimes a sliver of land from which rickety wooden walkways led to houses built on stilts above the shimmering lake. Some houses had walkways with gates. The Sunset Limited from New Orleans to Los Angeles - 2,022 miles - proved to be a supertrain with super service, providing a much smoother ride than the Crescent. With windows in the bedroom door, sleeper passengers could see out both sides of the train at once. And surprise! It had a working hand- held shower. As with the Coast Starlight, Amtrak's most popular long-distance train, the Sunset Limited has a sense of the pleasure that its passengers take in traveling the rails. Railroad employees took pains to make the trip more enjoyable. Dee Warren, a sleeper-car attendant, was thoughtful, sweet and efficient, rushing around answering buzzers while at the same time speaking in even tones to a passenger's child at his heels who was disappointed that the train wasn't longer. The dining room crew was also charming, with John Lillard, one of the red-vested attendants, inducing roars of laughter when he told jokes in a fog-horn Southern drawl. There wasn't a baby's cheek that he didn't tweak. Identical menus on each train were a major disappointment, so to make the best of a bad situation, a taste test was devised to assess the kitchens' competence. Steak was ordered on each train and at $9.75, it was freshly cooked and came as ordered, perfectly rare. The microwaved chicken Kiev was tasty at $6.25. Each meal was served with salad, packaged salad dressing, rolls and butter and a beverage. Warm, packaged apple pie, $1.25, was suprisingly good. The new textured tablecloths were not offensive and each table contained a vase of silk flowers. On the Lake Shore Limited and the Empire Builder, dining-car service was slow and trays invariably came with items missing. One attendant said he had lost five pounds retrieving forgotten foods and condiments. There are no tables for two in the dining car, so couples or singles usually have company at meals, and the companionship may not always be to one's liking. For example, en route from New Orleans, a man in cowboy hat, silver-tipped boots and a drawl that wouldn't quit attached himself to two elderly women. He ate with them and played cards with them and in his loud voice amused them with tales of a wife who left him, a child unknown and of winning ''big bucks'' in Las Vegas. Somehow none of it seemed believable and even if the rest of the dining car didn't care to hear him, he appeared to love the sound of his own voice. Then he bet one woman dinner. She said no and that was that. Other diners stared at their food afraid to glance at each other to share a smile over his being cut to size. All along the way, tours large and small got on and off. At one stop in Mississippi, 30 second graders boarded, two by two, each wearing paper Amtrak conductor's caps and carrying other train paraphernalia. The conductor announced their arrival and welcomed them aboard. They got off a few stops later to return home. Later graduating seniors on a class trip boarded. During the day, they queued up in the snack car. And at night, the coach section resembled a huge slumber party with pillows and bed linens sprawled all around. A group going to Chicago for a religious retreat held a sing-along in the club car. And there were marathon, smoke-choked card games and some unabashed wooing among apparently unattached passengers. On the few occasions when the conductor called passengers' attention to sights on the opposite side of the train, bedroom doors opened and we got to see our neighbors. The sunset from the Sunset Limited, the main event, is an awesome thing to see. One imagines that the train slows for just a few seconds when the view is just right. Instead, the sensation one feels probably comes from a catching of breath as the brillant yellow- orange yolk comes into view just outside Beaumont, Tex. At that instant, the big Texas sky is resplendent with colors ranging from burnt orange to gray-blue, and those hues were reflected silvery and shimmering in the water- sogged rice paddies that alternated with oil refineries. That night, the gentle rocking of the train made sleep irresistible. The next day near Sanderson, sheep and goats could be seen running all over the sandy, flat terrain. There was also a roving wild boar, herds of black steers with white faces, tumbleweed, deserted stock yards, clusters of cactuses and in the midst of all this nature, white saucer antennas poised outside isolated farmhouses. Just outside El Paso, the Sunset Limited crosses the Rio Grande going into New Mexico. ''The Christ of the Rockies,'' a statue atop 4,756-foot Sierra de Cristo Rey is visible. It is 27 feet tall and stands on a 9-foot base. Continuing north and west, near Deming, N.M., the train crosses the Continental Divide, the lowest crossing of the Continental Divide in the United States. Later on our journey, a northern crossing will be made. This is frontier land, the stuff - literally - of which westerns were made. The train pulls into Yuma, Ariz., at 3:10 A.M., and one imagines that the train's schedule was devised by someone familiar with the movie ''3:10 to Yuma,'' in which Van Heflin single-handedly, when his whole town won't help him, manages to put bad-guy Glenn Ford on a train that leaves at 3:10 (P.M.) to get him to trial. The train pulls into Los Angeles before 8 A.M. and the next leg of the trip resumes the next morning on the Coast Starlight, another Superliner. The pictures of scenery as seen at sunset from the windows of the Coast Starlight in Amtrak's newspaper and magazine advertisements do not exaggerate the beauty of the trip. But they give no hint of the other things to see, when the sun is directly overhead. The green hills do roll here, and now and then clusters of cows are seen seeking shade under low trees. Farther along are rows and rows of orange and lemon trees. Oil derricks posed like praying mantis also dot the fields. Coming into Santa Barbara, with the Pacific at its front, one can see offshore drilling rigs at a distance and closer in people windsurfing and swimming in wetsuits. For many miles north of Santa Barbara, the Starlight skirts the coast, running a few yards from the surf, much closer than is possible by car. Occasionally, the front of the train can be glimpsed as it snakes along. The next morning found snow blanketing the Cascade Range and the Willamette National Forest in Oregon. The descent from the Cascades into Willamet Valley was slow and spectacular, with all manner of evergreens bearing up majestically under a heavy snow fall. During the descent, the snow turns to rain. Outside, deer forage oblivious to the train. Inside the dining car during breakfast, John Finnegan and Lionel Johnson coo for the babies. The conductor, speaking over the public address system, which works - surprisingly - points out a rose- colored, white-trimmed bridge and says there's time for two snap shots. Farther along, near Salem, he announces that the train is about to pass the largest herd of llamas in Oregon, and it does. The train picks up Puget Sound around Tacoma as it winds its way to Seattle, where an attendant tells a sleeper-car passenger, incredibly, that the trip from Seattle to New York is too far to take by train. We would not presume to tell Amtrak how to hire people, but one requirement should be a love of trains. On the Empire Builder from Seattle to Chicago, the train passes through forests, past rushing waterfalls, dams and Indian reservations. A little red schoolhouse stands in a clearing at Winton. At the St. Paul/Minneapolis station, a letter in the Minnesota Rail Passenger News catches the eye. ''The statement that Mrs. Claytor refuses to ride on the Northeast Corridor during meal time is wholly untrue.'' Signed: Graham Claytor, Amtrak president. While in Montana traversing Glacier National Park with its hundreds of lakes and streams, the train crosses Stevens Pass, the lowest crossing of the Continential Divide north of New Mexico. The boarding in Chicago's Union Station for the Lake Shore Limited back to New York brought the worst moments of the trip because it was so poorly organized. The gate was not announced until shortly before boarding, and in the ensuing rush an elderly man fell. An Amtrak employee attempted to herd sleeper car passengers into a coach section. Upon entering the sleeper car, an attendant told us we could not take our luggage to our room. In response to questions about that, our bags were snatched away. Voices were raised, luggage passed between hands. Later came the explanation that the baggage supposedly would not fit in the rooms. The baggage did fit, though - beautifully. We made no complaint, but there were a lot of hard feelings. More champagne helped (the luggage was filled with the bubbly), but the hard feelings persisted all the way to New York. The attendant did not smile once; however, he did bring back some of the nostalgia of train trips from years ago when he walked through the sleeper cars announcing meals and then knocking for a final announcement. The gratitude that this gesture engendered, however, was almost totally lost because the dining-car service was slow and incompetent. The last part of the last leg of the trip was stunning as the train edged down the Hudson River Valley, passing ponds with swans and patches of blossoming lilacs and dogwood. Near Poughkeepsie, we passed Bannerman's Island, a castle-like structure built in 1900 to resemble a Rhenish robber baron's stronghold and used as an armaments storehouse. There were other points of interest, too, such as Constitution Island, Sugar Loaf Mountain and Dunderberg Mountain, known as Thunder Mountain, where goblins who start summer storms are said to dwell. Then, all too soon, it was under the Tappan Zee Bridge and a little later, under the 127-year-old Aqueduct Bridge and into Manhattan on the 138th Street draw bridge as the scenery became familiar and the train made its way to Grand Central Terminal, the end of the line. If you're planning a train trip Fares Amtrak's fares generally change with the season, and there are almost always special deals. For details, go to any Amtrak office, write the Amtrak Distribution Center, Box 7717, Itasca, Ill. 60143, or call 800-872- 7245. The All Aboard America Fares allowed my husband and me to travel the entire route for a base fare of $299 each, plus the cost of bedrooms. The plan remains in effect through the end of June for passengers who purchase tickets by the end of this month. A similar plan, but at higher fares and with some additional restrictions, is expected to be announced when the current plan expires. Amtrak divides the country into three regions; the special fare varies with how many regions are traversed. For one region, the base fare is $175, for two, $225 and for three, $299. These special tickets cannot be used for travel in connection with Club Car, Metroliner, Auto Train or Week of Wheels trips. Sleeping accommodations must be reserved. Be mindful that holidays may pose a problem and that New York-to-Florida trains are extremely popular. There are three basic types of accommodations, ranging from slumber coaches to bedrooms, but not all types are available on all trains. Charges for sleeping accommodations vary from train to train. On the Southern Crescent the range is from $27 to $117 a person in double occupancy. On the Sunset Limited: $54.50 to $99.50. On the Coast Starlight: $35.50 to $62.50. On the Empire Builder: $57 to $108.50. And on the Lake Shore Limited: $31.50 to $90. Amenities An old tradition has been brought back in the East: Sleeping-car passengers may put their shoes in lockers and have them shined overnight. Passengers in sleeping accommodations between New York and Florida receive complimentary dinner and breakfast. They also get a gift package of wine, cheese, crackers and a stationery set, a good-night sweet placed on their pillows and a morning newspaper. If you bring your own champagne, the attendant will supply a shallow bucket of ice. We prefer a deeper bucket and bring our own, which the attendant fills with ice. We tip $2 each time. Guide dogs, but no pets, are permitted. Packing and Other Hints Sleeping-car passengers may carry on board any baggage that can be safely stowed in their rooms, and all long-distance trains offer checked baggage service between major cities. We take two medium-size pieces of luggage and put clothing and toiletries that we expect to need on the train in one. The other goes in a corner or on an overhead rack. Be sure you have necessities such as a case for contact lenses and enough contact solution. Also bring asprin and Alka-Selzer; the vendors often run out of them. Because you'll be traveling through several climes, you might want to bring a sweater. There is a wool blanket for each bed. If you sleep only in the bottom bunk and need another blanket, ask the attendant for the one from the top bunk. Each bedroom has its own air- conditioning vents, which may be closed if one is too cool, and there is a small fan above the door, which you can turn on and off as you please. Dress is informal all over the train. There's no need to bring soap, towels or washcloths; they are provided.

172-> TOJOURS GUADELOUPE
Frank J. Prial is a metropolitan reporter and wine columnist for The New York Times. Late on Oct. 31, 1967, a battered Convair rattled to a stop in front of the tin-roofed terminal at Le Raizet, the main airport of Guadeloupe, the French outpost in the Caribbean. We six or seven passengers had spent most of the day at San Juan Airport, 300 miles to the north, waiting for the airline, Caribair, to piece together a usable plane from a collection of junks. Once past the sleepy customs man, the rest of the group slipped into the night, leaving me with an ancient Citro"en taxi, its unenthusiastic driver and the prospect of a long trip to the Fort Royal Hotel. During the ride, there was only the pitch-dark, seemingly endless road, the barking of dogs - and the skulls. In every hut window, in small clearings and all along the road glistened skulls, each with a burning candle, and no other lights. Oct. 31 is the Day of the Dead, the eve of Toussaint, the feast of All Saints - Halloween. It was eerie, unsettling. I've returned to Guadeloupe often since then and have come to love its not always harmonious blend of French culture and a far older African dispensation. But never since that first night have I seen the two so dramatically combined. I'd found a special place . . . even after I had discovered that most of the ''skulls'' were actually conch shells. The planes are better now, and they arrive in daylight. As the jet skims in over the cane fields to land at a newer, shinier Le Raizet, tall white buildings loom on the edge of Pointe- a- Pitre, Guadeloupe's commercial capital. They are the first signs of a new Guadeloupe. Driving into Pointe- a-Pitre this summer, there were others. Once lined with ramshackle garages and rum shops, the road now boasts a Prisunic supermarket, a color-photo processing plant and that ubiquitous symbol of middle-class life, a home repair and garden center. Some of the potholed, two-lane roads fanning out of the city have been widened to four lanes. Alas, the automobile population has easily outdistanced the improvements. There are about 320,000 people on Guadeloupe, and a car or truck for every third one of them. The apartment buildings, the roads, the stores, the university - a branch of the University of Bordeaux - all reflect the unique stability of Guadeloupe and the French Caribbean. Guadeloupe, like Martinique and French Guiana, is a Department of France, as much a part of that country as Hawaii is a part of the United States. Which, from the North American Francophile's point of view, is not bad at all. Guadeloupe combines a visit to France with a trip to the Caribbean. Driving along the coast road in St. Francois, for example, or dozing on the beach at Ste. Anne while a French family picnics nearby, or sipping wine under a striped awning at the Poisson d'Or seaside restaurant in Port Louis, it's easy to imagine being in the south of France. Francis Delages' La Plantation, at the new marina outside Pointe- a-Pitre, is as elegant a small restaurant as anything in Paris (and his wine list is better than many in Paris). Along the south shore of Grande-Terre, the eastern half of Guadeloupe, a colony of medium-size, Miami Beach-style hotels has grown up in the town of Gosier. When the hotels began to open in the early 1970's, snobbish old-timers said package-tour nonentities soon would take the best tables in the town's restaurants and block all the views. It didn't happen. Package-tour types, mostly from Europe, stick close to their hotels, where everything is included in the price. The same is true for the Club Mediterranee crowd, mostly from New York. They scramble from the plane each Saturday and, giggling and chattering, are bused off to their prepaid bacchanal. Rarely are they seen or heard on the island until they turn up at Le Raizet a week later to go home. In the piston-and-prop days, visitors tried some French and wanted little more than decent food with their sun and sand. Their vacation style was more likely to be European lazy than American frantic or Club Med organized. There was only one successful, albeit small, tourist hotel on Guadeloupe then: Mario Petrelluzzi's Grand Corsaire in Gosier. It had eight spartan cottages, an open-air dining room overlooking the sea and simple but excellent food. It was not American. ''The answer for Guadeloupe is not the hot dog or bacon and eggs,'' Mario once said. ''It is good service and making ourselves known.'' Mario scoffed at developers with plans for big hotels, golf courses and tennis courts. He believed that Guadeloupe should not compete with Americanized islands. And, in fact, many of Guadeloupe's big hotels have failed or had difficulty surviving. But there have always been a few small hotels tucked away on hidden beaches or in the hills, and now - even though Mario and the Grand Corsaire are both gone - there are more. Earlier this year, I visited half a dozen of them, including the elegant Toubana, on a promontory high over the beach at Ste. Anne, on Grande-Terre, and the tiny Auberge de la Distillerie in the cool foothills of the Parc Naturel on Basse-Terre. These little inns are not for everyone. Someone may speak English, but probably not much. For those adventurous enough to use high school French, the reception will be warm and encouraging. A few rounds of rum punches will do wonders for a limited vocabulary. Guadeloupe is two islands separated by a small stream: flat Grande-Terre, with its cattle ranches and sugar cane, its vast empty Atlantic beaches, its resort hotels and dozens of good restaurants, and Basse-Terre, to the west, which has sugar in the north and, down its spine, mountains that peak at Soufri ere, an active volcano that hisses, steams and occasionally erupts. At the foot of Soufri ere is the city of Basse-Terre, Guadeloupe's political capital and banana port. This is where Columbus first landed in 1493. The beaches are black volcanic sand, and the vegetation is thick and lush. Here, at Trois Rivi eres, is where the ferry jumps off for Les Saintes, the three quiet little islands where Guadeloupians go to get away from it all. A native Guadeloupian once described the island's culture as a French graft on an African structure, but the influence of France is overwhelming. The bookshops carry Paris newspapers and magazines, and the best-seller lists highlight what is being read on the Left Bank, not the Upper West Side. American papers and magazines are not to be had. New York and Miami are distant, almost irrelevant, and some businessmen make the round trip to Paris two or three times a month. The bigger hotels in Gosier have their own beaches - most of them man-made. But Guadeloupe has miles and miles of natural beaches. Some are guarded by reefs, some pounded by dangerous surf, some lapped by the gentle Caribbean. Some are favored by families, some by divers, some by nudists. Nudism, of course, means no clothes, and is limited to special beaches. Women routinely wear only bikini bottoms at all beaches. Rent a car on Guadeloupe. It's the only way to get to the Pointe des Chateaux, the impressive rock formations at the eastern tip of the island, or to the path to the summit of Soufri ere. It's the best way to visit the Parc Naturel, the deserted beaches or such distant restaurants as the Karacoli, near Deshaies, or the Folie Plage, near Anse Bertrand. Guadeloupian cooking reflects not only the French and African influence but the Indian, too. After slavery was abolished in the mid-19th century, 40,000 Indians were imported as indentured workers. Their descendants comprise 10 percent of the population, and their culture manifests itself in the native cooking. The best of the restaurants, such as Felicite Doloir's Barbaroc, offer local products. Guadeloupe has superb seafood, including a crayfish called ouassous, good chicken, kid, breadfruit, mango, guava and coconut, tart limes and a variety of searingly hot island peppers. But men, especially Frenchmen, do not live by chili pepper alone. There are dozens of authentic French restaurants featuring the cooking of the Landes, for example, or Burgundy or Paris. There is plenty of good wine, at reasonable prices, thanks to the strong dollar. There is excellent beer, including a good local brew called Sagba, and there is fine Guadeloupian rum. It's stronger, smokier, than Barbadian and Puerto Rican rums and makes memorable punches. Each winter, from January through April, the Ecotel, one of the island's two hotel schools, invites chefs from France for two weeks' vacation in exchange for some time with the students and two gastronomic dinners for the public. Arnaud Daguin of the Hotel de France in Auch and Gerard Boyer of the Michelin three-star restaurant that bears his name in Rheims were among last winter's guest stars. Guadeloupe has other ''programs,'' of course. For lovers of organized merriment, the Guadeloupe variety - centered around food and rum - is probably as appealing as any in the hemisphere. Back in 1967, there were no organized activities other than Carnival. Their presence now is a measure of how much has changed. On another level, nothing has changed. The surf still roars at the Pointe des Chateaux, the long white beaches are still empty, and there is still good wine in the remotest roadside bistro. There are four-lane roads now, but on Oct. 31, when the sun plunges into the sea and a million stars come out, those eerie lights will still flicker on the back-country roads. France in the Caribbean Les Auberges LA TOUBANA, St. Anne (telephone: 88-25-57), is set on a promontory high above the beach. There are 32 bungalows with kitchenettes, private gardens and terraces; about $60 a person in a bungalow for two, with breakfast and dinner. The restaurant lists such specialties as vivanneau (red snapper) au beurre, veal cooked in mustard, quail with grapes; dinner for two with wine, about $50. AUBERGE DE LA DISTILLERIE, Route de Versailles, Tabanon, Petit Bourg (85- 25-91), has only 10 rooms, each named after a flower, and one bungalow; double rooms are about $45, with breakfast and dinner. The restaurant serves such Creole specialties as ouassous (freshwater crayfish) and grilled meats; dinner for two, with wine, is about $20 to $40. ECOTEL GUADELOUPE, Gosier (84-15-66), is both an inn and a hotel school; simple double rooms overlooking the pool or gardens are about $53. The restaurant, Le Galion, is staffed by student waiters and cooks; there is a choice of a la carte or set menus. A $12 set meal might include an appetizer of braised conch, court bouillon de poisson (marinated fish slices in a tomato-based sauce) or a curry of chicken or lamb, a salad and a dessert of flambeed bananas or pineapple. Les Restaurants POISSON D'OR, Rue Sadi Carnot, Port Louis (84-90-22), a terrace restaurant looking out over the sea to the mountains of Basse-Terre, specializes in fresh Creole seafood. Dinner for two with wine should not be more than $25. BARBAROC, Petit Canal (84-72-71), is a beachside establishment that serves such Creole dishes as burgots (sea snails) gratines, crab p^ate, puree of breadfruit, roasted sweet potatoes, sweet potato noodles and coconut flan. The house drink, maby, is something like Pernod; home-brewed beer is also available. Lunch (weekends only) or dinner for two, with drinks, is about $35. LE KARACOLI, north of Deshaies (28-41-17), is a casual beachfront restaurant (the decor runs to flowered plastic tablecloths) with such specialties as cod fritters, curries and turtle stew; about $25 for two with beer or wine. FOLIE PLAGE-CHEZ PRUDENCE, at Anse Laborde, beyond Anse Bertrand (84-91-17), is a thatched-roof restaurant on the beach. The set menu of the day might include a curry, palourdes (clams), court bouillon de poisson and bananas flambees; lunch or dinner for two, with beer or wine, is about $25. LA PLANTATION, Galerie Marina, Bas-du-Fort (83-17-81), combines Creole, nouvelle and classic French cuisine in such specialties as a warm salad of goose giblets, c^ote de boeuf with sauce mo"elle and crayfish. Dinner for two, with wine, is about $70 to $80; reservations are recommended.

173-> THE COAL STRIKE: A STRUGGLE AGAINST 'MRS. THATCHER'S BRITAIN'
For almost seven months, Britons have been watching on television a spectacle that has horrified most of them. Several times each week, the nightly newscasts have pictured violence of an unusual kind - coal miners hurling stones, battling the police and blocking trucks in a desperate effort to give their strike some economic impact. These bitter scenes and division in the union - about 50,000 of the 180,000 miners have continued to work - have played into Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's hands. The traditional public sympathy for the men who do such dirty, dangerous work has been submerged in revulsion at violence on the picket line and attempted intimidation of those who have stayed on the job. The lack of solidarity within the National Union of Mineworkers has made it all but impossible for their combative left-wing president, Arthur Scargill, to gain the kind of support he needs from the rest of the British trade-union movement. Last week, in a passionate speech to the annual Labor Party conference, Mr. Scargill sought and gained support for a resolution condemning police violence without mentioning that done by some of his own men. But the union leader, who was served with a writ accusing him of contempt of court, also heard Neil Kinnock, the party leader, make a balanced statement. ''I abhor violence, I damn violence, all violence, without fear or favor,'' Mr. Kinnock said. Mrs. Thatcher remains adamant. On a recent visit to York, she told a news conference that Britain would turn into ''a museum society'' unless old, uneconomic industries were permitted to modernize. She will not be moved, the Prime Minister keeps saying, even if the onset of cold weather and dwindling coal stocks at the generating stations force her to order power cuts in January or February. The dispute centers on modernization, although it has now become, to some degree, a test of political will between Mrs. Thatcher and Mr. Scargill rather than a straight industrial struggle. The Prime Minister and the man she selected to head the National Coal Board, a crusty 72-year-old Scot named Ian MacGregor, who has spent most of his working career in the United States, want to close pits that are not exhausted but are uneconomical to work. Mr. Scargill, who has watched the industry - and his union - shrink steadily over the last two decades, wants to close only those mines that contain no more coal or are unsafe. Repeated attempts have failed to bridge the difference. Modernization Is CostlyMany left-wing politicians and commentators agree that the Coal Board has made a generous offer to the miners, including a pledge that no one currently employed will lose his job. But that is not what the strike is really about. Mr. Scargill appears to be trying to arrest the creation of what is known here as ''Mrs. Thatcher's Britain,'' a society far less dependent on heavy industry. The by-products of that process are more than three million unemployed, and many millions more living in poverty amid urban decay and industrial dereliction across wide sections of the Midlands and northern England, while in the south most people's living standards have risen steadily. That the major resistance has come from the miners is hardly surprising, for they have long formed the vanguard of the British union movement, with their quasi-religious banners and hymns and martyrs. Their position is now under threat not only because of the shrinkage in their numbers, but also because the industry restructuring that Mr. MacGregor proposes would scatter the men and their families, breaking up the minehead villages from which the union has always drawn its strength. Some prominent Britons have in the last few weeks begun to talk about the strike in something other than black-and-white terms. Two bishops, both of them, through no coincidence, from the north, have gained the broadest attention with their barbed comments. The Rt. Rev. David Jenkins, the new Anglican bishop of Durham, a city steeped in mining lore, denounced the Government as ''outrageously self-righteous, deeply inhuman and damnably dangerous.'' The Most. Rev. Derek Worlock, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Liverpool, described the strike as ''a symptom of the failure of our society to come to terms with the post-industrial age.'' He asked: ''What is to happen to whole communities when the industry with which their lives have been bound up and upon which their livelihood has depended is judged to be no longer profitable, practical or even the best way of doing things or of serving the wider community?'' There are signs that Mrs. Thatcher is beginning to see unemployment as a political and social menace at least on a par with the inflation she has so steadfastly battled against. In her recent cabinet shuffle, she moved one of her closest advisers, David Young, into the House of Lords and named him to the cabinet as a minister without portfolio with special responsibility for unemployment, which jumped to 13.6 percent last month. And in an important speech in Washington two weeks ago, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson, termed joblessness Britain's ''one outstanding worry'' and hinted at several new strategies for fighting it.

174-> A REFERENDUM ON MARCOS, HIS RULE AND HIS RELATIVES
More than 1,000 candidates are running for 183 National Assembly seats in the Philippine elections tomorrow. But the campaign, at least on the Government television network, has sometimes resembled a drama of one man's family. Imelda Marcos, the politically powerful wife of President Ferdinand E. Marcos, surprised political observers by announcing that she would not run for re-election to Parliament. She remains governor of metropolitan Manila and local leader of the Marcos party. Mr. and Mrs. Marcos are seen on the television news every night, sometimes dispensing the largesse at her disposal in her other role as a Cabinet minister. Their 28-year-old elder daughter, Imee Marcos Manotoc, is a candidate in the family's home province, Ilocos Norte, where Ferdinand E. Marcos Jr., 25, is Governor. Mrs. Marcos's brother, Benjamin Romualdez, the Philippine Ambassador to Washington, is running in his hometown, Cebu, in the central Philippines. Both relatives are heavy favorites. So is the Marcos party. Things have become very personal. The principal opposition group, the United Nationalist Democratic Organization, or Unido, nominated the former wife of Imee's husband as a candidate in Manila. She is Aurora Pijuan Manotoc, who was Miss International Beauty in 1970. Mrs. Marcos's reaction was stormy. ''How low can they get?'' she said on television. ''The opposition is truly sick, cruel and mean. Poor Imee is still in the Makati Memorial (medical) Center trying to get over a painful and traumatic experience in the loss of a child.'' Her daughter had been persuaded to run to circumvent a deadlock between two Marcos lieutenants in Ilocos Norte. A week later, Mrs. Manotoc suffered a miscarriage. She made early campaign appearances in a wheelchair. Melodrama had touched her before. She secretly married Tommy Manotoc, a basketball coach and businessman, in the United States after he had divorced the beauty queen in the Dominican Republic; divorce is illegal in the Philippines. Soon after returning home, he was kidnapped. His parents blamed the Marcos family, who were known to disapprove of the marriage. Mr. Manotoc reappeared a month later, saying he had been kidnapped by the Communist New Peoples Army. Pressure for FairnessTomorrow's national election will be the first since President Marcos ended eight years of martial law in 1981. He retains powers to order summary arrests, proclaim laws and to abolish Parliament. These powers and the economy are the main issues in the campaign. The assassination last August of former Senator Benigno S. Aquino Jr., Mr. Marcos's principal challenger, uncorked emotions that had been bottled up for years. Anti-Marcos demonstrations in Manila and other cities, although nearly all nonviolent, caused apprehension about stability, and a disastrous flight of capital. Foreign bank credit abruptly stopped, leaving the country with more than $25 billion in debts it cannot pay. Mr. Marcos came under extreme pressure from businessmen and the State Department, whose priorities include the security of important American military bases. Hoping to ease these concerns, Mr. Marcos guaranteed that tomorrow's election would be ''free and fair,'' in contrast to the generally held image of previous voting. But when the campaign formally opened in March, Mr. Marcos abandoned his conciliatory tone. He made retention of his extraordinary powers his central theme, deriding the former system of American-style checks and balances as fraught with ''deadlock and stalemate.'' He accused critics, including by inference Mr. Aquino, of encouraging the Communist-led insurgency that has produced pockets of rebellion in every province. His economic aides also went onto the offensive. Prime Minister Cesar E. A. Virata argued that heavy borrowing abroad has been good for the Philippines, providing roads and other nation-building infrastructure, instead of being the fiscal catastrophe that the opposition says it is. The opposition is hopeful. Former Senator Salvador Laurel, head of Unido, predicts it will win 60 of the 183 seats at stake if the vote is ''reasonably fair;'' if not, 40 seats. Detached political analysts, noting the Marcos's organizational and financial strength, say Mr. Laurel is too optimistic. A boycott, organized by people who say that no election under this regime can be fair, is expected to hurt the opposition more than the Marcos party. Accusations of illegal practices, such as vote-buying, are common. The elections commission has ordered re- registration in five cities and 45 towns because of reported irregularities. Several hundred people have been killed in pre-election violence, most of it officially attributed to Communist guerrillas. Mr. Marcos has laid down his defense in advance. Foreign reporters were ''already shaping public opinion around the world to conclude,'' he said, that if his party wins ''then the elections will have been dishonest and disorderly, and if the opposition wins they will have been honest and peaceful.''

176-> photo of Sarah Vaughan; MUSIC; KEY OFFERINGS OF A HECTIC SEASON
CONNECTICUT'S music schedule for the next couple of weeks is so crowded that the only way to deal with it seems to be to single out one of the many offerings for each day. Today : The Newtown Friends of Music opens its seventh annual series of chamber concerts at the Edmond Town Hall Theater at 4 P.M. with a recital by the dynamic young Mendelssohn String Quartet. Later programs in the subscription series are equally promising, by the way, including appearances by the pianist Richard Goode, the Arioso Chamber Players, the Rogeri Trio and the New York Woodwind Quintet. Call 426-8131 for more details. Tomorrow : Champagne and Strauss waltzes seem to go hand in hand, and there will be free champagne at the Stamford Center of the Arts at 8 P.M. to go along with the bubbly performances of the Vienna Johann Strauss Orchestra. This is the opening concert of a subscription series that will eventually bring I Solisti New York, the Chamber Orchestra of New England, Orpheus and the Mozarteum Orchestra of Salzburg to the center over the next few months. For more details, call 323-2131. Tuesday : The University of Connecticut Chamber Players, an ensemble of top faculty artists, play Ravel, Handel, Hindemith and Beethoven on the Storrs Campus at 8:15 P.M. You can also come back on Thursday for a program by the university's symphony orchestra, or on Oct. 16 to hear the UConn Wind Ensemble and Symphony Band. All of these programs, and lots more throughout the season, are free. Call 486-3728 for a complete arts calendar. Wednesday : A most unusual composer's retrospective will be at the University of Bridgeport, as 14 Connecticut players and singers perform works by Dr. David Barnett, a professor at the university. Dr. Barnett will be piano soloist in several of the scores, with the actress Josephine Barnett offering a narrative guide to her husband's music. This 8 P.M. program, too, is open to the public without charge (255-0158). Thursday : Back at the University of Bridgeport at 8 P.M., you can enjoy the first Connecticut visit of the Philadelphia Pops. Founded five years ago and quickly dubbed the Philly Pops by hometown fans, the orchestra has flourished under the direction of Peter Nero. He not only conducts, but also prepares most of the special pop and jazz arrangements for the ensemble. He not infrequently returns to his first performing love, the piano, especially when the classical direction turns to Gershwin (576-4399). Friday : When about 25,000 people gathered on the New Haven Green last July to hear the final concert of the Summer Jazz Festival, its producer, Brian Alden, decided to carry over that sense of excitement and community participation into the fall. The first New Haven Autumn Jazz Festival - which will bring such legendary figures as Lionel Hampton, Ray Charles, Cab Calloway and Sarah Vaughan to three theaters in the city - extends through Dec. 9, but it starts Friday when Spyro Gyra plays the Shubert Theater (with a repeat on Saturday evening). For more details, call 669-1662. Saturday : The weekend schedule is fairly bulging, ranging from Victor Borge at the Palace in New Haven (789-2120) to the New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players' production of ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' at the Palace in Stamford (325-9570), and including the season openers of the Greenwich, Greater Bridgeport and Eastern Connecticut Symphonies. My Saturday selection, though, is a rather more esoteric event: The recital subtitled ''Magical Colors of Sound,'' intended to focus attention on some of the fine solo performers within the vocal-chamber ensemble known as the Craven Singers. ''It is built into our philosophy to showcase young artists on a larger scale than is often the case today,'' says Dorothy Craven, ''and we start our eighth season hoping to create a larger vehicle for young singers in our area.'' The 8 P.M. concert at the Pequot Library in Southport is devoted largely to the music of Faure and Schubert (255-5155 or 878-5587). Next Sunday : Another of the finest vocal ensembles in the state, the Pro Arte Chamber Singers, mark the start of their 10th season, and the 4 P.M. celebration at the First Presbyterian Church in New Canaan includes a number of favorite selections. On the list: Bach's motet ''Praise the Lord,'' Brahms's ''Liebeslieder Waltzes'' and ''Bestiare,'' a series of whimsical animal portraits by the Belgian composer Jean Absil, along with Swedish folk songs and a Kyrie by Sven-David Sandstr"om, commissioned to mark the Pro Arte anniversary (847-2196 or 762-9016). Oct. 23 : To make up for the night off on Oct. 22, there will be a double- header today: At 8 P.M. the cellist Dmitry Yablonsky joins the Mendelssohn String Quartet to play the glorious Shubert String Quintet as the Waveny Chamber Music Society opens its third season in the Carriage Barn in New Haven (966-0733). In Woolsey Hall at Yale at the same hour, the New Haven Symphony under Murry Sidlin plays Mendelssohn's ''Reformation'' symphony, Prokofiev's ''Classical'' symphony and, with Lucy Shelton the guest soprano, the exquisite ''Four Last Songs'' of Richard Strauss (776-1444). Oct. 24 : In Stamford at 8 P.M., the Alvin Ailey Repertory Ensemble opens the dance series at the Center for the Arts, the company's unique fusion of modern, jazz and classical pieces an exciting reflection of its black American heritage (325-4466). Oct. 25 : Linda Skernick, solo harpsichordist of the Chamber Orchestra of New England and of the New Haven Symphony, gives a free recital at 8 P.M. on the New London campus of Connecticut College. The occasion is the inauguration of the university's new harpsichord, built by Miss Skernick's husband, Yves Albert Feder. The program - focusing on works by the three composers sharing 300th birthdays this season, Handel, Bach and Scarlatti - will be repeated two days later in the Old Meeting House in Chester, although $5 donations are requested there, since it is a benefit for Congregation Beth Shalom of Deep River (526-9295). Oct. 26 : Begin the weekend with chamber music at the Burndy Library in Norwalk by Keith Wilson, a clarinetist on the Yale faculty, Myron Fink, pianist and professor at Hunter College, and the library's music director, Viviane Bertolami, playing violin and viola. They will offer trios by Mozart, Stravinsky, Khachaturian and Bartok, starting at 8:30 P.M. This, too, is a free recital, although donations to the library will be gratefully received (852-6294). Oct. 27 : Since it is another busy Saturday, let's briefly consider three musical enticements: Connecticut Opera's production of ''Man of La Mancha,'' starring John Reardon, is being given at Bushnell Hall in Hartford (performances are also scheduled on Oct. 25 and 26; call 241-0251 for reservations). The Norwalk Symphony opens its season under Jesse Levine at Old Norwalk High School with music of Bach, Dvorak and Mozart, and Jeremy Menuhin as guest pianist, a program that will be repeated on Oct. 29 (847-2986). And the Ridgefield Orchestra plays its season opener under Beatrice Brown at Ridgefield High School, the program listing Verdi, Sibelius, Faure and, with Anthony di Bonaventura as soloist, Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 (438-0782).

177-> Texas Eastern To Sell Unit HOUSTON, Nov. 5 (AP) -
The Texas Eastern Corporation said it would sell its Transwestern Pipeline Company subsidiary to the Houston Natural Gas Corporation for $390 million. Transwestern operates a 4,395-mile pipeline that carries natural gas from west Texas to Oklahoma and California, Texas Eastern said. It said the pipeline carried 279 billion cubic feet of gas last year and had net income for the 12 months ended June 30, 1984, of more than $35 million on sales of about $1.1 billion. The deal gives Houston Natural Gas ''a strong position'' in the California market, ''which we believe has significant growth potential,'' said Kenneth L. Lay, chairman of Houston Natural Gas. Texas Eastern's chairman, I. David Bufkin, said the company decided to sell the subsidiary after concluding that ''the maximum value of Transwestern to our shareholders and its full potential as a transmission company would best be realized through its sale.'' He said Texas Eastern, which also owns the Texas Eastern Pipeline Company, would remain active in the gas pipeline industry.

178-> ASSOCIATES OF BECKETT SEEK TO HALT PRODUCTION
Representatives of the playwright Samuel Beckett are seeking to halt the production of ''Endgame'' that began previews last night and will formally open on Dec. 12 at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass. The representatives contend that the theater is distorting Mr. Beckett's play by changing its setting from a bare, cell-like room to a subway tunnel and by using an overture by the composer Philip Glass. Robert Brustein, the artistic director of the theater, said late yesterday that he would not halt the production. He said that it follows Mr. Beckett's script to the word and that, in spite of the change in the setting and the addition of music, ''it is totally true to the spirit of the play.'' The American Repertory Theater attained the rights to ''Endgame'' from Samuel French, the play publication company, several months ago. Mr. Brustein said that in a May 14 letter to Samuel French he made it clear that the production would include music by Mr. Glass. Joanne Akalaitis, best-known as a director and actress in New York's Mabou Mines troupe, was retained to direct the play. Wrote Stage Directions But during rehearsals, word reached Barney Rosset - the president of Grove Press, which publishes Mr. Beckett's plays and acts as his theatrical agent in the United States - of the subway-tunnel setting and of the Glass overture. Mr. Rosset informed Mr. Beckett and, he said, received a telegram from the playwright asking him to ''refuse permission'' for the production to proceed. ''They have changed, distorted, the setting,'' Mr. Rosset said. ''That's very upsetting to us and to Beckett. They had a normal contract to put on 'Endgame' and we took it for granted that the production would be put on as written - which includes stage directions and designs.'' Mr. Beckett's stage directions for ''Endgame'' include this description of the stage: ''Bare interior. Gray light. Left and right back high up. Two small windows.'' The playwright goes on to describe various props, the attire for the main characters, and even the number of steps they take in the course of the action. As for the music, Mr. Rosset said that Mr. Beckett opposes the addition of music to any of his plays and ordered a score by David Amram excised from the original production of ''Endgame'' in 1959. Right of Interpretation Mr. Brustein said that he personally ''reveres Samuel Beckett above all living playwrights'' and added that the American Repertory Theater had given well-received productions to other Beckett plays, including ''Footfalls'' and ''Waiting for Godot.'' He also said that Mr. Glass had scored several Beckett plays for Mabou Mines without incident. ''The only objection,'' Mr. Brustein said, ''seems to be from hearsay about the set. Nobody has seen the production, so there's a certain inappropriateness about the request. And, beyond that, the right of theater directors and designers to interpret a play seems to be something worth defending. ''We believe,'' Mr. Brustein continued, ''that if any representatives of the Beckett interests see the play, they will not only see that we have been true to it but that we have brought new values to an extraordinary play.''

179-> Bridge:The Steppingstone Can Be Useful, Elegant Maneuver
A declarer who finds at the start of the play that a blocking honor card makes it difficult to score a winner in the dummy can sometimes solve his problem at the finish. He must tiptoe delicately into an opponent's hand at the right moment, a move that is appropriately known as a steppingstone. An elegant example of this maneuver occurred in the diagramed deal. It was played recently at a flourishing New Jersey club, the Glen Rock, which runs 11 duplicate games each week at the Cultural Center in Fair Lawn, N.J. Sitting North was Enid Steinmark of Saddle Brook, N.J., who owns and manages the club together with Lila March of Glen Rock, N.J. In the South position was Dave Cliff of Basking Ridge, N.J., who pioneered the modern trend toward relay bidding. Defense Had Mistimed In response to three clubs, South hit the target immediately with a jump to four spades. When a diamond was led he put up the queen in dummy, winning. He played a second diamond, planning a diamond ruff, but East ruffed and shifted to a heart. West took the ace and led his trump to stop the impending diamond ruff. The defense had mistimed slightly, and Cliff could see light dawning. He overtook the spade jack to play more trumps and reach this ending: NORTH S - H 10 D - C A J 9 8 WEST S - H 9 D K 10 C Q 10 EAST S - H K J 4 D - C 7 5 SOUTH S 2 H Q D A J C K The last trump was led, and West had to give up his remaining heart. Then South cashed the diamond ace and the club king. A diamond lead forced West to win and concede the last trick to dummy's club ace. If East had held the club queen, then the heart king could have been the steppingstone, allowing South to score the club ace. NORTH S J H 10 6 3 D Q 4 C A J 9 8 6 4 2 WEST S 6 H A 9 7 D K 10 7 6 3 2 C Q 10 3 EAST S 8 7 5 4 3 H K J 5 4 2 D 9 C 7 5 SOUTH S A K Q 10 9 2 H Q 8 D A J 8 5 C K Neither side was vulnerable.

181-> EDITORS' NOTE
Under this heading, The Times amplifies articles or rectifies what the editors consider significant lapses of fairness, balance or perspective. A Washington dispatch on May 12 described Central Intelligence Agency efforts to influence El Salvador's presidential election. It quoted a Reagan Administration official who said the agency had covertly subsidized visits to El Salvador by European and Latin American journalists. The Administration official said these journalists - apparently not informed of the C.I.A.'s role in their visit - were also given derogatory information about Roberto d'Aubuisson, the candidate of the far-right Nationalist Republican Alliance. The article went on to quote a United States Embassy spokesman in San Salvador, Donald Hamilton, as saying that Washington had ''contributed to the expenses'' of three groups of foreign journalists who had visited El Salvador and other Central American countries in the last eight months. In the same paragraph, the article said ''it was unclear whether these groups were related to the journalists subsidized by the C.I.A.'' The article should have explained that the trips for foreign journalists referred to by Mr. Hamilton - which occurred in October and December 1983 and February 1984 and involved Europeans, Venezuelans and one Colombian - were part of a Congressionally authorized program sponsored by the United States Information Agency. The U.S.I.A. says the program is intended to explain American foreign policy to audiences overseas.

182-> MOST OF DISPERSED HOUSING PROJECTS IN 87 CITIES ARE SAID TO BE SUCCESSES
Four years ago, James and Geri Morris and a dozen of their neighbors stood in the path of a bulldozer in what they considered a final effort to save their neighborhood. Mr. Morris stood there long enough to be arrested. The Chicago Housing Authority development they were protesting went up anyway. The Morrises now say the two six- unit buildings across the street have not brought the devastation they feared for their Rogers Park neighborhood of frame houses and brick apartment buildings on tree-lined avenues. ''Things have fallen on the milder side,'' Mr. Morris said. ''The neighborhood is louder - cars and parties, more crowded - and there's more presence of minorities. But the people who live there are fine.'' The two buildings were part of the first phase of the housing authority's 2,398-unit program that aims to disperse small public housing developments around the city. Despite some neighbors' complaints, the most dire predictions of opponents of such scattered-site housing did not become a reality in Rogers Park. Most Programs Said to Succeed James Hogan, a University of Seattle professor who is completing a study of such programs, said Chicago and the 87 other cities with such programs had been successful for the most part. Among them are Rochester, Troy, Syracuse and Buffalo. In New York City, the housing authority is managing some small buildings that had been repossessed, but the smallest of the authority's developments have 25 units and New York City has no formal scattered-site program. Mr. Hogan said the housing authorities in his study reported few problems with crime or neighborhood deterioration and that the projects' residents ''are delighted to have the opportunity to move out of economically depressed environments and seem to be more hopeful about the future and more positive about themselves.'' Soon after Maria Freytes and her family moved into their new Housing Authority apartment at 3303 North Central Park here, some teen-agers threw a brick through one of her windows. But she says that she likes her quiet block and the Northwest Side location and that the situation has improved. ''They thought we were all public aid families from the slums, but not everybody can be judged that way,'' Mrs. Freytes said. ''It takes time, but they come around.'' Housing Expert's Criticism Some critics of these programs concede that they have been successful, but for a lucky few. Only 13,000 such units have been built nationally since 1967, according to J. S. Fuerst, a professor of social work at Loyola University who has studied public housing. ''It's stopped all public housing,'' he said, referring to scattered-site housing. ''It's an answer that takes away from the real answer.'' One real answer, he says, is developments of 300 to 400 units that can house many more people but still be ''viable and acceptable.'' He offers as an example such New York projects as the Forest Hills cooperative, which ran into opposition that was successfully resolved. In Chicago, the housing authority's scattered sites are usually maintained as well as others, and residents and neighbors said they were generally satisfied with the buildings' management and their new neighbors. But some white residents of the Rogers Park neighborhood say the buildings at 7433 North Wolcott Avenue caused long-time white residents to leave over fear that more blacks would move into the already integrated neighborhood. 'The People Aren't Bad,' but . . . ''The people who live across the street aren't bad - it's what's come after them,'' said Virginia Smith, who has lived in the area for 14 years. ''Just look at the 'For Sale' signs.'' Mimi McBride, who lives on West Barry Avenue, half a block from another small public housing development, said: ''The number of kids is disproportionate to the rest of the neighborhood, and they have different values about property and noise, but the ones we know are basically nice kids. ''Most of the tenants seem to be O.K. people, and it's better than building projects. My feeling is that if there are going to be people who have a hard time of it, we should do what we can to make things easier for them, even if it inconveniences some of their neighbors.'' Most scattered-site programs were begun in the late 1960's and early 1970's. A Federal judge's decision in an antidiscrimination suit ordering the Chicago Housing Authority to build much of its new housing in white neighborhoods was ''pivotal,'' Mr. Hogan said. Seed Was a Lawsuit ''In 1970 to 1973,'' he said, ''other cities knew what was going down in Chicago and they acted in anticipation that it wouldn't be long before H.U.D. and the courts mandated deconcentration efforts.'' In Chicago in 1966, Alexander Polikoff, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, sued the housing authority and the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development on behalf of Dorothy Gautreaux and five other black residents of housing authority projects. The plaintiffs said the Chicago agency was discriminating by building all its public housing in black neighborhoods. As a result of the action, the authority was ordered to build its next 700 housing units, as well as three of every four subsequent units, in white areas. Last July a similar suit and the possible loss of $10 million in Federal funds forced Yonkers to earmark two sites for low-income housing in white neighborhoods. Aldermen Lose a Veto Power Before 1974, white Chicago aldermen could veto sites proposed for their wards, and no public housing was built in the city until that year, when a court order prohibited aldermanic review. The program has crept forward since then, prodded by the court and by Mr. Polikoff, who has returned to court several times to ask that the program be assigned to an outside overseer. Only 117 units were completed by 1979, when the original decision was modified to allow construction of half the family units in white areas. Soon after the order was modified, Mayor Jane M. Byrne announced that the $100 million scattered-site program would go ahead, but by the summer of 1983 fewer than 400 units had been built or renovated. In July 1983 the housing authority was ordered to acquire at least 390 new units within seven months to prevent the program from going into receivership. Authority officials attributed the delays to a lack of funds, difficulty in finding suitable and affordable properties and with contractors, and opposition from white community groups and aldermen. But the authority beat its January deadline and 642 units have been completed, with 173 under way and 1,561 to go. The authority says it will place as many of the remaining 111 projects meant for white areas as possible in the 19 neighborhoods that have no public housing. Public opoposition, though, continues in many neighborhoods. The Northwest Neighborhood Federation has been pressing the authority for three years to reduce the number of sites planned for its area, arguing that neighborhoods with no public housing should absorb some first. 'Not a Black and White Issue' On the Southwest Side, the Southwest Parish and Neighborhood Federation is protesting two sites in middle-class Marquette Park. The problem, said a federation member, Jean Mayer, is that the sites are near Western Avenue, the border between white and black areas. Mrs. Mayer spoke of declining property values, ''panic peddling'' and white flight. She said residents would accept other sites, if reluctantly, and she insisted that racism was not the reason for their opposition. ''It's not a black-and-white issue, it's green,'' Mrs. Mayer said. ''People don't want to lose their shirts, and we don't want to move to the suburbs.''

184-> GOING OUT GUIDE;
CAMPUS ARTS The only art museum in Queens with its own permanent collection, more than 1,800 pieces, is on the campus of Queens College, at Long Island Expressway and Kissena Boulevard. It is a modern gallery on the second floor of the Paul Klapper Library. The exhibition that ends on Monday in the Godwin-Ternbach Museum displays 90 pieces from the collection of Joseph Ternbach, the collector and art restorer whose name is part of the museum's name. Among the items on display are Babylonian figures and plaques; decorated Greek cups; a 16th-century German tankard; a silver Torah pointer from 19th- century France; a fourth-century B.C. green jadeite ax pendant from Costa Rica; an ivory flask from 17th-century India and a bronze figure of a horse from third-century China. The exhibition is tastefully and clearly laid out, with easy-to-read captions and good lighting. In the hallway outside the gallery is an exhibition of ''Gyotaku: Japanese Fish Printing,'' by Esther Krichevsky. Open free, from noon to 5 P.M. today and tomorrow, from noon to 8 P.M. Monday. Information: (718) 520- 7323. THE IRISH An Claidheamh Soluis, which has as its other-language title the Irish Arts Center, offers New Yorkers many different facets of the Irish life in its programs of plays. The newest production there is called ''Letters From a Matchmaker,'' adapted by Jim Sheridan from John B. Keane's book of the same name. It tells of the loneliness of the Irish bachelors in the hills of western Kerry in the 1940's and 50's, and contrasts the old country's matchmaking system with those of the ''Cumangettum Love Parlour'' of Philadelphia, where some of the characters have settled. Terry Donnelly and Mickey Kelly, recently in the center's ''Shadow of a Gunman,'' star. A Siamsa, a traditional Irish interval of music and dance, follows the performance. At the center, 553 West 51st Street (757-3318), today, Friday and next Saturday at 8 P.M. and tomorrow and next Sunday at 3 P.M. Admission: $8. ANOTHER COUNTRY The program notes for tonight's concert at 8:30 P.M. in Carnegie Recital Hall, 57th Street and Seventh Avenue, where the music is usually, but not by no means exclusively, more on the classical side, will certainly describe a tempo somewhat different from the ones that usually reverberate in the chamber. The theme is cowboy swing, and its exponent is Junior Daugherty, who is a fiddler, singer and guitarist from New Mexico. Mr. Daugherty, whose family was involved in ranching and blacksmithing in the southern part of the state, started his musical career at the age of 8 and has toured many contries abroad for United States agencies and organizations. Accompanying him are Julie Kitzenberger on fiddle and vocals, Kris Allen-Ballinger on guitar, mandolin and vocals and Dale Ballinger on bass and vocals. This is the second in the hall's ''American Folk Roots'' series, done in association with the downtown Alternative Museum. Admission: $10. Tickets: 247-7800. HOLIDAY TIME There's a show that has been running for three years now at Jan Wallman's, the homey, pint-sized Greenwich Village Restaurant tucked away at 28 Cornelia Street, which is evidence of sturdy attraction even though it only appears several times a year at this season. ''Lovers at Christmas'' is a musical with a story line that was created by Wes McAfee, the jazz pianist who usually appears solo at Wallman's Fridays and Saturdays from 10:30 P.M. to 3:30 A.M. The stars are Barbara Lea and John A. Murray, who go through a programs of song, standards and lesser-knowns, that fit into the theme of lovers in New York at Christmas. Presented at 9 and 11 P.M. this Saturday and next. There is a $6 cover plus a $5 minimum. Drinks are $2.50 up. Main courses, $7.50 to $11.95. Reservations: 242-9557. ''Lovers at Christmas'' will also be presented free at 12:30 P.M. next Wednesday as part of the Midtown Jazz and Mid-day series of St. Peter's Church, 54th Street and Lexington Avenue.

186-> Swiss Bank Plans Bid For London Brokerage
The Union Bank of Switzerland plans to acquire a 29.9 percent stake in Phillips & Drew, one of London's largest stock brokerages, with an eye toward a full takeover once rules are changed on London's Stock Exchange to permit it. Today's announcement almost completes a sweeping realignment of institutions in the City, London's financial district, in anticipation of changes in securities trading resulting from last year's agreement between the Government and the exchange to abandon fixed commissions. The end of fixed commissions, which the Government demanded in return for dropping an antitrust action against the exchange, must occur before Jan. 1, 1987. Cazenove & Company is now the only major broker that has not announced some sort of linkup with a financially strong institution capable of providing the large amounts of capital the City thinks will be required to survive in the new era. ''Many of the partners wanted to remain independent,'' said Bryce Cottrell, Phillips & Drew's senior partner, ''but as the market pattern developed, that view finally shifted.'' What they could see coming was the breakdown of the exchange's separation of jobbers, the securities wholesalers who take positions in shares or Government notes, from brokers, who shop around among jobbers to arrange deals for investors. Another factor was the Bank of England's decision to move toward a new method of marketing Government debt. This will be patterned after the American system, centering on 20 to 30 primary dealers instead of just two major jobbers. In its search for a wealthy partner, Phillips & Drew chose Switzerland's largest bank from a host of suitors. Union Bank had assets in excess of $45 billion at the end of 1983. Phillips & Drew is best known as one of London's largest managers of discretionary investment funds, with about $5 billion under management. It has some 60 partners and more than 500 other employees. No figures were announced valuing the initial 29.9 percent acquisition or the full takeover, but deals announced for other brokerages suggest that Phillips & Drew may have been valued at anywhere from $55 million to $80 million.

188-> INTEREST RATES OFF MODESTLY
While traders and economists debated whether or not the Federal Reserve was easing monetary policy another notch, interest rates fluctuated in a wider-than-normal range yesterday before ending the day with modest declines. Speculation about the Fed's willingness to foster lower rates centered on the likelihood of a cut in the discount rate the Fed charges on loans to financial institutions. Because the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market has averaged less than the 8 1/2 percent discount rate the last two days, many experts believe the Fed will soon cut the discount rate. The Fed did not arrange any transactions, or make any announcements, that would shed new light on monetary policy. But credit market particpants were quick to read meaning into the silence of the central bank. A Sharp Drop Shortly before noon, for example, the failure of the Fed to announce temporary sales of securities led to a sharp drop in short-term interest rates, with three-month Treasury bills falling to about 8.03 percent, from 8 1/4 percent. Because the overnight rate for bank loans was a lower-than- expected 8 1/4 percent during the morning, traders and some economists concluded that the Fed's unwillingness to drain reserves, and put upward pressure on the overnight bank loan rate, was a sign that the central bank was promoting lower interest rates. ''The fact that the Fed failed to drain suggests that they have eased monetary policy again,'' said David Jones, an economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company. Hopes that the Fed has eased monetary policy another notch were dampened, but not eliminated, after 4:30 P.M., when the Fed did not announce any cut in the discount rate from the 8 1/2 percent level that was announced Nov. 21. A cut in the discount rate would be an overt sign that the Fed wants lower interest rates, while the absence of a cut leaves analysts uncertain if the recent drop in the overnight Federal funds rate is a temporary aberration. A Benchmark Rate The closely watched overnight funds rate, which is a benchmark for other short-term rates, averaged about 8 1/4 percent yesterday, down from 8.42 percent Thursday and well below the 8.70 percent average for the week ended Wednesday. After 4:30 P.M., the rate on three- month Treasury bills rose about a tenth of a percentage point to 8.15 percent, down from 8.27 percent a day earlier. Note and bonds traded in the same pattern as Treasury bills, with prices rising sharply before noon, and falling in the last hour of trading. By late in the day, the new two-year Treasury notes to be auctioned next week were offered on a when-issued basis with a yield of 10.25 percent, up from the day's low yield of 10.10 percent, but still lower than Thursday's closing of 10.35 percent. In the long bond market, the 11 3/4 percent Treasury issue due in 2014 ended the day at about 101 1/4, up 1/8 point on the day, to yield 11.60 percent. The Treasury bond fluctuated between an early morning low of 100 11/32 and a high of about 101 3/4 in the early afternoon. In the corporate market, ACF Industries offered $400 million of 15 1/4 percent sinking fund debentures due in 1996 at a price of 98.648 to yield 15.50 percent, through Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ACF said it would use the proceeds to retire bank debt, and for an acquisition program to be directed by Carl C. Icahn, who controls the company. The debentures were rated Ba-3 by Moody's and BBB- by Standard & Poor's.

194-> FOYT OUT AT THE MEADOWLANDS
A. J. Foyt did not like his car, so he caught a plane today and went home. Bobby Rahal did not like his new front suspension system, so his crew changed it 20 minutes before the final qualifying session, and now he will be carrying an NBC camera to the front row in Sunday's $536,000 Meadowlands Grand Prix for Indianapolis cars. Derek Daly's size-10 shoes did not fit on the brakes, so he changed to size 9, cut out the toes and finished third fastest. And, of course, Mario Andretti's Lola was the fastest of the 37 cars competing for the 28 starting positions. Foyt's March was the 37th fastest. While Andretti was improving his qualifying time to 63.067 seconds, at an average speed of 96.012 miles an hour around the 1.68-mile road course that goes through the Meadowlands sports complex, Foyt was struggling. The best the 49-year-old Texan could do was 75.196 seconds, or 80.526 m.p.h. Wanted to Earn Start Foyt, the only four-time winner of the Indianapolis 500, would still have been in the race had he chosen to stay. The 24 fastest cars qualified automatically, but the track had the option of adding four, provided those included numbers 25 and 26. Loris Smith, the race manager, said of course Foyt, racing's biggest draw, would have been invited. But Foyt, though he has raced only at Indianapolis this year, is still a competitor, and he would not go out in a noncompetitive car. ''I won't start unless I earn it,'' he said. Foyt had put in a new fuel-injection system, but it turned out that new was not necessarily better. It simply did not work well enough. In addition, Foyt was conceding at least 24 hours to the field. The 18- wheel transport that brought his car here from Houston did not arrive until after practice and qualifying sessions Thursday. Luck Not a Factor ''It's hard to come here and try to seat brakes and all the other stuff and get up to speed at the same time,'' he said. ''On a course like this, you just can't make it up all at once. If you do, it's luck.'' It is not luck with Andretti to be on the pole, especially for a road race. The 44-year-old Andretti has been on the pole for all three Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) road races on the PPG Indy Car World Series this year. Andretti earned his 41st Indy car pole position today. Only Foyt, with 49, and Al Unser Sr., with 46, have more. But Andretti has the record for road-course pole positions with 10, and in 38 road events, he has won 12. Here, he was almost seven-tenths of a second faster than Rahal, who averaged 94.960 m.p.h. The 31-year-old Rahal, the 1982 CART rookie of the year, experimented with different suspension setups on his March until finally deciding to go back to his old one. He went from 10th fastest Thursday to the spot alongside Andretti. Daly also showed great improvement, moving from 11th to third, with a lap of 94.940 m.p.h., in his March with the help of his open-air shoes. Four Nonqualifiers Added The four cars added to the field at the promoter's option, after Foyt declined, were the four fastest of the nonqualifiers: driven by Ed Pimm, Jim Crawford, Dick Simon and Scott Brayton. . . .Bobby Unser, a three- time Indianapolis 500 winner who is here for NBC, took 2 hours 20 minutes to drive to the track from the Meadowlands Hilton, about a mile away. Unser took a wrong turn and wound up on the Manhattan side of the Lincoln Tunnel.

197-> G.M. AND TOYOTA BEGIN TEAM TEST ON THE COAST
An unusual experiment in cross-cultural team play is getting under way here as the largest automobile companies in the United States and Japan and one of the nation's most powerful unions prepare to manufacture a small car for the American market. It is taking place in a sprawling assembly plant that once churned out cars for General Motors for sale on the West Coast. The plant was closed in 1982 after sharply increasing sales of Japanese cars in the region made it unprofitable to operate. The small car that is to start rolling off the assembly line next December will be sold by G.M. as a Chevrolet. In fact, it will be a somewhat disguised version of the Toyota Corolla, one of the successful Japanese cars that forced the plant to be closed in the first place. The Fremont plant is now operated by New United Motor Manufacturing Inc. It is a 50-50 joint venture of G.M. and Toyota and represents the first time either of the giant manufacturers has gone to a rival for assistance. Mutually Beneficial Project The joint project is to give G.M. the kind of small car it has been unable to develop on its own. Toyota expects to benefit by reduced hostility to Japanese imports while it learns if it is practicable to manufacture cars away from its tightly integrated Toyota City complex in Japan. ''It is important to note that Toyota and G.M. are equal partners in New United Motor,'' Tatsuro Toyoda, president of the new company, said as the plant was opened today to visitors for the first time under its new management. Mr. Toyoda, a member of the family that founded Toyota, added, ''Both companies are totally committed to making New United Motor a successful model of industrial cooperation between our two nations.'' The opening ceremonies emphasized the joint U.S.-Japanese nature of the venture. Although all the speakers spoke in English, each paused every few paragraphs to permit their remarks to be translated into Japanese. Most Managing by Toyota Although the two companies are co- owners, Toyota is doing most of the managing. Of the top 13 executives, eight are from Toyota and two from G.M. At Fremont, Toyota is trying something no other Japanese automobile maker has attempted in this country: working with a pool of experienced personnel represented by the United Automobile Workers. Honda and Nissan, two of Toyota's rivals from Japan, have established assembly plants in America. But both have built them in rural areas and filled them with young, easily trainable workers, most of whom appear to have strong antiunion views. Because Fremont was a G.M. plant, and there were over 5,000 laid-off workers in nearby communities, Toyota had little choice but to deal with the union and the workers, despite their reputation for disputes with management. Seasoned Force of Workers Instead of being able to hire a largely homogeneous labor force of rural whites, as Honda and, to a lesser extent, Nissan did, Toyota will have to manage a streetwise group of seasoned auto workers representing most of the diverse ethnic groups in the San Francisco bay area. Unable to avoid the union, Toyota has invited its cooperation in helping decide which workers will be rehired. And it is hoping to avoid some of the problems the plant has had by emphasizing respect for individuals and adopting a positive attitude toward solving problems, rather than punitive measures. In its approach, the company has a strong ally in the U.A.W. leadership. Unsuccessful so far in organizing the Honda and Nissan plants, the U.A.W. is eager to demonstrate that unionized workers can match the quality and efficiency of those in other Japanese-managed plants. The union has already agreed to simplify many of the complex job classifications that exist in American auto plants and has indicated that it is prepared to be flexible. Hopes for Innovations ''We will do some innovative things here,'' said Bruce Lee, director of the union's Western region. ''Maybe others in the industry will say: 'That doesn't look too bad. Maybe we should be doing that too.' '' The new company will hire about 1,000 workers before the end of this year and will have a total of about 2,500 when it reaches full production about mid-1985. About 3,000 laid-off workers have indicated an interest in returning to the plant. Applicants will have to go through a four-day series of interviews and workshops, where the emphasis will be on how well they can adapt to the Toyota system of self-inspection of quality and working as a group. Six former production workers from the plant are on the screening committee and any former plant worker who is rejected has the right to appeal to a three-member panel made up of company, union and neutral representatives. Both union and company leaders appear to be working carefully to set the right tone for the new plant before the work of producing automobiles begins. ''It is very important to have the support of the United Auto Workers,'' Mr. Toyoda said. ''In a way, our company is a cooperative effort between Toyota G.M. and the U.A.W.''

199-> PRESIDENT EXPRESSES WILLINGNESS TO MEET MONDALE IN DEBATE
President Reagan tonight expressed his willingness to debate Walter F. Mondale this year if Mr. Mondale wins the Democratic Presidential nomination. ''President Carter said that I would hide?'' the President said, smiling like a tennis player putting away a slam shot. Then, drawing on a punch line that he used in his 1980 race for the White House, he added, ''There he goes again.'' On the CBS Morning News Wednesday, Mr. Carter said he expected Mr. Reagan to ''hide behind all kinds of excuses to avoid debating'' Mr. Mondale. President Reagan's punch line, first used in rebutting President Carter in the 1980 campaign debate, drew a round of laughter at Mr. Reagan's 25th televised White House news conference. And in so saying, President Reagan ended any doubts about his willingness to debate the Democratic nominee. Mr. Reagan seemed relatively restrained in urging Congress once again to take action on a compromise to begin reducing the Federal deficit. While partisan rhetoric and recriminations heightened today on Capitol Hill, the President urged passage of the measure by noting that he had assured the Western allies at the economic summit in London last week that the United States would ease the problems of the large Federal deficits, and thus the problems for the world economy, such as high interest rates, that have been blamed on the deficits. Discussing the Congressional process, Mr. Reagan said he might be willing to deal with the deficit measure in two pieces, should tax proposals come along first, but only with assurances that adequate spending cuts were being enacted. ''This has got to go together,'' he said. Sensitivity to Issue Mr. Reagan did show his campaign- year political sensitivity to the deficit issue by saying that in 1982, ''I made the mistake of going along'' with a tax increase that was tied to spending cuts. That, the President contended, never fully materialized. ''The deficit would have been smaller if we had gotten those cuts,'' he said, clearly suggesting how he might deal with the deficit issue later this year in facing the Democrats. The President also dealt in smiling fashion with a suggestion that, if re- elected, he might retire before completing another four years in office. ''What the devil would a young fellow like me do?'' he responded, beaming. Mr. Reagan, now in the fifth month of his re-election campaign, dealt with a number of domestic issues, including Democratic charges that he has been unfair in his social and budget programs toward women and blacks. Complaining that ''a falsehood is being purveyed,'' the President asserted that people were ''not suffering'' as a result of his policies. Rather, he said, the poor and those with marginal incomes had benefitted because of the economic recovery. He also declared there had been ''no discrimination of any kind'' by his Administration. The President steered carefully through a number of questions on potentially explosive campaign topics. While he expressed his support for the immigration measure now in the House, he also tried to reassure Hispanic leaders that their constituents would not suffer discrimination. ''The simple truth is that we've lost control of our own borders,'' he said, emphasizing the amnesty being offered to illegal aliens already in the country under the proposed border-tightening measure. Ruling on Affirmative Action The President was asked whether a ''death knell'' had been sounded for affirmative action by the Supreme Court decision this week upholding job seniority over racial considerations in protecting public workers' jobs. ''No, I don't think that at all,'' he replied, saying the Court had only upheld ''what the law actually says.' In reviewing the ruling, Mr. Reagan was noticeably restrained in declining to contend, as many Administration officials did this week, that the White House had scored a major victory in its opposition to affirmative-action quotas. Instead, the President, whose political strategists are urging careful sensitivity toward white moderate voters, gently noted that Hubert H. Humphrey, the former Vice President, who was a Democrat and a leading supporter of civil rights, also had said the law did not provide for racial quotas. The Carter Papers In dealing with another campaign issue, the charges that the 1980 Reagan campaign purloined strategy papers from the Carter camp, the President asserted that ''this has been investigated thoroughly.'' Mr. Reagan said he had discussed the affair with his two aides who have presented somewhat contradictory versions, James A. Baker 3d, his chief of staff, and William Casey, Director of Central Intelligence. But, aside from saying their differing recollections were ''easily undestandable,'' the President did not elaborate on what he might have found out. Mr. Casey has said he had no recollection of passing along Carter papers to Reagan strategists, as Mr. Baker recalls. The President declined to endorse Democratic calls that a special counsel be appointed to look into the matter. ''That matter is in the courts now,'' he noted. Job Rights of Homosexuals The President was noticeably cautious in fielding another potentially thorny campaign question, whether he supported Federal protections for the job rights of homosexuals. He thought a moment, then replied: ''I am opposed to discrimination, period.'' Mr. Reagan said he wanted to study the proposal on this subject, which could be a major cause in the Presidential campaign. Mr. Reagan let the news conference run five minutes over the normal half hour as he defended his record toward blacks, women and the poor. ''We are helping more people and paying more than ever in the history of this country in all of those social programs,'' he said, contradicting studies that have found the poor suffering greater hardships in some cases because of the Administration's budget changes. Problem of Cutting Deficits In his visit last week to the economic summit meeting in London, the President offered assurances to his peers that an effective program would be started to begin cutting outsized Federal deficits. The attempt to produce an agreement in Congress on deficit reduction has become snagged, however, on differences over how to achieve spending cuts. Participants at the summit meeting voiced concern about the effect on the world economy of continuing high American deficits, in the range of $200 billion annually.

203-> CENSORSHIP IS NOT A CURE FOR TEEN-AGE SUICIDE
To the Editor: John F. McManus's claim that teen-agers are induced to commit suicide by ''their music, books and movies'' is typical of the confusion and ignorance with which authoritarians of every political stripe regard art they don't like. He neither distinguishes between works of suspect ideological tendency nor credits the propensity of audience members to interpret works as they see fit. And of course he avoids the vexed chicken-and-egg question of what causes what. From reading Mr. McManus's letter, for instance, you'd never guess that Elton John's ''I Think I'm Going to Kill Myself'' holds teen-age self- pity up to transparent ridicule, while Pink Floyd's ''The Wall'' presents the self-pity of its rich, famous and decidedly postadolescent protagonist as a species of heroism. It's not surprising that Mr. McManus offers no examples of suicide in which Elton John's song is implicated. I wonder what he'd make of the failed suicide who called me to complain bitterly when I criticized Pink Floyd's self-indulgent world view in print: the band's music, he told me, had given him the strength to go on. And I wonder, too, whether he'd be surprised to learn that many of his fellow citizens consider the propaganda of the John Birch Society, where he is employed as public-relations director, far more murderous than the effusions of an overrated band.

204-> LETTERS; THE RESIDENT'S ORDEAL
I was surprised to find no recommendations for change in the article on residents. Why not alter the antiquated system to make the first six months of the residency less exhausting, increasing the demands as the doctor gains skill and confidence? A more open system would allow residents at various levels to assist one another more freely in the interest of the main tasks: patient care and physician training. One benefit would be less severe consequences of error as a result of freer flow of feedback in a less authoritarian system. The present system increases the possibility of error due to stress and ignorance. We all share the financial price for unnecessary tests and longer hospitalizations due to interns' fear of error.

205-> I.M.F. OBSTACLES IN LATIN DEMOCRACY'S PATH
To the Editor: Anthony Lewis details well the nature and likely adverse consequences of the growing third-world debt, both to those nations and to the banks (mainly U.S.) that made the loans. Unfortunately, he devoted only the last paragraph to solutions. The ''official help'' he recommends to ease bank losses in writing off loans implies cost to all American taxpayers that may dwarf whatever deal is finally arranged to save Continental Illinois. Yes, concurrent failure of major banks with large uncollectible foreign loans would have a damaging domino effect on our entire economy. But it's unfair that all American taxpayers, rather than stockholders of the banks, should pay the bulk of the cost of rescuing private banks that made poor foreign loans initially and, to prevent their debtors' default, followed up with more loans, which are as unlikely to be repaid as the initial ones.

206-> D-DAY
To the Editor: In visiting places of historic interest in Europe I've taken my children to various sites of battle, both modern and ancient, famous and obscure (Marathon, Flodden, Waterloo, Anzio). All inspire some degree of awe. But none had the impact of Normandy. None even came close. For one week in July of 1969 I toured the invasion beaches and towns with my son who was then 13 years old. No one could have had a more moving or more meaningful history lesson. The rusted barbed wire and bunkers on Pointe du Hoc spoke to us almost as eloquently as the cool white marble of the military cemetery at St. Laurent. Thousands of men and ships seemed to appear out of the mist and drizzle of those July mornings as we looked across the channel from Omaha or Juno Beach. We came across the German cemetery quite by chance after leaving Ste. M ere Eglise. John Vinocur's description (''D-Day Plus 40 Years,'' Travel, May 13) brought it back so vividly. Sad and somber. Flat, dark, knights' crosses. Tall grass. No one else there. Just the two of us. Feeling like intruders, we didn't stay long. I remember being surprised to see the birthdate of each soldier marked on the stones. 1910. 1914, 1918. Why, I wondered, were they so old? But of course they weren't old at all. It was 1944 when they fell. Young men all of them, like ours, who remain in Normandy forever. We headed south towards the chateaus of the Loire Valley and another time, leaving the invasion beaches and the war behind. In reading the articles we both remembered and talked about that week in July. It was a special thing to have shared. JANICE WILSEY Port Washington, N.Y.

207-> LETTERS TO THE CONNECTICUT EDITOR;
I am writing in reference to the article ''Two Measures to Save Farm Land'' (June 3). The article does not explain the other side of the coin, regarding the effects of purchasing farmland to insure its future use for agriculture. Kenneth B. Andersen, State Commissioner of Agriculture, may be delighted with the bill signed by Governor O'Neill, but the program has potentially disastrous economic results. The free market should function, rather than use taxpayers' funds to support farms that cannot compete. I see nothing wrong with buying Washington State apples in Connecticut if they are cheaper, or other foodstuffs from farm areas more efficient than Connecticut. Our weather is capricious and soil less fertile than elsewhere. The big problem, however, is that interfering with a free market in land, by subsidizing farmland will push up real-estate values even higher than they are at present. Our state is highly industrialized, and already in Fairfield County, high land costs and housing make it difficult for industry to attract the skilled people needed for survival in the world economy. Saving land exclusively for agriculture may be the worst mistake the state has made for the success of future economic development. JOSEPH J. MAKOVICH Norwalk The Times welcomes letters from readers.

209-> Alison R. Rowe, a Broker, Is Married
Alison Rebecca Rowe, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Joseph H. Rowe of Marblehead, Mass., was married yesterday to Stephen Iglehart, a son of Mr. and Mrs. Robert H. Iglehart of Mystic, Conn. The Rev. Michael Coburn performed the ceremony at St. Mark's Episcopal Church in Mystic. Susan Kretzer was the maid of honor and T. Whitcomb Iglehart was his brother's best man. The bride, who will retain her name professionally, is a commodities broker for E. F. Hutton & Company in New York. She graduated from the Cushing Academy in Ashburnham, Mass., Catawba College in Salisbury, N.C., and the Katharine Gibbs School in Boston and did graduate work in romance languages at the University of Cincinnati. Her father is a general manager in the General Electric Company's aircraft engine group in Lynn, Mass. Mr. Iglehart teaches foreign languages at the Wooster School in Danbury, Conn., of which he is an alumnus. He graduated from Franklin Pierce College and studied at the University of Neuchatel in Switzerland and Middlebury College. His father, who is retired, was director of the Peace Corps in Togo and headmaster of the Westover School in Middlebury, Conn., and St. Mark's School of Texas in Dallas.

210-> LIBRRAIES ENTICING CHILDREN TO READ
TIME VOYAGERS could be the latest craze for youngsters this summer, if a new program by a county institution goes forward as planned. It is not, however, a video game, a television show or a movie. The science-fiction sounding name is the title of this year's program of the Westchester Library System designed to encourage children to develop reading habits and stay with them. According to Judith Rovenger, children's services consultant with the system, all that children need to do to become a time voyager in the 1984 Summer Reading Games is sign up at one of the 32 participating libraries. The reading games, which began last month and will continue almost until school starts, are not confined to reading. There are also parties, films, crafts, story hours and other activities related to the theme ''Be a Time Voyager - 1984.'' Participants receive buttons, stickers, certificates and book marks. Miss Rovenger is fond of quoting Arthur Langlie, Governor of Washington during the 1940's and 50's, on the importance of reading: ''Whoever forms a reading habit will never lose it. It is a treasure no one can take from him. It contains wealth that neither poverty, nor old age, nor misery can tarnish. Thieves cannot steal it, nor storms destroy it and, like vintage wine, it can only improve with age.'' ''We see 1984 as an important year,'' Miss Rovenger said. ''And we have taken this point to portray reading as a time machine. The reader can go back or forward in time, as they wish, or even stay in the present, covering such interesting topics as dinosaurs, Egyptian mummies, knights, computers, robots and spaceships.'' Miss Rovenger said that the libraries' activities would include full- length film showings, special story sessions and arts-and-crafts programs in which children can build models of mummies, spaceships or even make books themselves. At the Rye Free Reading Room, the public library in that city, she said, a model time machine has been built as part of the program. A youngster can climb inside, pressing buttons that reel off tapes of exciting adventures, and a window-picture shows a mock- up of scenes depicted in recommended books. Rye youngsters will be given the opportunity to select books and artifacts for a time capsule that will be buried there for 25 years. At Greenburgh Public Library, a medieval fair theme has been planned, with jugglers, mime artists and crafts programs representing that theme, Miss Rovenger said. Reading passports will be issued the Greenburgh time voyagers. Miss Rovenger said: ''We really look forward each summer for extra time in which to instill reading skills in children. ''In the early days of my participation in this program,'' she continued, ''I was a little put off by the idea of awarding gold stars or stickers for reading accomplishments. But I see now that the children love them. While visiting the Montrose library recently I was amazed at the enthusiasm youngsters there showed for reading, even volunteering to do book reports on their own.'' She said that even if a child was not interested in joining the Summer Reading Games, the summer was still a perfect time for parents to encourage recreational reading. ''It is also a time for reading aloud and sharing stories with the whole family. And the children's librarians are available for individual reading guidance, no matter what the child's age, reading level or reading interest may be.'' Summer Reading Games, an annual event sponsored by the library system, has begun to chalk up some interesting statistics, she said. Last summer 50,000 books were read by 4,600 children who were involved in the program. And a total of 200,000 children's books were taken out of Westchester public libraries. ''Of course, we hope to do better this year,'' Miss Rovenger said. The program breaks down book lists into categories of the past, present and future and recommends such titles as ''Supersaurus'' by Francine Jacobs; ''I Tut: The Boy Who Became Pharoh'' by Miriam Schlein; ''Harald and the Giant Knight'' by Donald Carrick; ''The Star Wars Question and Answer Book About Computers'' by Fred D'Ignazio, and ''Your Very Own Robot'' by R.A. Montgomery, among many others. Information is available at local libraries or by calling children's services at the library system at 592- 8214.

211-> A JUDGE ORDERS STRIKING NURSES BACK TO THE JOB
Striking nurses at three hospitals were ordered by a Federal judge yesterday to return to work, and their union told them to comply. Two of the hospitals - St. John's Episcopal Hospital in Far Rockaway, Queens, and Long Island College Hospital - complained that the nurses had ignored a back-to-work order that the judge, I. Leo Glasser of Federal District Court in Brooklyn, had signed earlier in the day. ''The nurses did not show up this morning nor this afternoon,'' said Mathew Kurs, the St. John's administrator. He said if the nurses were not back by this morning, he would ask Judge Glasser to hold them in contempt. Harold Light, the president of Long Island College Hospital, said nurses, as well as technicians, at the hospital's dialysis center on Flatbush Avenue had also ignored the court order yesterday but agreed last night to report for duty Monday. The hospital was forced to close the center a week ago when the nurses and technicians walked out. Question of Warning Mr. Light said many of the hospital's dialysis patients who had been referred to other centers had been forced to reduce their treatments. Judge Glasser based his order on a National Labor Relations Board decision that found that the nurses had failed to give appropriate warning of their strike. Robert Carroll, the spokesman for the striking union, District 1199, Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Workers Union, A.F.L.-C.I.O., said the union's president, Doris Turner, had sent union officials to Brooklyn and Queens to insure union compliance with the court order. Samuel M. Kaynard, the regional director of the N.L.R.B., said, ''We have indications that the union has not been in full compliance with the court agreement, and we are eager to see that hospital conditions do not deteriorate.'' At a third hospital affected by the court order, St. Mary's Hospital in Brooklyn, officials said the striking nurses had ''substantially complied'' and returned to duty. 10-Day Notice Required The N.L.R.B., in bringing the dispute to court, said the nurses in the three hospitals had failed to file a 10-day notice in time to walk out with the other members of the union, which struck 27 private, nonprofit hospitals and 3 affiliated nursing homes on July 13. The union struck 11 private, nonprofit nursing homes three days later. At two other hospitals where the nurses had struck, the 10-day notice was filed in time. The strike, the longest health-care walkout in New York City's history, entered its 14th day today without any sign of a settlement. There have been no negotiations and none are planned, with both sides far apart on the issue of wages. The only time union and hospitals have met was Wednesday when Federal mediators and financial experts from the State Department of Health explained the state's hospital reimbursement system. All told, 39,500 workers, most of them orderlies, nurse's aides, technicians, are on strike with supervisory personnel and temporarily hired nurses and nurse's aides taking their place.

212-> Anne Plumb Is Wed to John L. Kelsey
Anne Hoagland Plumb of Princeton, N.J., and East Orleans, Mass., and John Loveland Kelsey of Rumson, N.J., were married yesterday at Trinity Episcopal Church in Princeton. The Rev. Richard Bower performed the ceremony. The bride's children, Anne and Robert, attended the ceremony as did the bridegroom's children, Grayson and Jonathan. Mrs. Kelsey, the daughter of the late Mr. and Mrs. Henry Veghte Hoagland, was most recently the director of development at the Eden Institute for autistic children and young adults in Princeton. Her first husband was the late Robert Johnston Plumb Jr., treasurer of Asarco Inc., a mineral and chemical company. An alumna of the National Cathedral School for Girls and Sweet Briar College, she received a master's degree in education from Harvard University. Mr. Kelsey, a managing director of Paine Webber Inc. in New York, graduated from Indiana University and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. His first wife was the late Ethel Shelby Leathers Kelsey. He is a son of the late Mr. and Mrs. James E. Kelsey.

213-> EXCERPTS FROM STUDY OF MISSING ARGENTINES
Following are excerpts from the introduction of a report by the National Commmission on the Disappearance of Persons, as translated by The New York Times from the Spanish, which was presented to President Raul Alfonsin on Thursday. The introduction was written by Ernesto Sabato, an Argentine novelist who headed the 11-member commission. The complete report of 50,000 pages has not been made public. During the decade of the 1970's Argentina was convulsed by a terror that came as much from the extreme right as from the extreme left, a phenomenon that has occurred in many other countries. It happened in Italy, which for many years suffered under the merciless actions of fascists, the Red Brigades and similar groups. But not at any moment did that nation abandon the principles of law to combat those groups. They worked with absolute effectiveness through the courts, offering the accused all the guarantees of defense in a trial. When a member of a security force suggested to General Della Chiesa on the occasion of Aldo Moro's kidnapping that they torture a prisoner to get information, the general responded with these memorable words: ''Italy can permit itself to lose an Aldo Moro, but not to institute torture.'' It did not happen like this in our country. The armed forces responded with a terrorism infinitely worse than that of the combatant. From March 24, 1976, they relied on the power and the immunity of an absolute state to kidnap, torture and assassinate thousands of human beings. Evidence of Tragedy Our commission was not instituted to pass judgment, because for this we have the courts, but to investigate the fate of the disappeared during those fateful years. But having received thousands of declarations and depositions, verified or determined the existence of hundreds of clandestine detention sites and accumulated more than 50,000 documented pages, we are certain that the military dictatorship produced the greatest and most savage tragedy of our history. And even if we must wait for justice to give the last word, we cannot silence what we have heard, read and recorded, all of which goes beyond what can be considered simply delinquent to reach the dark category of inhuman crimes. Planning Is Inferred From the voluminous documentation we have gathered, we deduce that human rights were violated by the organs of the state through the repression of the armed forces. And they were not violated sporadically but systematically, always in a similar way. How could it not be attributed to a methodology of terror planned by the high command? How, under a vigorously military regime, could such crimes have been committed by preverse individuals acting on their own, with all the power and access to information this implies? How can one talk of ''individual excesses?'' From our information, it appears that this technology of hell was carried out by sadistic but controlled agents. The kidnapping operations demonstrated precise organization, at times in the work places of those who had been denounced. Others were carried out in the street in daylight. When the victim was looked for at night in his home, armed squads surrounded the district and entered by force, terrorizing parents and children, often gagging them and forcing them to watch the events. They took hold of the person they had been looking for, beat him brutally, hooded him and finally dragged the person to a car or truck, while the rest of the squad often destroyed what was left behind or stole what could be carried away. From there they headed toward a den with a door that could have been inscribed with the words that Dante read on the gates of hell: ''All hope abandon, ye who enter here.'' In this way, in the name of national security, thousands and thousands of human beings, generally young and even teen-agers, became part of a dark and ghostly category, that of the ''disappeared.'' A word - sad Argentine privilege - now written in Spanish in the world press. Investigators Were Insulted During the course of our investigations we were insulted and threatened by those who committed the crimes, who, far from repenting, again repeat the well-known reasons for the ''dirty war.'' They talk of the country's salvation and of their Western and Christian values - the precise values that they dragged between the bloody walls of the repression dens. And they accuse us of not propitiating national reconciliation, of inciting hatred and resentment, of preventing forgetting. But this is not so. We believe that reconciliation will not be possible until after the guilty repent and justice, based on truth, is done. Great calamities are always instructive. Without a doubt the most terrible drama that this nation has suffered in all of its history during the period of the militry dictatorship initiated in March 1976 will be useful to make us understand that only democracy is capable of preserving a people from such horror, that only it can maintain and save those sacred and essential rights of the human creature. Only with this, will we be sure that never again in our country will events be repeated that have made us tragically famous in the civilized world.

214-> MAN IS ACCUSED OF ABUSING 5 CHILD HOSTAGES
A 31-year-old man held seven children hostage in a house in Atlantic City a half-hour Friday and sexually assaulted five of them, according to the police. One of the children, who ranged in age from 8 to 13, slipped out of the house at about 12:30 P.M. and ran to a neighbor's house to call the police, according to Capt. A. J. Salvatore of the Atlantic City Police Department. He said another escaped assault by hiding in a closet. Captain Salvatore identified the suspect as Milton Paul Durham, and said he had no known permanent address. The captain said Mr. Durham had broken into the house, in the Inlet section of the city, around noon, brandishing a toy pistol. The suspect, who is being held on $250,000 bail in the city jail, is to be arraigned Monday. He is charged with five counts of aggravated sexual assault, six counts each of child abuse, endangering the welfare of a child and kidnapping, seven counts of terroristic threats, and one count each of possession of a weapon for unlawful purposes, second-degree burglary and possession of cocaine. The captain said the three boys and four girls were members of a family, their cousins and friends. Schools were closed Friday for Rosh ha-Shanah, the Jewish New Year, and the parents of the children who lived in the house were at work, he said.

215-> ; Stearns, Heart Of the Mets
To the Sports Editor: I was delighted to read John Stearns's account of his comeback (''The Long Comeback of John Stearns,'' The New York Times, Sept. 16). I had been a Met fan since 1973 when I moved to New York, and, as you well know, the fortunes of the club deteriorated steadily since that time until this year. During those years of frustration one of the few bright spots that I can remember was the Met catcher, John Stearns. More than anybody else on those losing teams, Stearns played defense and hit very well despite the perennial last-place finishes of the club. In fact, it was my feeling that of all the players of those teams, it was Stearns who most embodied the Met pride. I remember once when he got into a minor altercation regarding the relative merits of the Pirates and the Mets, Stearns was belittled by Manager Chuck Tanner of the Pirates, who said that Stearns had no right to feel proud of a last-place team that was not going anywhere. At that juncture, I felt sure that all true-blue Met fans suffered together with Stearns. Like him, we all felt proud of the Mets despite the team's lowly standing. These were probably the same Met fans whose eyes filled with tears when on Sept. 1, after two years of not being able to play because of injuries, Stearns came up to bat against San Diego with the Mets behind him. As absolutely expected, he promptly doubled and ignited a rally that propelled the Mets back to the top. Should the Mets ever win a World Series, I pray that Stearns will be part of the team. More than anybody else on the Mets, I feel that he deserves to wear a championship ring. GODOFREDO R. CELIS, M.D. Staten Island, N.Y.

216-> FLUTIE STARS IN 52-20 TRIUMPH
Doug Flutie showed again tonight why size bears no relation to success. The 5-foot-9-inch senior quarterback of Boston College passed for six touchdowns, a school record and two more than he had ever thrown in a game, to lead the Eagles to a 52-20 victory over North Carolina. Also, by throwing for 354 yards, Flutie moved up four places to sixth on the career list of college passers, with 8,063 yards. Those he passed were Steve Young of Brigham Young University, Jack Thompson of Washington State, John Holman of Northeast Louisiana State and Dan Marino of Pittsburgh. The next quarterback he would pass is Joe Adams of Tennessee State, who leads Flutie by 586 yards. The victory improved Boston College's record to 3-0 and dropped the Tarheels to 0-2, their worst start in 15 years. North Carolina won the only previous game between the schools, 56-14, in 1981. In his best performance of the season, Flutie completed 28 of 38 passes and was not intercepted. The completions and yardage total were high for the season. He had also attempted 38 passes in a victory two weeks ago over Alabama. He was replaced tonight by Shawn Halloran in the fourth quarter, when his team led, 45-20. 12 Touchdown Passes This Year Flutie now has thrown 12 touchdown passes this season. Those he threw tonight were on plays that covered 8, 6, 14, 4, 26 and 10 yards. The previous school touchdown pass record, five, had been held by Kenny Smith since 1977. Troy Stradford, who rushed 17 times for 109 yards, and Scott Gieselman, the tight end, each caught two touchdown passes. The others were caught by Kelvin Martin, a flanker, and Steve Williams, a running back. ''I felt good tonight from beginning to end,'' Flutie said. ''We were ready for this game, and we had a little revenge in our minds.'' As for the touchdown passes, he said: ''It just happened that the situations were right at the time.'' The Eagles scored a final touchdown on a 2-yard run by the fullback Jim Browne with 4 minutes 21 seconds left. Over all, they generated 612 yards of offense. Throws to His Brother Flutie marked several other milestones tonight. His third touchdown throw, a jump-pass to Stradford, was the 500th completion of his career. And in the drive for the fourth score, he completed his first pass ever to his brother Darren, a freshman flanker, who is one inch taller than his older brother. That pass covered 26 yards, and it was the longest pass play of the first half. The Flutie brothers connected on another pass, for 10 yards, late in the third quarter. The older Flutie, who also ran twice for 33 yards, was so effective that the Eagles scored on all but three possessions while he was in the game. Those that failed came in the first half - on the opening drive of the game, which started at the Boston College half- yard line; on the fifth, when the score was already 21-0, and when time ran out at the half. Otherwise, Flutie drove the team to six touchdowns and a field goal. North Carolina, which missed two field-goal attempts in the first half, did not score until Boston College had taken a 31-0 lead on a 30-yard field goal by Kevin Snow early in the third quarter. Ethan Horton, the Tarheel tailback, led all rushers with 162 yards on 22 carries.

217-> WAR MEMOIR BY SANDINISTA IS BEST SELLER
A memoir of life as a Sandinista guerrilla has become a best-selling book in Nicaragua. ''So much junk has been written, especially in Latin America, about what it means to be a guerrilla,'' the author, Omar Cabezas, said in an interview. ''The guerrilla is made into a mythical being who never feels pain and is happy to die at any moment. My book shows the fears and the longings and the pain we felt during our years underground.'' To many Nicaraguans, the Sandinista leaders remain a mystery even though they have been in power for more than five years. The public has little idea beyond their public statements of who they are or what they did to reach the top ranks of the Sandinista movement. The leaders themselves rarely speak or write about what they did during the war. Mr. Cabezas is the first Sandinista to publish memoirs of life as a guerrilla. From University to Mountains The book is a picaresque and frank story about a young university student who first collaborates with the underground, then joins it and finally is sent to the mountains to become one of the revolutionary elite. The book's title translates literally from Spanish as ''The Mountain Is Something More Than a Vast Green Steppe.'' It has caught the popular imagination more than anything published here since the revolution. ''Reading the book is great fun because it's written in such a direct style,'' said Miriam Hebe de Ramirez, who operates a cafe in Managua. ''People buy it because they want to know what guerrilla life was like, what it meant to live in the mountains,'' Mrs. de Ramirez said. ''Even reactionaries, people who are not with the revolutionary process, send their drivers over to buy copies.'' Mr. Cabezas said he had never planned to write a book. But a visiting journalist to whom he gave a series of interviews in 1979 liked his recollections and urged him to expand them into a full-length work. Won Cuban Competition He said he dictated 20 chapters into a tape recorder and sent it to two Sandinista leaders - Sergio Ramirez Mercado, a member of the junta, and the Culture Minister, the Rev. Ernesto Cardenal. With their encouragement, he entered it in the Cuban-sponsored Casa de las Americas literary competition in 1982. It took the top prize in its category and was published soon afterward. The Sandinista Government publishing house, Nueva Nicaragua, originally estimated that its first printing of 10,000 copies would sell out in 8 to 10 months, according to its production director, Hugo Nino. Instead, the edition was snatched up within two weeks. Mr. Nino said 50,000 copies were now in print, making it the largest selling book ever published in Nicaragua. ''The book can be read on two levels,'' Mr. Nino said. ''It is both an adventure story and a book with great emotional and conceptual depth. The vocabulary is elementary and there are no difficult references, so it can be enjoyed by every kind of reader.'' Mr. Cabezas was a student leader at the University of Leon in western Nicaragua in the early 1970's when he was first approached by a schoolmate who was a secret Sandinista. Mr. Cabezas, then still a teen-ager, agreed to join the Sandinista Front. His first task was to locate a safe house in Leon for some rebel fighters. Later he organized labor and student protests and study groups that evolved into Sandinista cells. Life as a Guerrilla Mr. Cabezas was then selected to become a guerrilla fighter. The bulk of his book is an account of his struggles to adapt to a hostile environment and prove himself a worthy Sandinista. In the course of his adventures in the mountains, as related in the book, Mr. Cabezas marches with a heavy pack, learns to make fires, contracts a tropical disease, teaches the Communist Manifesto to fellow guerrillas, eats monkeys and slowly convinces an incredulous peasant that the world is round and revolves. He writes: ''When you have adapted and made yourself into a guerrilla, what is hardest is not the nightmare of the jungle, not the horrible mountains, not the torture of not having enough to eat, not the actions of the enemy, not that your body is dirty, not that you stink, not that you have to be wet all the time. It is the solitude, nothing is harder than the solitude. ''There was nothing more terrible for me than the infinite solitude we lived in, and the worst was we had no idea how long it would go on.'' Recognized in Public Mr. Cabezas, who is 33 years old, often attracts spontaneous cheers and waves when he appears in public. In his Government post, Mr. Cabezas is in charge of ''political education'' for the Interior Ministry. Some say his job is best described as indoctrination. But he puts it differently. ''The job of police and security agents is to repress, to prevent,'' he said. ''The challenge is to teach them to repress without losing their human values, without becoming animals.'' Mr. Cabezas said many readers sent him letters urging him to write a second book to take his story past 1975, where the current volume ends. He said he is nearly half finished dictating a new book that will cover the period from 1975 until the Sandinista victory in 1979. ''That will be the last of it,'' he said. ''Let somebody else write about what has happened since we took over.''

218-> SHANNON FIRST AMERICAN BOXER TO LOSE
There were 22 seconds remaining in the second round and Robert Shannon had dutifully gone to a neutral corner, where he watched as Referee John Poucher of Ireland gave the Korean Sung Kil Moon a standing 8-count. From Shannon's perspective, a turning point in the bout had been reached, and in anticipation of another American victory, he turned and blew a kiss to the crowd. A last kiss, as it turned out. Before the second round was over, Shannon was on his knees, having been knocked down by a right hand with four seconds left. Moon's punch appeared to deflate him and instill a sense of urgency that should have been unnecessary. Shannon was leading on four of the five officials' cards after two rounds, but he did not know that. He came out in the third round throwing punches in desperation, trying to land the one he calls ''my famous right hook.'' But midway through the round, he was on the canvas again, this time for good. 16 Consecutive Victories Moon achieved an Olympic Games first today when he handed the United States team its first loss after 16 victories. His straight right hand caught Shannon flush on the jaw and Poucher stopped the bantamweight bout at 1:46 of the final round as Shannon struggled to his feet. The pro-American fans were stunned and silent at first, but then cheered Shannon for his effort. Pat Nappi, the coach, hugged his young boxer and patted him on the head, but Shannon was obviously upset. He did not attend the postfight interview, relaying word that he might return later in the day. The loss, said Jerry Page, Shannon's teammate, gave him new resolve. Waiting in the locker room for his bout in the light-welterweight division, Page said he was determined not to become the second American to lose. He kept his promise too, winning a unanimous decision against Octavio Robles of Mexico. In bouts tonight, Meldrick Taylor won a unanimous decision from Francisco Camacho of Mexico in the featherweight division, and Pernell Whitaker won a unanimous decision from Geofrey Nyeko of Uganda in the lightweight division, Page Motivated by Shannon But it was Shannon's defeat that would be the talk of the boxers today, especially since some of the foreign coaches had said they thought a knockout would be the only way an American could lose. ''Robert has nothing to be ashamed of, but he had no business losing,'' Page said. ''Seeing him lose motivated me a lot. It gave me an extra spark. I knew it was time to take care of business.'' Although the United States team had talked about the possiblity of winning all 12 boxing gold medals, Dr. John Anderson, the team psychologist, said that the pressure was building among the boxers not to be the first one to lose. The Koreans have quietly been building an impressive record of their own and now have won 14 of their first 15 bouts. Neighborhood Support A small delegation of fans from the Los Angeles neighborhood called Koreatown sat in the balcony, waving a South Korean flag, rooting for Moon. At times, they could be heard above the roar of the other fans in the crowd of 9,814. Shannon, though, silenced them when he connected with enough punches in the first two rounds to build a lead. He moved more than in past bouts, trying to neutralize the straight-ahead style favored by the Korean boxers. He moved too much occasionally, wasting energy, but he was also making himself an elusive target. Shannon continued that strategy until a right hook staggered Moon with 47 seconds remaining in the second round. Shannon moved in on his opponent like a swarm of bees and rocked him two more times, finally prompting the referee to give Moon the 8-count. When the bout resumed, Shannon became a careless, and Moon dropped him. Shannon looked more surprised than hurt. But when he came out for the final round, it was as if he thought he needed a knockout to win. He lowered his hands and threw punches from either hip, a gunfighter reaching for his gun. Moon fought back and landed the harder punches. Page Is the Aggressor Having watched the bout, Page entered the ring determined to patiently box his taller opponent. He was the aggressor, but was content to jab and look for an opening for his right hand. After sensing that Robles could not hurt him, he became more brazen in the second round. ''I figured I had won the first round,'' Page said, ''and I wanted to widen my lead in the second. He wasn't a strong puncher, so I figured I could open up.'' In the third round, however, Page said he felt weary and decided to box cautiously, protecting his lead. ''I took my time and didn't let things get out of control,'' he said. Taylor Cheered After two fights, Taylor has become a crowd favorite. The 17-year- old Philadelphian has extremely fast hands and he has not reluctant to do them. He throws punches in bunches and works against his opponent as if he were climbing a stair case, moving from the body to the head and back down again. ''I have hand speed and just get into the flow of my punches,'' Taylor said. ''I wanted to hurt him to the body and I knew sooner or later I would.'' Taylor was especially effective in the first and second rounds when the body blows lowered Camacho's guard and made him vulnerable to right hand leads. ''It was a great fight, he beat me,'' Camacho said. ''I tried to keep away from him but unfortunately, my strategy didn't work.''

219-> TRACK; MOSES AND ASHFORD JOIN THE GOLD MEDAL LIST; U.S. 1-2 IN HURDLES AND WOMEN'S 100
Today was one of those lovely days for American track and field in the Games of the XXIII Olympiad. In the morning, Joan Benoit of Freeport, Me., won the gold medal in the first-ever Olympic marathon for women. In the evening, Evelyn Ashford of Los Angeles won the gold medal in the women's 100-meter dash. Twenty minutes later, Edwin Moses of Laguna Hills, Calif., won the gold medal in the men's 400-meter hurdles, as he did in Montreal eight years before. Miss Benoit ran away from the marathon field early and beat Grete Waitz of Norway by a little more than a quarter-mile in 2 hours 24 minutes 52 seconds. Miss Ashford beat Alice Brown of Altadena, Calif., by 5 feet in 10.97 seconds, an Olympic record. Moses defeated 18- year-old Danny Harris of Perris, Calif., by 3 meters in 47.75 seconds. The day's other gold medal, in the men's javelin throw, went to unheralded Arto Haerkoenen of Finland with 284 feet 8 inches. In last year's world championships, he failed to qualify for the final. Tom Petranoff of Northridge, Calif., the favorite, finished 10th, with a throw of 257-3. Harris, who has broken the world junior record five times this year, held off Harald Schmid of West Germany by a foot for the silver medal. The medal ceremony was delayed because of a West German protest over the second-place and third-place finishes. Schmid contended that, between the eighth and ninth hurdles, Harris's elbow had struck him. The jury of appeals turned down the protest. Schmid's 1977 victory over Moses was Moses's last loss in this event. Since then, Moses has won 105 consecutive 400-meter hurdles races - 90 finals and 15 preliminaries. Moses Race Never in Doubt His race here was never in doubt. He led by 7 meters entering the stretch and seemed to ease up on his last two strides. Miss Benoit and Miss Ashford had run joyous victory laps after their victories. Moses, perhaps slowing down ever so little at age 28, walked a joyous victory lap and soaked in the acclaim from the capacity crowd of 92,600 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. His wife, Myrella, was crying most of the race. His mother, Gladys, kept telling Myrella not to cry. After the victory lap, Moses, his wife and his mother staged a long three-way hug in front of the stands. When his mother returned to her seat, she was crying for the first time all day. ''He said he dedicated the race to his father,'' she said. Irving Moses, a high school principal in Dayton, Ohio, died last December. ''I know he saw this race,'' said his son. Miss Ashford is 27 years old, slim at 5 feet 5 inches and 115 pounds. Had the East Germans not stayed away from these Olympics, she surely would have had a battle from Marlies G"ohr and Marita Koch. Without them, she was the favorite, her main threat being hamstring and buttock muscles that have suffered strains and tears. Here, her body held up and she broke the Olympic record of 11.01 seconds by Annegret Richter of East Germany in a 1976 semifinal. On the victory stand, Miss Ashford cried from the start of the medal presentation to the end of the national anthem. She also cried last August in Helsinki, Finland, during the first world championsips of track and field, when a buttock muscle tore during the final and left her writhing in pain on the track. Here, the tears turned to smiles again after the medal ceremony. 'Happy It Was Over' ''I was so happy it was over, I won and I ran under 11 seconds,'' she said. ''I was stunned at first. I didn't realize what had happened. Then he said 'new Olympic record' and it hit me.'' The day included preliminaries in eight other events, notably the men's long jump. There, Carl Lewis of Willingboro, N.J., took one jump, cleared 27 feet 2 3/4 inches and qualified for the final. On Saturday night, Lewis won the 100-meter gold medal in 9.99 seconds. Today, he led the long jump qualifying. And he still has a full week ahead. He faces the first two rounds of the 200-meter dash Monday morning, the long jump final Monday night, 200- meter semifinals and final Wednesday night, 400-meter relay heats Friday morning, 400-meter relay semifinals Saturday morning and 400-meter relay final Saturday night. Barring injury or illness, Lewis seems a solid bet to win the four gold medals and duplicate Jesse Owens's feat in the 1936 Berlin Olympics. After the 100-meter final, Lewis said his battle was 60 percent won. 'Only Wanted to Qualify' ''I only wanted to qualify today,'' Lewis said, ''and save my energy for tomorrow in case the wind blows in my face. It is a relief that I only had to take one jump today. I think that the main thing is that I did not have to stand around a long time, because with so many jumpers it could take up to 30 minutes in between jumps.'' The first semifinal of the men's 800 meters was fast and memorable. Joaquim Cruz of Brazil, an Oregon junior, won in the fast time of 1 minute 43.82 seconds. Next were Edwin Koech of Kenya and Earl Jones of Inkster, Mich. Steve Ovett of Britain, the 1980 Olympic champion, finished fourth and gained the last qualifying spot in Monday's final, but it was not easy. Ovett caught Omar Khalifa of Sudan 10 meters from the finish, started to pass him and started to stumble. Ovett got by and stayed on his feet long enough to cross the finish line a foot ahead of Khalifa. Two steps later, Ovett fell and was stretched out on the track. Delayed Elation He stayed there for perhaps 30 seconds, got up, turned toward the giant screen above the stands and watched a replay of the race. When he saw he had finished fourth and made the final, he raised his arms in triumph. Then he turned to the stands, mimicked himself stumbling and blew a kiss. Greg Foster of Los Angeles, the favorite in the men's 110-meter high hurdles, won his first-round heat in 13.24 seconds into a headwind. That equaled the Olympic record set by Rod Milburn of the United States in 1972. Tonie Campbell of Carson, Calif., and Roger Kingdom of Pittsburgh won their heats in 13.53 seconds and will join Foster in the semifinals. Many people expect them to finish 1-2-3 in the final. Favorites in 400 Advance Bert Cameron of Jamaica, Antonio McKay of Atlanta and Alonzo Babers of Montgomery, Ala., the favorites in the men's 400-meter dash, advanced to the semifinals. McKay (44.72 seconds) and Babers (44.75) were the fastest in the quarterfinals. Cameron qualified easily in 45.16. Other American who advanced were Johnny Gray in the 800 meters, Sunder Nix in the 400 meters, Larry Myricks and Mike McRae in the long jump and Bill Green in the hammer throw. Chandra Cheeseborough of Jacksonville, Fla.; Valerie Brisco-Hooks of Los Angeles and Lillie Leatherwood of Northport, Ala., qualified for the women's 400-meter final. Miss Cheeseborough's time of 50.32 seconds was the fastest of the day. Other American women who advanced were Judi Brown and Sharrieffa Barksdale in the 400-meter hurdles and Karin Smith in the javelin throw. This was the third Olympics for 44- year-old Ed Burke of San Jose, Calif. In 1964 and 1968, he made the hammer throw final, but not this time. Despite roars from the morning crowd of 77,083, he threw only 221 feet 6 inches in the qualifying round and finished 19th. At least he has the memories of the opening ceremonies, when he carried the American flag. And he had other kinds of satisfaction. ''It was a thrill just to walk into the stadium,'' he said, ''and see so many people and to hear so many people cheering. I was certain there must be another event going on because there were so many people there. ''I think that maybe I said more for middle-age people by not advancing here today. I show them that it's possible to feel satisfaction in just competing, not in the winning. Just because I didn't advance doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it.

220-> U.S. REWARDS FOR POLAND BUT...; WHAT OF WARSAW'S DEBT?
The Administration's decision last week to ease some of the sanctions on economic and scientific cooperation with Poland is a step in the right direction. It does not, however, solve the larger, underlying problem created for the United States by our decision in December 1981 to impose sanctions on Poland. Among those varied sanctions, the suspension of United States Government involvement in debt-rescheduling talks on Poland's huge $27 billion debt was perhaps the most damaging to us. Why? Because Poland owes $3.15 billion to American creditors - nearly $2 billion of it to the Government, either directly or through loan- guarantee programs. Americans may debate the wisdom of the sanctions and whether our lifting them in response to the recent amnesty for political prisoners was appropriate. There can, however, be little debate about the financial consequences of American policy. Over the past three years, Poland has paid its foreign private creditors $4.7 billion - about 10 percent of that has gone to American banks - but has paid the United States Government nothing since 1981. Poland is now more that $1.2 billion in arrears on its payments of the total $2 billion that it owes Washington. To add insult to injury, the United States Treasury has been forced to pay more than $941 million of taxpayer's money to American banks to make good on outstanding guaranteed loans to Poland. The American response to the Polish debt problem is a case of policy mismanagement of the first order. What went wrong? Politics clouded our better judgment. The Administration decided in December 1981 to put relations with Poland in the deep freeze because of public outrage at the declaration of martial law by the Jaruzelski Government. In that heated moment, Washington simply failed to see that the ''sanction'' concerning the suspension of debt-rescheduling negotiations was self-defeating, for it gave Poland an excuse to stop payments to us and forced the United States Government to repay its loan guarantees to American banks. Our debt-rescheduling negotiations with Poland resumed in November 1983, but much time and money was lost. While we refused to negotiate, the Jaruzelski Government had worked out a modus vivendi with the private banks. In essence, Poland agreed to keep current on its rescheduled-debt payments to the banks, and the banks agreed in return to recycle a portion of those payments as trade credits. Poland has a clear incentive to repay the banks because new hard currency credits will enable it to pay for essential imports. In contrast, the Polish Government has judged - correctly, so far - that the United States and other Western governments have no intention of lending again to Poland in the near future. As a result, Warsaw has not bothered to pay much to its official creditors. We may regard this conduct as cynical and scandalous, but we must blame our own actions as well. Where do we go from here? The United States and its allies have adopted a common position in their debt-rescheduling talks with the Polish Government. This is an important first step, given the disarray of previous years. However, these negotiations are moving forward very slowly. The Polish Government has been intransigent, and the debt issue has not engaged the attention of American officials at the policy-making level. Part of the reason for that inattention is, I believe, that a serious willingness by Poland to address the debt repayment issue would require Washington to take yet further steps toward lifting sanctions - in particular, the restoration of most-favored- nation status and of United States government-to-government credits to Poland. To move in this direction - even if it is in our interest to do so - is still not considered popular in Washington, but it will have to happen eventually if we are to restore full relations with Poland. In the meantime, what's important is that we begin collection of those $1.2 billion in Polish debt arrears to the United States Government. A billion here and a billion there soon adds up to real money.B

221-> MAILBAG Missing Strings
To the Editor: In ''Youth Puts Vigor in Jazz'' (Sept. 9), Jon Pareles refers to ''string-orchestra backing, in the manner of Miles Davis's 'Sketches of Spain.' '' I have listened frequently to ''Sketches of Spain'' for more than 20 years and thought I knew it well. But Mr. Pareles's piece sent me back to it in search of that string-orchestra backing. It isn't there. Even Gil Evans, that wizard of orchestration, is unable to make brass, woodwind and rhythm instruments sound like a string section. DOUG RAMSEY Northridge, Calif.

222-> MAJOR NEWS IN SUMMARY ; Egypt and JordanTogether Again
Egypt and Jordan ended a four- year estrangement last week, raising hopes for progress on moderate solutions to Middle East problems. In an Islamic New Year's telephone call to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, King Hussein of Jordan announced he was restoring diplomatic relations. The move could help Egypt to regain influence as an Arab leader, and open the way for Jordan to edge toward discussions with Israel about the West Bank. King Hussein may also have been ready to move closer to Cairo and Washington in view of Israel's talk of withdrawal from southern Lebanon, the consequent United States diplomacy with Syria, and possible improved Egyptian relations with the new Israeli Government. Jordan was one of 17 Arab League countries that recalled their ambassadors from Cairo in 1979 after the Camp David peace accords. Jordan praised ''Egypt's solidarity with the struggle of the Arab people in Palestine, Iraq and Lebanon'' and said the two countries could prevent ''our enemy'' from exploiting them ''one by one.'' Speaking for the ''enemy,'' Israeli Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir hailed Jordan's decision as ''a victory of the Camp David process'' underlying the Egyptian-Israeli peace accord. Western diplomats said Jordan would need Egyptian support to take up the invitation by Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres for West Bank discussions. Egypt and Jordan hope Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader who has already resumed ties with Egypt, can also be drawn into West Bank negotiations. But Israel and the United States want to exclude Mr. Arafat. Last week, King Hussein met separately with Mr. Arafat and Richard W. Murphy, the American Assistant Secretary of State, who also visited Syria. Syria, Iran and Algeria denounced the Jordanian move. Syria backs Mr. Arafat's rivals in the divided Palestine Liberation Organization and stands to lose leverage in its own territorial disputes with Israel if other Arabs agree to separate negotiations. The Government newspaper Al Thawrah perceived ''a treacherous stab in the back of the Arab struggle'' and warned that ''Syria will not allow a new Camp David in its neighborhood and will not tolerate Jordan becoming the center of espionage and aggression against Syria.'' (Setback for Syria? page 3.)

223-> THE CITY ; ;
A group of Hispanic police officers filed a lawsuit yesterday seeking to invalidate the results of a test used by the city for promotions to sergeant. The suit, in Federal District Court in Manhattan, asserted that the results of the test, released last month, show that the examination was not related to the actual work involved and was unfair to the Hispanic applicants. In the suit, the Hispanic Society of the New York City Police Department asked for court orders barring the city from using the test results in appointing new sergeants and requiring the promotion of enough Hispanic officers ''to compensate for a pattern of past and present discrimination.'' The results showed that 4.4 percent of the 1,003 Hispanic applicants passed the test, compared with 10.6 percent of the white applicants. Thomas Kelly, a spokesman for Mayor Koch, said the city would fight any court challenge.

224-> FOOD; FRENCH BISTRO DISHES TO ENLIVEN THE LAST DYS OF SUMMER
SOME foods never go out of fashion. As the evenings grow cooler, certain French bistro dishes go perfectly with the last vegetables and herbs of the season. A classic such as veal kidneys in a mustard sauce, can be served with buttered noodles and zucchini seasoned with tarragon and chives. A tender piece of calf's liver, its juices deglazed with Madeira wine can be accompanied by mashed potatoes and grilled tomato topped with pesto sauce. With these simple bourgeois dishes, drink a red wine - a light Bordeaux or Beaujolais with the liver, a full red Burgundy with the kidneys. Calf's liver is expensive, but so rich that a little goes a long way. Between one-quarter and one-half pound a person is enough. It should be cooked over high heat so that a crust is formed that seals in the juices. Sauteed liver should be pink in the middle with rose-colored juices. If overcooked, it will be leathery. Before cooking, slice it as evenly as possible (a good butcher will do this). The gristle should be removed and the filament, which shrinks when the liver is cooked and deforms the shape of the pieces, should be cut away. When buying liver be sure that you are getting calf's liver not ''baby beef'' (or whatever other name has been invented for what is essentially, grass-fed beef liver). Beef liver has none of the delicate flavor and texture of pale pink milk-fed calf's liver. The same applies to kidneys. Both liver and kidneys should be glossy and fresh-looking with no smell. Veal kidneys are less expensive than liver. They, too, should be cooked so that they are pink in the middle, otherwise they become gray and tough. If they are sauteed in slices, it should be over a very strong heat. Another method is to cook the kidney whole, then slice and warm the slices in the sauce. Whole baked shallots are delicious with liver or kidneys. Place them on oiled foil paper and roast them in their skins in a preheated 375 degree oven for 40 minutes, or until they are soft. Choose firm, large shallots, they should not be dry, wrinkled or have green stalks sprouting out of the middle. Zucchini sauteed in a little oil and butter with chives, tarragon and basil, or tomatoes cut in half and grilled with pesto sauce (made with basil, garlic, pine nuts and olive oil) are fine accompaniments. Veal Kidneys In Mustard Sauce 2veal kidneys 2tablespoons unsalted butter 2tablespoons brandy or Calvados 2shallots, minced 1/2cup dry white wine 1tablespoon Dijon mustard 1/4cup heavy cream Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper to taste. 1.*Trim the fat from the kidneys and cut them into half-inch slices 2.*Heat one tablespoon butter in a heavy skillet and saute the kidneys for one minute so that they are golden but almost raw. Add the brandy or Calvados and flame. Remove immediately with a slotted spoon and keep the kidneys warm. 3.*Add remaining butter and the shallots and cook until they are soft. Add the wine and reduce by half. 4.*Add the mustard and cream and bring to boil. Season with salt and pepper and return the kidneys with their juices to the pan. Bring to boil and immediately pour into a serving dish. Serve at once. Yield: 2 servings. Calf's Liver With Orange Juice 1 1/4pounds calf's liver, sliced Flour for dredging 1tablespoon peanut or vegetable oil 2tablespoons unsalted butter 4shallots, minced 2leaves fresh sage or 2 sprigs of , chopped 1/2cup freshly squeezed orange juice 1to 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar (more or less according to taste) Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper to taste. 1.*Trim gristle and filament from the liver. Dredge the pieces lightly in flour. 2.*In a large skillet heat the oil and butter. Gently saute the shallots with the sage or rosemary until soft. 3.*Turn up heat, add the liver, 2 or 3 pieces at a time and brown on both sides. Remove to a heated dish and keep warm. 4.*Add the orange juice, bring to boil and add a tablespoon of vinegar. Taste for sweetness and add more vinegar if necessary. If the sauce is too dry, moisten with a little water or dry red wine. If it is too liquid, reduce over high heat. Season the sauce with salt and pepper and pour over the liver. Serve immediately. Yield: 4 servings. Calf's Liver With Madeira Sauce 1 1/4pounds calf's liver, thinly sliced 2tablespoons unsalted butter 2medium onions, sliced 1/2cup Madeira 1fresh sage leaf, snipped Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper to taste. 1.*Pat the liver dry with paper towels. Heat the butter in a heavy skillet and quickly brown the liver on both sides Remove to a plate and keep warm. 2.*Add the onions to the skillet and cook until golden, stirring frequently. Add the Madeira and sage leaf and bring to boil. 3.*Empty in any juices that have accumulated in the plate holding the liver. Correct the seasoning of the sauce and return the liver to the sauce. Add the remaining butter, working it in over medium heat. Serve immediately. Yield: 4 servings.

225-> WOMAN ATHLETES TOPPLE SPORTS MYTH
In the final moments of the Olympic marathon last weekend, the first that women were allowed to run in the history of the Games, Kathrine Switzer, announcing for ABC, told viewers that gold medalist Joan Benoit's world record of 2 hours, 22 minutes and 43 seconds - set in the 1983 Boston Marathon - was faster than the marathon run by the great Emil Zatopek in the 1952 Olympics. ''As I said it, I knew the danger of those kinds of comparisons,'' said Miss Switzer, who ran the 1967 Boston Marathon bundled in a sweatsuit because women were not allowed to compete and who led the successful lobby for the women's Olympic marathon as the director of sports programs for the Avon Company. ''It's comparing apples and oranges, but I was trying to make a dramatic point because these are considered the ultimate performances.'' Miss Switzer shuddered at her own comparison because along with most other women athletes and sports medicine specialists she thinks the notion that women will eventually equal men in physical achievement is as ridiculous as the notion that women are too frail for certain arduous activities. These lobbyists for women's sport have effectively laid to rest the old wives' tales that physical exertion turns women into muscle- bound creatures, brings stubble to their smooth cheeks or endangers their reproductive organs. They do not mean to suggest, however, that physiological differences do not exist or that women will eventually run as fast or jump as far as men. ''Now that girls who enjoy sports are getting more exposure, better coaching and greater social acceptance, the women's performance levels are rising and will continue to,'' wrote Dr. John L. Marshall, who was an orthopedic surgeon at the Hospital for Special Surgery and a noted sports medicine specialist until his death in 1980. ''As for how much improvement women can make, that's only now beginning to be explored.'' The Psychological BarrierThe dramatically improved performance levels are evident in virtually all sports, among them the 26-mile, 385-yard marathon, an important symbol because, in Miss Switzer's words, ''it was said to be the most arduous distance and that only the strongest hearts could do it.'' It was not until 1971 that a woman marathoner broke the three-hour barrier. Every finisher at the Olympics last weekend had times at least that good, with Miss Benoit winning in 2:24.52. Miss Benoit's 1983 record was the first women's marathon below 2:25, but many experts predict that a woman will run 2:20 in the next year or two. ''Joanie right now may be the only woman capable of running 2:19,'' Miss Switzer said. ''She's broken the psychological barrier like Roger Bannister did with the four-minute mile.'' The marathon, most physiologists agree, is an event well suited for women. Women are smaller, with lighter bones, and have more body fat in relation to weight and less potential for building muscles. They have a wider pelvis, and thus a different hip and leg structure, as well as narrower shoulders and less chest girth. Women also have more flexible joints and a lower center of gravity. ''Man for man, woman for woman, their bodies are not equal,'' said Dr. James Nicholas, the founder and director of the Institute for Sports Medicine and Athletic Trauma at Lenox Hill Hospital. ''I wouldn't say never, but in our lifetime there will be a difference between men and women in terms of epitome of function.'' Dr. Nicholas and several other doctors agreed that physiological differences make women best suited for sports that call upon endurance, like marathons and English Channel swims, and those that require balance, like certain gymnastics events and skiing. They are least suited for events that require upper body strength, such as the discus or the pommel horse in gymnastics, or those that require bursts of speed, like sprint races. Many experts tentatively speculate that once women catch up in opportunity or training, they will surpass men in endurance events. ''Because of their lighter bones,'' Dr. Marshall wrote, making the comparison between aluminum and steel, ''women have a chance to end up better marathoners.'' Two secondary performers in last weekend's marathon stirred debate of a more specific nature: Gabriela Andersen-Schiess, who listed from side to side as she staggered to a 37th place finish, insensible from heat exhaustion, and Ingrid Kristiansen, the fourth-place finisher who had a baby 11 months ago. Many of the experts in women's fitness were concerned that Miss Andersen-Schiess's terrifying finish, when she was removed on a stretcher, would further the misconceptions about female frailty, but all agreed that dehydration was not a problem limited to women. ''With the equality to participate comes the equality to be totally exhausted in public,'' Miss Switzer said. Doctors later found that Miss Andersen-Schiess was not in danger. Miss Kristiansen's case did not stir the public as much, but generated considerable debate among experts. Many spoke glowingly of the example set by a woman who trained throughout pregnancy and quickly resumed training after childbirth. Dr. Marshall's book takes the commonly held position that ''appropriate exercise during pregnancy is generally favored.'' Dr. Mona Shangold, however, expressed reservations. The director of the sports gynecology center at the Georgetown University School of Medicine said that no existing studies demonstrate harmful effects for either the mother or the fetus from intensive aerobic training, but that she would not recommend it because it diverts blood from certain organs and raises internal temperature, which can cause birth defects. Still, like most in her field, Dr. Shangold was buoyed by the sight of women running their first Olympic marathon. ''People have their own prejudices and a lot of prejudices will remain,'' she said. ''I say it's about time and why did we have to wait until 1984?''

226-> THE REGION ; ;
A former aide to Representative Stewart McKinney, Republican of Connecticut, was shot in the head by another motorist early today on Interstate 95, the state police said. The victim, 25-year-old Nathaniel Young, was in critical condition at St. Joseph's Hospital, according to a state police spokesman, Adam Berluti. He said Mr. Young, who is a deputy sheriff in Fairfield County, was shot shortly after midnight while traveling west on I-95. After he was shot, his car crashed on the exit ramp. ''The circumstances of the shooting are unknown,'' Mr. Berluti said. ''Police have no information which can explain the shooting.'' He said the police did not have a description of the passing vehicle.

227-> YOUR MONEY; MUTUAL FUNDS' SIMPLIFIED DATA
A REVISION authorized by the Securities and Exchange Commission is permitting mutual funds to shorten and simplify prospectuses for their stockholders. Some of the new prospectuses have begun to appear, and within the next five months, the short-form prospectus will be the only one used by the industry. The modification is in keeping with an effort by mutual funds - formally known as open-end management investment companies - and Government regulators to make legal documents prepared for the public easier to read. Despite the simplifications that reduced the size of the prospectuses, those involved in the development of the new format say, shareowners and potential shareowners can still obtain more of the facts necessary to understand the operations and performance of these funds by requesting an additional document. At one time, mutual funds were required to file two registration statements: one under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and another under the Securities Act of 1933. This requirement was later changed so that only one registration statement had to be filed: an N-1, which included the prospectus itself and a section for other information. In August 1983, the S.E.C. announced a new form, N-1A, that would have three parts. Part A is the simplified prospectus, Part B is the ''statement of additional information'' that formerly was contained in the prospectus and Part C is the other data required by the registration statement. Since the simplified prospectuses were permitted last September, they have been used by about half of the newly created mutual funds and about three-quarters of the existing funds. But after Sept. 21, all prospectuses must be in the shortened format. ''Most investors were put off by the very long, technically written prospectuses for mutual funds,'' said Henry Hopkins, vice president and legal counsel of T. Rowe Price Associates, a Baltimore-based manager of many mutual funds. ''They really were defeating the very purpose for which they were designed.'' ''Not only have the prospectuses become shorter, but many of the funds have also made an effort to get them out in plain English,'' Kathryn B. McGrath, the head of the division of investment management at the S.E.C., added. ''Now we are in the process of doing the same thing for variable-annuity-type insurance products, closed-end investment companies and unit investment trusts.'' The mutual fund industry - working through its trade association, the Investment Company Institute - has given increasing attention to simplifying prospectuses in the last three years. There were two major factors behind such interest, according to Thomas Maher, its assistant general counsel. ''Although we wanted to deliver to investors a document that is comprehensible, the essential core information that the overwhelming majority of investors would find useful in making an investment decision tended to be obscured by all this other information,'' he said. ''And the printing and mailing costs of these prospectuses are very much related to their size.'' The institute estimates that the average size of these documents will be reduced to 10 to 12 pages from 25 to 40. It also believes that the nation's mutual funds will save $7 million annually in printing and mailing expenses. The major reason for fewer pages is that full financial statements no longer need to appear. But among the data remaining are such information as the fund's net asset value, income from investment activities and distributions over the most recent 10- year period. Under the new procedure, all funds will send prospective stockholders a copy of the shortened prospectus - and many funds will also send them to existing stockholders once a year along with the annual report. These prospectuses, however, will include a reference pointing out that the statement of additional information is available free for the asking. Up to now, fewer than 5 percent of those who have received shortened prospectuses have asked for the additional statement. It appears, therefore, that the investing public is thus far satisfied with the clearer and more readable information supplied. But it will not be until the simplified prospectuses are universally used for some time that the commission and the funds will know whether these forms really meet the needs of the public.

228-> WHERE CIVILIZATION IS AN ECHO
This is where it all begins. If there's a strip of sand where the Atlantic Ocean gives up its realm and the land begins, I'm standing on it. This is the spot - near the bend of Cape Hatteras - where the Gulf Stream approaches within 12 miles of shore in summer, the place where the continental shelf turns into a precipice, and the shallows reach for the brink of the Hatteras Abyss, 16,000 feet below them. If there's a borderline where north meets south, or at least where the cold black waters of the north meet the warm and saltier waters of the south - the Labrador Current confronting the Gulf Stream head-on - where cold water fish and warm water fish, cold weather birds and warm weather birds mingle for a few miles in their respective environments, this is it. If there's a fringe of primitive coastline left to us, here it is, 120 miles of barrier reef known as the Outer Banks, the longest such stretch in the country. The only man-made structures to be seen for most of the distance are lighthouses and the timbers of an occasional shipwreck, along with a few discreet signs announcing that this is Cape Hatteras National Seashore, with Cape Lookout National Seashore beyond it. Standing on the beach at this moment, as far as I can see to right and left, not another soul is visible - not even the surf riders in their wet suits today. That's partly because it's early in the season and partly because the wind is blowing at 35 miles an hour, 45 in gusts (two red flags hoisted over the Coast Guard station in the village), so that the spray from the whitecaps is blowing sideways and every wave flourishes its own streamer. Weather, in a sense, is what brought me here. I'm a sailor, a racing sailor, accustomed to keeping one eye on the cloud banks and one ear cocked for the marine weather forecasts, telling me what to expect ''from Block Island to Cape Hatteras to 20 miles offshore.'' Block Island I'm familiar with - but why Cape Hatteras? What makes this a dividing line? Now I know. This is the place where our weather begins, the nursery where the storms that strike the northeast coast are bred. According to Wallace DeMaurice, chief of the National Weather Service office on Hatteras, here is the place where the tired- out remnants of cold dry low-pressure systems encounter the warm moist Gulf air, creating a spiral effect, a whirlpool of wind that ultimately dumps rain or snow on our northern cities. But I'm an amateur. I only know what I see - and what I see overhead is more weather right here than one place is entitled to, just as there's more sky here than anywhere else. Storms, wind, sunshine chase each above the beach, low and swift as terns, and a rainy or sunny spell is measured in hours, not days. This is a lean, spare beach I'm standing on. The sand runs flat and straight as if laid out with a T square, thrusting out an elbow from the shore of North Carolina, with none of the rocky charm of New England or the curves of the tropics, but rather the bare-bones beauty of a place where the highest elevations are either sand dunes or whitecaps, and where the bushes rustle at night from the thousands of birds that make their home in them. And if there's a single stretch of coast where the history of the United States began, this is it. Four hundred years ago this summer, Sir Walter Raleigh, newly knighted and high in the favor of Queen Elizabeth, sent two barks from England to explore the coastline. The boats sailed to the extremes of these Outer Banks before returning. The following year, Raleigh dispatched his cousin, Sir Richard Grenville, at the head of a fleet to settle the first colonists on the island of Roanoke, sheltered by the northern tip of the Banks. That's the portion of the Outer Banks known to the tourists, where a bridge connects the mainland to the towns of Kitty Hawk and Nags Head, where the colonists these days favor fast foods and supermarkets. Across the bridge from Roanoke, the national seashore begins, and civilization is restricted to a few odd corners. From this point, a single two-lane road stretches along the spine of the reef, which is frequently no more than a quarter of a mile wide, bordered on one side by the Atlantic Ocean and on the other by the shallow water of Pamlico Sound. A great blue heron stalked alongside the highway as I drove down here, past several National Park Service campgrounds. I was bound for Ocracoke, the most remote island of the Cape Hatteras group, where every living creature is brought in not only by the sea but because of it, and where history is still incarnate in the people and animals. From the deck of the ferry that carried me from Hatteras to Ocracoke, I spotted one island a hundred yards long that was apparently the territory of the cormorants, and another that was padded with pelicans. At the end of the sand spit stood a gaggle of fishermen in hip boots, surf-casting for channel bass (also known as red drum), sea trout, gray trout, mullet, bluefish, pompano. Sport fishing boats passed us, heading for the Gulf Stream with its marlin, tuna, bonito, king mackerel and swordfish, as well as the fishermen's colleagues: hammerhead sharks and loggerhead turtles, pilot whales and porpoises, shearwaters and stormy petrels. Nowhere else on the Atlantic coast is fishing more varied, from crabs that can be caught with a chicken neck tied to a piece of string, or clams dug out of the sand of Pamlico Sound with a rake, to largemouth bass that hide in the muskrat grass of the banks or flounder that can be hooked from a pier. Similarly, some 350 species of land, shore and offshore birds have been spotted on this reef, a favorite resting place on the Atlantic Flyway. Ocracoke Island - population 657 - is a long way from anywhere, a three- or four- hour drive from mainland cities like Norfolk, Va., or Raleigh, N.C., followed by a 45- minute ferry ride via Hatteras, if you're coming from the north, or a two-and-a-half-hour ferry trip across Pamlico Sound, approaching from the west. But even this form of approach seems amazingly metropolitan when compared to the past. It was only in 1957 that the first paved highway for the public was cut through the brush, and only in 1960 that North Carolina inaugurated regular ferry service to the mainland, washing tourists in and out like the tides. Visitors who get off the ferry from North Carolina tend to look for the village. They're standing in the middle of it. The Coast Guard station, the ferry slip, the harbor where a hundred or more fishing trawlers may be docked at one time, unloading their shrimp or flounder, the old lighthouse marking the far end of the cove - this is the center of town; this is where the action is. There's no shopping street, for the good reason that there are neither shops nor streets - or at least no sidewalks, although an occasional strip of boardwalk leads across a dune. There's no clothing store (the general stores sell a few T-shirts and jackets), no shoe store or shoemaker, no drugstore, no supermarket - only a few ''variety stores,'' as they say on the island, that carry bait and ice along with hardware and groceries and do a land-office business in kites during the summer. There are two churches, one saloon and a used-book store that stays open late, but no movie theater (the churches show an occasional film), no bowling alley, no record shop and most emphatically no amusement park. It's easier to find a bait and tackle shop than a gas station. No one feels the need for a carwash. Where there are tourists there are motels - a dozen or so on the island - but all of them put together have not much more than 200 rooms. Just behind the highway fringe of motels are dirt roads covered with pine needles, where the homes still have their family dead buried in a corner of the garden, and the trees rise four times the height of the house. The one-room schoolhouse that until recently took care of kindergarten to 12th grade still stands, even though there's a modern school on the island; the old post office still stands, not much bigger than a postage stamp, even if it has been converted into a tourist gift shop. There's no McDonald's or Carvel on the island, nor any other franchise or chain store, but you can get a first-rate baconburger or sausage dog at the 3/4 Time Dance Hall and Saloon, and shoot some pool while you wait. The original Ocracokers made their living from the sea. Their descendants do the same, some by fishing, but many by serving the tourists whom the sea has lured to this spot. ''We're all descended from pirates or shipwrecked sailors,'' I was told by one of the Bankers I met in the general store. ''I can trace my family back easy to the 1750's, probably long before that if I put my mind to it.'' Looking at him and listening to him, it was easy to believe him. Pamlico Sound he called ''the Sigh-und,'' in an accent that to an untrained ear sounded vaguely rural English. (''You mean the Sow-nnd?'' the North Carolinian sales clerk asked in antiphony.) Devon is the area the guidebooks ascribe the local accent to - Devon, the home of seafarers. The man's hair is red-gold; his beard is red-gold, and drum stew is his favorite food. ''Just sit with a fork and get fat,'' he says. He could convince me that last week he was busy repelling the Spanish Armada. His name is O'Neal, he tells me, which is scarcely surprising on an island where five names - O'Neal, Howard, Garrish, Gaskill and Ballance - encompass a large proportion of the original population. Pirates holed up on this island, without doubt. Edward Teach, better known as Blackbeard, had his ''castle'' here and took a 16-year-old North Carolina girl to be his 14th wife, at a wedding ceremony reputedly performed by the governor of North Carolina. Blackbeard favored a cove at the end of the harbor, where the trees still grow particularly tall, so that his mast was concealed amid the trunks until he chose his moment to pounce on a merchant ship passing through the inlet. It was off this shore that a Lieut. Robert Maynard of the Royal Navy, commanding two sloops paid for by the enraged Governor Spotswood of Virginia out of his own pocket, finally cornered the buccaneer in 1718 and engaged him in battle. Blackbeard sustained 25 wounds, 5 from pistol balls, before he keeled over. The lieutenant then cut off his head and stuck it on his bowsprit, after which, according to island legend, the body swam seven times around the ship before sinking. Despite the piratical past, however, most of the islanders probably descend from a more prosaic group, settlers who came here to make their living by fishing or boat-building or guiding the ships that passed through Ocracoke Inlet in the 18th century. At that time the village was known as Pilot Town and served as a gateway to the commerce that flowed through the Sounds as far north as Virginia. Pilot Town had a built-in monopoly; the island was part of Hatteras at the time and there was no other route. In 1846, however, a fateful hurricane opened the present inlet north of Hatteras and doomed Ocracoke to oblivion for more than a century, until the highway and ferry service once again put it in touch with the wealth of the mainland. History lingers here like old coins in the back pocket of a suit, forgotten until someone shakes it out and sends it to the cleaners. The O'Neals and Howards and Ballances, the Garrishes and Gaskills may date back a few hundred years, but they're hardly the oldest island families. Descendants of the oldest families have four feet and live in a pen by the highway - they are horses, many of them copper colored, that are distinguished from the mainland breeds by their short necks, short legs, goose rumps and golden manes. Because of their small size, the beautiful creatures are known as Banker ponies, despite the fact that they are not ponies at all but wild horses, probably descended from proud-eyed Andalusian forebears. When Grenville brought Raleigh's colonists to the New World in 1585, his fleet stopped first in Puerto Rico and Hispaniola to stock up with horses, cattle, sheep and other animals unknown on the mainland. Like many other sailors in the centuries to come, Grenville ran his flagship on rocks near Ocracoke, and it had to be beached for repairs. It is reasonable to assume that some of the livestock put ashore at that time was never recaptured when the fleet set off for Roanoke. Somehow, the stubby horses not only survived but multiplied and ran in vast herds along the Banks, eating salt grass and pawing the ground with their hooves to dig shallow holes that then filled with fresh drinking water from underneath. When the barrier reef became a national seashore, however, conservationists became alarmed that the animals were destroying the vegetation that kept the island from eroding. A few horses were maintained in a central pen for the local Boy Scout troop and the rest removed, but the remaining herd was too small to breed successfully. Ten years ago, only nine ponies survived out of hundreds or even thousands that had once roamed the Banks. Alarmed once again, conservationists then worried that this Spanish strain would become extinct. A full size Andalusian stallion was brought to the island, where he mated successfully with the local mares, raising the population in the pen to 22 ponies. But this is the way things happen on Ocracoke. The sea breaks ships on rocks and brings horses safely to shore, opens an inlet elsewhere and throws pilots out of work. Land turns to sea; sea turns to land. The lighthouse on Hatteras, at 208 feet the tallest in the nation, built more than a century ago to warn ships away from the deadly shoal, is the favorite tourist sight in the area. But the lighthouse itself may prove to be the sea's next victim. It was 1,500 feet from the water when it was erected; at times high tide has reached within 50 feet of the base. Geography on a barrier reef is not much more stable than on an iceberg. When I left Ocracoke, I drove the length of the national seashore and crossed a bridge over Oregon Inlet - and there it struck me that the bridge was askew. It simply wasn't where it ought to be. On one end, a spit of land jutted out a mile and a half beyond the pilings, while at the other end the pilings seemed to be wading in the water. Here was my final message from the Outer Banks, this evidence that the land itself had shifted in the few years since the bridge had been built, and would go on shifting, making nonsense of the bridge, while the ocean crumbled the base of the Hatteras lighthouse. A reminder that the line where shore meets sea is not a line at all but a flux, and those of us who build bridges or lighthouses, or use them, must watch the world changing underneath our feet. Here, then, is the beauty of Ocracoke, a beach that isn't beautiful at all in the way that the Caribbean beaches or the Hamptons are beautiful, a village that by New England standards isn't charming or picturesque in the least - a place that is nothing more than real. History washed away from Ocracoke the day a storm blew open an inlet at the far end of Hatteras. History came flooding back when the highway and ferry service began. On this shore, we can watch our civilization shrink back and rush forward, like nothing more grandiose or independent in its decisions than a sandpiper feeding between the waves. Savoring the quiet life along the Outer Banks What to See and Do Swimming, surfing, fishing and bicycling are favored activities along this 120-mile strip of national seashore. Bird watchers head for Bodie Island Lighthouse, where a trail leads to two observation platforms, or for the Pea Island Wildlife Refuge. There is a choice of sound, surf, pier or offshore fishing. All along the barrier reef are nature trails and wildlife areas maintained by the National Park Service. Although the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse is closed for repairs, the Museum of the Sea, housed in the former quarters of the lighthouse keeper, is open to the public daily. Nearby, the Buxton Woods nature trail winds through the wetlands. Camping The National Park Service maintains five campgrounds on the Outer Banks, one of them on Ocracoke. The cost is $8 a night for a tent site that can accommodate up to six people, plus a $3 registration fee. In summer, sites should be booked up to eight weeks in advance, either through Ticketron or by writing the Ticketron Reservation Office, Post Office Box 2715, San Francisco, Calif. 94126. Private campgrounds are also available. Ocracoke Island Ocracoke is the most tranquil community of the Outer Banks. The open-air Ocracoke Trolley takes visitors on historic tours, including a glimpse of the Banker ponies. Fishing guides are available (Capt. Norman Miller, 919-928-5711; Capt. Wayne Isbrecht, 919- 928-5571; Capt. Thurston Gaskill, 919-928- 3851). Junius Austin (919-928-4281) will arrange boat trips. Staying on Ocracoke Among the dozen or so motels on Ocracoke are the Anchorage Inn (Post Office Box 130, Ocracoke, N.C. 27960; 919-928-1101), which is on the harbor and has docks and a boat ramp; rates range from $55 for the most expensive double in the summer season to $29 for the least expensive double during the winter season. At the Silver Lake Motel (Post Office Box 303, Ocracoke, N.C. 27960; 919-928-5721), doubles start at $55 in summer and $29 in winter. The Island Inn (Post Office Box 9, Ocracoke, N.C. 27960; 919-928-4351), which has a swimming pool, offers doubles beginning at $55 in the summer and $28 in the winter. Eating on Ocracoke The Back Porch, new this season, presents Banker seafood with a French flair. Outstanding appetizers include crabmeat beignets ($4.50), and seafood p^ate ($4.50). For a main course, try Melanie shrimp verde, sauteed with scallions, fresh dill and garlic, served on an herb waffle ($10.95). The Back Porch (off Highway 12; 919-928-6401) is open for breakfast and dinner only. For lunch, try the sausage dogs at the 3/4 Time Dance Hall and Saloon (Highway 12; 919-928-1221). Ferries Ocracoke can be reached only by ferry. The ferry from Hatteras leaves every 40 minutes in the summer, less frequently other times. The trip takes 45 minutes and is free. The ferries from Swan Quarter, N.C., and Cedar Island, N.C., leave several times daily during the summer; the trip takes two and a half hours and costs $10 one-way for a car and passengers. Reservations for the longer trip, essential in summer, may be made by calling 919-926-1111 (for departure from Swan Quarter) or 919-225-3551 (for departure from Cedar Island).

229-> THEATER; 10th BIRTHDAY AT THE HARTMAN BRINGS ON 'THE TORCH-BEARERS'
STAMFORD, Conn. WHY is the Hartman Theater opening its 10th anniversary season with ''The Torch-Bearers,'' an archaic piece of nonsense? To the artistic director, Edwin Sherin, it is apparently an act of methodical madness. To ''retrieve lost or rarely seen American works'' is the way Mr. Sherin put it in a program note that, in this instance, could be construed as an apologia. In fact, or even in fancy, ''The Torch-Bearers'' does not rate retrieval. George Kelly's first ostensibly full- length play (circa 1922) encouraged him to press on from a prosperous career as a vaudevillian to the perils of playwriting. How were Mr. Kelly or the critics of the period, who praised his fledgling effort, to know that about 60 years later, a British playwright, Michael Frayn, would wipe out ''The Torch-Bearers'' with ''Noises Off,'' a takeoff on a ratty acting troupe putting on a dreadful play. ''Noises Off'' or not, ''The Torch- Bearers'' could easily stake a claim to oblivion. Initially expanded from a vaudeville routine, as was Mr. Kelly's better known and still oft-performed ''The Show Off,'' this is a three-act skit that is about two-and- a-half acts too long. Unlike the movies, which can be comfortably locked into a celluloid time warp, living theater all too glaringly exposes a play's seams. Even if a dated play is lovingly preserved as a period piece, it is easy to see whether the piece is there. Does the material merit restoration or does it deserve no more than relegation to the archives? ''The Torch-Bearers'' appears to be more meritricious than meritorious. At times, it is hard to know what to make of the direction or costumes, respectively credited to Elinor Renfield and Mariann Verheyen. The former vascillates between slavishly adhering to a stilted script and shamelessly indulging in a parody of it, without ever entering the realm of real farce, as such a production must. The costumes range from amusing extravagance to outlandish awfulness. Casting aside the caliber of the play - and it should be cast aside - what are we to make of the production? Does it come from affectionate nostalgia or mere mockery? Even the locale is unclear, so shifting are the dialects from English to upper crust American society. Mr. Kelly's conceit concerns a fiercely untalented amateur theatrical group, dictated by a ''directress'' of even less distinction. They are rehearsing a one-act play in the ''kind of drawing room'' of one of the company's would-be actresses (Act I), putting it on at the Horticultural Hall, which we watch from a backstage vantage point where everything goes wrong (Act II), and suffering the aftereffects of their sheer awfulness (Act III). It takes considerable acting talent and a directorial point of view to play talentlessness. The Hartman production comes off as a museum, not a theater piece. Preaching her acting credo, which advocates grandiosity of gesture and ''emotional conservation'' at the same time, butting into scenes during rehearsals, carrying on when the performance is in progress and, throughout, indulging in malapropisms (''Never foresake one in the hour of quotation'') that alternate with oddly sensible lines (''The question of whether to be or not to be an actress is something every woman must decide for herself'' and ''There will be actresses when husbands are a thing of the past''), Jan Miner is perhaps too good-natured and not nearly dotty enough as the perpetrator of it all, Mrs. J. Duro Pampinelli. The arm or shawl-waving excesses of Sofia Landon and Joyce Bulisant as two of the would-be actresses of the nonoccasion give rather too much credence to the intended amateurishness at hand. David Cryer acts Miss Bulisant's disapproving husband with appropriate disdain. The sight of Mr. Cryer fainting when he hears what is going on is genuinely funny, as well as apt. For sure, there are random moments of merriment. Half of the leading man's mustache falls off (twice), an alarm goes off at the wrong time, two actors get stuck while making a joint entrance through the same narrow door, and one actor is named Huxley Hossefrosse. A little of all this goes too far, however. Clearly, Mr. Kelly had more in mind than a simple spoof. Community theaters are resources for the discovery of real talent, as Mrs. Pampinelli points out in one of her more lucid moments. The Hartman, however, is supposed to surpass that level. ''The Torch-Bearers,'' a comedy by George Kelly; at the Hartman Theater of the Stamford Center for the Arts, 307 Atlantic Street. Stamford, Conn. Through next Sunday Box office: (203) 324-6781.

230-> AROUND THE NATION; Shower Water Rationed In Corpus Christi, Tex.
Corpus Christi residents, in the (AP) - Corpus Christi residents, in the grip of an eight-month drought, began taking shorter showers today as a rationing plan to cut water use by 25 percent went into effect. The rationing should help existing resources last through the fall, when more stringent rationing could be ordered, said Doug Matthews, director of public utilities. Lawn watering already has been curtailed. Under the rationing plan, single- family allocations will range from 6,000 gallons a month for a family of four to 12,000 gallons for a family of 12.

231-> THE AMERICAN DREAM OF TOMAS JONSSON
THE Americanization is virtually complete. Tomas Jonsson breaks into a wide grin at the mere mention of steak, spreads his hands a good two feet apart, and conjures up an image of prime U.S.D.A. beef like some proud Texan. ''You would read in the newspaper back home that in America everything was so big,'' said Jonsson, introduced to native cuisine when he joined the Islanders in 1981. ''And the steak. . . . in Sweden, if you get a steak, it's just a small, little one. ''But here, in America, they're so big. Everything's so big.'' Jonsson's wife, Christina, now comfortably cruises through supermarket aisles near their home in East Northport, L.I. Hot dogs, repulsive to the Jonssons at first, are now a normal part of their diet. Doughnuts are a staple. ''I was really, really careful at first,'' recalled Christina. ''I was only buying things that were most like the food we ate in Sweden. Not anymore. ''I buy all the garbage now.'' There were many new things for Jonsson to learn when he first joined the Islanders in 1981. New dishes to try. New friends to make. Hardest of all, a new language to speak. And the size of the country, like its beef, boggled his mind. ''You can travel in an airplane five or six hours to play another team and you're still in the same country,'' he said, still slightly wide-eyed after three years of coast-to-coast travel. ''Do that in Sweden and you're in Italy, or somewhere.'' For the most part, though, the 24- year-old defenseman has become accustomed to the country's nuances and the continent's particular brand of hockey. He may be Swedish, and through the National Hockey League most everyone properly pronounces his surname YAWN-son, but his style and level of play equal - if not surpass - the Canadians who lay claim to inventing and refining the art form. There are often times now when Jonsson outshines his hockey brethren, Canadian and American, Finnish and Czechoslovakian. Like many Europeans, who arrive in the N.H.L trained more in the finesse aspects of the game such as skating, passing and playmaking, he has not only been assimilated, but he has excelled. About to enter his fourth season, Jonsson stands on the threshold of stardom. Whereas the game's biggest names were once only its top scorers or best brawlers, there is now room for well-rounded, highly skilled players like Jonsson and other non- Canadians to share the spotlight. Some would argue that Jonsson has already reached star status. ''I don't understand how superstars are rated,'' said a teammate, Bryan Trottier, a veteran of all four Islander Stanley Cup teams. ''And I can't speak for the people who make All- Star selections. But, in my interpretation, Tommy has all the qualities of being a superstar in this league. He has the speed, the strength and he has the vision - he sees a lot of what's going on out there on the ice.'' Still, there are nights when Jonsson appears hesitant on the job. A strong, swift skater, he occasionally comes whirling out of the defensive end with the puck and suddenly breaks the continuity of his route. He'll pass off quickly, sometimes errantly, and either watch a teammate carry the play or be forced to retreat on defense. ''You've got a point there,'' said Jonsson, when asked about his inconsistencies. ''In Sweden, I knew I was an offensive player, carrying the puck all the time. When I got here, I wasn't too good in our end of the ice. But I'm getting better. ''You find out it's fun to play defense, too.'' Back in his hometown of Falun, ''a small town of 50,000,'' says Jonsson, the idea of playing in North America became a reality in the early 70's. One of his countrymen, Borje Salming, joined the N.H.L.'s Toronto Maple Leafs in 1973 and was soon on his way to stardom. Two others, Anders Hedberg and Ulf Nilsson, went west for the riches of the now-defunct World Hockey Association the following year. ''I had a dream then,'' recalled Jonsson, who began skating at the age of 7. ''Every little guy has the dream, first to play for his hometown, then to play for a club team in Sweden, and then to play for the Swedish national team. This is the biggest dream, to play here.'' By the age of 17, he was playing for the top club team in Sweden, MoDo, and eventually spent four years on his country's national team. Before reporting to his first N.H.L. training camp in 1981, two years after the Islanders made him the 25th overall pick in the draft, he had already played in two World Cup tournaments, one Canada Cup, the 1980 Olympics at Lake Placid and three world junior championships. Now, looking back over the Swedish national teams he played for, Jonsson sees some of the most promising talent in the N.H.L., including Mats Naslund in Montreal; Bengt Gustafsson in Washington; Pelle Lindbergh and Thomas Eriksson in Philadelphia, and the Sundstrom brothers, Patrik in Vancouver and Peter with the Rangers. ''Already, at the age of 16, you could see he had the skills,'' said Bill Torrey, the Islander general manager. ''He had the quickness, the ability, traits you see in a lot of the European players. You could see he could pass, shoot and handle the puck so well. The good Lord gave him the talent, though, no coach.'' One of Jonsson's early teachers was Anders Kallur, the Islanders' veteran right wing who, as a member of Sweden's national team, coached the 10-year-old Jonsson in Falun. Years before, with Jonsson just learning to skate, Kallur was playing in Falun and it was Jonsson's father, Alf, who drove the Falun team bus. On short bus trips, seated behind his father, Jonsson would accompany the Falun team to its games. ''Tommy would be there on the bus, looking up to the big hockey players, wishing he was one of us,'' said Kallur. ''He sure became one.'' None of the early experience on Long Island now strikes Jonsson as particularly traumatic or frustrating. He earned a job with the Islanders in his first camp, an extraordinary feat considering the Islanders' depth on defense and the fact that they had already won two of their four consecutive championships. He says it all seemed very natural. Christina Jonsson, however, recalls two hardships for her husband. ''He was really homesick at Christmas time the first year,'' she said. ''And each year since, around the same time, he's that way. But it's less and less each year. And the language, a lot of the times, he would tell me, he would just laugh at what the other players were laughing at in the dressing room. But he didn't even know what was funny.'' It was still in his early months here, living in Huntington, L.I., that Jonsson drove to Kennedy Airport to pick up his mother and father for their first visit from Sweden. Eager to see them, and equally eager to show his savvy in his new surroundings, Jonsson got lost on his way home from the airport. For two and one-half hours, he aimlessly drove past countless highway signs and directions that he as yet couldn't read. ''I was angry, too,'' said Jonsson, who now laughs as he tells the story. ''I was somewhere down near Jones Beach the whole time. Boy, was I lost. I still think about it when I see the signs. But I can read them now.'' At home on Long Island with his wife and 2 1/2-year-old daughter, Camilla, Jonsson still converses in Swedish. Friends and neighbors, if they don't speak Swedish, aren't affronted. The Jonssons politely switch to English. Upon the conclusion of each season they head home to Sweden and spend the summer at their lakefront home in Envjken, a town of some 2,000. If he had remained in Sweden and played hockey, Jonsson figures, his salary would have approached 30,000 American dollars. perhaps a fifth of his present salary. Jonsson . He has added 10 pounds since his first camp, feeling that a playing weight of 185 pounds suits him better for the goal-mouth confrontations every N.H.L. defenseman must face. He acknowledges that the play in front of the net is more vigorous than in Sweden. ''But it's clean hitting here,'' said Jonsson. ''The European hockey has a lot of stick work, dirty play, much dirtier than the N.H.L., and that's not good.'' Stardom, say in the form of being named a first-team all-star, would be fine. But it isn't a goal Jonsson sets. ''I'm happy. If I was an All-Star, sure, I'd be even more happy,'' he said. ''But it's nothing I hope for; it's important to do a good job for the team, most of all.'' Perhaps it is that lack of overt aggressiveness, or drive, that keeps Jonsson from reaching his full potential. Or maybe it's a simple case of a young player still uncertain of his direction and capabilities. ''Maybe he's afraid to try and do it, I don't know. But he seems to hold back a little and I don't know why,'' said a fellow Islander defenseman, Dave Langevin, who is an American. ''He just needs a little more confidence in himself, I think. Why not be a catalyst back there?'' ''I think he's right there, ready to do it,'' said Al Arbour, the Islander coach, emphasizing his point recently by banging a closed fist on his desk at Cantiague Park, the club's training facility. ''He's got the potential to be an All-Star. He just needs the confidence to get over that threshold.''

232-> INVITATION TO RESORT OPENS DOOR TO A TIME-SHARING SALES PITCH
Tempted by a Gulf of Mexico vacation, a trip to Disney World, a video cassette recorder, a microwave oven or a push-button telephone? ''You will definitely receive two of the awards,'' was what the Mailgram promised. ''There are no hidden conditions, and there is no obligation to purchase anything.'' All the recipient had to do was ''enjoy an informal introductory tour'' of a new hotel in Newport, the Inn on the Harbor. The offer did not say that the tour would be a three-and-a-half-hour sales pitch to buy two weeks of ''interval ownership,'' usually known as time sharing, in the hotel. Growth in Time Sharing Time sharing is a rapidly growing form of ownership that gives people the right to occupy a housing unit for a specified period. Since 1975, annual sales of time-shared property have jumped from $50 million with 10,000 owners, to projected sales of $1.8 billion with more than 700,000 owners this year, according to the National Time Share Council in Washington. But the sales, often initiated by direct mail promising expensive-sounding gifts, have touched off widespread complaints among consumers and prompted new laws in Connecticut, New Hampshire and California. The Rhode Island Attorney General promulgated a set of regulations in February requiring sellers to describe fully the value of prize offers and give buyers the right to change their minds. The Attorney General acted after receiving 171 complaints in a year about several resorts, 90 percent of them involving the Inn on the Harbor and Newport Overlook, both of which are owned by the Inn Group, according to Daniel Hackett, a spokesman for the Attorney General. The complaints were all cleared up after informal intervention by the Attorney General's office, he said, with some visitors being given more satisfactory prizes and others being released from their purchases. 'By Invitation Only' Richard Winkler, a lawyer for the Inn Group, admitted there had been ''a few inquiries, or complaints.'' But he said, ''I have worked very hard with the Attorney General to resolve them.'' At the Inn on the Harbor, each visitor is greeted by a sales agent, one of 25 on staff, who escorts the visitor into a large room furnished with tables. The agent immediately presents his prospective client with vouchers for a $500 ''reduction'' in the price. ''We're not a used car lot - we're not pressuring you,'' said a saleswoman who introduced herself as Martha, a former high school teacher. ''This sale is by invitation only,'' she said. ''You have been specially selected.'' (The inn had purchased names of holders of American Express, Visa or Master charge cards, Martha later acknowledged.) ''But wake up, no tooth fairy is going to give you a chance like this again,'' she warned. ''If you don't buy today, you can't come back. We don't sell to people who just walk in off the street.'' The inn has ''fantastic amenities'' in every room, Martha said. To start with, there is the ''Newport harbor view.'' View From the Rooms The inn is on the waterfront off Thames Street, a few feet from the boat yard where the America's Cup yachts were berthed last summer. But only the rooms on one wing, including the room shown to visitors, actually face the harbor. Most rooms face a brownstone Gothic armory on one side or a row of new shops and restaurants on the other. ''We have the best beaches in the world,'' Martha said. ''A shuttle bus will take you there.'' She does not explain that they are the city's public beaches, not the private beach clubs used by Newport society. The compact rooms, decorated in American motel style, also offer cable television, small microwave ovens, a ''six-foot soaking tub'' and ''everything right down to a hair dryer.'' The soaking tub turns out to be a large bathtub. Back in the salesroom a loudspeaker proclaims that Donald Bourgeois of Dorchester, Mass., a working-class section of Boston, ''has just become the newest owner of Inn on the Harbor.'' Some Sales Are Made Indeed, many people seem to be buying. Four sales are made in the three and a half hours, and Martha says about one of every 11 visitors end up buying units. With 75 visitors a day, that means a lot of money for the developers, led by R. Perry Harris, a former salesman of computer time sharing. The inn sells each of its 58 rooms 26 times, for 26 two-week ''intervals.'' At $18,000 for each two-week unit sold, that translates into roughly $27 million. Mr. Harris, according to Martha, bought the land four years ago for $350,000, a sum that does not include construction costs. For the money, Martha said, owners get to use their rooms for a particular week in ''prime time,'' in the summer, and seven other days in the winter. ''Even if you don't like the Inn,'' Martha said, ''it's still a great deal, because you can trade your prime time week for a free week in the international space bank at other time-share resorts.'' The Prospectus Is Requested When a visitor, a reporter who had come to the inn as an invited prospective purchaser, asked to see a prospectus outlining costs, conditions and ownership of the inn, he was told this could be seen later. But when the visitor declared his intention not to buy, Martha asked him to give her the notes he had taken on her talk. A man she described as the manager then came over and said: ''This is a very competitive business. We can't afford anyone taking notes.'' The notes were confiscated, over the visitor's protest, and thrown into a wastebasket, where they were later retrieved. Still, Martha led the visitor to a small room where the promised prizes were awarded. They were a Hong Kong- made telephone that is not compatible with some American telephone services and the Gulf of Mexico vacation. The terms included two free nights at an unnamed motel but no meals or transportation. A small green ''travel passport'' pledged that the motel was ''within two miles'' of a Holiday Inn, a McDonald's and Pensacola beach. Mr. Winkler, the inn lawyer, said ''hundreds'' of people had taken advantage of the offer and had been satisfied.

233-> 9 Die in 2 Airplane Accidents
Investigators yesterday examined wreckage from a plane crash in Georgia that killed four people and an explosion aboard a plane over Wyoming in which five people died. All five people aboard a twin-engine turboprop plane were killed yesterday morning when it blew up while flying over southwestern Wyoming, the National Transportation Safety Board said. The plane, an AeroCommander 690, en route from Red Bluff, Calif., to Aurora, Ill., had refueled in Ogden, Utah, and was flying at 19,000 feet when it went off the Salt Lake International Airport Radar, the safety board said. The plane went down just east of Lyman, Wyo., said a dispatcher at the Sweetwater County Sheriff's Department. Earlier yesterday, all four men aboard two private single-engine planes died when the airplanes collided just east of Valdosta, Ga., Municipal Airport, said Lowndes County Sheriff G. Robert Carter. One plane, a Cessna 150, was taking off and the other, a Cessna 152, was landing when they crashed, said a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman, Jack Barker. ''Witnesses in houses nearby said they heard a noise, looked up and saw one plane spinning toward the ground in one direction and the other spinning in another direction,'' said Sheriff Carter.

235-> 2 Dutch Minesweepers Due at Port on Red Sea
Two Dutch Navy minesweepers are expected to arrive in Jidda on Sunday to replace United States and French teams that have been looking for mines in Saudi Arabia's territorial waters in the Red Sea, a Dutch Embassy spokesman said today. The spokesman, contacted in Jidda by telephone, said the minesweepers Haarlem and Harlingen, each with a crew of 40, would take over from two French minesweepers and three American helicopters that have been in the area since last month at the request of the Saudi Government.

236-> ANTIQUES VIEW; TRANSFORMING THE SCREEN INTO ART
Artists throughout history have pioneered in collecting period or foreign artifacts and, in so doing, have occasionally sparked innovative revivals in the decorative arts. A small, creative movement - and one of the least publicized - began a century ago when French painters, immersed in Japanese art and culture, transformed the Oriental folding screen into a Western furnishing. The results were - and are - stunning, as can be seen in ''The Folding Image,'' at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, the first exhibition to examine this development . The screens on view dating from 1870 to the present include examples of most of the art styles that emerged in this period, executed in paint, carved wood, embroidered silk and bronze- framed opalescent glass. ''Japan exerted a strong influence on the Western folding screen,'' writes Michael Komanecky in the show's superb catalogue ($14.95), published by the Yale University Art Gallery, where Mr. Komanecky is assistant to the director. The catalogue and the selection of the 40 objects on view in the show were a two- part effort by him and Virginia Butera, formerly assistant to the director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Mr. Komanecky explains that the extent of the Japanese influence ''certainly varied from artist to artist and from one time to another.'' He notes that a large number of Western artists who made folding screens also owned Japanese screens. The major artists who began painting screens in the 1850's after Japan opened its doors to the West included Jean Baptiste Camille Corot and Charles Daubigny, who worked together on a landscape screen, and Paul Cezanne, who devised a six- panel, double-sided folding screen for his father's house in Aix-en-Provence. James Whistler, who depicted Oriental screens in his paintings, devised one of his own in 1872, a two- panel, double-sided affair that remained in his possession until his death in 1903. On one side of it he painted Old Battersea Bridge in the moonlight, a view as seen from his London house. Although Whistler's screen is not included in the exhibition, there is a splendid selection of representative examples, most of which have never been shown publicly in this country. One of the earliest screens shown is an 1867 design by William Nesfield, an English artist, that imitates the Oriental character of screens. Dramatically different and totally Western in character is the unfinished screen by Sir Laurens Alma- Tadema and his bride-to-be, Laura Epps, executed when she studied with him in 1870. The painting shows the Epps family about to sit down for a midday meal, a richly detailed but somber Victorian scene in which Alma-Tadema injects a wonderful note of comic relief - a spider dangles from a web above the head of one of the participants. William Morris saw in the screen yet another opportunity to restore quality craftsmanship to furnishings. His three-panel screen shown is of embroidered panels depicting famous historical female figures rendered in the late-medieval style he adapted from tapestries. Pierre Bonnard combined screens with lithographic images, as is seen in a four- panel design showing a nanny and her charges on a Parisian street with a line of horse carriages in the background. Remarkably, the image appears to change slightly each time the screen is folded in a different way. Edouard Vuillard's four-panel 1895 screen, depicting a couple seated in a room, shows an awareness of how the perspective also may change with each refolding of a screen's panels. Louis Comfort Tiffany, a wizard with impressionistic images, created one of his masterpieces in the three-panel bronze-framed glass screen awash with leaves and flowers. Paul Klee took a quite different tack in his 1900 five-panel screen, each panel of which is painted with a different view of the hills of Bern, Switzerland. And Antonio Gaudi's pair of five-paneled wood-framed glass screens, in which each of the 10 undulating carved panels differs from all the rest, is theatrical architectural device used at the entrance to this show. The screens devised following World War I are even more adventurous. Giacomo Balla's 1918 abstract landscape sweeps in brilliant bands of color across his two-panel design. Thomas Hart Benton's stylized waves embellishing his four-panel screen suggest the wild seas of Hokusai's 19th-century Japanese prints. Eileen Gray's screen of swiveling lacquered wood blocks is an Art Deco classic. And Donald Deskey's glamorous use of geometric motifs in his late 1920's silver, black and red design is memorable. The combined talents of Seraphin Soudbinine and Jean Dunand in the battle of the angels in the skies above an urban landscape is a powerful period piece. The exhibition remains through Sept. 3 when it moves to the Yale University Art Gallery, where it will be on view from Oct. 11 through Jan. 6, 1985. The show is supported by grants from Bankers Trust Company and Goldman, Sachs & Co. The catalogue, which is made possible by a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, details in a scholarly essay by Janet W. Adams, the author of a 1982 book on this subject, the history of the screen worldwide from the 16th through the 19th centuries. Screens of the caliber of those in the show are rarities in the marketplace. When they appear, they command prices usually paid for major paintings. One of the Eileen Gray screens sold at Christie's in New York last December for $66,000. Two of the screens exhibited are owned by art dealers - the Gaudi belongs to Allan Stone, and the Tiffany is from Lillian Nassau. The owners say they are not interested in selling them and if they did, according to Mr. Stone and Paul Nassau, who heads the 57th Street establishment his mother founded, the price for each would be about $500,000. Mr. Stone reports that he owns one of two known period copies of his screen. It is about $50,000.

237-> AGENCY TO DRAFT NEW RENT-STABILIZATION CODE
Key legislators have reached agreement on who should draft the regulations governing the administration of rent stabilization laws that cover nearly a million apartments in New York City. In March, Mayor Koch refused to accept a code drafted by the Rent Stabilization Association, an organization of 25,000 New York City landlords. Since then, tenant groups have been lobbying in the Legislature to have the regulations drawn by the State Division of Housing Renewal. The Omnibus Housing Act of 1983 transferred the administration of the rent stabilization system to the state. But under that act, the code that sets forth the administrative actions necessary to carry out the law was to have been drafted by the Rent Stabilization Association, with the city holding a veto power. When the Mayor rejected the code, there remained no agency legally permitted to redraft the regulations. Now, under the agreement announced by the chairman of the Assembly Housing Committee, the State Housing Division would draft the regulations and submit them to the city for comment. There would then be a public hearing, after which the final regulations would be written. The agreement was announced by Senator Frank Padavan, a Queens Republican, and Alexander B. Grannis, the Manhattan Democrat who heads the Assembly Housing Committee. It should take about six months to adopt the final regulations, according to Yvonne Scruggs-Leftwich, the Commissioner of the Division of Housing and Community Renewal. Wicks Law The Koch administration has joined with a coalition of other local governments and construction contractors to seek repeal of a law that they believe drives up the cost of government construction. The law, which has been on the books in one form or another since 1912, requires that most public construction projects be separated into four prime contracts: general construction, plumbing, electrical and heating and ventilation. The members of the coalition, including the State Association of Counties, the Association of General Contractors and the State School Boards Association, complained that the system of multiple contracts is ''the main reason'' for cost overruns and delays on public construction. Mayor Koch and others have tried for years to repeal or amend the law, know as the Wicks Law, for former State Senator Arthur H. Wicks, its prime sponsor. A top legislaitve aide said this year's effort appeared to be stronger and better organized than before. Equal Rights The Assembly Judiciary Committee voted, 20 to 0, in favor of an amendment to the State Constitution providing for equal rights for women. It was the first step in a two-year process designed to put the measure before voters in November 1985. The measure was sponsored by the Speaker, Stanley Fink, Democrat of Brooklyn, and the minority leader, Clarence D. Rappelyea Jr., Repubican of Norwich. Marital Ages The Assembly gave final legislative approval to a bill that would set uniform age requirements for marriages in New York State. Currently, different minimum ages are in force for men and women. Under the legislation, parental consent will be required where either individual is under the age of 18. Judicial consent would also be required for marriages involving individuals under 16. When either party is under 14, the written consent of parents and a judge would be required. Existing law prohibits marriages of males under 16 and females under 14. Kosher Food Hotels, restaurants and other food establishments that sell kosher food would have to register with the state, under a bill that won final legislative approval last week. The measure is designed to avoid the misrepresentation of kosher foods. It requires that establishments submit the name and address of rabbis or rabbinical organizations who certify that the food meets Jewish dietary laws.

238-> LETTERS; Victoria
To the Editor: I was surprised not to see mention of one of the great tourist finds, the British Columbia Provincial Museum, in ''What's Doing in Victoria'' (Travel, July 29). This institution is devoted to depicting the lives of the West Coast Indian, and it succeeds marvelously. I would rate this museum on a par with the Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City, and I would recommend it as the subject for an article of its own. It doesn't settle for the merely visual; there are recordings of tribal rites. Visitors leave the museum feeling they have actually lived among the peoples portrayed in the extraordinary exhibits.

239-> 2 NONWHITES IN SOUTH AFRICAN CABINET
The new South African President, P. W. Botha, announced a Cabinet today that, for the first time in his country's history, included nonwhites. It offered no representations to the blacks who make up 73 percent of the population within its traditional frontiers. Both of the new nonwhite Cabinet ministers were given ministries without portfolio, and critics asserted that the Government's apparent unwillingness to confer specific responsibility on them suggested that their presence was little more than token. The new Cabinet members are the Rev. Allen Hendricske, leader of the Labor Party that represents some people of mixed race, and Amichand Rajbansi, whose National Peoples Party is drawn from the 800,000 Indian community. Both parties achieved a flawed ascendancy in elections last month that were marked by great abstentions and boycotts. They had pledged to try to change the racial separation system called apartheid from within. Mr. Rajbansi is viewed by the Government as less of a radical threat, in relative terms, than the Labor Party leader. ''We are starting a new dispensation and I am going to act responsibly,'' Mr. Botha said when asked why he had not given portfolios to the nonwhites. ''If I find a colored or Indian member capable of handling a portfolio, I will not hesitate to appoint him.'' Unlikely to Appease Blacks Mr. Botha's announcement, in Cape Town, seemed unlikely to appease radical blacks such as those in the bleak townships of Sharpeville, Sebokeng and Evaton, south of here, who buried their dead from recent riots today under the surveillance of armed riot police in camouflaged uniform. Mr. Hendrickse, who was once jailed by those who will now be his Cabinet colleagues, and Mr. Rajbansi, will be the only nonwhites on the ''general affairs'' Cabinet that will deal with all matters of national importance. Ultimate power lies with Mr. Botha who, in his new position to which he was elected Friday, holds potentially authoritarian powers. Mr. Botha said at a news conference that Cabinet ministers would not all have to bear collective responsibility for decisions, but would be obliged to inform their colleagues before making public their dissent. ''I will not allow a minister to go out without informing his colleagues and then making attacks on the Cabinet from outside,'' he said. The ruling was directed principally against Mr. Hendrickse, who has been a vocal adversary of racial rule, but who, as a Cabinet minister, will sit in the same government as the principal theoreticians of apartheid's evolution. Protest at British Consulate Mr. Botha repeated his pledge to give urgent attention to those black people living outside the nominally independent homelands within South Africa's traditional frontiers to which blacks are consigned according to their tribe of birth. He did not, however, give details or suggest a role for black people reflecting the demography of the divided nation. In a further show of opposition to a new Constitution on which the multiracial Cabinet is based, six political fugitives remained sequestered in the British consulate in Durban, complaining at their treatment by British officials who have made clear that, while the dissidents will not be evicted, they want the protesters to go away. The six, all of them facing detention without trial for political activism if they leave the diplomatic sanctuary of the consulate, made it known today that they would send an emissary, Zak Yacoob, to London to seek audience with Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe and other senior officials. Under South Africa's new Constitution, which came into effect on Sept. 3, Parliament will be composed of three houses: one of 160 members for the country's 4.5 million whites, one of 80 seats for the 2.8 million ''coloreds,'' as people of mixed race are officially known, and a 40-seat chamber for Indians. Cabinet for Each House Each house will nominate its own Cabinet for what are called ''own affairs'' that is, the day-to-day running of matters such as education within the overall structure of racially segregated teaching. Those Cabinets, however, are subservient to a ''general affairs'' Cabinet made up almost exclusively by members of Mr. Botha's National Party, the traditional voice of the 2.8 million Afrikaners who form the dominant white group. Adding to the complexities of a system called unwieldy and expensive by its critics, a series of committees drawn from the three houses - and reflecting in their composition the numerical superiority of the whites - will seek consensus on disputed issues. In the townships south of Johannesburg where opposition to the changes has focused over the last two weeks, thousands of people gathered today in churches and cemeteries, places sandwiched between dry, vacant lots ornamented only by garbage, to commemorate their dead. The police kept close watch from heavy armored trucks and Land- Rovers equipped with huge funnels that billow tear gas at the touch of a control button. In the modest Methodist Church in Sharpeville, hundreds of black people crammed in the half-light around seven coffins in polished wood, shouting the battle cry of disaffected nonwhites: ''Amandla.'' The word means ''power'' and its rejoinder is ''Awetu'' - ''It shall be ours.'' The police trucks outside the church, and the air force helicopter hovering above, seemed to suggest a different prophecy from their adversaries.

240-> HIS TORMENTS SHAPED HIS POLITICS
DOS PASSOS By Virginia Spencer Carr. Illustrated. 624 pp. New York: Doubleday & Company. $24.95 In this stylishly written, fact-crammed book, Virginia Spencer Carr has given us a clearer sense than ever before of what a bizarre personal life lay behind the bitter views of public life that John Dos Passos presented in his most notable novels, ''Three Soldiers,'' ''Manhattan Transfer'' and the ''U.S.A.'' trilogy, and of his passage from radicalism to the conservative politics of his later years. Lucy Sprigg, Dos Passos' mother, was a most unconventional Southern lady. Growing up in Petersburg, Va., in the aftermath of the Civil War, she was married at 16 to Ryland Randolph Madison, a fourth-generation nephew of President James Madison. The bridegroom was also an alcoholic and a ne'er-do-well. After fathering a son, he walked out on his little family and never came back. Instead of playing the maternal role that Petersburg expected of her, Lucy handed over her little boy to her own mother and took off for Washington, D.C., where her father was running a real estate business. Although officially devoted to Lucy's mother, he actually had a mistress, as Lucy discovered upon taking a job as a copyist in his office. Lucy probably became sexually involved with Dos Passos' father, John R. Dos Passos, in 1883, when she was 27. John R. was a cocky little man with bushy waxed mustaches. The son of an immigrant cobbler from the island of Madeira, he had achieved fame and wealth as a lawyer, first in Philadelphia, then in New York. Despite his Portuguese heritage, he was an ardent Anglophile. He believed in the political union of all the English-speaking peoples and was fond of declaiming long passages from Shakespeare, Othello's speech to the Venetian Senate being one of his favorites. John R.'s upwardly mobile marriage to the daughter of the president of the Bank of Manhattan had been a great gratification to him, but after the birth of their son, Louis, he and his wife ceased to be lovers, a state of affairs that would persist until her death in 1910. For a quarter of a century, he maintained Lucy Sprigg Madison as his mistress. Early in 1896, the 40-year-old Lucy returned to Washington after an unexplained trip to Chicago. She informed her relatives that the baby she had with her was the offspring of an unwed mother who had pleaded with her to raise him. Jack Madison was the name she bestowed upon the infant. A decade and a half would pass before he would begin to call himself John R. Dos Passos Jr. The senior Dos Passos very quickly decided that it would be more prudent if reunions with Lucy and his bastard son took place abroad. In London, Paris, Brussels, Wiesbaden, Bologna and elsewhere, the future novelist accordingly endured a hotel childhood. Living in such close quarters with his mother, young Jack could not help knowing that her loneliness and sense of disorientation were even more acute than his. Periodically their lives were illuminated by visits from a mustachioed man who Jack was told was his guardian and was taught to call Dedi. But when Dedi left them, as he always did, ennui set in again with a vengeance. That Jack worshiped his father there can be no doubt. The boy walked fast, swam in all kinds of weather and eventually began keeping a diary, all because Dedi did these things too. After Jack and his mother returned permanently to the United States and he was enrolled at the Choate School, some of his keenest pleasures came from the letters he received from John R. and from the visits he paid to him in New York. Kenneth S. Lynn is the author most recently of ''The Air-Line to Seattle.'' He is currently at work on a life of Ernest Hemingway. Yet no matter how kind John R. was to the boy, no matter how sincere his interest in Jack's astonishing intellectual development, he was hated by his namesake as fiercely as he was loved by him. Not until Jack's senior year at Choate did his father finally marry his long-suffering mistress, John R.'s first wife having at long last followed Lucy's first husband to the grave. The joy Jack took in his mother's happiness did not last long, however. Before he had finished his junior year at Harvard, Lucy was dead. And in January 1917, seven months after his graduation from college, his father passed away as well. The New York Times obituary reported that the famous lawyer was survived by one son, named Louis. The density of detail in Mrs. Carr's account of Dos Passos' family background and early years is sustained in her description of his curiously reckless conduct as a World War I ambulance driver and in her tracking of his wanderings across four continents in the 10 years following the war. ''Scuttling about the world like a cockroach running away from a light,'' as Dos Passos once described his own conduct, he mystified his friends by his unwillingness to stay put for more than three or four days at a time. Even the easy living at the Gerald Murphys' Riviera villa could not keep him from restlessly moving on to Baghdad, Tiflis, Madrid, Tangier, New Orleans, or wherever. Once again, home for him was a series of hotels. Life unrolled before his eyes like a travel film, and encompassing visions of mankind in the large were duly incorporated in his fiction. ''Three Soldiers'' (1921) may have anticipated by eight years the story that Ernest Hemingway would tell in ''A Farewell to Arms'' of a young man who makes a separate peace, but the strength of the novel lay in the sense it gave of war as a mass experience, which is why Norman Mailer may have made it the model for ''The Naked and the Dead.'' The strange, hurried scenarios in ''Manhattan Transfer'' (1925), its jagged characterizations, its frenzied conversations, brilliantly depicted New York City as a diseased organism - although, as Edmund Wilson pointed out in 1929, the deficiency in the book was that it condemned the sufferers as well as the disease. In the three volumes of ''U.S.A.'' (1930- 1936), Dos Passos raised his social sights from a city to a nation. A dazzling mixture of biography and fiction, of prose-poetry and journalistic documentary, these books have surely told us more about the 20th- century American experience than any historical synthesis ever has. At the same time, did ''U.S.A.'' also chronicle Dos Passos' experience? T. S. Eliot's ''The Waste Land,'' we have lately come to understand, projects a personal agony upon a portrait of civilization. If Mrs. Carr's valuable biography is ultimately a disappointment, it is because she fails to seize the opportunity to make an analogous reassessment of Dos Passos' greatest work. The fascinating story she tells about the author's life would have been even more fascinating if she had attempted to follow it into his fiction. THROUGH Hemingway, Dos Passos met a woman named Katy Smith in Key West, Fla., in the spring of 1928. Having spent all his childhood summers in the same part of Michigan as she did, Hemingway had known and liked Katy for a very long time. As for Dos Passos' reaction to her, he noted that she had beautiful eyes but did not pursue her. He was too busy making notes for his novel, ''The 42nd Parallel,'' the first volume of the ''U.S.A.'' trilogy. A trip that year to Soviet Russia also served to put Katy out of his mind, for the Russian authorities were wooing Dos Passos politically, and they made sure that he had an engrossing time. (The only annoyance the novelist experienced was that he had to travel about the country in the company of a fellow American, Anna Louise Strong, whose militant Communism offended him greatly.) In March of 1929, Katy Smith again came into his life at Hemingway's place in Key West. In between bouts of work on ''The 42nd Parallel,'' Dos Passos now began to spend as much time with her as possible. Five months later, they were married. In applying for their marriage license, Dos Passos truthfully stated that he was 33. Katy listed her age as 34, although in fact she was two months shy of 38. It is Mrs. Carr's opinion that ''Dos Passos may not have known Katy's true age,'' but she is almost surely wrong to suggest this. For Hemingway was well aware of how old she was, and when one remembers what an incorrigible gossip he was, it is difficult to imagine that he did not pass on the information to Dos Passos as soon as he saw that Dos Passos was interested in her. There were other secrets that Dos Passos probably knew - or thought he knew - about his bride. Hemingway and Katy may have been lovers in Chicago in the winter of 1921, even though he was about to become engaged to Hadley Richardson, who was one of Katy's oldest friends. Given the sexual boasting in which Hemingway habitually indulged, would he not have told Dos Passos this story, whether it was true or not? Moreover, Katy may have been bisexual. As Mrs. Carr herself makes clear, Katy spent most of the 1920's living in Provincetown in a curious menage that included her alcoholic brother and two other women. A number of their neighbors speculated that Katy had a lesbian relationship with one of these women. According to Mary McCarthy, who in the 1930's became Edmund Wilson's wife, Wilson referred to Katy's female friends as a ''lesbian enclave.'' How conscious Dos Passos was of such rumors before his marriage is a question that is not touched on in ''Dos Passos.'' But we may safely say that, whatever Dos Passos believed to be true about Katy, he married her anyway. In ''The 42nd Parallel,'' a 20-year-old boy whose first name is John encounters on the train to Ocean City, Md., a young woman whose ''eyes set him tingling.'' Her name is Annabelle Marie Strang (which is as close to Anna Louise Strong as Dos Passos cared to come). Once Johnny Moorehouse gets to know the young woman better, he asks her how old she is. ''I admit to twenty-four,'' she says. He knows she is older than that, knows too that she is a sexual tramp and consequently cannot be sure that he is the father of the child she is expecting. He marries her anyway, because her father has money. Perhaps Dos Passos forgave Katy for trying to keep secrets from him because he also had some he did not wish to share. All through the 20's, he had been on the run. It was a way of avoiding people's questions about his past and of steering clear of lasting entanglements with women. Perhaps, too, in places like Tangier, he had had relationships with men he didn't want anyone to know about and could only bring himself to discuss under the guise of fiction, as for example in ''Manhattan Transfer,'' wherein the bisexual propensities of a young man named John are portrayed with a striking amount of imaginative energy. By the end of the decade, though, after the failure of his romance with a woman named Crystal Ross, Dos Passos may have felt that his friends were beginning to wonder why he wasn't married. Whereupon he met Katy for the second time. THE novelist's family history was checkered with deceits and desertions, all of which seem to have left their mark on him, especially his father's repeated desertions of him during his hotel childhood. Is it any wonder that three months after his father deserted him for the last time - i.e., by dying - Dos Passos caught Socialism, as he phrased it, the way other people caught the flu, and began to proclaim that the whole society - symbolized by his father - was rotten to the core? As Whittaker Chambers would be, Dos Passos was impelled leftward by personal nausea. And in the novels of his leftist years he set forth a terrifying vision of family life and marriage. The characters in ''U.S.A.'' may not appear to have any connection with the author, but in fact their lives are studded with autobiographical references. When Doc Bingham, the dirty-book salesman, puts his arm around the waist of the pneumatic Mrs. Kovach, he seduces her by declaiming Othello's speech to the Venetian Senate. When Janey Williams graduates from high school in Washington, D.C., she goes to work as a copyist, and one of her jobs is to type up ''prospectuses from real estate offices.'' ''The amount of influence the Communists have had on the liberal in-gangs that have made a hash of non- partisan literary criticism in this country would make an interesting study,'' Dos Passos remarked to a friend in 1970. The liberal in-gangs have certainly made a hash of Dos Passos criticism. Except for an occasional and quite perfunctory acknowledgment that the novelist had a tense relationship with his father, they have depicted his conversion to radicalism as a response to the ''objective'' evils of imperialistic capitalism as symbolized by the war-seeking Woodrow Wilson, and they have asked us to believe that his ditching of the left two decades later represented an overreaction to Loyalist infighting during the Spanish Civil War. (See, for example, Alfred Kazin's assertion in ''An American Procession'' that Dos Passos allowed events in Spain to ''irritate'' him into conservatism.) In fact, Dos Passos' disillusionment with the left began well before the Spanish Civil War, and the first registrations of it - as he himself would later point out - can be found in the third volume of ''U.S.A.'' Thanks to Mrs. Carr's biography, it is now possible to put together a more plausible explanation of Dos Passos' political odyssey. Against all odds, this mild-mannered man, who masked torturing memories behind a wonderfully attractive smile, found happiness in his marriage to Katy Smith. His conversion to conservatism was no less personally inspired than his embrace of radicalism. Historical developments served to intensify his political sentiments, but they did not give rise to them.B

241-> NEED TO DISCUSS NUCLEAR WAR CITED
HOPING to overcome what they consider the ''wall of silence'' that prevents families from discussing the nuclear war threat, the county's chapter of Physicians for Social Responsibility has begun what it hopes will be a series of community meetings on the issue. ''What could be a more appalling thing to think about on a nice Tuesday night?'' asked Dr. Nina Evans, the medical director of Westchester County Jewish Community Services as she surveyed the small audience at the first meeting in White Plains last week. Dr. Evans and her husband, Dr. Richard Evans, clinical director of the Echo Hills Community Counseling Center in Hastings, were speaking on behalf of the Physicians for Social Responsibility, a nonprofit national organization with 260 Westchester members that is committed to public and professional education on the medical hazards of nuclear weaponry. Entitled ''The Last Secret,'' last week's meeting at the White Plains Library was co-sponsored by the library and by the county's Department of Community Mental Health. A video documentary, ''In the Nuclear Shadow: What Can the Children Tell Us,'' was shown, followed by a discussion led by the two physicians. ''One of the things I have learned from kids is the importance of secrets,'' said Dr. Nina Evans, a child psychologist - ''whether it's the 15- year-old confiding to her diary or the secret of the closed parents' bedroom door.'' But not all secrets are kept for good reasons, she said. The failure of most families to discuss the threat of nuclear war is what she called ''a dysfunctional secret,'' or one that everyone knows but agrees not to discuss because it is too painful. An example of such a painful secret is the case of the young patient who confided in Dr. Nina Evans that her brother was dying of leukemia. Dr. Evans was warned by the child, ''Don't tell mommy, because if she knows she'll be too sad to be a mommy anymore.'' While people think they are collaborating in dysfunctional secrets to protect each other from pain, Nina Evans explained, the real result is that participants feel terribly isolated and ''disconnected.'' The second consequence of the failure to discuss pain such as the threat of nuclear war, Dr. Nina Evans said, is a sense of ''disempowerment.'' Families conclude, ''The only way to handle this is to deny it. Denial quickly leads to apathy,'' she said. Parents as well as teachers and community organizations must begin to regularly discuss the threat of nuclear war, Dr. Nina Evans said, because ''hope can come through sharing and through the community solidarity which will result.'' Dr. Richard Evans said he hoped that last week's first meeting would ''provide a model for discussion for P.T.A.'s, churches and any organization in the county which has parents.'' Dr. Richard Evans proposed the idea of sponsoring community meetings to the physicians group because of recent studies by mental health professionals that showed, he said, that people overcome their fear of a devastating nuclear war by achieving ''a capacity for denial.'' ''In the face of clear and present danger,'' Dr. Evans said in his proposal, ''denial can lead to perceptual and cognitive deficits that result in selective 'not seeing' or wishful thinking that 'somehow' the situation will change for the better.'' Beginning on Oct. 29, the Physicians for Social Responsibility will sponsor a series of four meetings on the nuclear threat in partnership with the Committee of Interns and Residents at the Westchester County Medical Center in Valhalla. Organizations that want more information on these meetings or on community meetings may contact Dr. Richard Evans between 9 A.M. and 5 P.M. at 478-0633.

242-> 'GO FOR IT': MAKING YOUR WAY IN A TRIATHLON
EIGHT o'clock Saturday morning, and I am in water over my head with 648 other swimmers, waiting for a gun to start Manufacturers Hanover's Mighty Hamptons Triathlon - a three-part race in Sag Harbor, L.I., involving a 1.5-mile swim, 25-mile bike ride and a 10-mile run. It is my third time in the event, thanks largely to the urgings of Ambrose Salmini, a friend and film maker whose favorite phrase is ''go for it.'' Salmini and Ray Charron dreamed up Mighty Hamptons three years ago and have been turning away applicants ever since - more than 2,000 this year. Luckily, training for Mighty Hamptons, affectionately termed a Tinman, is not as strenuous as training for a race like Hawaii's Ironman (2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike, full marathon). I like to swim, bike and, sometimes, even run. But I cannot abide the notion of training: the very word, with its connotations of discipline and denial, makes me want to lie in a hammock. As one friend gently chides, I don't train for the triathlon, I practice for it. The start is sounded and, after a while, my strokes become a physical mantra - light blue, dark green; first sky, then water - punctuated by unintended but well-placed foot jabs to my jaw. I remember a fisherman describing the start the year before. ''It was just like a run of blues, all that splashing and whitewater commotion.'' I wonder if bluefish are as bruised. Halfway through I become aware of another swimmer in a bright orange cap. We match stroke for stroke, he breathing on his left, I on my right, and after a few minutes of consternation, I begin to like this pickup game of synchronized swim. Could Tracie Ruiz and Candy Costie, the Olympic duo with the Peposodent grins, do so well in Noyac Bay? I doubt it, and am almost disappointed when my erstwhile partner picks up the pace and pulls out of sight. Fifty-five minutes after the start, I emerge, 26 minutes behind the leader, Charlie Graves. Now, anyone who takes the triathlon seriously knows the importance of the transition - that period between one activity and another, when a clothes change is made. In fact, the previous afternoon, a professional triathlete, tan and muscled like a shark, warned novices, ''You can make or break a triathlon in transition.'' I had not listened: I knew the luxury of limbo, and would not be thwarted by my tri-suit, a sleek spandex affair worn in the swim, bike and run, and given to me by my self-appointed trainer, a man who considers swimming a way to avoid drowning and runs only to catch taxis. I dry myself off, sit down and put on my shoes and helmet. Limbo beckons. I lean back and watch as one contestant speeds off, then another and another. I smile. There is an art to slow transitions. Finally on the road, I take my place in the parade of cyclists, all pink and blue, yellow, purple, green and red, moving through the forest, dappled in sunlight, a late 19th-century French velodrome print in motion. The whir of well-oiled machinery is interrupted only by decisive clinks as derailleurs move chains to a lower gear for the long, steady climb over the terminal moraine. At the summit, we hover, a flash of Peconic Bay, and then down, tucked against the wind, to the flats of the potato fields, newly brown after summer's harvest. By and large, I am not competitive. By and large. But I find myself keeping track of the number of women I pass, the number of women who pass me. I am one up and counting in my own game when I pass a woman, disspirited and spent on a wide-tired bike, and a man who looks as if he and his bike could go much faster. ''Don't worry,'' I hear him say as I break away. ''A lot of these people will burn themselves out. Besides, the main thing is to finish.'' Thus admonished, I give up my vainglorious tally and make note instead of the Canada geese floating on a pond. They, too, are on an annual triathlon (swim, waddle and fly), heading south. As if by some grand design, a group forms, this time a student who spent his summer cycling through the Netherlands and a woman with a British accent. We ride three abreast, taking turns falling behind one another as cars overtake us, more like members of team pursuit than competitors. The woman, No. 975, tells me she is looking forward to the run. ''I feel much safer,'' she says. ''It's just one foot in front of the other.'' That's why I don't particularly like running. It is just one foot in front of the other, in this case for 10 miles. I fall silent, reciting my ritual prayer that I'll have a flat, a neat out from the race: I have no spare. My hopes are deflated as the transition area comes into view. Nothing to do but lace up my running shoes and head off. Just out of the parking lot, people are cheering as Dale Basescu breezes by, heading for the finish and, with a time of 2 hours 27 minutes 52 seconds, first place. Just four racers later, the first women, the Canadian twins Sylvane and Patricia Puntous, run by, their strides as evenly matched as a pair of racing trotters. A man in a First Boston T-shirt cheers them on, then grouses: ''I can't stand it. They're finishing and we're only starting.'' I sympathize, but don't really understand, pleased as I am that these specimens of grace and speed have just passed and I am only nine miles behind. At the side of the road, someone is doing deep kneebends. Many say the triathlon is better for the body than the marathon because different sets of muscles are used and, in cross-training, exercising one set strengthens another. Perhaps. But there is also the flip side, when fatigue hits all sets of muscles at once. If you've been riding hard and then start running, often it feels as if your thigh bones are no longer attached to your shinbones. Experienced athletes call this ''cross- bonk.'' Watching the would-be runner, I reiterate what another runner told me the year before: ''Don't worry, it's supposed to feel that way,'' I lie. ''It's just the first mile or two, and then you'll feel better,'' I add truthfully. A man of about 40 falls in step with me. Such alliances are typically brief, lasting only as long as both runners can remain in stride. Unlike cocktail chatter, names and occupations are usually exchanged only after several miles, if at all - it's a sort of Emily Post racing etiquette. We wait till Mile 5. Dave, a former teacher who now fights fires in Queens, is most encouraging, but at Mile 8, I tell him to go ahead - the sun is at its zenith and I am ready to slow down. Around the bend, an elderly couple stand at roadside, spraying contestants with cold water, an oasis of kindness. Refreshed, I start the final stretch. I lost some time, but it has been my experience (speaking for the rearguard) that unless your time is in the top 10 percent, people don't remember how fast you finished, but how well. I cross the line, smiling, as the clock shows that the race and I have been going for four hours. Later, I see two runners and a cyclist talking an older woman into the finish. I'm not sure, but I think I saw her at the awards dinner for the 635 finishers. She was on the podium, No. 990, Barbara Kipp, winner of the women's 55-and-over division. I know I saw the woman I had cycled with, No. 975 - she came in second among women 45 to 49. And I, No. 943, came in 10th, 35 to 39. And everyone cheered as loudly for the winner of 55 and older as for the winner of the entire race. It was, as Dave the Fireman said, a glorious day. Suzanne Charle is a freelance writer and editor.

245-> BRIEFING
Off-the-Record Reagan In an election year, it seems, a President, like it or not, is public relations-bound to give reporters a chance to get to know him better. President Reagan is no exception. In recent weeks, Mr. Reagan has been holding off-the-record meetings with small groups of White House reporters, the object being, according to his advisers, to improve the personal chemistry between him and the adversary pack that follows his words and deeds on a daily basis. One participant noticed a touch of the bunkhouse in his group's meeting with Mr. Reagan. ''It's the same old Reagan we see in public, except for a few 'hells' and 'damns.' '' One of the most striking things about these sessions, according to some of Mr. Reagan's aides, has been the press's adherence to the ground rules. They say that so far, at least, no one has reported a word from these meetings. Instead, some of the reporters have been sharing some of the President's more newsworthy remarks with one another, off the record, of course, around the White House press room. The world may never know what the President thinks of, among other things, the memoirs of a former member of his Cabinet who is critical of the Administration's conduct of foreign policy. The Virtue of Tolerance One of the few places in Washington where both sides of the story are within easy reach is the Department of Labor's public information office. In the same bins where departmental fliers tout the latest labor news from the Reagan Administration, a variety of union newspapers tell a different story. ''Wealthy Gain, Poor Lose Under Reagan Policies,'' says the headline of The A.F.L.-C.I.O. News. ''Mondale on a Roll in Election '84,'' says the headline of Steelabor, the newspaper of the United Steelworkers of America. The department, it turns out, over the years has allowed union papers to share the rack with its news releases as a service to reporters, one that has survived even the bitterest times between unions and the White House. Meanwhile, the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations is trying to show that it can be just as tolerant when it comes to foreign cars. The manager of the A.F.L.- C.I.O. building here, in a move designed to show solidarity with American automobile workers, recently decreed that any foreign cars parked in the headquarters driveway would be towed or ticketed. When federation officials learned of the rule, they quickly overturned it, explaining that it would irritate foreign visitors who arrive, as often as not, in foreign cars. Diplomat on the Move Anthony C. E. Quainton is in line to be the new United States Ambassador to Kuwait. Earlier this year he was recalled from his ambassadorial post in Nicaragua after some in the Administration decided he was out of sync with President Reagan's policies in that region. Some of Mr. Quainton's allies in the Senate made an effort to see that his fall from favor did not result in a setback to his Foreign Service career; the Kuwaiti post is considered an important one and worthy of someone with Mr. Quainton's diplomatic experience. His move from Nicaragua to Kuwait is a reminder of one of the stranger aspects of modern diplomacy: Security concerns often are greater in friendly countries than in politically hostile ones. In Managua, the Nicaraguan capital, United States diplomats live in relative peace, despite the high emotional pitch of anti- American rhetoric in that country. Kuwait, on the other hand, has friendly relations with Washington, but the United States Embassy there was the target of a truck bomb last year a few weeks after a similar terrorist act killed 241 Americans serving in Beirut, Lebanon.

247-> BOTH SIDES ATTACK PERSIAN GULF SHIPS; U.S. FEARS STEP-UP; IRAN IS REPORTED WEIGHING PLANS TO WIDEN WAR
Reagan Administration officials have reportedly told members of Congress that some intelligence analysts believe Iran may be planning to widen the Persian gulf war by attacking Saudi Arabian oilfields and sending suicide planes against oil tankers. Congressional staff members said today that the officials had cited such reports as support for the tentative Administration decision, disclosed Wednesday, to provide Saudi Arabia with 1,200 portable Stinger antiaircraft missiles. The staff members said 200 missiles would be provided immediately and 1,000 later. They Cite Emergency Powers They said the first 200 missiles, accompanied by 100 launchers, would be provided to the Saudis through the President's emergency powers and would not have to be delayed for a 30- day Congressional review. The House Speaker, Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., said today that ''there is going to be an escalation of the war after June 1.'' Mr. O'Neill, Democrat of Massachusetts, who had a closed-door briefing on Tuesday from Secretary of State George P. Shultz, added that he could not say more on the subject. But he said the United States should not get involved in the Persian Gulf situation except in concert with Britain and France. A State Department official said later that intelligence analysts had said Iran might launch a major ground attack against Iraq during Ramadan, the Moslem month of dawn-to-dusk fasting, which begins June 1. Iranian forces, estimated to total hundreds of thousands of men, are said to have been massed near the Iraqi border for months. Other officials said the intelligence analysts had warned that the conflict could also be widened by an Iranian attempt to destroy the oilfields of Saudi Arabia, which backs Iraq in the war, or by an Iranian decision to send suicide flights of small planes carrying heavy explosives into tankers in the gulf. Doubt Saudis Will Seek Help The officials said such moves could lead to a Saudi decision to retaliate in strength using American-made F-15's against Iranian installations. The officials said, however, that they thought it was unlikely that the situation would worsen to a point at which the Saudis might ask the United States to introduce naval and air power to help them. Some Administration officials, when informed of what Congressional staff aides had reported that members of Congress had been told in their briefings, said they knew of no hard intelligence predicting an imminent Iranian air strike against Saudi oilfields. They said, however, that they had heard of estimates by intelligence analysts about possible ''scenarios'' by which Iran might step up action against Saudi Arabia. The Iraqis also seem to be talking of increasing the fighting. On Tuesday President Saddam Hussein of Iraq said that the ''the day is coming closer'' when Iraq will have the weapons to destroy the Iranian oil terminal at Kharg Island and other major Iranian ports and oil installations. A Western diplomat in Washington said today that he understood that the Iraqis were to receive medium-range SS-21 missiles with conventional warheads from the Soviet Union. These are said to have a range of several hundred miles and are an improved version of earlier, less-accurate missiles. Last year the Soviet Union provided the SS-21 to the Syrians, the first time the weapon had been introduced into the Middle East. U.S. Would Open Reserves The Secretary of Energy, Donald P. Hodel, said today that if tensions in the Persian Gulf were to lead to a substantial oil shortage in Europe and Japan, the United States would open the sale of its strategic oil reserves to foreign bidders. The reserve program is designed to store up to 750 million barrels of crude oil in underground caverns to be used in the event of a significant worldwide oil shortage. The current level of reserves is 400 million barrels, Mr. Hodel said. Mr. Shultz and other Administration officials have been consulting with leaders of Congress on the sale of the Stingers to Saudi Arabia, in the hope of avoiding a dispute. Last March, the Administration announced plans to provide Saudi Arabia with 1,200 Stingers and Jordan with 1,633, but the decision was canceled after Congressional opposition arose to the Jordanian sale. The Stingers would be used, the Administration said in briefings conducted in the last two days, to improve security at the Saudi oilfields and to allow small Saudi boats to accompany tankers in the vicinity of their waters, carrying Stingers for protection. The Stingers have a range of about three miles and are considered effective against low-flying planes. Wisconsin Senator Cautious Concern about the sale of Stingers to Saudi Arabia was raised today by Senator Bob Kasten, Republican of Wisconsin, chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations. He said he did not think the Saudis' security situation was so precarious that the Administration should waive the usual rules for providing weapons. He said that there were many questions and that he preferred the 30-day period so that all the questions could be answered. Mr. Kasten noted that the Saudis already have improved Hawk antiaircraft missiles and portable Redeye missiles.

250-> CAMPAIGN NOTES; Arrest and a Quarrel Disrupt a Jackson Rally
A campaign rally for the Rev. Jesse Jackson here was disrupted Thursday by members of the Jewish Defense League after a man carrying a knife was arrested at the scene. Mr. Jackson was late for the rally at the Los Angeles Valley College. Before he arrived, the police said they arrested Daniel Zimring, 20 years old, who was placing a knife in his boot. He was charged with possession of a dangerous weapon and was released on $1,000 bail. ''We don't know if he was a member of the Jewish Defense League or not, but a tattoo on his arm led us to believe that he might be,'' Sgt. Jeff Sheldon said. A photographer for United Press International said the tattoo appeared to depict a Star of David. As the candidate for the Democratic Presidential nomination sat on the dais preparing to begin his speech, a man arose to express Jewish support for Mr. Jackson. Members of the militant Jewish organization got into a shouting match with Jackson backers.

251-> CREDIT MARKETS; SHORT-TERM BILL PRICES RISE
Short-term Treasury bill rates fell sharply yesterday, while yields of long-term bonds rose briefly to their highest levels of the year, and remain higher than anytime since July 1982. Although prices of Treasury bills rose while bond prices fell, participants in both markets were responding to concerns about the stability of the United States banking system. There was no evidence of a major deposit outflow from any major bank, yesterday, but rates for Treausry bills fell as much as three-tenths of a percentage point while yields on bank certificates of deposit rose by about the same amount. The widening spread between Treasury bills and bank certificates of deposit ''reflects both a flight to quality to bills and a growing concern over the safety of Eurodollar deposits,'' analysts at Money Market Services, a Belmont, Calif., economic news analysis firm, said. Adding to the uncertainty and volatility of the credit markets is the continuing debate about the future course of Federal Reserve monetary policy. Analysts agree that the Fed has responded to excessive credit demands and rapid economic growth by allowing linterest rates to rise since March. But they are not sure if problems in the banking system would cause the Fed to change direction. Prices in the note and bond market were little changed in response to the Federal Reserve's late afternoon announcement that the nation's basic money supply rose by $1.1 billion, to $541 billion, in the week ended May 14. The increase was in line with forecasts, and leaves the M-1 money supply measure $2.6 billion below the top of its 4 percent to 8 percent growth target. An increase in the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market to 10 3/4 percent or more the last three days led James R. Lothian, a money market economist at Citibank, to conclude that ''the Fed has probably tightened up.'' Other analysts, focusing on the Fed's responsiblity to maintain order in the financial markets, said the central bank might keep interest rates from rising for a while. ''The Fed will not want to tighten until the markets have calmed down,'' said Maury Harris, an economist at Paine Webber Inc. ''Today's action in the money markets tells you that the panic situation has not blown over yet.'' Prices of Treasury bills - which are widely sought as a haven by conservative investors during times of turmoil - rose enough to reduce the three-month bill rate to 9.65 percent from 9.96 percent a day earlier. For bills due in one month demand was strong enough that the rate was only about 8.90 percent. While bills were in heavy demand and their rates were falling, securities issued by major banks were regarded less favorably, and their interst rates were rising. Senior officials in charge of borrowing at major New York City banks maintained that they still had access to the capital markets, but acknowledge that they were not trying to borrow large sums of money while the markets were in turmoil. In secondary market trading of large bank certificates of deposit that are already outstanding, rates rose as much as three-tenths of a percentage point, on very light trading. By late in the day, the secondary market yield on one- month C.D.'s issued in multiples of a million dollars was about 10.85 percent, rising to 11.55 percent for three- month C.D.'s. Securities firms that are active traders of bank C.D.'s said that market conditions were much different than a week ago, when C.D.'s of Continental Illinois were trading with a yield that was a percentage point higher than the yield for comparable C.D.'s of the 10 largest banks. In yesterday's trading, certificates of the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company were not trading any differently than they have in recent weeks, and there was no major selling by investors in the bank's certificates. Yields on Manufacturers paper were either the same as other large banks or no more than five basis points higher. In the Treasury note and bond market prices weakened substantially, and securities dealers said that investor demand remains very weak. Besides their holdings of notes and bonds auctioned earlier this month, dealers said investor demand was disappointing at Wednesday's auction of 12 5/8 percent notes due in two years. The new notes were offered yesterday at 99 3/4 to yield about 12.87 percent, compared with about 99 29/32 at the auction. Demand for bond prices was further weakened, analysts said, by worries that the Federal Reserve might ease monetary policy in response to problems in the banking system. A major easing of policy could be bad news for bond investors, since it might lead to a resurgence of inflation in 1985 and 1986, analysts said. In the long bond market, the 13 1/4 percent issue due in 2014 traded as low as 96 10/32, about equal to the low trade on May 11. By late in the day, the bellwether bond issue had recovered to an offered price of 96 5/8, down about 7/8 point, to yield 13.74 percent. The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds is now at the highest level since 13.91 percent on July 7, according to records at the Technical Data Corporation, a Boston firm. Other Fed data showed that business credit demands contined strong as bank loans rose by $453 million at 10 large New York City banks while commercial paper outstanding increased by more than $3.8 billion. Because of distortions caused by Continental Illinois' heavy borrowings from the Fed, analysts said the latest reserve data reported by the Fed did not provide any clues about the current status of monetary policy. For the two weeks ended Wednesday, bank borrowings excluding extended credits averaged $4.146 billion while excess reserves averaged $557 million. The resulting net borrowed reserve position was $3.854 billion.

256-> ABOUT NEW YORK
The small coffee shop at South Ferry was shoulder to broad shoulder at 7 A.M. with construction workers from Locals 3, 825 and 1536. Most wore sleeveless undershirts that revealed tanned, muscular arms - arms that had never been hooked up to machines at health clubs, they will assure you; arms with plenty of latitude for tattooed panthers, hula dancers and snakes. The men drank coffee - black - and passed around photographs, which someone or other seems to carry with them every morning. There were photographs of someone's Datsun 280 ZX and of children and friends, but most of the photographs are of ''the Lady,'' as the men refer to her - the Statue of Liberty. These workers are on the crew that is rehabilitating the statue. One of them, Bob Conmy, says his 9-year-old daughter, Robyn, takes the photographs to school to show to her classmates. Mr. Conmy is on the crew that built the scaffolding surrounding the statue. He was one of the first people in 98 years to look her right in the two- and-a-half foot eye. He gave her a kiss. At 7:30, the men boarded a boat that took them to the work site. They have made this trip every day for months, but still most of them face forward, gazing at the green copper statue showing through their shiny aluminum superstructure. Joseph Romano, a young general laborer, said this was an exciting job, because people ask him about it and because he gets to ride a boat to work. Fred Harris, who has operated a forklift for 35 years, insists, ''It's really just another job.'' Paul Gabriel, an electrician for 25 years, said he liked the job, ''because supervisors don't like to come out to an island where there aren't any good places to eat lunch.'' ''There is no need for supervision,'' he said. ''This is something you want to do. She is all ours for a while.'' It is just another job in some respects. There is straining and sweating these hot, humid days. There is the sound of clanging iron, of whirring power saws and of jackhammers busting things up. Inside the statue, temperatures reach 120 degrees, punctuated by occasional blasts of burning cold - liquid nitrogen at -350 degrees Fahrenheit is sprayed by Mr. Romano and others on a century of paint and corrosion, causing it to fall in flakes like autumn leaves. There are cuts and bruises and the danger of far worse as men dangle out 30 stories above Liberty Island and Upper New York Bay, with winds whistling through the 25-story, free- standing aluminum scaffolding. Final preparations are hurriedly being made for a Fourth of July ceremony, when the old corroded torch will be removed by a hoist, with Lee A. Iacocca, chairman of the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Centennial Commission, and other dignitaries in attendance. Elmut Leonardelli, of Local 1536, explains through a big wad of chewing tobacco that he always wears his Stars and Stripes sweatband on this job and plans to wear suspenders to match on the Fourth. Fred Harris of Paterson, N.J., will be the man of the moment. Mr. Harris, an operating engineer for 35 years, has been selected for the exacting job of operating the hoist that is to lift off the old torch. ''Just another lift,'' he said. ''I'll have to work the Fourth, and my wife doesn't like that. At least I won't have to stay home and barbecue and work around the house. And it's a double day,'' a reference to premium pay. On the other side of a wire fence around the construction site, the Miss Freedom of the Circle Line continues to deposit visitors. A park ranger, Mike Kusch, who leads tours, still becomes a little misty-eyed when he tells of immigrants arriving on ships and being greeted by the Statue of Liberty. A group from the Camp Fire Girls organization in Fairfax, Va., asked him how they could go about contributing $5 each to the restoration fund. Angelo Bommarito, labor foreman on the project, immigrated from Italy 18 years ago, at the age of 17. ''Get moving with that!'' he yells to one of the workers, in the midst of telling the story of his arrival on a ship from Italy at 3 A.M. and of seeing the Statue of Liberty for the first time. ''I cannot talk about my feelings,'' he said. ''To me, the job is a little special. I come from the other side.'' Mr. Gabriel hung from the very top of the thin aluminum scaffolding to attach aircraft warning lights. The 45-year-old electrician from Matawan, N.J., talked of suddenly being an important person to family and friends interested in the project. ''Normally I am just an electrician,'' he said. ''I hope my boss puts in a good bid for the remainder of this work,'' he said. ''I want to finish the job. I have worked on a lot of jobs, including the World Trade Center. Working on the Lady here, you realize that the trade center was just a tall building.'' Tom Snodgrass, supervisor of the project for the general contractor, Lehrer/McGovern Inc., has a reputation among the men for toughness. He talked of arriving on the island at 6:30 A.M., before any of the other workers. ''It is very quiet,'' he said. ''You can take the time to notice little things about her, the little creases in her hands, the spots on her arms and little welts in her throat that need to be tended to. She is a different color in the morning light. It is quite a sensation to touch her face. Very few people have done that.'' Joe Fiebiger works inside the statue making molds of each one of the 1,200 corroded armatures that attach the superstructure of the statue to the copper skin and hold its shape. Each one must be replaced. Each is different, following the contour of the flow of the robes, the slant of the nose and the like. ''I guess,'' said Mr. Fiebiger, ''whether we admit it or not, we are all in love with her, for different reasons. I don't want to sound foolish. I am a blacksmith.''

257-> BUSINESS PEOPLE; A Top Post is Filled At Troubled Equibank
Claire W. Gargalli has been elected president of Equibank, the principal subsidiary of the Equimark Corporation, the financially troubled bank holding company in Pittsburgh. Miss Gargalli, 41, succeeds James D. Lowry as president. Mr. Lowry, a turnaround specialist for troubled banks, remains chairman and chief executive officer of Equibank and its parent company. Miss Gargalli joined Equibank in August as senior executive vice president. She was recruited from Fidelity Bank of Philadelphia, where she had been an executive vice president, by Mr. Lowry, who has known her for 15 years. ''I was at Fidelity while he was with Provident Bank,'' Miss Gargalli said in a telephone interview. ''We both have experience in dealing with different types of problems at different organizations.'' Miss Gargalli was referring to Provident National Bank of Philadelphia, a troubled bank that Mr. Lowry turned around in the 1970's. In her new post, Miss Gargalli said that she would ''concentrate on the day-to-day operations of the Pittsburgh bank,'' while Mr. Lowry would be concerned with ''strategic direction and raising capital.'' As part of the latter effort, Equimark said an investor group headed by the Provident National Investment Corporation had indicated a willingness to buy a 4.9 percent stake in the holding company, a purchase that would provide slightly more than $3 million in new capital. In addition, the parent company said it had agreed to sell its mortgage services company for about $8 million to the Central Mortgage Company, a unit of PSFS of Philadelphia. Largely because of its problem real estate loans, Equibank has been ordered by bank regulators to raise $100 million in new capital by the middle of next year. Miss Gargalli became a banker in 1964, shortly after graduating from Middlebury College in Vermont. At 32, she was named senior vice president of Fidelity Bank and president of Fidelity International Bank.

258-> SCOUTING; Goalie's Big Test
Tom Barrasso's short National Hockey League career has been meteoric. At the age of 18 he came out of Acton Boxboro High School in Massachusetts to become the starting goalie for the Buffalo Sabres and went on last season to win the Calder and Vezina trophies, the first emblematic of the league's best rookie and the second its best goaltender. After playing poorly for the United States team in the Canada Cup tournament late last summer, he returned to the Sabres, but was not the same dominating goalie. After losing three of five decisions and allowing 4.9 goals a game, he was assigned last Saturday to Rochester of the American Hockey League. Had the meteor burned out? ''There was a lot of pressure on Tom in the Canada Cup and when he came back to us,'' said Scotty Bowman, the general manager and coach of the Sabres. ''When you're only 19, the mental pressure can be pretty rough and influence your play. He needs to sharpen his game and regain confidence. ''We thought he'd be better off with Rochester, where he'll play five games in eight nights. Rochester is a good hockey team. They were undefeated in eight games when Tom reported.'' On Sunday, Barrasso made 27 saves as the Americans won their ninth straight, 4-1, from Sherbrooke. ''Tom took being sent down pretty hard,'' said Bowman who is not permitting the goalie to speak to reporters. ''But he gave his best performance of the season against Sherbrooke and he'll be much improved when he returns to us next week. In sports, it's what you do now that counts, not what you did last season.''

259-> U.S. JUDGE RESTRAINS DISTRIBUTION OF MAGAZINE IN COPYRIGHT DISPUTE
A Federal judge restrained the distribution of a national magazine yesterday in a copyright dispute about an article. The magazine, the Saturday Review, was scheduled to distribute the 250,000 copies of its new issue yesterday. But it was delayed by a restraining order issued by Judge Constance Baker Motley in Federal District Court in Manhattan. Late yesterday, the dispute was settled when the Saturday Review agreed to place two advertisements in The New York Times, stating that portions of the copyrighted article are in the autumn edition of The Yale Review. The disputed article - a profile of Barbara Lazear Ascher - was originally sold to the Saturday Review for $1,000. However, Mrs. Ascher said, the magazine failed to publish it or pay her by a deadline set in their agreement. As a result, Mrs. Ascher said, she sold a shortened version of her article to The Yale Review. But the Saturday Review decided to publish the article in its new issue, she said, and the magazine warned The Yale Review not to publish it. No First Amendment Violation Mrs. Ascher filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court contending that the Saturday Review was violating her copyright on the article. After a hearing late Monday, Judge Motley issued a temporary restraining order against the Saturday Review. The judge said the magazine did not have a right to publish the article, rejecting an argument that restraining the magazine's distribution would violate its First Amendment rights. The case was unusual because it dealt with preventing the distribution of a magazine because of a copyright complaint. It was not an attempt to prevent the publication of sensitive subject matter. Judge Motley said she was restraining the magazine's distribution unless it inserted a flier saying the article was published with permission of The Yale Review. To avoid a delay that would be caused by printing the flier, however, the settlement provided for using the newspaper advertisements instead. Floyd Abrams, a lawyer who handles many First Amendment cases, commented that prior restraint was generally available to prevent copyright violations, but that using a prior restraint to prevent distribution of a magazine was ''an extraordinarily grave act with serious First Amendment implications.'' ''In all fairness,'' Mr. Abrams said, ''it is well established under copyright law that prior restraints are available.'' But he added, ''It is important, in my view, that First Amendment considerations be taken into account.'' Mrs. Ascher's lawyer, John S. Siffert, said she had been willing to settle the dispute if the Saturday Review paid the original $1,000 for the article and legal fees for the lawsuit, and if it stated that the article was printed with the permission of The Yale Review. 'That's All We Want' Those terms were accepted by the Saturday Review, Mr. Siffert said after the agreement was reached. He said, ''That's all we want.'' A lawyer for the Saturday Review, Charles D. Reed, had said before the settlement that ''We have 250,000 copies of this magazine currently held captive.'' Mr. Reed said the Saturday Review would ''respect the order'' of the judge, although ''we believe it was erroneously entered.'' He said the magazine believed it had the consent of the author's agent to publish the article. ''Our major concern is to give the magazine to the subscribers,'' he said. He noted that most of the magazine's circulation was distributed by mail. It was was the first issue of the Saturday Review since the magazine was sold last spring. The new principals and publishers are Paul Dietrich and David Simpson 2d. The Yale Review, a quarterly published under the auspices of Yale University, paid a nominal fee of about $50 for the shortened version of Mrs. Ascher's article. It is in the autumn edition, which has not yet been published. The lawsuit contended that Mrs. Ascher owned the exclusive copyright to the article and asked for a total of $2 million in compensatory and punitive damages. Judge Motley dissolved her restraining order a little more than 24 hours after issuing it, when the settlement was reached.

260-> AVERAGE PRICE OF NEW HOME TOPS $100,000 FOR FIRST TIME
The goal that has come to be known as the American dream has crossed a historic threshold: The average price of a new, single-family home broke into six figures in May, the Commerce Department said today. The average price was $101,000, up $5,100 just since April. As prices are rising, fewer Americans are buying homes. Last month, sales fell for the third month in a row. High interest rates are causing the drop, analysts agree, but they add that sales would be even lower if not for the proliferation of adjustable rate mortgages, which allow people to buy initially at less than market rates. ''No culture ever got to over 50 percent of homeownership as we did in the years after the war,'' said Paul Samuelson, a winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science and author of the nation's most widely read textbook on economics. ''Now we're getting to where it takes several years of family income to buy the average house,'' he added, ''so for my six children, it's going to be hard to live as well as my generation.'' Representatives of the real estate industry hastened to argue that the average figure for last month was a bit misleading. They said it was magnified by the expensive homes of the rich, who are less constrained by rising mortgage rates. But the median price, the level at which half the homes are more expensive and half are less expensive, has also been rising. It reached $80,900 last month, up $1,500 since April and well beyond the means of most families. In 1980 the median was $64,600, and in 1965 it was $20,000, according to the Census Bureau. 'Change in the Mix' ''The higher price reflects a change in the mix of houses we're selling,'' said Norris Dotson, a vice president of John R. Pinkett Real Estate in Washington. ''People who were going to move up did so last month because they were expecting interest rates to keep rising, and the home you move up to is usually the more expensive home.'' The boom in American homeownership began after World War II with the proliferation of the 30-year conventional mortgage in which monthly payments never change. They cost as little as 4 percent until the 1970's, when interest rates began creeping toward 10 percent. Eight years ago, the average American family's monthly home payment came to a quarter of its income. By 1982, it had reached one-third, and it is still rising. ''The median-income family cannot afford the median-priced home at present,'' said Jack Carlson, economist for the National Association of Realtors. ''But people can get into a little less desirable house.'' For several years, builders, bankers and real estate agents have tried to ease the home buyer's burden with the adjustable rate mortgage. The initial interest rate is set below the rate of conventional mortgages and then raised or lowered periodically as general interest rates change. A Significant Difference The new mortgage makes a significant difference in the family budget. In the Washington area, for instance, the interest rate on a conventional $50,000 mortgage is 14 percent and costs the homebuyer $592 in principal and interest a month. Some lenders, however, are offering adjustable rate mortgages starting at 10 percent, requiring a monthly payment of $439. In a curious way, the adjustable rate mortgages may be causing prices to rise faster than they otherwise would. Builders of homes, facing an overabundance of supply but anxious to keep prices from falling, sometimes offer discount mortgages as low as 9 percent to attract buyers. ''It has been my experience,'' Mr. Dotson said, ''that buyers look mainly at that first 3 years, not at the 30 years.'' Annual Rate of 612,000 In its report today, the Commerce Department said sales of new, single- family homes reached an annual rate of 612,000 in May, a decline from 640,000 in April and 654,000 in May 1983. Economists and political scientists have often contended that having large numbers of families owning their own homes accounted for some of the stability of American society. With home ownership becoming more difficult for the young, that stability could face new tests, said Mr. Samuelson, the economist. ''Some people will put their stake in a cooperative or a condominium, rather than a villa,'' he added. ''But more will be renting, too. Renters are a more obstreperous type. From the beginning of time, people have hated landlords.''

261-> Western Union Adds New Easylink Feature
In an attempt to spur interest in its struggling electronic mail system, the Western Union Corporation said yesterday that users would soon be able to converse on their computers, rather than merely send electronic letters. Under the new system, a message will appear on a recipient's screen as the sender is typing it - unless the recipient is using the computer terminal for another purpose. Until now, messages have been stored in computer memory until the recipient checked to see if there was any message there, making communication cumbersome. Western Union also announced that it had agreed to buy Personal Computers from the International Business Machines Corporation and to package them with Western Union communications software. The package will then be sold to companies wanting to sign up for Western Union's electronic mail system, called Easylink. Western Union began offering Easylink two years ago. Although it holds the top spot in electronic mail, with an estimated 25 percent of the business, the market remains much smaller than it or any of the other contenders in the field, such as the MCI Corporation or the GTE Corporation, had anticipated. Customers have complained that the systems are too complicated, and only recently has it been possible for people using different manufacturers' computers or terminals to communicate. As a result, many of the companies involved in electronic mail have been losing money. And Western Union, with $150 million already invested in the business, badly needs to see the market grow. One problem is that Western Union has been facing stiff competition, not only from other electronic mail vendors but also from computer companies such as Wang Laboratories Inc. and the Digital Equipment Corporation. Both offer office-automation software packages that include electronic mail and more. With yesterday's announcements, however, Western Union may get the boost it needs, analysts said. The aggreement to sell I.B.M. Personal Computers packages, they explained, could enable Western Union to piggyback sales of Easylink on Personal Computer sales. And by offering customers the ability to talk back and forth by typing their messages, Western Union may make such communication easier than in the past. ''There is no one offering anything exactly like it,'' said Kenneth G. Bosomworth, president of International Resource Development Inc., a Norwalk, Conn., consulting firm.

262-> Preakness Purse To Be Increased
The purse for the 1985 Preakness Stakes, the middle jewel of racing's Triple Crown, will be increased by $100,000, officials at Pimlico Race Course announced Monday. Track officials said the 110th running of the $350,000-added classic is scheduled for Saturday, May 18. As part of the overall purse increase, track officials said the purses for the second, third and fourth-place finishers would be increased. The second-place finisher will receive $70,000, up from $50,000. The third-place finisher will get $35,000, an increase from $30,000, and the fourth-place finisher will receive $17,500, up from $15,000.

265-> Simmons May Be Replaced
The United States Football League may be close to naming a replacement for Chet Simmons, who has been commissioner since the league was founded two years ago. A league executive who asked for anonymity said U.S.F.L. owners had discussed four candidates for the job, including Harry Usher, general manager of the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee, and Pete Dawkins, the former West Point running back and Army brigadier general who is now a general partner with Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb, the securities concern. The executive described Usher and Dawkins as ''the two most serious'' candidates. Some owners have not been satisfied with Simmons, a former NBC Sports and ESPN executive who was hired by the league for his familiarity with television contracts, among other reasons. The U.S.F.L. contracts with ABC and ESPN, in the opinion of these owners, have not been as lucrative as they might have been. ''Right now, it looks like the league is leaning toward Usher,'' said the executive, who added that he was virtually sure the change would be made by the end of the month. Usher said yesterday from Los Angeles that he had met several times with league owners, including Donald Trump of the Generals and Tad Taube of the Oakland Invaders, to discuss the possibility of succeeding Simmons. ''While I'm intrigued and curious about the job, and it sounds like one with a challenge,'' Usher said, ''these conversations were really preliminary, and, clearly, we would have to have more talks.'' Neither Dawkins nor Simmons returned telephone messages to comment. With six weeks remaining in the National Football League's regular season, most teams have a good idea now whether they have a chance of being among the 10 that will qualify for the playoffs. The Miami Dolphins, at 10-0 the league's only undefeated team, can clinch at least a tie for the American Conference's Eastern Division title with a victory over Philadelphia next Sunday if both the Jets and the New England Patriots lose. Whether or not they clinch then, the Dolphins need only two victories in their last six games to get the tie, and that shouldn't be too difficult: Four of those games are at home, and in Don Shula's seasons as the Dolphins' coach, they have an 86-17-1 record in the Orange Bowl. In the American Conference Central, the Pittsburgh Steelers (6-4) have a three- game lead on the Cincinnati Bengals. And in the A.F.C. West, the Denver Broncos (9-1) lead the Seattle Seahawks by one game and the Los Angeles Raiders by two. If the season were over now, the Seahawks (8-2) and the Raiders (7-3) would be the wild-card teams because their records are superior to those of the Jets and New England, both of which are 6-4. In the National Conference, the San Francisco 49ers (9-1) seem to have the West under control with a three- game lead over the Los Angeles Rams. And the Chicago Bears (7-3) are three and a half games ahead of the Detroit Lions in the Central. The East is too close to call. The Giants, the Dallas Cowboys and the St. Louis Cardinals are 6-4, and the Washington Redskins were 5-4 before last night's game against Atlanta. The N.F.C. wild-card teams will probably come from among the teams in the East and the Rams, who are also 6-4. Once again Sunday, key players, including five quarterbacks, were lost to injuries. Jim McMahon of the Bears, who missed time earlier in the season with a broken bone in his throwing hand, suffered the most serious injury, a lacerated kidney that team doctors said yesterday would keep him out a minimum of four weeks. McMahon was injured on a run in the second quarter of the Bears' 17-6 victory over the Raiders when he was tackled by Bill Pickel, whose helmet hit him in the side. McMahon stayed in the game for one play of the second half and was then replaced by Steve Fuller, who finished. Fuller is expected to start for the Bears next Sunday against the Rams in Anaheim. The other quarterbacks hurt were Marc Wilson (thumb) and David Humm (knee) of the Raiders, Danny White of the Cowboys (shoulder) and Bill Kenney of the Kansas City Chiefs (shoulder, knee, elbow). None of those injuries was considered serious. Among the other players hurt Sunday were Dean Steinkuhler, the Houston Oiler offensive lineman, and Dan Hampton, the Bear defensive lineman. Steinkuhler, the second player taken in the draft last spring, injured his right knee and is expected to be lost for the remainder of the season. Hampton injured his elbow but probably won't miss any time. The N.F.L. record for most receptions (649, by Charley Taylor of the Redskins, who retired in 1977) may not stand for long. Charlie Joiner of the San Diego Chargers caught 9 passes for 119 yards Sunday to bring his career total to 635 and move him into second place, past Raymond Berry (631) and Don Maynard (633). Joiner is also now second in receiving yards, with 10,466, trailing only Maynard's 11,834. Another receiver who had a memorable game Sunday was Butch Johnson of Denver. He had 9 catches for 156 yards - both career highs - and 2 touchdowns in the 26-19 victory over New England.

266-> SPORTS PEOPLE; McKay Quits as Coach
John McKay, the only coach in the nine-year history of the Buccaneers, announced in Tampa that he would resign at the end of the season. At a news conference attended by Hugh Culverhouse, the Bucs' owner, McKay said that he was ''sorry I couldn't get the job done, but we tried.'' McKay, who is 61 years old, also cited health reasons for his decision, noting that he underwent a cataract operation on one eye earlier this season and would have a similar operation on the other eye after the season. Culverhouse said McKay would become the Buccaneers' president. McKay posted a 127-40-8 mark during 16 years at the University of Southern California before joining the Bucs for its first season in 1976. His Tampa Bay teams struggled, and his record is 41-85-1, including a 3-7 start this season. McKay, saying he always felt success depended more on players than coaches, said his priority as president would be ''to see that the new coach gets the players he needs.'' . . . As expected, Lee Corso, the football coach at Northern Illinois, resigned effective immediately to become coach of the new Orlando Renegades of the United States Football League. Robert Brigham, the school's athletic director, named Ted Huber, the defensive coordinator, as interim coach.

267-> WINE TALK
PERHAPS 75 percent of all wine sold at the retail level is bought a bottle at a time. ''Pick up a bottle of wine for dinner'' is the way most purchases start. Smart consumers soon learn, of course, that buying by the case is more convenient and cheaper - fewer trips to the store and, often, a 10 percent case discount. More and more, serious wine enthusiasts are also discovering that there is yet another way to buy wine and save money - or better yet, to buy wine and make money: investing in wine futures. A wine future is nothing more than a sales slip - a contract, if you will - for a quantity of wine to be delivered at a future date. Wine futures, which are sold by many good retailers, are offered almost exclusively on Bordeaux - they have proved to be the most long-lived and will therefore appreciate the most in value - and usually about a year after the harvest; the first futures are being offered on the 1983 vintage. The futures market was long centered in London, where wine is treated as a valuable commodity. Knowledgeable British enophiles have for many years bought wine for both enjoyment and investment. The war correspondant and wine writer Cyril Ray once explained that he always bought fine claret - the British name for Bordeaux wines - with the idea of eventually selling half of them at double the original price. This way he always drank half the wine he bought at no cost and still had his investment to put into more wine. The fad for wine futures reached a frenzy with the sale of the '82 Bordeaux. The 82's, by almost every gauge, were truly exceptional. Most good vintages have detractors and advocates who hedge their praise, but not the '82 Bordeaux. Except for one or two mavericks, the experts struggled to find new superlatives. Investors needed no further urging: as soon as the futures were offered in the fall of 1983 they were snapped up. Now, a year later, the opening prices of the best ones have doubled and the chateau owners are maintaining that their cellars are empty, at least of that vintage. This is unusual because in recent years the owners have been holding back part of their wine for second and third offerings, whereas in the past they sold everything at once and then watched others trade the price up and get rich on the chateaus' work. The current practice is to release a given vintage in tranches - literally slices - as the price goes up. This means that anyone hoping to buy '82 futures now will pay far more than the opening price. The best of the 1982 Bordeaux are finishing their second year of aging in casks and are being bottled; they will begin to arrive in America after a further year of aging, in the bottle now. As a rule investors concern themselves almost exclusively with the most prominent Bordeaux names, Lafite, Mouton, Margaux, Latour, Haut-Brion, Ausone, Cheval Blanc, Petrus and Yquem. To that list can be added several currently popular chateaus such as La Mission Haut-Brion and Palmer. Futures are also available for dozens of other Bordeaux vineyards, and buying from these lesser-known properties makes good economic sense as well. Even if the wines will not appreciate much in value, they are excellent additions to any cellar. These are wines to drink, not to trade. What is more, the lesser-known 82's, particularly the so-called petits chateaux, will be arriving over the next few months. Most will profit from two or three years of additional aging, but many - the little chateaus from the C^otes de Blaye and the fringe regions of St.-Emilion - will be ready after a few months' rest. In recent weeks the '83 Bordeaux futures have begun to appear. With some increases to reflect higher production costs - and the fact that the 82's did so well - the prices are not much different than they were for the preceding vintage. The 1983 vintage was a very good one but, by most standards, not as fine as '82. Some chateau owners insist that, in spite of the extraordinary quality of their 82's, their 83's are better, but they are in the minority. Others place the 83's somewhere between the 78's and 79's - considerable praise because the '78 Bordeaux were extremely good and the '79 not far behind. Christie's, the international auction house, recently held a seminar on wine auctions and futures in New York. John Armit, a London merchant who specializes in wine investment, spoke on futures and offered some recommendations for serious investors. I emphasize ''serious'' because he thinks in terms of $10,000 minimum orders for his American customers. Mr. Armit's figures are impressive: An investment in 1966 Bordeaux first growths such as Ch^ateaux Margaux and Latour, purchased through him in 1967, would have appreciated over 35 times, Mr. Armit reports. The same investment in wines just below the first-growth level would have done even better, appreciating almost 45 times. Mr. Armit is not particularly interested in those who would buy wine with the novel idea of one day drinking it. He advises leaving the wine right in the chateau where it was made until the time comes to sell it. Despite the impressive figures for wines left to appreciate over long periods, Mr. Armit says that experience dictates selling investment wine after about five years. He suggests that an investor leave the selection of the wines up to him; however, he will buy as instructed, with a maximum of 25 cases from a particular chateau. ''It's advisable to have a spread of wine,'' he said, ''because when selling, one can invariably get better prices for relatively small quantities of different wines than large quantities of one or two wines.'' He recommends, too, that any order include magnums (double bottles) and double magnums (quadruple bottles) because the larger bottles, in small quantities, draw bigger prices than the same amount of wine in single bottles. It is not necessary to have a minimum of $10,000 to buy wine you will never drink. Some futures are written for a case or two, although most buyers purchase 5 to 10 to make the savings worthwhile. Generally speaking, the prices on the 83's will reflect duties and shipping charges and you will usually be expected to take delivery about two years after harvest. One problem with becoming a wine investor in America is that there is no good secondary market. If you sell three cases of wine to your neighbor you are violating the law in 49 of the 50 states. In every state except Illinois, wine must be sold to the public by retailers. The best way to avoid the problem is to leave the wine in France or London. If it is imported it can be ''cleared'' through a retailer, who will charge a handling fee even though the wine does not actually have to pass through his premises. This, then, is a glimpse, necessarily simplified, at one of the more sophisticated facets of wine. Bear in mind that there are as many pitfalls as in any other investment plan. There are good vintages that go bad and, of course, there are very bad vintages (some of the most knowledgeable experts were ruined by overinvestment in the '72 Bordeaux). That's another story. For most of us the best way to buy wine is with the idea of eventually drinking it. Market interest rates can be calculated. The pleasure of drinking a great bottle is incalculable.

268-> BABY FAE CONTINUES TO MEND
Baby Fae, the infant who received a baboon's heart 18 days ago, is recovering from a moderate rather than a mild rejection episode, doctors at Loma Linda Medical Center said today. Baby Fae remained in serious but stable condition and is ''responding favorably'' to drugs, cyclosporin-A and steroids, that should prevent her body from rejecting the transplanted heart, a spokesman for the doctors said. The infant is again receiving oxygen, the spokesman said, and is eating well. One of Baby Fae's doctors revealed on Sunday, in the course of an interview on the television program Face the Nation, that the infant had been undergoing a mild rejection episode for two days. The statement conflicted with reports issued by medical center spokesmen on Friday and Saturday that Baby Fae was doing well. Jane McGill, speaking for the medical center, said today she could not provide details explaining why the rejection episode is now being called moderate rather than mild. Jessica Baker, another spokesman, said Loma Linda press aides had not been informed that the baby was experiencing a rejection episode. Such episodes are considered inevitable and normal after any heart transplant operation.

269-> Continental Group To Sell Georgia Mill
The Continental Group said yesterday that it had agreed to sell its bleached paperboard mill in Augusta, Ga., and related operations to the Federal Paper Board Company for about $305 million. Continental said the sale includes four chip and saw mills, two folding carton plants and two paper-plate plants. The paperboard mill has an annual capacity of 430,000 tons. Continental said the final sale price would be adjusted to reflect any external debt and capitalized leases assumed by Federal. Continental, a subsidiary of the Kiewit-Murdock Investment Corporation, is based in Stamford, Conn. It has interests in packaging, forest products, insurance and energy. Federal Paper Board has headquarters in Montvale, N.J. It makes and sells solid bleached paperboard and pulp, lumber, recycled paperboard and folding cartons. The company said it would take over a long- term wood supply agreement between the paperboard mill and Continental Augusta Woodlands Inc. Federal Paper Board, which noted that the purchase must be approved by Federal regulatory agencies, said financing for the acquisition had been arranged by the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company.

270-> REPORT ASSAILS COLLEGE FAILURES IN HUMANITIES
American colleges and universities are failing to give students ''an adequate education in the culture and civilization of which they are members,'' a panel convened by the National Endowment for the Humanities asserted yesterday. College faculties have caved in to vocational and other pressures from students and abdicated their authority over what students should study and learn, the panel's report said. ''Most of our college graduates remain shortchanged in the humanities - history, literature, philosophy and the ideals and practices of the past that have shaped the society they enter,'' said the report, written by William J. Bennett, the endowment's chairman. Fewer Humanities Majors The 31-member panel cited declining enrollment in the humanities in both high schools and colleges as well as decreased numbers of students choosing humanities majors as evidence that the humanities in general and the study of Western civilization in particular ''have lost their central place in the undergraduate curriculum.'' The document, ''To Reclaim a Legacy: A Report on the Humanities in Higher Education,'' laments what it terms the ''steady erosion'' in structured curriculums with specific course requirements. ''A student can obtain a bachelor's degree from 75 percent of all American colleges and universities without having studied European history, from 72 percent without having studied American literature or history and from 86 percent without having studied the civilizations of classical Greece and Rome,'' the report said. ''Fewer than half of all colleges and universities,'' the report continued, ''now require foreign language study for the bachelor's degree, down from nearly 90 percent in 1966.'' The result, the educators said, is a pervasive philosophy of ''intellectual relativism'' in which students are deprived of any sense of ''a common culture rooted in civilization's lasting vision, its highest shared ideals and aspirations, and its heritage.'' The panel called for a series of reforms, including an overhaul of college curriculums based on ''a clear vision of what constitutes an educated person.'' 'Core of Common Studies' While stopping short of recommending specific courses or texts, the report suggested that students graduating from college should have encountered a ''core of common studies'' embracing these elements: - A chronoligical understanding of the development of Western civilization. - A ''careful reading'' of several masterworks of English, American and European literature. - An understanding of the most significant ideas and debates in the history of philosophy. - Demonstrable proficiency in a foreign language, either modern or classical. - Familiarity with at least one non- Western culture or civilization. - Knowledge of the history of science and technology. Big Questions and Great Works The report urged colleges to reward faculty members for teaching as well as for research and to place the humanities at the center of instruction, even for those going into professional fields. ''The humanities are not an educational luxury, and they are not just for majors,'' the document said. ''They are a body of knowledge and a means of inquiry that convey serious truths, defensible judgments, and significant ideas. Properly taught, the humanities bring together the perennial questions of human life with the greatest works of history, literature, philosophy and art.'' The document is the second major report to be released this fall on the quality of undergraduate education in the country's 3,000 colleges and universities. Last month T. H. Bell, the Secretary of Education, made public a study sponsored by the National Institute of Education, the department's research arm, citing ''warning signals'' about the quality of higher education. The Association of American Colleges and the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching are preparing their own studies of the issue. The document made public yesterday reflects eight months of work by the endowment staff, aided by prominent teachers, scholars, administrators and others. The study group held hearings, examined graduation requirements at 15 representative institutions and solicited research. Among the panelists were Diane Ravitch, a professor of history and education at the Teacher's College of Columbia University; Hanna H. Gray, president of the University of Chicago; David Riesman, a retired Harvard University sociologist, and John R. Silber, president of Boston University. Mr. Bennett and Mr. Silber are among the candidates mentioned as possible successors to Mr. Bell, who has said he will leave his Cabinet post at the end of the year to become a professor at the University of Utah. Praise for Brooklyn College Despite the generally bleak picture it painted, the study group found several ''bright spots'' in American colleges, including the 10-course core curriculum at Brooklyn College of the City University of New York. The report noted that Brooklyn College is a public institution with 14,000 undergraduates, ''many of whom are recent immigrants'' and most of whom are heading into professional fields like accounting. Nevertheless, the college requires all bachelor's degree candidates to take courses such as ''Classical Origins of Western Culture,'' with readings from Homer, Aristophanes and Virgil. The Brooklyn College faculty has been ''enlivened intellectually'' through teaching core courses, the report said, while students ''see relationships among fields and ''talk about a renewed sense of a community of learning.'' The report painted a bleak picture of the condition of the humanities in American education, noting that the number of students majoring in these areas is declining along with college requirements in areas such as foreign languages. It cited figures from the Modern Language Association showing that the percentage of institutions requiring foreign language study for a bachelor's degree fell to 47 percent in 1983 from 89 percent in 1966. Teaching Called a Problem ''Conventional wisdom atttributes the steep drop in the number of students who major in the humanities to their concern for finding good-paying jobs after college,'' Mr. Bennett wrote. ''Although there is some truth in this, we believe that there is another, equally important reason - namely, that we in the academy have failed to bring the humanities to life and to insist on their value.'' Mr. Bennett said that too much teaching in the humanities is ''lifeless or tendentious, mechanical or ideological'' and that the curriculums on too many colleges are nothing more than ''a self-service cafeteria through which students pass without being nourished.'' He criticized colleges for relegating too much of the instruction in the humanities to the first two years of college and delegating it to graduate students or to part-time faculty members. ''If students do not experience the best the humanities have to offer early in their undergraduate careers, they are unlikely to come back for more,'' the report declared. The document criticized graduate schools, which, it said, ''produce too many narrow specialists whose teaching is often lifeless, stilted and pedestrian.'' ''Historians who used to be responsible for teaching the entire sweep of Western civilization or the Survey of American History now insist on teaching only that portion of it that corresponds to their specialties,'' it stated. ''Foreign literature specialists consider it a waste of their talent to teach foreign language classes.'' Mr. Bennett attributed the ''steady erosion'' of the ''coherence of the curriculum'' to ''a collective loss of nerve and faith on the part of both faculty and academic administrators'' in the late 1960's and early 1970's. What Education Ought to Be ''When students demanded a greater role in setting their own educational agendas, we eagerly responded by abandoning course requirements of any kind and with them the intellectual authority to say to students what the outcome of a college education ought to be,'' he wrote. ''With intellectual authority relinquished, we found that we did not need to worry about what was worth knowing, worth defending, worth believing. The curriculum was no longer a statement about what knowledge mattered. Instead, it became the product of a political compromise among competing schools and departments overlaid by marketing considerations.'' The report was also critical of recent efforts by colleges to emphasize ''skills'' such as reading, critical thinking, and awareness of other points of view or to restore ''distribution requirements'' under which students must take a certain number of courses in, say, the humanities, the social sciences and the natural sciences. ''Merely being exposed to a variety of subjects and points of view is not enough,'' it stated. ''Learning to think critically and skeptically is not enough. Being well rounded is not enough if, after all the sharp edges have been filed down, discernment is blunted and the graduate is left to believe without judgment, to decide without wisdom, or to act without standards.'' The study group report urged college faculties to refocus their attention on the ''content'' of their curriculums and to assert that ''some things are more important to know than others.''

271-> Regulator Issues Warning on Thrift Unit Growth
Edwin J. Gray, the chief Federal regulator of savings and loan associations, told the industry today that the Federal Home Loan Bank Board would act to stop the rapid growth of many thrift institutions. Such growth, Mr. Gray has said, often threatens the soundness of the institutions because it is accomplished by bidding aggressively for deposits and by making high-risk loans. He said that the bank board, among other things, was considering adopting a net worth standard for all federally insured thrift institutions. Mr. Gray reminded industry leaders that when associations take risks, there is also a threat to the resources of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, the bank board's insurance arm. Underwriting the Growth ''Is it not fair to ask how we can expect the F.S.L.I.C. to underwrite for risk the incredible growth spiral we are seeing in the industry as a whole?'' he said. Mr. Gray, who is himself a former thrift institution executive at the Great American Federal Savings and Loan Association in San Diego, spoke to the annual convention of the United States League of Savings Institutions. He criticized states that have given state-chartered savings and loan associations investment and loan powers far broader than those accorded federally chartered associations. Most of these state institutions are federally insured. The bank board chairman challenged those states - mainly in the Sun Belt - to insure their own institutions, but he predicted that they would not do it. ''I can understand why they would feel far more comfortable relegating that expensive chore to the F.S.L.I.C.,'' he said. Net-Worth Standard In his speech, Mr. Gray said the board was considering linking asset growth to increases in a thrift institution's net worth. But in an interview later, Mr. Gray acknowledged that the board had not decided on what the net-worth requirements should be. Net worth is the difference between assets and liabilities. It thus provides a cushion between any losses on loans and depositors' funds. Because the F.S.L.I.C. insures deposits in the thrifts, it would bear the burden of any losses beyond an association's net worth. The greater the net worth, the less likely it is that an association with bad loans will fail and turn to the F.S.L.I.C. However, increasing an institution's net worth is worrisome to many savings and loan executives because it can be costly. One way to increase net worth is to retain profits, which usually means lowering dividends for shareholders - if the organization is stock-owned and not mutual. Many Report Losses Many institutions, however, are not earning a profit. About a quarter of the nation's 3,500 savings and loans, in fact, have been losing money. At their annual convention in New York last week, commercial bankers complained that they have been under pressure from banking regulators to increase their net worths, or capital accounts, while there are no such constraints on thrift institutions. After his speech, Mr. Gray was asked whether his call for greater net worth among thrift institutions was being done in coordination with bank regulators. He said that it was not, and that the board was acting independently.

272-> THE WORM AND THE APPLE; Meaner Streets, Cleaner Streets
Bombs Away It seems worse every year this time of year. The weapons get larger, yet so does tolerance for them. Roman candles, sparklers, silver salutes, cracker balls, smoky cherry balls, pineapples, helicopters, silver jets and aerial bombs are routinely sold on New York streets. So are the formidable M-80's, equivalent to an eighth of a stick of dynamite, and South Carolina Blockbusters, equivalent to a quarter-stick. Yet all such devices are illegal for everyone but licensed pyrotechnists, with good reason. Some 8,300 Americans, mostly male and under 25, were injured by fireworks last year (among them a 23-year-old Staten Island man who was killed when a garbage can he had loaded with M-80's exploded). On July 4, 1980, firecrackers closed down La Guardia Airport by starting a brush fire near a fuel storage depot. Some youngsters use fireworks as firearms - tossing them at joggers or through subway, car and bus windows. The police of the Fifth Precinct, which includes Chinatown, take the problem seriously enough to have a fireworks squad. It recently seized $100,000 worth of explosives. In other precincts, however, requests for action are met with mumblings about ''selective enforcement'' and the need to set priorities. Youngsters caught igniting explosives in the street receive no more than a ticket and a phone call to the house - where parents too often seem foolishly tolerant of both the danger and the neighborhood disruption. The city offers plenty of safe displays for all who enjoy watching fireworks on the Fourth of July. Getting to them on the night of the Fourth ought not to require passage through residential free-fire zones. Shame on all parents who care so little for their children's safety and their neighbors' peace, and worms to the police who seem so ready to look the other way.

275-> PLAN TO PUT LOGGING ROADS IN WILD AREAS IS CHALLENGED
The Forest Service has accelerated its road-building in undeveloped tracts of the northern Rockies, angering Western environmentalists and prompting a lawsuit in Federal District Court here to stop the program. The roads are being built to make it possible for lumber companies to cut timber on Federal lands in the future. The Forest Service says roads must be built, even though current demand for timber is low, to anticipate any growth in the timber industry. The road construction is being resisted not only by environmentalists who fear a loss of prime wilderness areas and naturalists who are concerned about intrusions in wildlife habitat, but also by ranchers who fear the building will hurt water quality. In 1981, without public hearings, the Forest Service changed its policy to emphasize road-building in potential wilderness areas, those included in the service's second sweeping inventory called ''Roadless Area Review and Evaluation,'' or RARE 2. There are 60 million acres of such Forest Service lands in the country, most of it in the West. However, the planned network of heavy-duty logging roads could automatically disqualify millions of acres from Congressional protection as wilderness areas. If the rate of building of the last three years is maintained in the northern Rockies for the next 14 years, when Congress is scheduled to take up the next round of wilderness bills, 21,000 miles of log-haul roads will have been built in roadless areas of Montana, Idaho and northern Wyoming at a cost of about $2 billion. In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 1983, for example, 1,864 miles of heavy logging roads were built in Montana and Idaho alone, at a cost to the taxpayers of $68.1 million, including indirect costs. The Forest Service argues that the move into potential wilderness areas is needed because the agency is running out of suitable timber-cutting areas and that the new reaches of the Rockies must be opened up to harvesting of trees. The roads, suitable for carrying 30- ton, 18-wheel logging trucks, are being built even though none of the timber they will reach is yet up for sale, according to the Forest Service, because there would not be enough time to begin the process to meet any upsurge in demand. Future Areas at Stake Forest Service officials concede that their roads will affect wilderness designations in the future, but they point out that the new roads currently planned are avoiding areas in Montana and Idaho considered likely to be included in wilderness legislation to be reintroduced in Congress next year. Opponents of the program say the roads will make about 11 million acres ineligible for inclusion among Congressionally protected wilderness lands. They also object on the ground that the Forest Service handed down a potentially far-reaching plan without holding public hearings or analyzing the environmental impact of the road plan. The National Wildlife Federation is suing the Forest Service in the Federal court here to compel public hearings on the road-building program. The suit argues that the road plan was adopted without complying with the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires Government agencies to conduct public reviews on projects having an extensive environmental impact. ''Anybody who has been in the West knows that wilderness and RARE 2 is a hell of an issue here,'' said Thomas France, the northern Rockies' representative of the federation. Group Questions Motives ''If the Forest Service issued a document saying their major objective is to destroy RARE 2 areas, the public would become unhinged,'' he added, ''which is probably why they haven't come out and done that.'' But Max Peterson, who heads the Forest Service in Washington, responded: ''We're not antiwilderness. All we're saying is, you can't stop the world so you can keep all your options open in perpetuity. You can't say the gate only swings one way, and say, 'We'll take our wilderness area this year and keep everything else open because we might want it later on.' '' Nearly 100 million acres of lands are already protected under the National Wilderness Preservation System Act of 1964. They range in size from the six- acre Pelican Island site in Florida to the 8.7 million-acre Wrangell-St. Elias Wilderness Area in Alaska. All these lands are put aside forever by Congress and by the states as refuges from development where no road may go and no machine may be used, and where man, as the law puts it, ''is a visitor who does not remain.'' Roads Can Disqualify Area Accordingly, most areas that have truck-haul roads winding through them would no longer qualify for wilderness designation under a loose formula for eligibility on Western lands that disqualifies an area if there is more than one mile of road per 1,000 acres in an area. Small Eastern wilderness tracts, such as Pelican Island or the 1,300-acre Fire Island High Dune area, the only Federal wilderness area in New York, are exempt from that rule of thumb. The tug-of-war over future wilderness areas goes beyond technicalities to reflect the fundamental and often irreconcilable differences emerging in the West over the management of Federal lands, which make up the bulk of Western lands, by the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. Those two agencies have the role of balancing commercial exploitation of the vast lands they hold with environmental needs. Only a few years ago the conflict was popularized as the Sagebrush Rebellion, when the issue was spearheaded by commercial interests: the timber industry, mineral prospectors and cattle ranchers who objected to restrictions on the commercial exploitation of Federal lands under previous Administrations. Administration Policy Criticized Today the fighting words are coming from environmentalists who object to the Reagan Administration's stated policy of stressing the commodity value of Federal lands to the detriment, its detractors say, of intangibles like recreation and wildlife habitat. The present dispute stems directly from the change in the Forest Service plan in 1981 that came to light as a result of the Wildlife Federation's suit. The agency directed its Region 1, covering Montana, Idaho and northern Wyoming, to give top priority in its road plans to providing ''new road and bridge access to commercial timber lands in RARE 2 and other unroaded areas released or available for development.'' In the wilderness lands debate, ''released'' land is acreage that has not been included in the current round of wilderness designations and is therefore regarded as available for development like timbering. Thus, when a bill for a Wyoming wilderness was passed in the last session of Congress, three million acres of passed-over land was released for development until the next round of wilderness legislation, in 1988. Disputed Acreage in 2 States In Montana and Idaho, the states most deeply affected by the emphasis on building roads in RARE 2 areas, no wilderness bill was agreed upon in the last session because of disagreements over acreage. Thus, the RARE 2 lands in those states are still eligible for consideration in Congress next year. ''We've tried to avoid collectively those areas that appear to have a lot of interest for wilderness,'' said Tom Coston, regional forester for Region 1. He said his region's program for roads in in RARE 2 lands was progressing only in places he did not think would be part of any wilderness legislation for the two states in the next Congress. ''There are 60 million acres inventoried in RARE 2,'' he went on, ''and you could probably find someone who would want all of it in wilderness.''

279-> Smoker Law Passed on Coast
After a month of infighting and reversals, the City Council passed an ordinance today calling for nonsmoking areas in workplaces. Mayor Tom Bradley has said he would make a decision on whether to sign the law, passed by a vote of 12 to 3, ''when it reaches his desk,'' said a spokesman, Vicki Pitikin. The ordinance was taken apart and restored several times in October by Council members who faced fierce pressure from lobbyists on both sides of the issue. As passed, the final version excluded a once-considered rule that would have enabled a single employee to bring about a smoking ban. Before the vote, one more unsuccessful effort was made to eliminate a clause that makes it a misdemeanor for an employer to dismiss a worker for insisting on enforcement of the statute. That item previously was removed, then reinserted. The ordinance requires employers with five or more workers to make ''reasonable'' efforts to create a nonsmoking area at the workplace. It also limits smoking in employee restrooms, elevators, company medical facilities, and in two-thirds of the area in employee lunchrooms and lounges. The ordinance was passed just hours after a man was stabbed to death when he refused to stop smoking on a bus. The victim, Adrian Kelley, 23 years old, of Los Angeles, boarded the bus at 1 A.M. Mr. Kelley lighted a cigarette, which is illegal, the police said. The passenger next to him objected, and the two struggled after Mr. Kelley said, ''I'll smoke if I want to,'' according to Richard Hoffman, a police detective. Mr. Kelley was stabbed in the struggle. The assailant fled, but 20 minutes later, Kenneth Roberts, 32, turned himself in. He was held without bail on suspicion of murder. The proposed smoking law would not affect the rules on buses.

281-> ARGENTINA TO PAY OVERDUE INTEREST IN BANKING PACT
Argentina announced today that it had reached an agreement with international banks that gives the country a respite in its debt crisis. The accord came a day before a deadline for repaying overdue interest. The Government of President Raul Alfonsin has been moving to defuse the crisis by compromising with both the International Monetary Fund in Washington and militant unions at home over austerity measures to help repay the country's $45 billion debt, the developing world's third largest. Economics Minister Bernardo Grinspun said at a news conference today that Argentina would pay $225 million from its reserves to help pay off $350 million in interest that would become more than 90 days past due by this weekend. 45-Day Bridge Loan From Banks In return, a steering committee of 11 American, European and Japanese banks representing the country's private creditors would give Argentina a 45-day loan for $125 million to make up the difference due, Mr. Grinspun said. The banks also agreed to extend certain other loans, as did four Latin American nations that had lent $300 million. ''The Government had been holding out for better terms,'' said a senior Western diplomat, ''but they just didn't have any other options. This by no means solves the debt crisis, but it heads off the immediate problems.'' The catalyst for the agreements was moves by Mr. Grinspun while in Washington earlier this week to compromise with the I.M.F. in a confrontation over domestic austerity measures, Argentine officials and Western diplomats and bankers said. Argentina submitted an unprecedented unilateral austerity program two weeks ago without the agreement of the fund's staff. The sources said the I.M.F.'s managing director, Jacques de Larosi ere, told the banks Thursday that progress was being made in the negotiations, giving the banks if not the green light they had demanded, then at least a ''yellow one'' to go ahead. Mr. Grinspun acknowledged that progress was being made in the I.M.F. negotiations. ''I hope that within a week all the additional information required by the technicians of the I.M.F. will be ready, so that afterwards we can enter into full negotiations,'' he said. He has insisted that the country will not change the letter of intent it submitted outlining the austerity program, but other officials said Argentina is giving ground in many aspects of the program. Reduced Government Spending They also said Argentina has taken various steps to produce more money to repay the debt, including a reduction in Government spending. They said Argentina is also tightening up projected outlays, reducing the projected fiscal deficit by limiting inflationary increases in wages, and speeding up the Government's devaluation schedule. The changes are designed to increase trade earnings, reduce Government spending and dampen the country's inflation rate of nearly 600 percent a year. In a critical measure, the Government today postponed until Tuesday its announcement of what July salary increases will be. Government officials said Mr. Alfonsin will stick to his vow to raise wages this year 6 percent to 8 percent above inflation, but he is seeking ways to reduce the impact of the salary increases. Salaries make up the bulk of Government spending. Non-Accrual Status If the loans more than 90 days past due had not been paid by Saturday, the last day in the American banking quarter, the banks would have been forced by law to declare much of the $8.5 billion they have lent to Argentina non-performing. The loans would then have been converted to what is called non- accrual status. That would mean that the banks could not credit to their earnings any interest due on Argentine loans unless the payments had been paid in cash. In contrast, when loans are on an accrual basis, banks can count toward their earnings interest due, but not actually received. Thus, when a loan first goes on a non-accrual basis, the effect on earnings is particularly pronounced because any interest accrued in earlier quarters but not paid in cash would have to be deducted from the current quarter's earnings. Limited Impact Seen But today's agreement is likely to have less an effect this quarter than a similar agreement had in the first quarter because of a more conservative accounting stance expected to be taken by most major banks. Last quarter, the banks considered a loan to be on an accrual basis as long as it was not more than 90 days past due at the end of the quarter, even if the 90-day period had been passed earlier in the quarter. Argentina's payment in the first quarter, which ended March 31, brought its payments up-to-date only through the first few days of January. This time, however, the banks are expected to place loans on a non-accrual basis as soon as they become 90 days past due. And many of the loans passed that point in early March. As a result, the banks will not count toward their earnings most of the interest owed on the Argentinian loans during the second quarter. New Bank Accounting Rule In addition, the Federal bank regulators in the United States have said that beginning in the third quarter, banks will be required to follow this policy, and that even in the second quarter banks will have to disclose how their earnings would have been affected under the more strict accounting rules. The Manufacturers Hanover Corporation, the biggest lender to Argentina, already has said it will follow this stricter policy in reporting its second-quarter earnings and that, as a result, its net income will be reduced by about $25 million, to $70 million, from $95 million. If Argentina made no payment at all, Manufacturers Hanover said its earnings would declined by $35 million. In today's action, the banks also agreed to give Argentina a 90-day extension to repay $750 million that was due June 15 on a loan they had given Argentina 18 months ago, as well as a 90-day extension on $100 million due Saturday from a March loan during a similar payment crisis. In another reprieve, four Latin countries - Brazil, Mexico, Colombia and Venezuela - agreed to give Argentina a 30-day extension on repaying $300 million they lent in the March crisis, Mr. Grinspun said. The Alfonsin Government last week turned over $100 million to creditor banks, reducing the total amount of interest due. Today's agreement leaves the country paid up until April 4, bankers said. Bankers representing some of the 11 steering committee banks said today that the Argentine central bank had already begun disbursing the money in its part of the bargain. They said their loan would be turned over Monday, adding that New York bankers had wanted to go home for the weekend, instead of repeating the all- night scramble in March to physically transfer all the money. Tie to I.M.F. TalksBankers in New York said yesterday that the negotiations with Argentina were prolonged and difficult because the banks insisted that Argentina eventually reach agreement with the International Monetary Fund. ''The major point is that there's a linkage to the fund,'' said a leading banker. ''That's most important and the thing we held out for.'' Another item in the agreement emphasized by the bankers was that Argentina made the payment last night, one day from the end of the second quarter, and that the new bank loan for $125 million will not be disbursed until next week, which is in the third quarter. That, the bankers said, indicated that Argentina paid the loan from its own resources. According to banking sources, the four Latin American countries agreed to extend the maturity of their $300 million loan on the condition that the banks agreed to lend additional money to Argentina.

287-> ST. JOHN SEEKS CONSISTENCY
After opening the season with a 46- point rout of Lafayette in the opener of the Joe Lapchick Memorial Tournament last week, St. John's has been taken to the wire in each of its last two games by teams that were supposed to offer only mild resistance. On Saturday, the Redmen escaped with a 58-57 victory over St. Bonaventure to win the tournament. On Wednesday, against Fordham, St. John's, trailing for most of the game, looked disoriented on offense and overeager on defense but staged a late surge to win, 47-46. The narrow victories have raised a question: When will St. John's younger players mature, and which ones will blend best with the team's top three players - Chris Mullin, Walter Berry and Bill Wennington? ''We're going to be a better team because of games like this,'' said Mullin, the 6-foot-6-inch all-America guard who scored a game-high 16 points against Fordham and hit the tying and winning free throws with 15 seconds left. ''We hung in, we came from behind and showed what kind of character we have.'' Redmen Better Under Deadline Even though the victory provided a glimpse of the team's determination, it revealed some problems. For example, the Redmen are much more effective with the 45-second clock than without it. The clock was used in the tournament but not against a deliberate Fordham team that exercised its option not to use it. St. John's ran exceptionally well in its first two games and, even against St. Bonaventure, used its speed, size and quickness to advantage. Mullin's outside shooting and his uncanny ability to anticipate a play complements Berry's inside moves. But in a halfcourt game the Redmen, without an assertive point guard, thus far have been tentative, scoring more on instinct and sheer athletic ability. Mike Moses, a senior, started as point guard last season and is clearly the team's top defensive guard. But so far this season, his shooting has been inconsistent and, more important, he has yet to show authority while running the offense. Mark Jackson, the sophomore from Queens, has been alternating with Moses. Jackson shoots and drives better, but last season he had a tendency to force a play at crucial moments. ''On offense were playing defense, shooting once, then chasing them down court. We're not smart enough yet to know how to reverse the ball,'' Carnesecca said. ''We get the ball down low, they converge on him, we don't pass the ball out, we're not seeing all of the court.'' Berry Seeking Patience Berry, the 6-8 junior-college transfer, has been a devastating inside player, averaging 14 points a game and 11.5 rebounds. However, he is still not executing the full range of the offense, sometimes forcing shots instead of passing to an open player. ''I rushed a lot of shots early on, sometimes you just feel the shot,'' Berry said. ''But I have to be more patient.'' Wennington, the 7-foot senior center who is averaging 10 points and 6.0 rebounds a game, has played well. He rarely got the ball against Fordham and scored only 2 second-half points, but he blocked the potential winning shot. Carnesecca is also concerned with the lack of scoring from the small-forward position. Willie Glass, who started the first two games, is shooting 41 percent and averaging 6 points a game. Glass went scoreless against Fordham and was replaced by Ron Rowan, a 60 percent outside shooter averaging 6 points a game. Rowan lacks Glass's jumping and rebounding skills but potentially is a consistent outside scorer. ''At this point,'' Carnesecca said, ''I'm still looking for combinations.''

288-> LATIN AID DISPUTE SEEMS DEADLOCKED
A stalemate between the House and Senate over authorization of $21 million in emergency aid for covert operations in Nicaragua has frozen a supplemental spending bill containing $62 million in military aid for El Salvador. A House-Senate conference on the bill broke up in disagreement nearly four weeks ago. The positions have stiffened since then. Administration officials and Senate Republicans, pressing for the funds, have sought in vain to win over House Democratic leaders. ''I don't see any breakthrough,'' said Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., the Massachusetts Democrat, who has said repeatedly that he considers such covert operations to be immoral and counterproductive as well. Shultz Breaks Appointments Secretary of State George P. Shultz, assigned to use personal diplomacy with Mr. O'Neill, has thus far broken three appointments to see him, according to the House Speaker. Kathleen Lang, a State Department spokesman, said the department would not discuss the Secretary's appointments schedule. Mr. O'Neill said he doubted a meeting with Secretary Shultz would advance the White House cause but added, ''I'm curious to listen to him.'' ''I sent a message back to Shultz yesterday afternoon, telling him that it's worse now than it was four weeks ago,'' he added in an interview. Senator Howard H. Baker Jr., Republican of Tennessee, the majority leader who also serves as the President's lieutenant on Capitol Hill, said he remained optimistic. ''I think we'll have a bill,'' Mr. Baker said. The Senator added it was important to read between the lines when communicating with Mr. O'Neill. ''You have to understand the art of talking to Tip O'Neill,'' he said. ''It is not a straightforward craft. You have to use a lot of body language.'' A Link to Youth Jobs Bill Mr. Baker rejected Mr. O'Neill's efforts to allow separate Senate action on a $100 million summer youth jobs program in the bill. This led House Democratic leaders to conclude that the Senate Republicans were holding the summer job program hostage to the Nicaraguan aid bill. President Reagan requested the emergency funds last February, and in April the Senate approved a $1.4 billion package that included $21 million for covert operations in Nicaragua and $62 million in military aid for El Salvador. These funds were attached to a House- passed bill that provided $60 million for drought-stricken African nations. A House-Senate conference on the spending bill broke up in disagreement May 17, pending further instructions from the two chambers. On May 24 the House approved the funds for El Salvador but rejected extra funds for covert operations in Nicaragua. Approval by Senate Committee On Wednesday the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence approved the President's request for $28 million in covert aid to the Nicaraguan guerrillas in the next fiscal year, beginning Oct. 1. In so doing, the committee rejected a proposal by Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Delaware Democrat, that would have allowed the money to be used only to stop deliveries of arms from Nicaragua to rebels in El Salvador and other Latin American nations. Senator Daniel P. Moynihan, the New York Democrat who is the intelligence committee's vice chairman, complained that the group had received no ''conclusive information'' to support the Administration's claim that Nicaragua has been shipping arms into El Salvador.

In the publicity that followed, Mr. Kreuz met Maine's Governor, was made an honorary member of the Penobscot Indian tribe and received a gift acre of land from a couple in St. Francis, Me., near Canada. Mr. Kreuz, who lives in the West German town of Adelsried, still owns the land and pays a realty tax of ''under $20'' on it every year, says Belinda Michaud, the tax collector in St. Francis.

Dr. Noguchi, who vowed to appeal the ruling, was suspended and then demoted as county coroner by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors after complaints that he had sensationalized details of the deaths of the actors William Holden and Natalie Wood. Other allegations against Dr. Noguchi included charges he devoted too much time to activities outside the coroner's office. Judge Epstein called Dr. Noguchi ''a good man but he is not an appropriate person to hold the top position as coroner.''

298-> NEW AMERICAN BID GETS JEWEL
Abandoning its struggle to remain independent, the Jewel Companies announced today that it had agreed to merge with the American Stores Company in a $1.16 billion deal that analysts said would form the nation's third-largest supermarket chain. American, a Salt Lake City-based company, which like Chicago-based Jewel operates supermarkets and drugstores, increased its tender offer by $5 a share, to $75. And Jewel, after two weeks of trying to find a way to avoid a takeover by American, said its board would recommend acceptance to its shareholders. The companies announced that L. S. Skaggs, American's chairman, would be chairman and chief executive officer of the combined company. Sources close to the negotiations between the two companies said that Weston R. Christopherson, Jewel's chairman, and several other top Jewel officials would not be part of the merged company. Instead, they are to receive hefty severance payments, the sources said. Despite the friction preceding today's announcement, analysts said the merged company would be a very strong competitor in both the supermarket and drugstore field. 'A Really Awesome Company' ''It's going to be a really awesome company,'' said John Landschulz, an analyst with Mesirow & Company in Chicago. ''It's a good blend of companies that understands how the other operates. Their commitment to combination supermarket-drugstores is especially favorable.'' He said the combined company's strength would make it easier for it to expand, and help it fight discounting wars to increase its market share. Jewel, the nation's sixth-largest supermarket company, operates 1,100 stores in 29 states, concentrated in the Middle West. It earned $83.1 million on sales of $5.7 billion last year. Analysts said that Jewel's supermarket operations had matured, but that its Osco drugstore subsidiary was still enjoying rapid growth. American, the fifth-largest supermarket chain, is concentrated in the West and has about 1,000 stores. It earned $117.9 million on sales of $8 billion last year. A Long History American and Jewel have a long history of courtship and spurning. In 1966, the Skaggs Companies, the predecessor of American Stores, talked with Jewel, but no deal was worked out. Then in 1978, Skaggs and Jewel agreed to merge, but Skaggs backed out. A year later, Skaggs acquired the larger American Stores Company. Sources close to the talks said the surviving company would be called American Stores. They said that in an effort to block American's bid, Mr. Christopherson had lined up a deal in which Jewel was to obtain Vons supermarkets in Los Angeles and other retailing establishments from Household International Inc. in exchange for $500 million in Jewel stock. This tactic was aimed not only at making the deal more expensive for American, but also at creating antitrust problems for American, which operates supermarkets in California. The sources said Jewel's outside directors pushed the company's management at Tuesday's board meeting to accept the $70 offer American made two weeks ago. American had threatened to lower its offer if Jewel took steps to make Jewel less desirable. One analyst said the reason that the deal went through was that Jewel's outside directors ''played the role they were supposed to play and made sure the shareholders got the best possible deal.'' Talks With Tengelmann Inside sources also said that Jewel had talked with the Tengelmann Group of West Germany, which controls the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company. Tengelmann was said to be considering making an offer of more than $70, but the outside directors pushed Jewel to accept American's firm offer. ''The bidding strategy of American Stores was designed to place the board of Jewel in a position where the most attractive option available for them was to negotiate with American,'' said J. T. Hill, a managing director at Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb Inc, the investment banker for American in this deal. When American made its offer, Jewel stock was selling for $49 a share. Under the terms announced today, American is offering $75 a share for two-thirds of Jewel's 15.4 million outstanding shares. The offer is open until June 28, at which time American will seek to obtain the other third by offering $75 a share in stock. Company sources said the merger should be completed by late summer. Analysts said it was ironic that Mr. Christopherson would be forced out, because, they said, he had done an excellent job building Jewel, which was founded in 1899 and was known as the Jewel Tea Company. Nevertheless, Mr. Christopherson, who owns 112,634 shares of Jewel, is scheduled to receive about $8.5 million in the deal, aside from any severance payment. In announcing that the two companies had executed a definitive merger agreement, Mr. Skaggs, who is 60, said his goal was to create ''a nationwide organization.''

299-> 20 CZECHS FREED BY ANGOLA REBELS
A senior Czechoslovak official escorted 20 of his countrymen out of captivity at a remote bush camp in southern Angola today after they had been held for 15 months as prisoners of rebellious guerrillas. The hostages had been forced to march 750 miles across the savannah before being freed by the guerrillas, who are fighting the Angolan Government under the banner of the rebel leader Jonas Savimbi. Deputy Foreign Minister Stanislas Svoboda of Czechoslovakia accompanied the technicians from Mr. Savimbi's headquarters at Jamba, in southern Angola, through Johannesburg and on to Kinshasa, Zaire, where the group was to board a Czechoslovak airliner for Prague. According to officials here, Mr. Svoboda's brief stay in South Africa was the first publicly-acknowledged visit by an East-bloc diplomat since the 1950's. However, the officials said, contacts between South Africa and the Soviet Union that have been less public, about commodities such as the gold and diamonds that both produce, might have taken place in Western Europe, Moscow or elsewhere. Thanks South Africans for Help Mr. Svoboda said he wished to thank the South African authorities for assisting in the release of the 20 Czechoslovaks, who were captured last year when Mr. Savimbi's guerrillas overran the town of Alto Catumbela, in western Angola. He said he had been in South Africa only in transit and declined comment at a news conference on the relationship beteen South Africa and his country, which, like other Warsaw Pact nations, supports the black nationalists seeking the overthrow of the white authorities. Czechoslovakia is also a principal ally of the Marxist Government in Angola. Mr. Svoboda said the only condition attached to the release of his compatriots under the auspices of the International Committee of the Red Cross, had been that he travel to Jamba and meet Mr. Savimbi. The encounter Thursday between the Czechoslovak envoy and the rebel leader is bound to be interpreted by Mr. Savimbi as an acknowledgement of his movement's demand to be included in any regional peace negotiations affecting Angola's future. Czechoslovakia does not recognize Mr. Savimbi's National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, which receives major support from South Africa and which has the sympathy of Western-oriented African countries including Zaire and Morocco. No Word on American Hostages South African officials said there was no word on the whereabouts or well- being of American hostages seized by the rebels three weeks ago and believed to be still on their way across Angola to the insurgent headquarters. The capture of foreign technicians working within Angola's battered economy has provided Mr. Savimbi with a principal tactic to win publicity for his cause.

300-> BASEBALL; TIGERS' MORRIS WINS 11TH, 5-3
Newly acquired Ruppert Jones hit a tie- breaking three-run home run in the sixth inning today, and Jack Morris helped the Detroit Tigers split their four-game series with Toronto by pitching a seven-hitter to beat the Blue Jays, 5-3. Morris (11-2) leads the majors in victories. Two of the three runs against him came as a result of two errors by the first baseman, Dave Bergman. Jim Clancy (4-6) took a three-hitter into the sixth but gave up a bloop single to Lance Parrish and walked Darrell Evans before Jones hit his first homer of the season, into the upper deck in right. Jones, a left-handed-hitting outfielder, was playing his second game with Detroit after being called up from Evansville of the American Association. The 29-year-old Jones was an all-star with the San Diego Padres two years ago. He was signed to a minor league contract by Detroit April 18 after he failed to make the Pittsburgh Pirates' roster as a free agent in spring training. One out after Jones broke the 1-1 tie, Howard Johnson singled, stole second and scored on a single by Lou Whitaker to make it 5-1. White Sox 11, Angels 10CHICAGO (AP) - Harold Baines cracked a pair of three-run homers for Chicago, which rebounded from a 7-0 deficit. Baines's first homer capped a six-run third inning and his second put the White Sox ahead to stay in the fifth. The Angels' Fred Lynn homered twice. The second, with two out in the eighth, made it 11- 10. Al Jones then got the last four outs for his fourth save. Royals 9, Mariners 8KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) - Frank White clubbed a three-run homer in the seventh inning for Kansas City, which trailed, 7-0, after three innings. The Royals scored five runs in the fifth and four in the seventh. Willie Wilson led off the seventh with a triple and scored on a groundout by Butch Davis. George Brett then walked and Hal McRae singled ahead of White's seventh home run, off the reliever Dave Beard (3-2). Dan Quisenberry pitched the final two innings for his 15th save. Alvin Davis, the Mariners' power-hitting rookie, smacked his 13th homer. Brewers 6, Red Sox 3BOSTON (AP) - Bob McClure, a reliever forced into his second start of the season because of Milwaukee injuries, allowed only one unearned run for six innings and the Brewers had a 19-hit attack. McClure (1-1) scattered five hits before giving way to Peter Ladd, who yielded a two-run home run to Mike Easler in the eighth. Easler drove in all three Boston runs. Rollie Fingers worked the ninth to pick up his 10th save. Twins 5, Rangers 4MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - Kent Hrbek's seventh-inning single drove in Tim Teufel with the winning run for Minnesota. With the Twins trailing by 4-3, Kirby Puckett singled with one out in the seventh and scored the tying run on Teufel's double. Hrbek then singled home Teufel. Reds 12, Padres 1 SAN DIEGO (UPI) - Dave Parker, Nick Esasky and Tom Foley each hit a two-run homer in a six-run first inning, and Cincinnati went on to ending San Diego's six-game winning streak. The Reds scored five more runs in the eighth inning, with a two- out, three-run triple by Brad Gulden capping the inning.

301-> B.P.'s Profit Accelerates
The British Petroleum Company, citing gains in all sectors, reported a $478.8 million profit for the first quarter, up sharply from $103.6 million a year earlier. British Petroleum said it made $249 million in the latest quarter from its 53 percent interest in the Standard Oil Company (Ohio), up 57 percent from last year. B.P.'s operating earnings from British operations climbed to $340 million from $144 million. The company's worldwide production in the quarter rose to 1.23 million barrels a day from 1.20 million. British Petroleum said refining and marketing profit margins at its BP International and BP Shipping units had changed little from the fourth quarter of 1983, ''despite unstable oil prices and fluctuating dollar rates.''

302-> A SHOE CONCERN TO CLOSE DOORS
Welpro Inc. of Seabrook, N.H., a 50-year-old maker of women's dress shoes, will cease operating July 1, Stanley Barr, president and son of the company's founder, told the 250 employees at noon today. Mr. Barr said the decision was made in response to Wednesday's decision by the United States International Trade Commission not to give tariff protection to American shoe manufacturers. He said he and his brother were going to go out of business ''before we run out of cash'' to meet the payroll. Another response to the I.T.C.'s 5-to-0 ruling that imports of cheaper shoes do not represent ''a serious'' threat to the domestic shoe industry came from Henry Clayman, president of P. Clayman & Sons Inc. of Salem, Mass., which says it supplies 50 percent of the innersoles used by the naton's domestic shoe manufacturers. The ruling ''defies logic,'' he said. Mr. Clayman said that the flood of cheap imported shoes in the last several years had taken 75 percent of the market for shoes in the United States. ''The American shoemaking industry isn't shrinking anymore - it is a disappearing industry,'' he said. ''How they could ever come to a decision that cheaper imports have not damaged the United States because a lot of shoe manufacturers also sell imported shoes, I don't know,'' he continued. ''They forget that the tanning business and allied industries total much more than the actual shoe business.'' One company that has started adding imported shoes to its product line, is the G. H. Bass Company of Wilton, Me, a wholly owned subsidiary of Chesebrough- Pond's Inc. and a maker of shoes and boots since 1876, Richard Bourret, president of G. H. Bass, which sold 144 million pairs of shoes in 1983 and increased its sales by 21 percent in the first quarter of this year, said the company ''only went into the sale of imported shoes two years ago in order to remain competitive.'' Its current imports account for 35 percent of overall sales. Mr. Bourret said that it is ''ridiculous for the Government to say there has been no injury.'' Mr. Bourret, who is the director of Footwear Industries of Amer ica, a trade association that has petitioned for relief from shoe imports, together with two A.F.L.-C.I.O. unions, said that throughout the United States more than 300 shoe factories have closed in the last 10 years. He said 18 of those closings had been in the last six months, including two in Maine. Indeed, throughout New England, once-bustling footwear factories stand idle from Lynn and Salem, Mass., to Maine. In 1945 there were 65 shoe factories still operating along the Merrimack River in such towns as Lowell and Haverhill, Mass. Today only two are still in operation. Many of the factories trace their history to Civil War days, when they were built to supply shoes to the Union forces. For decades young people growing up in the region expected to go to work in the shoe factories after school. Not all the mills have been abandoned, however; many of them today are the site of some of New England's most advanced industrial parks. Rebuffed Abroad Mr. Bourret complained that while imports were flooding into the United States, American producers were rebuffed abroad by the embargoes and duties foreign countries placed on American-made footwear. Brazil, the biggest supplier to the American market, will not allow American shoes to be imported, while Taiwan and South Korea, the second- and third-largest suppliers to the United States, levy duties of more than 50 percent on American-made shoes. In Canada, the duty on American shoes is 25 percent. And Japan will allow only one million pairs of shoes to be imported a year, he added. Welpro - the name is an acronym for a British welding process the company has used for shoemaking, has made an average of 1.25 million to 1.5 million pairs of shoes annually in the last five years. Its shoes have been marketed largely under private label by chains such as J. C. Penney. In 1983, Welpro's sales dropped to 750,000 pairs. As of July 1, when the company closes its doors, it will have produced only about 300,000 to 325,000 pairs, Mr. Barr said. Not all American makers are in trouble. Richard Bass, president of the Cardinal Shoe Corporation of Lawrence, Mass., said his own company's sales today are ''better than ever before'' but he added that it had taken a ''monumental effort to stay on top of fashion and at the same time to remain price competitors.''

303-> AUCTIONS; ; If it's scarce, it's important.
-quality 18th- century American furniture has become scarce, the focus of auction houses and collectors has shifted to lesser works.These are being categorized by the auction galleries as ''highly important,'' a case in point being the collection Hugh and Ethelyn Cox assembled over three decades to furnish their 18th-century Federal town house in Alexandria, Va. The Cox collection of 89 Newport, Philadelphia, Boston and New York chairs, settees, chests and tables will be on view tomorrow through next Friday and up for bidding next Saturday, June 16, at 3 P.M., at Christie's, Park Avenue and 59th Street. ''The importance has crept up on the collection,'' Dean Failey, Christie's American-furniture specialist, said the other day. ''They happen to be pieces that 30 years ago would have been considered nice - now they are considered rare.'' He cited as an example a Massachusetts Chippendale settee with double-chair back, which, he said, is one of only 10 such pieces in existence. Christie's expects it to sell for as much as $60,000. Notable, too, Mr. Failey said, are a Newport Pembroke table attributed to John Townsend, also one of only 10 known to exist (up to $50,000), and a small, circular Boston ''tuckaway'' tea table, of which only six are known (up to $45,000). Harold Sack, who heads Israel Sack, the 57th Street dealers, agrees with Mr. Failey. ''By default, the collection becomes important,'' he said. ''There are so few sales of collections of city furniture these days that when something interesting appears, there is great excitement.'' The Coxes began buying American furniture in New York, where they lived before moving to Washington in the mid-1930's, when Mr. Cox joined the Justice Department. He became a chief deputy and later assistant solicitor general in the department's antitrust division, turning to private law practice in 1946. He died in 1973. John Walton, an American-furniture dealer, formerly of New York and now of Jewett City, Conn., met Mr. Cox in 1951 and sold him many of the antiques that will be auctioned. ''He was not what you would call a collector - he was furnishing his home,'' Mr. Walton recalled. ''He had a good eye, but never bought something because it was a rarity. He just bought things he liked and worried about where to place them afterward. I am sure that the collection will bring a handsome profit.'' The escalation of values on American furniture can be seen in the prices Mr. Cox paid, and the values Christie's now places on those pieces. Mr. Walton bought a matching highboy and lowboy at an auction in 1954 for $2,000 and sold them shortly afterward to Mr. Cox for $6,500. Christie's expects the set to bring up to $120,000. Six Philadelphia chairs carved by Samuel Walton cost Mr. Cox $4,250 and may sell for as much as $50,000. A Chippendale single-drop-leaf table was $900 in 1951 and may sell for up to $30,000. ''I was sort of surprised at how low some of Christie's estimates are,'' Bernard Levy, a Madison Avenue dealer, commented. ''There are a number of items - including a chest - that I think should bring double the estimates.'' Boy's Walk Near Tracks May Net Him $450,000 Jewelry found beside railroad tracks near Hollywood, Fla., by Eric De Wilde, a 16-year-old orphan who had run away from home, will be sold by Christie's over the next two weeks. Mr. De Wilde was looking for a place to sleep one night in March 1983 near the Seaboard Coast Line tracks, not far from his home, when he discovered a yellow bank bag filled with gems. He returned home, and on the following day, he and his aunt, Modena Trost, who has cared for him since his mother died when he was 7, turned the jewelry over to the police. Under Florida law, the sack's contents, and 20 more pieces discovered by the police during their investigation, became Mr. De Wilde's property six months later, after more than 1,000 claims had been reviewed. In all, there are 116 unmounted stones, rings, brooches, bracelets and necklaces, valued by Christie's at about $450,000. They have been divided into two parts - 29 lots will be sold at 10 A.M. next Tuesday at Christie's and 46 lots on June 21 at Christie's East, 219 East 67th Street. Mr. De Wilde has not been available for comment since the discovery was made public. The jewels were transferred to a trust account. ''He wants to lead a quiet normal life,'' Charles O. Morgan Jr., the young man's lawyer, said by telephone from Miami. Mr. Morgan said that his client was still living at home with his aunt, but had left school - he was in the ninth grade last fall. ''He is working now in a full-time job,'' Mr. Morgan said. Reprise A Federal tambour desk, attributed to John Seymour of Boston, sold at Robert Skinner Galleries in Bolton, Mass., last Friday for $176,000, an auction record for a piece by the Massachusetts cabinetmaker. The desk, which was sold to Elaine Wilde, a Boston collector, eclipsed the previous record, $121,000, established in a sale of another tambour desk by Thomas and John Seymour at Christie's in New York two years ago. A German toy train made by Marklin in 1909, a tin-plate model of the 19th-century steam-fired Stevenson's Rocket, was bought at Sotheby's in London on May 29 for $39,270 by Alexander Acevedo, a Madison Avenue dealer in American art. The price set an auction record for a toy, surpassed the previous figure, $28,600, paid a year ago at Sotheby's in London for another Marklin model - of the liner Lusitania. Mr. Acevedo explained that the train, comprising a locomotive, tender, open passenger coach and luggage car, was extremely rare, because ''it was not a big seller when it was new, so very few were produced.''

306-> FOLLOW-UP ON THE NEWS; Smashing Projects
After building a 2.4-mile circular tunnel on Long Island and starting work on an atom smasher that was to have used the tunnel, the Federal Department of Energy was told by a panel of physicists a year ago that the project really should be scrapped. Some $200 million had been spent on the work at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, but the physicists - a subcommittee of the department's High Energy Physics Advisory Panel - said the atom smasher would be obsolete by the time it was finished in 1987. They urged instead that a more advanced atom smasher be built with a 60-mile tunnel. The recommendation has been accepted, and all work on the Brookhaven atom smasher has now halted. Before it stopped, however, a refrigeration plant - ''probably the largest liquid helium cooling facility in the world today'' - was completed, according to Julius Spiro, an assistant to the laboratory's associate director. The hope is to use the plant with the bigger atom smasher if it is built. Atom smashers break subatomic particles apart through high-speed collisions, and physicists study the debris for clues to the makeup of matter. The Brookhaven installation was to have been a proton collider. Brookhaven is proposing now that a heavy-ion collider, the world's first, be built at its 2.4-mile tunnel.

307-> HOMELESSNESS SPREADING TO BEDROOM COMMUNITIES
Wearing layers of worn clothing despite the sweltering temperature and carrying the rest of her belongings in tattered shopping bags, a frail and elderly woman huddled on a bench in a shopping mall in this middle- class Nassau County community one recent morning. Such a scene, unimaginable a few years ago among the split levels, two-car garages and tree-lined streets, is still rare enough to startle passers-by. But there is growing evidence that the cancer of homelessness has spread beyond the city line to the suburbs. No one is sure how many people are homeless on Long Island or in Westchester County or New Jersey, but volunteer and religious groups that have taken up their cause say the numbers are rising, spurred by high interest rates and diminishing subsidies, which have limited low-income housing. Soup kitchens and makeshift shelters have begun to appear - sometimes over local opposition. Private groups say local and suburban governments, hamstrung by regulations and lack of funds, aren't doing enough. The Nassau Action Coalition estimates there may be as many as 5,000 homeless people in the county, ''many of whom end up spending the night in cars, church pews and cold basements,'' according to the Rev. Stark G. Jones, co-chairman of the group. ''It's a tragedy that cannot be allowed to go unaddressed,'' he said last week, accusing the county Department of Social Services of ''failing to provide sufficient services or encouragment to community groups struggling to help the homeless.'' Dorcas Carlos, a spokesman for the agency, said the county provided emergency shelter assistance last year to 724 families and 1,053 individuals, more than 35 percent of whom were ''repeaters'' - people who may seek the department's aid as often as 10 times in a year. She dismissed talk that some suburban agencies merely provide the homeless with bus or train fare to New York City. ''No one leaves here without a place to spend the night,'' she said. Suffolk's ConcernHowever, critics cite the case of the Kosters, a family who claim they were forced to sleep in their truck two years ago after the agency failed to find them emergency housing. John Koster, unemployed after injuring his back while working as a bank security guard, his wife and five children found themselves homeless when their landlord turned over the house they had been renting to a member of his family. They tried living with her parents, then his, but each time left because of overcrowding. They turned to the county Social Services Department, but said they were refused help. With the aid of the Nassau- Suffolk Law Services Committee, the Kosters went to Federal court in October 1982, contending that Nassau's failure to provide ''lawful shelter'' violated the 14th Amendment provision for equal protection under the law. The case is pending. Suffolk County has no shelters of its own and no accurate count of its homeless. Nevertheless, John Sheahan, spokesman for the Department of Social Services, said ''finding homes for the homeless is our major concern.'' But, he added: ''We don't see any immediate solution, and we think it's going to get worse. The major underlying reason is the shortage of low-rent housing. A large portion of the housing that was marginal in the past and used by welfare recipients is now in greater demand and being upgraded by landlords. Right now we have 110 families in motels in an emergency housing situation and there is no place to move them.'' When Westchester County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke opened a 19-bed shelter for homeless men and women in a World War II-style Quonset hut at the county airport in March, he described it as a ''temporary'' facility that would remain open only for 90 days. Two weeks ago, nearly four weeks after the shelter had been closed, Mr. O'Rourke ordered it reopened ''until we can come up with some better answers.'' According to various estimates, between 4,000 and 10,000 people may be at least temporarily homeless in Westchester, but even with the airport facility there are fewer than 100 beds available at public and private shelters. At any given time, the county also puts up several hundred families displaced by fire or eviction in apartments or motels. Nor is the pressure likely to abate. Westchester Legal Services took the county Department of Social Services to court last year, accusing it of denying assistance to those unable to furnish a fixed address. In February the agency agreed in an out-of-court settlement to change the policy. In New Jersey, a survey by a gubernatorial study group estimated that there were 20,000 homeless people, but that public and private agencies had only 700 beds for them. Trenton is setting up telephone hotlines for the homeless and will spend $500,000 helping existing shelters meet fire and safety codes. The Legislature is also considering a $1.6 million rental assistance program to help families threatened with eviction. Another bill would require that shelters be licensed by the state, upgrading standards.

A Federal District judge has upheld a ban on all commercial fishing in Everglades National Park. The rule had been set to go into effect at the end of next year. Judge Sidney Aronovitz ruled Friday in response to a suit filed in 1980 by Organized Fishermen of Florida against the Department of the Interior, the National Park Service and Everglades National Park. The fishermen sought to prevent enforcement of restrictions created by the agencies in 1980. The regulations also would impose a limit of 10 fish of one species.

310-> FOOD; FRUITS OF SUMMER FOR DESERT
HOW often do we get the chance to taste an apricot that is warm from the sun and bursting with flavor, or a peach so juicy you almost need to wear a bathing suit to eat it? We get our peaches, plums, nectarines or apricots from the supermarket or fruit stand. These usually look perfect. But their looks deceive. All show, it turns out, for when it comes to eating, very often they fall into two categories: hard or woolen. What to do with such fruits? The answer is to cook them. Even the hardest peach is transformed when poached or baked; the flesh becomes tender and the juices form a syrupy glaze. Apricots, too, become soft and juicy when baked with a little sugar (flavored with vanilla perhaps) and a splash of kirsch or white wine. Cardamom seeds, taken out of their pods and wrapped in cheesecloth, can be added for flavor. Plums can be baked a similar way, with sugar and port. If there is a loaf of day-old French or Italian bread on hand, it can be used for making an excellent and easy dessert with any pitted fruit. Slices of the bread are dipped in melted butter and peach, apricot or plum halves placed, skin down, on the slices and sprinkled with sugar. When baked in a hot oven, the bread becomes crisp and golden, the fruit sticky and caramelized. A spectacular-looking but easy dessert can be made with poached apricots or peaches placed on a crimson pool of pureed raspberries and decorated with a sprig of mint. Another good way to serve peaches is skinned and sliced into large wine glasses. Just before sitting down to the meal, sprinkle the peaches with a little sugar, place them in wine glasses and fill up the glasses with red wine. One of the most delicious summer desserts is unquestionably apricot tart; the fruit, burnished and gleaming, arranged in concentric patterns in a pastry shell (the filling might also be peach, plum or pitted cherry). The French always seem to produce such tarts perfectly, without the sogginess that one often encounters elsewhere. To reduce sogginess, brush the pastry with lightly-beaten white of egg. When making pastry it is important to keep everything as cool as you can. Handle the dough as little as possible (for this reason, the food processor is a help in blending the butter and flour). Use a cold surface - preferably marble - for rolling out the pastry. If the pastry is tough, you have worked it too much or used too much water. If it is too soft and tears easily, you have used too little water or too much butter. Apricot Tart FOR THE PASTRY: 1 1/2 cups flour Salt 1 tablespoon sugar 12 tablespoons unsalted butter 3-4 tablespoons iced water FOR THE FILLING: 2 pounds apricots pitted 1 cup apricot glaze 1.* Make the pastry. By hand: Sieve the flour and the salt into a large bowl. Sprinkle with sugar. Cut the butter into small pieces and work into the flour with two knives, crossing the blades and pulling them away from each other rapidly; mixture resembles coarse bread crumbs. Sprinkle on three tablespoons iced water. Gather the dough into a bowl and knead gently with the heel of your palm to bind. Shape into a ball and dust with flour. Place in a plastic bag and refrigerate for one hour. In a food processor: Place the flour, salt, sugar and butter, cut into pieces, into the bowl of the machine fitted with the steel blade. Buzz 15 times (each time long enough to count quickly to three). Add the water and repeat 10 times. The dough should look like sticky coarse bread crumbs. It should not be allowed to form a ball in the machine or it will be difficult to roll out and the crust will be tough. Turn the dough onto a floured surface and bind with the heel of your palm. Shape into a ball. Dust with flour, place in a plastic bag and refrigerate for an hour. 2.*Roll out the dough: Dust a working surface and rolling pin with flour. Place ball in the center and give a few smacks with the rolling pin to flatten. Then roll the dough away from you in quick, short strokes, clockwise. Roll out into a large circle, always working clockwise and in the same direction. Do not roll back and forth. 3.*Place the dough into the center of a tart tin and fit the pastry inside the tin. Using the prongs of a fork or the blade of a blunt knife, press the dough down over the edges of the pie tin. Cut away any overhanging flaps. They can be saved and used for individual tarts later. Refrigerate. 4.*Preheat oven to 425 degrees. When the oven is ready, remove the pastry from refrigerator. Cut the fruit into halves or quarters and place skin down on the pastry in concentric circles. Bake for about 20 minutes, or until the edges of the fruit are lightly brown. Remove from the oven and coat with syrup or apricot glaze. Yield: One 9- to 10-inch tart. Peaches With Raspberry Sauce 6 peaches 2 teaspoons sugar 1/2 cup dry white wine, dry ver mouth or champagne 1 cup fresh raspberries or one small package, frozen 2 tablespoons lemon juice Fresh mint leaves to garnish 1.* Bring to boil enough water to cover the peaches in one layer in a large saucepan. Drop the peaches in and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove, drain and slip off the skins. 2.* With a sharp knife, cut the peaches in half along the indentation marks.

311-> U.S. NOW PRAISING SYRIA AS'HELPFUL'
A senior State Department official told a Congressional subcommittee today that Syria was playing a ''helpful'' role in restoring stability in Lebanon. He said this stemmed from a decision by Damascus ''to shift course'' and be more cooperative. The praise for Syria's actions seemed to stun some members of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on the Middle East and Europe. They sharply questioned the witness, Richard W. Murphy, Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs, about the apparent switch in Administration polemics about Syria. For most of the last two years, President Reagan, Secretary of State George P. Shultz and other spokesmen have repeatedly blamed Syria for the trouble in the Middle East, for blocking progress toward a Lebanese accord, and for being involved in terrorist actions against the United States, including the bombing in Lebanon that killed 241 American servicemen last October. Success in Lebanon Cited In a general review of the Middle East situation, Mr. Murphy noted that the new Government of Prime Minister Rashid Karami of Lebanon had been achieving success in restoring order and in ''addressing the many problems before it.'' ''We believe that Syria has been one of the helpful players in these recent developments,'' he said. ''We also believe that Lebanon needs peaceful, cooperative relations with both Syria and Israel. No lasting solution is possible which fails to take into account the interests of both of these important neighbors.'' Representative Ed Zschau, Republican of California, asked Mr. Murphy how Syria could be described as ''a helpful player'' after it had been so long depicted as ''the troublemaker in the region.'' ''Times change,'' replied Mr. Murphy, a former Ambassador to Syria. He said that the Syrians had caused trouble in the region as a result of the American-negotiated agreement of May 17, 1983, between Israel and Lebanon on the terms for Israeli withdrawal. Mr. Murphy said that ''clearly the Syrians had set their sights on blowing up that agreement.'' ''And when that was blown, they showed themselves ready to move in the direction of helping to restore stability in Lebanon,'' he said. Stability Seen as Goal ''I think they have come to a policy decision that a stable Lebanon, and a stable Beirut'' are necessary for greater stability in the region, he said. A strong Israeli supporter on the committee, Representative Larry Smith, Democrat of Florida, said, ''I am distressed by the choice of the word 'helpful.' '' ''It's a relative term,'' he continued. ''If someone throws you down a well a hundred feet and you're not very happy and then they haul you up 50 feet and you can see the light at the top of the well, you feel a lot better and you call them helpful, but you never would have been down there in the first place if they hadn't thrown you down there.'' On other Middle East issues, Mr. Murphy said that Iran continued to build up its forces along the border with Iraq for an invasion that could occur ''tomorrow - or never.'' He said that there seemed to be a continuing debate in Teheran on what to do about the invasion. ''For the moment, the situation is not getting better,'' he said of the Iran-Iraq war, ''nor is it getting any worse.'' ''But this is a perilous duel,''he said. ''The danger is real that it may at any moment ignite a wider conflict.'' He argued for Congressional backing of Administration efforts to provide arms to various Persian Gulf states concerned over Iran. ''

312-> TRI-STAR, HOLLYWOOD'S NEWEST FILM STUDIO, HITS A HOME RUN
If the arrival 15 months ago of Tri-Star Pictures, Hollywood's newest movie studio, was met by equal parts envy and skepticism, both were understandable. In a town where nearly every day someone announces that he has raised $50 million to make a string of movies, Tri-Star was no such shoestring-operation. Formed by Columbia Pictures, Home Box Office and the CBS television network, which put up $67 million apiece, Tri-Star got another $200 million from the banks. Private outside financing and a deal with Home Box Office for exclusive showing of Tri-Star movies on cable brought the studio's hope chest up to nearly a billion dollars. That accounts for the envy. The three unlikely partners in charge of Tri-Star caused the skepticism. ''HBO is not popular in Hollywood,'' said David Matalon, Tri- Star's executive vice president of distribution and marketing, with deliberate understatement. HBO is actively hated by top studio executives only willing to speak anonymously. As the biggest pay-cable television channel, HBO has treated Hollywood with what those executives described as high-handed arrogance. Seen as a Marionette Tri-Star was seen by the film industry as a marionette that would be swinging from strings held by both HBO and Columbia. It was widely felt by the other major studios that Columbia, which gets fees from distributing Tri-Star movies, would push the new studio aside whenever a Tri-Star movie and a Columbia movie were in competition for theaters. Although one movie is not enough to erase all doubts, the results of ''The Natural,'' Tri-Star's first home- grown movie, have eased Hollywood's skepticism and earned Tri- Star grudging approval. ''The Natural,'' starring Robert Redford as a baseball player who is given a second chance at fame, has sold $44 million worth of tickets during the last 10 weeks and is still playing at 700 theaters. If ''The Natural'' has not hit the box-office home run of ''Police Academy,'' at $82 million, or ''Ghostbusters,'' at $125 million, it has done extremely well for a serious movie. Directed by Barry Levinson, ''The Natural'' is taken from Bernard Malamud's first novel. The movie turns Mr. Malamud's dark mythological vision into a fairy tale. The advertising and distribution of ''The Natural'' were designed by Tri- Star to take advantage of Mr. Redford's box-office strengths and to combat the usual commercial weakness of baseball movies. ''The Natural'' opened in approximately 1,000 theaters on May 11, two weeks before the onslaught of summer movies. ''We wanted two solid weeks by ourselves,'' Mr. Matalon said. ''We knew we'd lose the kids when movies like 'Indiana Jones' came out.'' Pattern of Redford Films The two weeks were also made necessary by the pattern of Redford movies at the box office. ''His films open well but not sensationally,'' Mr. Matalon said. ''Then they hang around for a long time.'' For example, ''The Electric Horseman'' was a disappointment when it opened during Christmas 1979. Ray Stark, its producer, said a research survey showed that the film was in fourth place on everybody's Christmas movie list but first on very few. However, the movie, which co- starred Mr. Redford and Jane Fonda, started doing well in January when there were no new movies to contend with. It eventually earned an excellent $30 million in film rentals. Film rentals are the portion of the box-office receipts, usually about 50 percent, that are returned to a movie's distributor. According to Mr. Matalon, opening ''The Natural'' head to head against ''Indiana Jones,'' ''Gremlins'' and ''Star Trek'' ''would risk depressing our opening level.'' A mediocre first two weeks might brand the film a failure. Tri-Star's advertising campaign was equally careful. Several different television commercials were made. On television sports programs and ESPN, a cable sports network, commercials presented ''The Natural'' as a rousing baseball movie. ''But we were very conscious that baseball is not appealing to some people,'' said Steve Randall, Tri-Star's advertising vice president. ''On the afternoon soap operas we ran pure love story commercials featuring Bob, Kim Basinger and Glenn Close. There wasn't a hint of baseball.'' Baseball and Mystery For the broader prime-time audience, there was a tiny bit of baseball but more mystery. For newspaper advertisements, it was all mystery: ''No one knew where he came from. But he was the best they'd ever seen.'' The best at what? Certainly not at baseball, which was hardly mentioned. The inference that ''best'' might have a sexual connotation was deliberate, according to Mr. Randall. Indeed, the tenor of the newspaper advertisements was mystical: an older Robert Redford looking down from the sky at his younger self. Whenever baseball had to be shown, it was cloaked in romanticism, ''as analogous to the final boxing match in 'Rocky' as possible,'' Mr. Randall said. The box-office success of ''The Natural'' has given Tri-Star a certain amount of credibility. But, within the Hollywood community, Tri-Star has earned even more because, during the fierce summer competition for theaters, it has proved that Columbia is not pulling its strings. ''Obviously their objective, which was to be established as an instant major company, was accomplished,'' said Frank Price, chairman of Universal's motion picture group. ''They are clearly going to be taken seriously.'' Mr. Matalon said Tri-Star had proved its independence by not handing a single one of its theaters over to Columbia's ''Ghostbusters.'' ''People said that there was no way 'The Natural' would keep its theaters when 'Ghostbusters' came out,'' Mr. Matalon said. ''They wouldn't believe that Tri-Star really does its own distribution.'' Columbia Is Paid a Fee Mr. Matalon added that Columbia is paid a fee to take care of what are called ''backroom functions'' - the invoicing and accounting and the physical moving of prints of a movie to theaters. However, the salesmen who book the theaters are Tri-Star employees, not Columbia employees, he said. Mr. Matalon dates the beginning of Tri-Star to May 1983 when the company's telephones were installed. Yet in 1985, he said the company expects to release 18 movies, as many as most major studios, and a whopping 24 movies in 1986. There are still a few hurdles. Psychologically, Tri-Star lost some luster when, instead of releasing the classy ''The Natural'' as its first movie, it picked up an exploitation movie dropped by another studio, ''Where the Boys Are,'' and released it a few weeks before ''The Natural'' to poor results commercially and critically. Mr. Matalon said that ''Where the Boys Are'' was used to test Tri-Star's distribution system. ''Would you take the risk of launching 'The Natural' without testing the system first?'' he asked. Box-office results alone will not make ''The Natural'' profitable, since the movie cost more than $25 million. A look at Tri-Star's schedule over the next several months shows that it is heavy with pickups of independently made movies - the kind of movies that studio executives describe as ''filler'' - including ''Meatballs II,'' and ''The Evil That Men Do,'' starring Charles Bronson. And the studio's movie for next Christmas is a big-budget film that Warner Bros. spurned, ''Supergirl.'' However, ''The Muppets Take Manhattan,'' the second movie financed by Tri-Star, has opened well at the box office and has gotten good reviews. And Tri-Star has a movie for next fall that looks promising - ''Places in the Heart,'' starring Sally Field and written and directed by Robert Benton, the writer-director of ''Kramer vs. Kramer.''

314-> IRAN PROFITS IN SHIP INSURANCE
A director of Iran's state-owned Bimeh Insurance Company asserted today that his country was making a profit on war insurance for ships prepared to risk Iraqi air attacks in the Persian Gulf, and was looking into ways of attracting more insurance business. The director, Hojjat Poustinchi, said that for the last two years Iran had offered war risk insurance at rates of 1 percent a week or less, compared with as much as 17 percent on the London insurance market. Premiums paid to the company for hull insurance have far outweighed the $25 million paid out in claims over the last two years, he said in an interview. Claims have mounted recently as Iraq has intensified its air attacks, Mr. Poustinchi said, with 40 percent of the $25 million total paid out in just the last two months. Most of the insurance covered cargo ships bound for Bandar Khomeini at the head of the gulf and little was laid out for tankers using Iran's main oil terminal at Kharg Island, the Bimeh executive said. He said this was because tankers using Kharg were heavily mortgaged and bankers would not agree to the Iranian arrangement. But he said the Government was studying ways to make the insurance more attractive. He would not give details except to say this would mean better conditions on the policies as a whole. ''We cannot understand why shippers go to the London market in spite of the high rates there when it would be more logical to come to Iran for insurance,'' Mr. Poustinchi said. In the last three years 30 ships sailing in convoy to Bandar Khomeini have been hit, many of them receiving only slight damage. Not all were insured by Iran.

315-> FASHION VIEW; UPDATE ON THE JAPANESE
IRENE DIAMANT, A THEATER DIRECTOR, BROWSED through a markdown rack of summer cottons by Yohji Yamamoto. She was in the Japanese designer's new 2,000- square-foot boutique in the recently opened Charivari shop at l8 West 57th Street. ''Japanese clothes are not for everyone,'' she said as she pulled out a voluminous white cotton dress. ''They're very comfortable, but I feel lost in them. I'm attracted to them because they're like works of art. But I'm not able to wear them.'' Next door, at Henri Bendel, the entire summer collection of Comme des Gar,cons by Rei Kawakubo was marked down 50 percent. There, in the small, quiet boutique on the third floor, Alicia Bilbruck was pulling out a white cotton skirt that was crinkled, pleated and folded with the Japanese trademark: one size fits all. ''This is a great skirt,'' she said, as she held it up against her Calvin Klein shirt and Ralph Lauren skirt. ''I've always liked the Japanese clothes. They're funky. They're always in good fabrics.'' As a Westchester housewife who has been buying Japanese clothes for the past two years at Barneys New York and at Bendel's, she finds their big selling point is comfort. ''I'm not wild about Japanese shoes, however,'' she says. ''They're so unattractive!'' Outside on 57th Street on this hot summer day, it was hard to find women wearing Japanese clothes, quite a change from last summer when New York streets were filled with them. Now, as summer sales clear the way for the new fall merchandise of the five major designers - Issey Miyake, Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Gar,cons, Yohji Yamamoto, Mitsuhiro Matsuda and Kansai Yamamoto - the question is, what has happened to Japanese clothes since last year's explosion? The answer is quite a lot. Says Geraldine Stutz, the president of Henri Bendel, says, ''Japanese designers have settled in. They've become part of the territory. They're no longer visiting strangers. The American designer Bill Blass offers a different viewpoint: ''I thought I would see more Japanese influence this summer. But it's not on the streets nor on my friends. I think there is a stagnant feeling about the Japanese clothes today. Unless they come up with something different, they're not going to be the big influence everyone had predicted.'' Selma Weiser, the founder of Charivari, however, is projecting sales of $1.5 million in Yohji Yamamoto's clothing. Bloomingdale's, the first American store to buy Issey Miyake in the early 1970's, backed the five Japanese designers in spring l983 with $600,000 worth of retail merchandise. This September, Bloomingdale's will launch a six-week, storewide promotion of Japan. ''It's a life-style promotion,'' says Kalman Ruttenstein, the store's vice president for fashion direction, ''concerned with how the Japanese people live, the computer revolution, the age of information. There's great emphasis on home furnishings. ''It's not a fashion promotion,'' he says, but acknowledges that Bloomingdale's has placed orders far in excess of $600,000. Then, too, Bergdorf Goodman is opening the first Issey Miyake boutique in the United States. ''We think Issey is the best,'' says Corinne Coombe, Bergdorf's senior vice president and general merchandise manager. ''He epitomizes Japanese fashion. He has stood up to the test of time. His fibers and fabrication are unique.'' Dianne Benson is another Issey pioneer and continues to buy from him, but in a much more limited way. ''In 1979 and through 1982, I was Issey's biggest customer,'' says Miss Benson. ''It was a good 35 percent of my stock. At retail, it amounted to about $400,000. Now Issey is turning his business in a new direction. He's aiming for a more sophisticated and commerical look, rather than being just an art piece. Frankly, my Issey business has not been too good. I found resistance from my customers when they had to pay $700 for an outfit with polyester. Also, the knits became too expensive. Some were as high as ,200. None of these things are bad, but they're just not for me.'' This fall, however, Miss Benson and her partner, Ralph Davies Lewis, will open a Comme des Gar,cons boutique on Geary Street in San Francisco. They already own a Comme des Gar,cons shop at ll6 Wooster Street in SoHo. Miss Benson thinks Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Gar,cons is to the younger generation what Sonia Rykiel is to the Bendel customer. When she opened in SoHo last fall, she went ''wildly'' beyond expectations. The spring and summer seasons, however, were very difficult. ''I bought too much of a collection I didn't believe in because I was still in awe of Rei,'' she admits. ''We did O.K., but certainly not brilliantly.'' Some insiders say it was a disaster. Homme, Kawakubo's men's line, sold well. But by the end of June, everything in the huge shop was marked down 50 percent. Gene Pressman, the executive vice president of Barneys New York, agrees that the Japanese men's clothing has been selling. ''Today,'' he says, ''we do about $750,000 retail in Japanese men's clothes, compared to $500,000 in the women's area. I feel the Japanese men's clothes are better than the women's. But their prices are still high. Their men's wear is more expensive than that from comparable American men's-wear designers. The three Japanese designers whose men's wear has been strong are Yohji Yamamoto, Matsuda and Pashu. We sell a lot of it in the women's shop, especially the shirts.'' Despite all of this, the question of whether the Japanese are still influential remains. Some observers point out that many of the Japanese characteristics - big oversize shapes, rubber shoes, rubber jewelry, the all-black look, single sizes, the wrapping and tying instead of buttons - have been adopted by other designers. ''The influence has been absorbed on such a wide scale that no one even realizes it comes from Japan,'' says Barbara Weiser, the co- owner of Charivari. ''The Japanese eye is more the eye of a sculptor. They have made the world so much more sophisticated. Their interest in fabrics with pattern and texture has had a tremendous influence.'' Joseph Ettedgui, the London retailer who owns several shops. including a new boutique for Yohji Yamamoto, says that ''the rush for Japan is over. I felt it in Tokyo this year. First, their prices are astronomically high. Second, theyre difficult to sell. They're like art - a combination of cut, color and fabric. Because of their high prices, the women who can afford them are more establishment dressers, not experimental ones.'' In New York, Ellin Saltzman, Saks Fifth Avenue's corporate fashion director, disagrees. ''I don't think the Japanese influence will fade,'' she says. ''But I do think there will be less press on it and that's not bad.'' Recently back from Tokyo, Mr. Ruttenstein of Bloomindale's reports that the younger Japanese designers are not into ''the shroud look, they're much more international. Right now, I think they're in a state of transition.'' Looking ahead, Charivari's Barbara Weiser thinks that people will be more interested in specific designers than in merely asking, ''What's new with the Japanese?'' The Japanese designers are now considered international creators, she says, and ''that's good for both of us.''

316-> WET SPRING YIELDS BIG MOSQUITO CROP
With the first hatch of mosquitoes already in the air, official mosquito watchers in the New York metropolitan area have taken to their boats, trucks and helicopters to combat what they fear will be the worst infestation of the insects in years. A mild winter and record spring rains and flooding caused the bumper crop of bugs, the experts say. Mosquitoes breed in the puddles and ponds left by the receding flood waters, and every time it rains the breeding cycle begins again. ''Right now, throughout the state, the mosquito population appears to be three to four times larger than what it was last year at this time,'' said Dr. Thomas Bast, chief entomologist for the New York State Department of Health. ''It's bad. It's very bad.'' ''This year it probably far exceeds the populations 10, 12 years ago,'' he said. ''In certain places, we're getting over 3,000 adult mosquitoes collected in a night where usually you get about 200.'' In New Jersey, John Kuschke, superintendent of the Morris County Mosquito Commission, said: ''There are some pretty hefty ones in my backyard. Several of them tried to carry me away. They're out there, and they're biting.'' One species of mosquito, Aedes vexans, thrives in flooded areas and is appearing in record numbers, Dr. Bast said. That species, he added, is particularly aggressive. ''Aedes vexans will chew on a rock if they get a chance,'' Dr. Bast said. ''They will even go after hubcaps.'' Not only are the mosquitoes a nuisance, they also pose a health risk as carriers of Eastern equine encephalitis, local and Federal health officials say. Most mosquito-control programs attack the insect during its larval stage, in stagnant water. They either drain swamps, stock them with fish that eat mosquito larvae or spray insecticides, light fuel oils, or bacteria that kill the larvae. Once the mosquitoes become adults and take wing, after as little as seven days, the workers begin spraying insecticides from trucks, helicopters and airplanes. The spraying usually takes place during the morning or evening hours, when the mosquitoes are flying. Many communities that were flooded by heavy spring rains have started their attacks on the insect population several weeks earlier than normal. Some have hired extra workers to combat the mosquitoes; others have tried new methods of killing them. Two counties in upstate New York, Oneida and Onondaga, increased their spraying efforts by truck and by airplane, Dr. Bast said. The village of Mamaroneck in Westchester County has been spraying since mid-May and has considered bringing in mosquito- eating dragonflies, according to Joseph P. Fraioli, the Village Manager. In Morris County, one of the areas hit hardest by spring flooding, Mr. Kuschke has been spraying by helicopter all week and plans to continue for several more. ''We had flooding in the upper reaches of the Passaic Valley, Lincoln Park and Wayne,'' Mr. Kuschke said. ''You probably have mosquito breeding in much of the area.'' New York City hired 10 extra workers, and last week, two weeks ahead of schedule, started spreading a bacterium called Bacillus thuringiensus israelensis, or BTI, which attacks mosquito larvae, according to Solomon Peeples, the director of operations at the city's Bureau of Pest Control. Special Permission Needed ''We realized that because of the rain we wouldz have a problem,'' Mr. Peeples said. ''Once we miss that larvae stage, there's nothing we can do.'' Two years ago, the State Health Department began requiring municipalities to get special permission to use insecticide on adult mosquitoes. According to scientists, the mosquitoes transmit equine encephalitis - also called sleeping sickness - between birds, the primary carriers, and other animals. The disease killed one New York State resident last year. The wet weather has also spurred the growth of other seasonal insects, including black flies and one variety of tick. Dr. Jorge Benach, a research scientist with the State Health Department at the State University at Stony Brook, said isolated reports indicated that the deer tick, or ixodes, was being found in greater numbers this year. Another tick common to the area, the dermacentor, or dog tick, which carries Rocky Mountain spotted fever, has shown no appreciable increase, Dr. Benach said. If the rainy season in the region finally comes to an end, and the National Weather Service says it should do so soon, the mosquito population will decline, Dr. Bast said. But if there is more rain - and there is a chance of showers Sunday and Monday - he warned, ''You will get a different species coming in which will make these numbers seem like child's play.'' How to Keep The Bugs Away There are no foolproof ways of keeping mosquitoes from biting, according to scientists. However, they recommend bathing often to prevent the buildup on the skin of lactic acid, which attracts mosquitoes. Some authorities suggest eating foods with garlic in them, because garlic seems to repel mosquitoes. The best chemical repellents, the scientists say, are those that contain DEET, or diethyl-meta-toluamide, which is found in most insect repellents sold without prescription in drugstores. They recommend that the repellents be sprayed on clothing as well on as exposed skin. When bitten, a person can alleviate itching by applying a cold compress or an ice cube; an alcohol- based solution like shaving lotion or rubbing alcohol; calamine lotion, or an anesthetic first-aid or sunburn spray. For severe reactions, an over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream is recommended.

317-> FRESH AIR CAMPERS LEARN THE SKIES
When were the first stars born?'' ''Do you know where the sun got its name?'' ''If the sun explodes, will anyone die?'' Their hands waving impatiently in the air, the girls fired off one question after another. Their hosts, Robert Rigalo and Charles Feldman, who were running a planetarium show, fielded each query with a smile, an explanation and the occasional tall tale. Although their friends had gone for a hike, the dozen or so girls who were campers in a Fresh Air Fund summer program, hardly felt they had been left behind. They were attending a private showing at the Hidden Valley campsite, which may be the only camp in the country with its own planetarium. ''At first, it's hard to get them to ask questions,'' said Mr. Feldman, who showed the girls a constellation shaped like the camp's dog, Freckles. ''But once they ask one, and they see that you're not going to laugh at them for it, it's hard to get them to stop.'' At Camps and Homes Some 2,500 New York City children are attending one of the four Fresh Air Fund camps this summer. The youngsters will hike through a wooded nature preserve, milk cows on a model farm and learn about the stars in the planetarium, which was willed to the fund by an engineer, Carl Gustafson. The fund, a nonprofit organization that depends on contributions, operates the camps, in Dutchess County, and also sends city children to live with families in the country. Contributions may be sent to the Fresh Air Fund, 70 West 40th Street, New York, N.Y. 10018. The planetarium show last week was the first ever for Dorakesha Davis, 12 years old, who traveled to the Fishkill campsite from the Bronx. She liked it so much that she asked to see another. The show, all about the sun, was ''exciting,'' Kesha said. ''They showed us a film,'' she said, ''and it was interesting and kind of funny. It was science and it was comedy, too. In school, we go to science, but there's no comedy.'' For Nadine Felder, also 12, the planetarium is the best part of camp. ''It teaches a lot,'' she said. ''What I like most is how the sun gives us light. I never knew that before.'' Setting a cedar-shingled planetarium by the side of a lake was the brainchild of ''Grandpa'' Larry Mikolic, who until his retirement last month was the associate executive director of the fund. ''A man came into our office one day,'' Mr. Mikolic recalled, ''and he wants to know who's in charge. He hands me this paper, which indicated that the Fresh Air Fund has been given $250,000 by a Mr. Gustafson.'' Puzzled by the identity of the donor, who had never before made a contribution, Mr. Mikolic called the executors of the Gustafson estate and asked them why he had chosen the fund. 'Not Paying a Thing' ''I was with him walking down the street,'' the executor told Mr. Mikolic, ''and we saw some kids getting onto some buses. 'What's this?' he asked the man with them. 'These kids are going to camp,' he was told, 'and it's free. They're not paying a thing.' '' ''He turned to me,'' the executor recalled, ''and said, 'Some day, I'm going to do something for this organization.'' With $145,000 of Mr. Gustafson's bequest, the fund built a memorial planetarium, which it operates in cooperation with the local school district. The rest of the money was put in the bank for replacement projectors, lenses and slides. Mr. Mikolic believes Mr. Gustafson, a successful engineer who grew up in poverty on the Lower East Side, would approve. ''I think we've touched a lot of kids'' since the planetarium opened in 1971, Mr. Mikolic said. ''Hopefully, we inspired them - not to be astronauts - but to understand the world a little better.''

319-> FILM VIEW; 'THE ALAMO' IS AN OFFBEAT AMERICAN BARROOM BALLAD
''Last Night at the Alamo,'' an 82-minute import from Texas, photographed on grainy, black- and-white film stock, is a small, unassuming, all-American classic. It's the kind of low- budget, regional movie that suddenly reminds us that, between New York and Hollywood, there's a vast, unruly, exuberant continent and filmmakers still capable of seeing and hearing what's going on in it. It's simultaneously funny and bleak, sweet and unsentimental. If I had to choose the one current film that most accurately reflects what a certain kind of American life is like today, this would be the film. That, I realize, is going out on a limb. ''Last Night at the Alamo'' has nothing to do with the so-called major issues of our time, but never for a minute does its total preoccupation with the small crises of its boozy, inarticulate characters deny the existence of those major issues. Like most of the people in this country, Cowboy and Claude, Ichabod and Mary, Lisa, Ginger, Janice, Skipper and Willie - who are the principal figures in ''Last Night at the Alamo'' - have other, seemingly more important things on their minds. The film, which was shown at last year's New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center and is just now going into commercial release, was written by Kim Henkel, whose only previous claim to fame is the screenplay for the notorious ''Texas Chainsaw Massacre,'' and directed by Eagle Pennell, whose ''Whole Shooting Match'' was one of the comic treasures of the 1979 New Directors/New Films Festival. ''Last Night at the Alamo'' is so good, in fact, that when I think about it I want to drop names, including those of Mark Twain, Sam Shepard and David Mamet, among others, people who have heard America singing and delighted in the delirious cacophony of missed notes and lyrical, often obscene non sequiturs. It's not by chance that the names of Mr. Shepard and Mr. Mamet come to mind. ''Last Night at the Alamo'' has as idiosyncratic a voice as the works of those two playwrights, the best of their generation in the American theater. If I hadn't seen ''The Whole Shooting Match,'' which was written as well as directed by Mr. Pennell, there would be a great temptation to credit this ''voice'' entirely to Mr. Henkel. However, since ''Last Night at the Alamo'' sounds very much like the earlier film, though it's far more precisely focused, one must assume that Mr. Pennell and Mr. Henkel are exceptionally responsive collaborators who are good for each other. In form, ''Last Night at the Alamo'' recalls that time in the American theater 40 years ago when the barroom was the world and the man behind the bar was, if not God, then His surrogate. Into this world would wander the the misfits, the down-and-outs, the con men, hookers and backsliding members of the bourgeoisie who, in the course of the evening, usually found some sort of absolution. A lot of terrible plays used this setting, but also some good ones, including William Saroyan's fairly whimsical ''Time of Your Life'' and the one that towers above all the others, Eugene O'Neill's monumental ''Iceman Cometh.'' Just what happened to this genre, I'm not sure. It may possibly be that playwrights decided that enough was enough, that the whole idea had become a bit tiresome, though, since playwrights, even good ones, are often reluctant to part with a cliche, the disappearance might be attributed to more natural causes, especially the changing function of the neighborhood bar in American life. Corner pubs are still the virtually private clubs for millions of Americans, but, with the introduction of television in the 1950's and now video games, it may be that the customers - at least, in the minds of playwrights - aren't experiencing the epiphanies they once did when the only competition was provided by the pool table or a juke box. It may also be, of course, that as our playwrights and stage designers discovered a more cinematic theatrical method, they were liberated from the restrictions of the one-set play, and moved away from the metaphorical barrooms into a metaphorical stage space that could be anywhere. As playwrights found new freedom in fluid stage design, it now seems - and I emphasize ''seems'' - that some of our filmmakers are finding their own kind of new freedom in the challenge offered by vastly restricted film spaces. It's just a coincidence, but two of the most interesting of the new releases are both essentially one-set movies. They are Ingmar Bergman's ''After the Rehearsal,'' which never moves from the stage where a rehearsal of Strindberg's ''Dream Play'' has just finished, and now ''Last Night at the Alamo,'' which is set entirely in and around a seedy Houston bar called The Alamo, which, on this night, is due to close forever, to be torn down by the ''Olshaw Demolishing Company (Texas's largest)'' to be replaced by a fancy new high-rise. The Alamo is not to be confused with Gilley's, the giant Houston beer palace that was the principal location for ''Urban Cowboy.'' The Alamo, you realize, has been slowly going broke for years and, as someone has said of the Barn, the real Houston bar that doubles for the Alamo in the film, ''If it has five people in it, it's a busy night.'' There are no epiphanies in ''Last Night at the Alamo,'' and Skipper (George Pheneger), the bartender, is nobody's idea of God. A slight, even-tempered man, Skipper simply serves the drinks and, with remarkable forbearance, requests that rowdy customers, on the verge of a major physical confrontation, please step outside if they want to do that sort of thing. As the film opens, the Alamo regulars are gathering to celebrate the bar's last night, which means drinking beer as usual and awaiting the appearance of Cowboy (Sonny Carl Davis), a favored Alamo regular who, it seems, may be able to save the place from ultimate destruction. As the Alamo customers talk about Cowboy, you begin to suspect that O'Neill's Hickey may be alive and well and living in Texas. Everybody speaks of Cowboy with awe, especially Ichabod (Steven Matilla), a hotheaded young man who wishes he had a ''neat'' nickname, like Cowboy, instead of Ichabod - his real name is William. Cowboy's major admirer is Claude (Louis Perryman), a man approaching unhappy middle age who spends much of his time arguing on the pay telephone with his wife, Marcie, a character who remains forever off screen tending to her over-applianced house, which has two separate telephones, with two separate listings, for their two children. When Cowboy finally appears, he turns out to be a good-looking, smooth-talking, over-the-hill high school hero who has, with immense satisfaction, just told off his construction boss and is, once more, out of a job. In the course of the evening, Cowboy's plan to save the Alamo comes to nothing - it has something to do with contacting a Texas legislator, with whom Cowboy roomed during his one and only year at college - and nobody's life is radically altered. The following night, it becomes apparent, the old Alamo gang will simply shift their base to another bar called the B & B. However, a lot of life has been revealed, often hilariously and sometimes with wonderfully discreet pathos. One can have nothing but admiration for the simplicity and ease with which Mr. Pennell, Mr. Henkel and their actors bring this ordinary moment of blue-color existence to vivid screen life. Mr. Davis and Mr. Perryman, who played quite similar characters in ''The Whole Shooting Match,'' are superb as Cowboy and Claude, whether acting with each other or with any of the other members of the remarkable cast. Mr. Matilla, a New York actor, is priceless as the easily overheated Ichabod, and Tina-Bess Hubbard, an exceptionally pretty young woman now teaching dance and acting in Munich, is very funny as Claude's pliant young girlfriend, Mary. Mary doesn't put her foot down often, but she does think that Claude shouldn't blame people for being fat, which leads to a serious discussion on whether someone with a beer belly can accurately be called fat. When finally at her wit's end with Ichabod's behavior, Mary is likely to scream, ''When you talk to me, keep that eye open. I don't want it twitching at me!'' The dialogue is so good that it doesn't sound as if anyone could have actually written it. Though mostly so vulgar and obscene that little of it can be quoted here, it has the ring of metareality. Abstract notions never enter the mind of anyone at the Alamo. Everyone is completely absorbed by things and events in the present tense. Near the end, after Claude has returned to the bar after an unsuccessful attempt to burn down his own house, he receives still another call from the furious Marcie. ''I guess I better be getting home,'' he tells the solicitous Cowboy. ''I ain't never going to hear the end of this.'' ''Last Night at the Alamo,'' which is American filmmaking of, I think, an exceptional order, was produced by Mr. Pennell and Mr. Henkel for $50,000, half of which was provided by the National Endowment for the Arts, and the rest by a group called the Southwest Alternate Media Project (affectionately known as ''SWAMP''), in the form of film equipment and office space. It was shot in three and one-half weeks. There's something extremely reassuring that the state that gave us the real Alamo, ''Dallas'' (the show, not the city) and all of those legendary oil fortunes, should also have given us this film, which is as small as Texas is big. Apparently some Houston boosters are not pleased with ''Last Night at the Alamo,'' which they feel makes the city look tacky. It does, though benignly. In the film's opening, very gray establishing shots, the city's great glass-and-steel high-rises are a vision of high-tech at its least humane and least functional. The characters in ''Last Night at the Alamo'' are people who live in buildings where it's still possible to open the windows. ''Last Night at the Alamo'' should give heart to a lot of filmmakers and, I hope, delight a large film audience.

320-> ROWING; ; Finn Captures 3d Gold in Single Sculling
A towering Finn, Pertti Karppinen, used a devastating closing sprint today to capture his third consecutive Olympic gold medal in the men's single sculling 2,000-meter race, matching a record of supremacy in Olympic rowing's glamour event first set 20 years ago. Karppinen's 2-second, come-from- behind victory over the five-time world champion, Peter-Michael Kolbe of West Germany, the man he trailed until the final 250 meters of the race, was expected. However, Canada's victory in the men's eight-oar shell with coxswain, with the onrushing American crew edged by 4-tenths of a second, was a major upset as well as Canada's first gold in that event. The 1-second victory by Brad Lewis and Paul Enquist of the United States in the double sculls, the first American gold medal in the event since 1932, was also a surprise. Over all, the United States captured five medals in the eight men's races, the highest total among the 14 countries who shared in the medal awards at Lake Casitas, before another capacity crowd of about 12,000. The competition, however, was sharply affected by the absence of East Germany, which won seven of the eight rowing gold medals at the Moscow Olympics in 1980. Karppinen and Kolbe, both 31 years old, had dueled many times before in world championships but only once, in 1976, in an Olympic final. That day, Kolbe blamed his second-place finish behind Karpinnen on medication he took before the race. Kolbe, who missed the Moscow Games because of the American-led boycott, came out of retirement a year ago and was hoping to even the score. ''It was a fantastic race,'' said Karppinen, a laconic fireman from Paisio, a town of 18,000 in central Finland, ''but it was the last stroke that decided the victor.'' He was referring to what the rowing world considers the sport's most powerful closing sprint, an unusually graceful stroke that lifts the shell out of the water with each thrust. Karppinen, who is married and has an 8-month-old son, is 6 feet 7 inches tall and weighs 210 pounds. Unlike most scullers, who vary their pace to reserve energy for a final push in the last 500 meters, Karppinen methodically increases his pace. He started today at 32 strokes a minute and closed in a flurry at 36 a minute. ''You cannot beat Karppinen coming from behind,'' Kolbe said. The two had not raced head to head since 1979, and their duel was expected to be a highlight for their countries during the Olympics. ''This was the best race I was capable of, and I still expected that he would reel me in at the end,'' said Kolbe. ''He is just too powerful now.'' Karppinen trained for the last year by rowing an average of 4 hours a day in morning and afternoon shifts, plus doing runs or cross-country skiing jaunts of 12 miles a day, according to his coach, Seppo Nuuttila. The rowing regimen alone burned up an average of 6,000 calories a day. Karppinen supplements what Nuuttila described as a varied and loosely- disciplined diet with vitamins and minerals. He trained outdoors in Italy and West Germany for three months last winter, and before that on a $3,500 adjustable-stroke rowing machine designed by a Norwegian physician. ''He trained this entire year as if it was going to be his last,'' Nuuttila said. There is, nevertheless, a physiological possibility that Karppinen could go for an unprecedented fourth consecutive Olympic victory in 1988. Vyacheslav Ivanov of the Soviet Union is the only other single sculls rower to win three consecutive Olympic gold medals, in 1956, 1960 and 1964. Canada's eight-man shell, which kept a lead that reached more than a length by the halfway point, came close to losing when it lost its rhythm seven strokes from the finish line. ''Another six strokes and the Americans would have caught us,'' said Mike Evans of the Canadian crew. The Canadians lept off the starting mark at an unusually fast 44 strokes a minute and settled back to 38 a minute by the halfway mark to build their lead. They covered nearly all of the last 500 meters at 42 a minute before ''going numb,'' Evans said. ''Our guys didn't know if they were going up the slide or putting the oars into the water,'' Evans said, recalling the crew's exhaustion near the end. ''The more and more pain you feel, the more your sense get knocked out. For us, it was an almost perfect race, the one we needed to win.''

321-> Town May Get Guru's Name
Residents of this tiny central Oregon town, which was taken over by the followers of the guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, will vote next month on a proposal to rename the community Rajneesh after him. The town council voted unanimously today for a referendum Sept. 18. Antelope has 80 residents who are followers of the guru and 15 who remain from the days when it was a small ranching community. The town's street names already have been changed to names with symbolic meaning to the Rajneeshees.

322-> 'TOWERS AND TRENCHES' MEET AT PRINCETON SUMMER SCHOOL
Alan Miller, a special-education teacher in Alaska, traded teaching for note-taking this summer to study the evolution of technology. He said he thought the course, part of a Princeton University program paid for by the National Endowment for the Humanities, would help him teach his students about technology. ''These kids have grandparents who are still steeped in ancient culture,'' said Mr. Miller, who teaches at West Anchorage High School. ''They are bumping their heads against forms of technology that two generations ago were unknown to their cultures. I'm hoping to pick up the pieces and provide them with a positive approach to technology.'' Mr. Miller is one of 100 teachers who attended seminars and lectures in the program to improve teachers. The teachers were from high schools and from colleges that lack large libraries or are in remote locations. More than 30 universities were in the program. 'The Towers and Trenches' ''Teachers see themselves in the trenches on the front line and perceive the university professors to be in the towers,'' said Peter Jurjevich, chairman of the English department at Colonia High School in Woodbridge Township. He participated in a study of early English literature. ''This is a way to bring the towers and trenches together,'' Mr. Jurjevich said. The areas of study included early English literature, the history of technology, Afro-American studies, linguistics and music. The classes and seminars, which started in late June and ended today, ran four to eight weeks. 'Makes You a Better Teacher' The participants were asked to complete lengthy reading assignments and were frequently required to work on research projects in the 3.5 million-volume library at the university. ''This is a chance to do things when we are not drowning in sophomore themes and committee work,'' said Dr. Philip O'Mara, a professor of English and humanities at Jackson State University in Mississippi. ''It's the kind of break from teaching that makes you a better teacher.'' ''The Princeton Library probably has more books in it than all the public and private libraries in the state of Mississippi,'' Dr. O'Mara said. The endowment paid stipends from $1,000 to $3,000 to the teachers and gave Princeton $583,000. ''These teachers are like a bunch of hungry sharks or hungry piranha fish,'' said Prof. Michael Mahoney, who led a seminar on the history of technology. ''Sometimes they take little bites, and sometimes they take big bites, but they are voracious.''

323-> NEWS SUMMARY;
Israel's opposition leader was asked to form a new government. Shimon Peres, the Labor Party's leader, received the mandate from President Chaim Herzog nearly two weeks after national elections that left both the Labor Party and Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud bloc without a parliamentary majority. (Page A1, Column 6.) An explosion in the Red Sea that severely damaged a Liberian-registered tanker, might have been caused by a mine. The tanker, the Olympic Energy, was sinking, according to unconfirmed reports that did not mention casualties. The explosion appeared to be the worst in a series in the key waterway that have damaged at least five other ships since Thursday. The State Department says a total of 15 ships have recently been involved in such incidents. (A1:2.) Peru appears stymied in its offensive against leftist guerrillas. President Fernando Belaunde Terry said he is pessimistic that the Peruvian Army will be able to make much headway against the guerrillas in the Andean highlands. Mr. Belaunde, who in 1980 became Peru's first elected civilian leader after 12 years of military rule, put the army in full control of the counterinsurgency campaign last month, because, he said, the guerrillas' violence had reached alarming proportions. (A1:5.) The first Olympic women's marathon was won by Joan Benoit, of Freeport, Me., who finished in 2 hours 24 minutes and 52 seconds, about 430 meters ahead of Grete Waitz of Norway, the world champion who had never before lost a marathon she had finished. The 26-mile, 385-yard course in Los Angeles was the first women's Olympic race longer than 1,500 meters. (A1:2.) Private sponsorship of the Olympics appears to have been successful, according to growing indications midway through the Games. (C11:1) President Reagan was urged to delay the shipment from France to Japan of 417 pounds of plutonium - enough for 30 nuclear bombs. Protests against the shipment came from 5 Senators and 10 Congressmen, all Democrats, in a letter to Mr. Reagan saying that ''the dangers posed by this shipment cannot be underestimated.'' The shipment is subject to United States approval because the plutonium originated in nuclear fuel from the United States. (A4:3.) Richard Burton, the actor, died of a stroke in a hospital in Geneva, Switzerland. He was 58 years old. (A1:5.) National Overscheduling of flights at airports is a fairly widespread problem, according to data from the Federal Aviation Administration. At Kennedy International Airport recently, 63 planes were scheduled to land in the hour beginning at 3:45 P.M., but the most the airport could handle, even with clear weather, was 44. Overscheduling has contributed to a sharp rise in flight delays and is responsible for growing criticism from Federal officials and consumer groups. (A1:3.) The budget deficits could not be cut significantly by President Reagan or Walter F. Mondale leading economic forecasters said. In a comparison of both candidates' statements with underlying trends in the economy and political attitudes in Congress, the economists predict that annual Federal deficits would remain at the stubbornly high $200 billion level through the 1980's. (A1:1.) Drastic ecological changes along the coast from northern Maine to Cape Cod are feared by some scientists if Nova Scotia builds a huge plant to generate power from the tides in the Bay of Fundy. Studies indicate the plant may increase the tides by one foot, or 10 percent. (A10:2.) Rebellious prisoners in Virginia released their hostages under threat of a state police assault if they failed to meet a 7 A.M. deadline. The prisoners at the maximum security Mecklenburg Correctional Center near the North Carolina state line released the last of nine members of the prison staff just before sunrise. (A10:2.) Metropolitan Home sharing by elderly people is a growing practice in the New York metropolitan area and elsewhere in the nation to save money, gain companionship and avoid going to a nursing home. ''Home sharing has gone on informally for a long time,'' said a specialist in housing problems of the elderly. ''What we see now is a formalization of the process by community groups, church groups and social service agencies.'' (B1:4.) Screening of day-care employees is being reviewed following charges of sexual abuse of children at a Bronx day-care center, one of 385 such publicly financed and privately operated centers in New York City. Privacy laws now limit the extent of criminal- background checks on day-care center employees. Current practices require applicants to meet only some state educational requirements and to particpate in job interviews, officials said. (B3:1.) New York utility companies would be prohibited from charging customers for the charitable donations the utilities make if a suit against the Public Service Commission, which permits the practice, is successful. The suit was prepared by the New York Civil Liberties Union on behalf of an upstate utility customer, contending that his First Amendment rights had been violated. (B5:3.) Page D1

324-> THE ENVIRONMENT
SEVERAL hours after protestors from Greenpeace U.S.A. scaled the 160-foot- high water tank at the Ciba- Geigy Corporation's chemical plant in Toms River, three investigators from the State Department of Environmental Protection's Bureau of Field Operations arrived at the security gate for an unannounced inspection of the company's landfills. The ascent of the protestors, Samuel Sprunt, 26 years old, and Beverly Baker, 23, both of Boston, was well covered in the press (both were charged with criminal trespass by the Dover Township police after they descended three days later, on July 1), but what was happening below was never reported. There are three dumps or landfills on the 1,240-acre plant site in Ocean County: two are abandoned hazardous chemical waste dumps totaling about 14 acres; the third is a still-functioning landfill of about two acres. The first two dumps, covered with plastic tarpaulins, have contaminated the ground water beneath the porous, sandy soils along the northern fringes of the Pine Barrens. This led to Ciba-Geigy's being put on the Federal Superfund's priority dump-site list a year ago. William Bobsein, manager of environmental technology for the company, said in a recent interview that the functioning landfill had been used to dispose of the solids produced after the company ran the residues from its making of epoxy resins through its huge waste water treatment plant. (The watery remnants of this process - also used in treating the company's dye wastes and industrial waste waters from outside corporations - go through Ciba- Geigy's 10-mile-long pipeline. It traverses Barnegat Bay and ends 2,500 feet out in the Atlantic, off Ortley Beach.) The D.E.P. investigators who showed up unannounced were kept waiting for an hour and a half although a visitor who arrived before them was issued a security pass within a half hour and was immediately escorted to the executive offices by the chief of security. ''These people from the D.E.P. used to show up just every once in awhile,'' the security chief said, ''but lately they're here at least once a week.'' The tower was scaled and the investigators showed up on a Monday morning, the day after the New Jersey weekly reported that Ciba-Geigy was under investigation by both the D.E.P. and the Division of Criminal Justice. The division, it was reported, also was investigating the environmental agency's handling of violations and monitoring of the company as a polluter. The D.E.P.'s stepped-up monitoring was at least partly a result of a pipeline rupture last April. Hazardous wastes were spewed into the ground in a Toms River neighborhood and, although immediate well contamination was not evident, the company must monitor the spill site for several years to assure that the waste does not seep into the water supplies of 14 homes nearby. The rupture brought the company's government regulation into public view. Its pipeline discharges into the ocean, once regulated by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, came under the jurisdiction of the State Environmental Agency just last year. It was said by protestors that there were few legal limitations under the Federal Clean Water Act for much of what ends up in the ocean. The pipeline was laid in 1966, four to six years before the nation's first major environmental protection statutes were enacted. The scene at Ciba-Geigy security house pointed out how difficult it could be for government regulators to get into a chemical plant. The investigators' superior, Ronald T. Corcory, said later in a telephone interview that it was unlikely that the delay had been meant to cover up wrongdoing. ''The alternatives to waiting there,'' said Mr. Corcory, ''were to leave and come back again or to get an administrative search warrant, either of which would have taken more time.'' He added that there had been no adverse ''pattern'' in Ciba-Geigy's availability to investigators and that this one event had been of little concern because ''they couldn't cover up what we were looking for and it wouldn't have affected our testing.'' Plant officials have been less than candid about what is in their pipeline discharges. During two days of interviews, John Harvey, a company spokesman; Cyrus Moffett, director of administrative services for the plant, and Mr. Bobsein, declined to say exactly what was discharged from the pipe. Mr. Harvey did say, however, that there had been five substances on the E.P.A.'s list of 129 priority pollutants found ''in the hundredths-parts-per-million range.'' Whether these included the nitrobenzene, lead, mercury, chromium, zinc and chlorinated hydrocarbons that the company has admitted in the past to discharging, was unclear. However, as Mr. Moffett said, the D.E.P. has been reviewing the pollution permit issued by the E.P.A. in 1977 and reissued with little review in 1980, and there probably will be a public hearing to discuss these matters. Despite the controversy over discharge regulation, Mr. Harvey said there was ''no method available to test for every chemical that may be in our ocean effluents.'' According to Mr. Harvey, Ciba-Geigy plans to break ground next spring for another large facility in Toms River that will accommodate the transfer of its pharmaceutical divisions active-ingredients operation, now based in Rhode Island. Meanwhile, whether the new permit that the D.E.P. will issue under its Pollutant Discharge Elimination System is more stringent than the E.P.A.'s old one will be judged at the hearing, or when the permit is finally issued in September. With their departure, the 15 Greenpeace volunteers left behind the Ocean County Citizens for Clean Water, a local group that promised to pick up - perhaps in a less spectacular way - where the demonstrators left off.

325-> SOCIAL SECURITY IS PART OF THE DEFICIT, FOR NOW
To the Editor: Toward the end of the Reagan-Mondale debate on Oct. 7, within the context of exchanges on the deficit and Social Security, President Reagan stated, in essence, that Social Security is not a part of the deficit. He drew the distinction between Social Security, as a trust fund, and the general fund. That distinction has always been true; unfortunately, what he said about the impact on the budget deficit is not true. Before the 1970's, the vehicle for communicating budget surplus or deficit was the so-called administrative budget. All trust funds were reported as a separate entity, with no effect on what was generally accepted as the budget surplus or deficit. Thereafter, however, as a result of recommendations of a bipartisan budget commission, the several Social Security trust funds and virtually all other trust funds held by the Government were brought directly into the budgets, notwithstanding the legal and bookkeeping distinctions between trust funds and general fund. Since then, what comes to the Treasury for Social Security serves to reduce the deficit, and what is paid out increases the deficit, notwithstanding the President's remark that Social Security has nothing to do with balancing a budget or increasing or lowering the deficit. More recently, some members of the bipartisan Social Security Commission argued for going back to the budget concept prevailing before the 1970's (presumably, in the hope that Social Security would thus be removed from the political vicissitudes of existing large budget deficits). But they did not prevail. SIDNEY SOKOL New York, Oct. 8, 1984 The writer is a former Treasury Department official, whose responsibilities included reporting the Government's budget results.

326-> V.F.W. ELECTS FIRST VIETNAM VETERAN
It was a package of nourishment from home that his Marine Corps unit in Da Nang received in 1967 that led Billy Ray Cameron to the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Today, on the last day of a weeklong convention held here, he was elected commander in chief of the 85-year-old veterans' organization. Mr. Cameron, who is from Sanford, N.C., is the first veteran from the Vietnam era to hold that position. His election was the first highlight of a day that concluded with an address by President Reagan. People who had begun lining up two hours before the President's appearance greeted Mr. Reagan with cheers of ''Four more years!'' For Mr. Cameron, who introduced the President and pledged the organization's ''undivided loyalty to this great nation,'' it all began 17 years ago in Vietnam, where he was known as ''Pops,'' because, at the age of 23, he was the old man in the unit. A Package From Strangers Newspapers from home carried accounts of antiwar protests and morale among the troops was low, he recalled. But one day a package arrived from strangers, a ladies' auxiliary of the Veterans of Foreign Wars from someplace in Illinois. Along with the canned goods and candies in the package, he recalled in an interview, were 18 letters ''telling us how much they appreciated us, supported us and loved us.'' ''That day,'' Mr. Cameron said, ''12 of us committed ourselves to joining the V.F.W. when we got back home.'' This morning, as he assumed office, he told the veterans, ''I want you to know at the outset that I do not intend to let anyone, in or out of Government, degrade the Vietnam veteran and the honorable service he provided in the name of his Government.'' Three Issues of Concern Mr. Cameron, who is married and the father of two children, has taken a leave of absence from his job as coordinator of the Sanford-Lee County Office of Civil Preparedness. He will use his year as commander in chief, he said, to focus on three issues: ''peace through strength,'' a posture that coincides with Mr. Reagan's stance; medical care for veterans, including Vietnam veterans who were exposed to the defoliant Agent Orange, and an accounting of soldiers still listed as missing in Southeast Asia. Mr. Cameron wears a bracelet that bears the name of one of those men, Sgt. W. Darrell Johnson of Rocky Mount, N.C., who has been missing since Jan. 19, 1968. As for medical benefits, Mr. Cameron said: ''We all understand that there is a big deficit in the Federal budget. We understand that there's got to be cutbacks, but we want to be sure that the Veterans Administration hospitals are funded at a level that will take care of all the veterans.'' Noting that the average age of World War II veterans was 63.5, he said, ''It only takes common sense to realize there will be more and more asking for assistance.'' Reminder of Soviet Threat On Thursday, John O. Marsh Jr., Secretary of the Army, spoke to his fellow V.F.W. members of a threat posed by the Soviet Union. ''What really is at stake,'' he said, ''is not just Soviet military power - a threat we cannot ignore. Rather, it is the ultimate resolution of key social and political issues. The conflict we are in, but did not choose, is a challenge of ideas and contrasting values.'' The Veterans of Foreign Wars has two million members in the United States and abroad. In many communities, the V.F.W. post is a major social center, but Clifford G. Olson Jr., the retiring commander in chief, said there was more to the organization than that. ''The old concept of a veterans' club being a place where you just go drink and party and carouse, put a cap on your head and tell war stories, that's gone,'' he said. Conflict With Another Group The organization, with about 575,000 Vietnam veterans, has been in conflict with the Vietnam Veterans of America, which has been seeking a Federal charter from Congress designating it as a bona fide veterans' organization. Mr. Olson has written to Congress condemning the 17,000-member V.V.A. for its direct dealings with the Governments of Vietnam and Cambodia in an attempt to obtain an accounting of 2,483 American soldiers listed as missing after the war. The United States has no formal diplomatic ties to Vietnam. Mr. Cameron, who agrees with his predecessor, said, ''We don't deal with any country our Government doesn't have diplomatic relations with.'' He condemns leaders of the Vietnam Veterans of America but praises its members, some of whom, he said, are his friends. ''They do a lot of good community service work,'' Mr. Cameron said. ''I wish them the best.'' He said he expected to work with the group for common legislative objectives.

Bridge: No-Trump Lightner Double Offers 2 Schools of Thought Once upon a time life was simple. Doubles were either for take-out or for penalties, and that was that. But the late Theodore Lightner began a trend toward mystery doubles. If out of a clear blue sky you doubled a contract that your opponents clearly expected to make, you must be attempting to suggest a lead to partner. The suggestion often relates to dummy's suit. The double becomes even more mysterious when no suits have been bid at all. The commonest such case is the one shown in the diagram, and there is no general agreement. Since West will tend to lead a major suit after such bidding, one group holds that the double should call for a minor suit, clubs or diamonds according to one's agreement. Another group uses the double to carry this message: ''I have a long, strong major suit. If you will lead your shorter major, you will probably be right.'' Example From Grand National The short-major school of thought triumphed on the diagramed deal, from the 1984 Grand National Team zonal playoff in Port Chester, N.Y. The Westchester County team that eventually won the event bid briskly to three no-trump as shown. The East player for New York, Ron Rubin, doubled, and his partner, Michael Becker, duly led the heart ten. The defense therefore took the first five tricks, and Rubin exited with a spade. The best South could do was to win in his hand and develop clubs, losing 300. In the replay, North became the declarer and was much better off, since he was protected against a damaging heart lead. When the heart queen was led, he was able to score his king. Rightly or wrongly, West dropped the ten. North could now see a road to eight tricks, and was close to making nine. He finessed the club queen successfully and cashed the ace. Then he came to the spade ace and finessed the diamond jack. When this also succeeded, the ending was this: NORTH S 4 H 6 3 D Q 6 C J 7 6 WEST S 10 9 7 6 H 8 D 9 8 4 C - EAST S J H A J 9 7 D K 10 C K SOUTH S K Q 5 H 5 4 D A 3 C 2 The top spades were cashed, and an end play against East was in prospect: he had to keep the club king and the guarded diamond king. East was Larry Cohen, whose team won the playoff, and he defended brilliantly by throwing a high heart and saving the seven. When he was then given the lead in clubs, he was able to lead the heart seven to his partner's eight and frustrate the end play. This fine defensive effort cut a potential gain of 12 international match points for New York to 6.

329-> Canadians Top Czechs To Gain Semifinal Berth
Canada, led by Mike Bossy, Brent Sutter and John Tonelli, scored four first-period goals tonight to defeat Czechoslovakia, 7-2, and gain a berth in the Canada Cup semifinal. The victory improved Canada's record to 2-1-1, and eliminated disappointing Czechoslovakia, now 0-3-1. Rick Middleton, Mark Messier, Michel Goulet, Peter Stastny and Paul Coffey also scored for Canada. In the second game, Sweden remained in contention for a semifinal berth with a 4-2 victory over West Germany.

330-> POSTINGS; BRONX OFFICES
At long last, Fordham Plaza, the mixed-use office and retail complex, planned more than a decade ago for a 5.5-acre urban renewal site on Fordham Road in the Bronx, appears to be a reality. On Tuesday Mayor Koch will put shovel to earth at Third Avenue and Fordham Road, symbolizing the start of construction at the $60 million private and public development project. Chase Enterprises of Hartford, Reynolds Construction Company and Eli Zborowski are the private developers for the mixed-use building, which will include 350,000 square feet of office space, about 50,000 square feet of retail space and a parking garage for 500 vehicles. Some $26 million for the project will come through city, state and Federal grants and loans with the balance of financing coming from the private developers. According to Borough President Stanley Simon of the Bronx, who was instrumental in seeing the project through, Fordham Plaza is the first major office building to be constructed in the Bronx since World War II. The building, designed by the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, will be a 22-story structure of light brick with black glazed accents. The main entrance will sit under a circular tower which links the office floors to the two-story green marble base.

332-> THEATER IN REVIEW; A MISCONCIEVED 'MERCHANT OF VENICE'
SHAKESPEARE wrote all sorts of ''problem plays'' - works that don't necessarily deal with problems but that create them, for audiences, actors and directors. ''The Merchant of Venice'' is one of the most familiar and most problematical. To this observer, the New Jersey Shakespeare Festival's staging at Drew University magnifies the severity of those problems and diminishes the play's virtues, so one must labor to seek redemption. Ultimately, it's a labor lost. With four unsuccessfully interwoven plots, with its themes of venal vengefulness, real ardor and real friendship, contrasted by the pitting of Christians against Jews, the play demands a director of consummate resourceful or stunning conceit to bring it off. Ever shifting gears, ''Merchant'' is as somber as an Inquisition scene one moment and as airy as a Mozart comic opera the next; indeed, the play's coda, involving a deliberate deceit by wives against husbands, is found in another variation in the libretto of Mozart's ''Cosi Fan Tutte.'' Epitomizing the play's problems, the fearsome Jew Shylock is dependent on the performer for illumination, if not outright justification. Although he's only visible in one-fifth of the play, he remains a force throughout and can be played any which way - as a mercenary, merciless stereotype or a heart-rending victim of oppression, a figure of tragedy and dignity. Those who see Shylock strictly as the anti-Semitic stereotype are denying the role's historic appeal for great actors of the Yiddish stage, among them Jacob Adler, Rudolph Schildkraut and Maurice Schwartz. Morris Carnovsky gave a sympathetic and multileveled performance. The role goes on resonating in the repertory of great actors, from Sir Laurence Olivier's urbane, slick interpretation in a television version almost a decade ago, to Sir Alec Guinness's currently praised performance in Chichester, England. In Madison, Cal Winn is an unspeakable Shylock who abandons his high-pitched, squeaky dialect whenever he's supposed to be infuriated. The character exists on the sole dimension of sheer loathsomeness, winding up a crazed, sneering Shylock who could give Iago a run for his money, but only on the most obvious level. By contrast, Portia's radiant beauty, mercurial intelligence and devilish wit could be a tonic, although she, too, is a paradox, as cunning as she is merciful. Lisa Bansavage is declamatory and dull. In the famous trial scene, the actress comes on bearded, a notion both ludicrous and lamentable. As her ''waiting gentlewoman,'' Nerissa, Katherine Carlson gives the sort of primping, petulant, posturing performance that gives ingenues and Shakespeare bad names. One could condone it in the context of Off Off Broadway's The Ridiculous Theatrical Company. The director, Paul Barry, employs the madrigal singers to good advantage, framing the scene where the casket, for Portia's hand, is chosen and, at another point, placing them outside the theater. However, his direction is choppy and utterly lacking in concept or cohesion. Ronald Martell's mercurial and charming interpretation of Bassanio, Portia's passionate husband, is the graceful savior of a misbegotten production that would have been better left unseen, unspoken and unsullied. ''The Merchant of Venice'' is being performed in rotating repertory with ''Othello'' and Sheridan's ''School for Scandal.'' ''Merchant'' closes on Sept. 16.

333-> Twain Book Not Required
School officials have removed ''The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' from a required reading list after an alderman complained the book was offensive to blacks. Alderman Robert Evans Sr. had threatened a lawsuit or student boycott if Mark Twain's novel about a boy and a runaway slave was not taken off the list. The decision to drop the book came Wednesday at a meeting between a school board committee and Mr. Evans, who objected to the book's use of the word ''nigger.''

334-> CHESS TITLE GAME DRAWN IN MOSCOW
Anatoly Karpov, the 33-year-old world chess champion, and his challenger, 21-year-old Gary Kasparov, agreed to a draw after 44 moves of the fourth game of their title match in Moscow yesterday. The champion leads in the series, 1-0, but this is a long way from the six victories needed for him to retain his title. Draws, as in this and the first two games, do not count in the scoring. When play began Friday in the House of Trade Unions, Karpov again used the Queen's Indian Defense, as he had in the second encounter, but this time he carefully adopted the sophisticated maneuver 4 . . . B-R3; 5 PN3, B-N5ch; 6 B-Q2, B-K2. One theoretical point was that the black king bishop was developed normally, whereas the white queen bishop was somewhat in the way at Q2. Thus, the dangerous Pomar Gambit, arising from 4 . . . B-N2; 5 B-N2, B-K2; 6 O-O, O-O; 7 P-Q5!?, PxP; 8 N-R4, was circumvented this time. Difficulties for White Karpov's efficient development with 13 . . . Q-B1 (better than 13 . . . RB1 which is always vulnerable to 14 B-R3), 14 . . . R-Q1 and 16 . . . Q-K3 made it difficult for White to obtain any initiative. The exchange with 20 PxP, PxP gave Black hanging pawns at his QB4 and Q4, but, coupled with his active piece placement, they were no liability here. The point of Kasparov's sacrifice with 21 N-K5!? was that after 21 . . . BxN; 22 PxB, a second capture, with 22 . . . QxP, could be answered by 23 RxQP!, RxR; 24 BxN, R/1-Q1; 25 BxR, RxB, with a slight edge for White. An attempt by Black to win material with 23 . . . P-N4? would have been sharply rebuffed by 24 BxN, PxKB; 25 RxR, QxR (or 25 . . . RxR; 26 BxP, RQ4; 27 N-N4!); 26 B-K3, which leaves the black position a mass of weak pawns, for example, 26 . . . Q-Q4?; 27 N-N4!, Q-K3 (or 27 . . . B-K2?; 28 BxBP!); 28 QxP! wins material. Pawn Sacrifice Justified The challenger's second pawn sacrifice, 24 N-B6!?, NxN; 25 PxN, QxBP, was perfectly justified by his 26 B-N5, which insured the gain of the black QP. In the position at which play broke off Friday night with Karpov sealing his 41st move in the referee's official envelope, Kasparov's bishop was more actively placed than its black counterpart, giving him some chance to molest the black king, and the split black queenside pawns required Karpov's watchful tending. Nevertheless, the bishops-of-opposite-color militated against White's developing real winning prospects. After play was resumed yesterday with the referee exposing Karpov's 41 . . . Q-K4 on the board, Kasparov took seven minutes in the fruitless attempt to press for a victory. However, Karpov quickly got rid of one weakness with 42 . . . P-R5; 43 PxP, RxP. After Kasparov observed that 45 RxB!?, KxR; 46 R-B7ch, K-R1; 47 QR6, R-N7ch; 48 K-B1, R-N8ch; 49 K-N2 leads to perpetual check, he offered a draw and Karpov accepted. The fifth game will be played tomorrow.

335-> THE WORLD ; Israel's LaborGets a Chance
Israel last week concentrated on grave domestic concerns. President Chaim Herzog, citing economic problems ''that may well be the most dangerous and difficult this state has ever known,'' asked Shimon Peres, a fellow Labor Party member, to try to form a government. Under the rules, Mr. Peres has five weeks left to do so but his prospects are uncertain. Labor won 44 seats and came in first in last month's elections, far short of a majority in the 120-seat Parliament. Mr. Peres pledged ''a supreme effort to rise above the differences of opinion'' that splintered the new Knesset into 15 parties, most of them small. He met privately with Yitzhak Shamir, leader of the other large party, Likud, and now the caretaker Prime Minister. Likud, with 41 seats, was a close second. All three leaders say a national unity coalition is needed. But Mr. Shamir was publicly skeptical about Mr. Peres's chances, predicting Labor could not retain the support in a unity grouping of left-wing Mapam members who hold six of the Labor Alignment's seats. Naftalie Feder of Mapam said he was not worried about that problem because ''too many conflicts'' would keep Labor and Likud from getting together. Sharpening one point of conflict, the Defense Ministry authorized Jewish settlers to move their house trailers to a new spot near the West Bank town of Hebron. Labor wants to put a freeze on additional settlements in the territory taken from Jordan in 1967 and to locate them at a distance from Arab communities. But Ariel Sharon, a Shamir Cabinet member, insisted that settlements should be established all over the West Bank. The Shamir Government also said it would begin cutting Government spending to try to bring down the 400 percent inflation rate. But Mr. Sharon said Likud was not ready to start by cutting the money for the new settlements.

336-> In Fighting Trim
Bruce Mays's article ''In Fighting Trim'' (About Men, Sept. 2) perpetuates the myth of aggressiveness, competitiveness and arrogance. I, too, grew up in the world Mr. Mays speaks about. Fortunately, I was able to transcend the myth and realize the importance of living in ''the best of all possible worlds''; a nonviolent nonsexist world. Even if this world view is not yet shared by a majority of the people. It is time we laid this myth to rest and started raising a generation of males less reluctant to share this world view and, therefore, not needing to test their prowess at being the best, having the most, or being the smartest. These ''new boys,'' future ''new men,'' might be less likely to start a fight or a war, less likely to kill another person for a pair of sunglasses, or worry about ''taking him.'' And, when finally adults, they, hopefully, will give their peers equal treatment regardless of sex. I would like to hear Mrs. Mays's ideas on child rearing. Until her ideas are heard, and implemented, the ''dog-pack, Wild West show'' threatens us all. Until that time, we force ourselves to live a world with ''high-sticking ways.'' STEWART D. GROSSMAN Staten Island, N.Y. -

337-> THE CITY;
Two court officers arrested a Bronx man after he threw a brick of cocaine worth an estimated $15,000 into a sewer during a chase in lower Manhattan yesterday, a spokesman for the officers' union said. The incident began at about 10:30 A.M. when Dominick Whittaker, 32 years old, of the Bronx, and Kim Brown, 16, of Teaneck, N.J., came for unknown reasons to Manhattan Criminal Court at 100 Centre Street, officials said. Court officers conducting a spot check for contraband found 13 vials of cocaine, $35,000 in cash and six live rounds from a small-caliber handgun in the teen-ager's pocketbook, according to Abraham Bernstein, a spokesman for the Court Officer's Association. She was arrested on cocaine possession charges, he said. Her companion, Mr. Whittaker, was arrested after taking something from his car and throwing it into a sewer during the course of a chase by court officers, officials said. Fire Department officials helped the officers recover from the sewer a package containing a block of uncut cocaine wrapped in white paper, Mr. Bernstein said. Mr. Whittaker was arrested on charges of possession of cocaine and resisting arrest, Mr. Bernstein said.

338-> THE REPUBLICANS
Thank you for Richard Reeves's refreshing and provocative article, ''The Republicans'' (Sept. 9). Senator Robert Dole of Kansas probably epitomizes what afflicts our Government when he comments: ''We're going back to the real world now - it's called Washington.'' The real world is not Washington - it's all the locales of America - the cities, farms, towns, highways, etc. Any politician who confuses Washington with real-world America has already lost touch with reality.

339-> QUESTION BOX
QUESTION: What is the name and origin of the Olympic melody played so frequently on telecasts of the Winter and Summer Games? The piece is called ''Bugler's Dream'' and it is from ''Charge!'' an original suite composed in 1959 by Leo Arnaud, a Frenchman who is a former arranger and composer for the late Fred Waring. The version that has been used by ABC Sports since the 1964 Summer Games in Tokyo is conducted by Felix Slatkin and is available on Angel Records. QUESTION: How many total points and rebounds did Elvin Hayes finish his pro basketball career with, and in which career categories did he wind up first? Hayes missed only nine games in a 16-year career in the National Basketball Association that he completed last spring with 27,313 points (21.0 average), 16,279 rebounds and 1,771 blocked shots in regular-season games. That placed him third in all three categories. Hayes leads in games played (1,303), field-goal attempts (24,072) and personal fouls (4,193). QUESTION: When Dave Kingman of Oakland hit a ball into the ceiling of the Metrodome in Minneapolis this spring and it failed to come down, the umpires gave him a ground-rule double. Is the ball still up there, and if so, what if another ball dislodges it during a game? Which ball will be in play? No need to worry. On May 5, the day after Kingman's double, stadium workmen were able to retrieve the ball and it has gone on to the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., where it will be displayed for the first time next weekend in the room showcasing 1984 events. QUESTION: In the year that Joe DiMaggio hit safely in 56 consecutive games, in how many games did he fail to get a hit that season? Does he hold the record for number of games hitting safely in a season as well as the one for consecutive games hitting safely? When DiMaggio's streak was stopped in the 57th game, he followed with a 16-game hitting streak, meaning that he hit safely in 72 of 73 games during one stretch of the 1941 season. Injuries, though, kept him out of 17 games and he finished the season with at least one hit in 114 of the 139 games he played. He batted .357 with 193 hits, and never went more than three games without a hit. The American League record for hitting safely in a season is held by Al Simmons of the Philadelphia Athletics, 133 in 153 games in 1925, when he had 253 hits and batted .384. The National League mark belongs to Chuck Klein of the Philadelphia Phillies, who hit safely in 135 of 156 games in 1930, getting 250 hits and batting .386. QUESTION: With runners on second and third, two out and two strikes on the batter, a pitch is delivered that the batter swings at and misses. In doing so, though, his bat strikes the catcher's mitt. That makes the catcher miss the ball and he has to scramble after it. The umpire awards the batter first base on catcher's interference, but the catcher thinks the batter is running to first because of a missed third strike by the catcher. If the catcher throws the ball wildly to first in a mistaken attempt to retire the batter, can the runners score? When an umpire clearly calls interference by the catcher, the ball is dead and the runners must remain on base unless there is a play in progress or the ball is hit by the batter. In that case, the manager of the team batting may elect to take the play rather than the automatic first base for his batter. In this case, since the batter did not hit the ball and the runners were not moving on the pitch, no runs will score and the bases will be loaded. QUESTION: Was the term ''Ivy League'' derived from the Roman nu meral IV or from the plant ivy? The expression is credited to Caswell Adams, a sports reporter for the defunct New York Herald Tribune, who first used it in a story in 1937 to refer to that group of colleges in the Northeast where academic tradition, as represented by the ivy on the buildings, meant more than sports. The eight universities in that category are Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Pennsylania, Princeton and Yale. QUESTION: When did the Hall of Fame and Holiday bowl games begin in college football and who were the winners of the first games? In the first Hall of Fame Clasic, held Dec. 22, 1977 in Birmingham, Ala., Maryland defeated Minnesota, 17-7. In the first Holiday Bowl, exactly a year later on Dec. 22, 1978 in San Diego, Navy defeated Brigham Young, 23-16. Question Box is a regular feature of Sports Monday.

340-> A Middling 98th To President Reagan, the 98th Congress was a disaster. It wouldn't do anything he wanted. In fact, with some notable exceptions, it did just what he wanted - that is, not much of anything.
This Congress can boast of just two major bipartisan achievements: the rescue of the Social Security System last year and the election-year vote to raise taxes somewhat in the session just ended. Even these brave efforts barely dented the central problem: the massive Federal deficits. The Government is headed still deeper into debt, passing the costs of today's economic recovery to future generations. And the leader in devising that strategy is the President, not Congress. Despite the Democrats' gains in the 1982 mid- term election, which again gave them firm control of the House, the 98th Congress generally approved only what Mr. Reagan proposed. It failed to press for what he opposed. The President has little use for Federal activism, so he didn't push for much. Major issues that cry for attention died from neglect - immigration reform, clean air, clean water, waste disposal. The tangled final days of the session exposed some of the frustration caused by this neglect; legislators schemed to attach important bills, like civil rights, to the omnibus appropriations bill. All those amendments should have been dealt with earlier. The President was frustrated on less critical matters like school prayer, a private-school tuition credit, the empty balanced budget amendment. He yielded a bit on military spending. He still lacks a mandate for the MX missile and funds for the interventions in Central America. A Congress dominated by Reagan Republicans might have rubber- stamped these measures, but in the 98th, even the Republican-controlled Senate demurred. The Social Security reform, early in 1983, was a masterful compromise between the President and legislators of both parties. No one wanted to be blamed for the pain of cutting back but all knew it had to be done. So they agonized together and did it. New taxes were a different matter. Mr. Reagan's proposal for a ''down payment'' on the deficit was appended to his budget only as an afterthought and because Congressional leaders finally persuaded him that ever-widening deficits were unacceptable in fact and in appearance. Unconsciously, this Congress has also shaped the coming debate about tax increases and tax reform. The idea of sharply reducing tax rates and eliminating many deductions - the so-called modified flat tax first proposed by two Democrats, Senator Bradley of New Jersey and Representative Gephardt of Missouri - has won favor among leading Republican conservatives and apparently also at the Treasury. Without even voting on anything, Congress has again pointed the way. So the 98th won't be remembered for landmark legislation. But it was no disaster. Mostly, as usual, it accommodated the President, and where he failed to lead, it goaded him constructively.

341-> NEW LAW ALLOWS STATE BANKS WIDER USE OF VARIABLE RATES
Banks may now charge variable interest rates on some consumer loans, including auto loans and credit card balances, under a law signed Saturday by Governor Cuomo. The law also applies to store credit cards, cash advances and overdraft loans. The law, which took effect immediately, provides that interest rates cannot change more than once every three months. Changes in rates are to be based on a published index, or formula, that changes according to economic conditions. The index must be one beyond the control of banks and approved by the State Superintendent of Banks. Banks already are allowed to charge variable interest rates on personal loans. Mr. Cuomo also signed legislation to send more than $16 million in state and Federal disaster assistance to the southeastern section of the state, which suffered extensive storm damage last April. Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Orange, Rockland, Sullivan and Ulster Counties and the cities of New York and Yonkers will receive the aid. The Governor also signed these measures over the weekend: - A bill to prohibit suits against people who tell authorities about suspected abuse of the eldery or other vulnerable adults. The Governor said the legislation would encourage people who fear that an adult is endangered or in need of protective services to report their suspicions without fear of being held liable in a civil suit should the charge turn out to be false. - A bill making permanent so-called super-exotic wagering at state harness racing tracks, extending a one-year experiment. The wagers involve picking the winners of seven or more races. The tracks hope the large potential payoffs will attract more betting. - Two bills regarding sexual abuse. One redefines the crime of ''sexual contact'' to touching the victim through clothing as well as direct contact. It also includes as sexual contact the forcing of a victim to touch a defendant. The second requires day-care centers to determine whether a prospective employee is the subject of a report on the child-abuse register. It also requires a check of current workers.

342-> THE OTHER OLD PHILADELPHIANS
David Levering Lewis teaches history at Howard University and the University of California, San Diego. He is the author of ''When Harlem Was In Vogue.'' ONE MORE DAY'S JOURNEY The Story of a Family and a People. By Allen B. Ballard. Illustrated. 288 pp. New York: McGraw-Hill Book Company. $17.95. THE ideal ethnic migration study would combine the large and the particular, the statistical and the biographical, in a bond of mutual illumination. Few studies of Afro-Americans (or of any other ethnic group) have managed to achieve that balance. Allen B. Ballard has endeavored to combine the scholarly and the personal in ''One More Day's Journey,'' his study of Afro-American migration from the South to his native Philadelphia. In doing so, he has created what appears to be a new genre of social document, one that owes as much to Jessie Fauset's genteel 1924 novel of Afro-American Philadelphia, ''There Is Confusion,'' as it does to W. E. B. Du Bois's inaugural study of urban sociology in America, ''The Philadelphia Negro.'' Was it lynch law and segregation in the South that pushed Afro-Americans north in the early years of this century, or was it the drying up of cheap, European labor and wartime industrial expansion that pulled them? The prevailing wisdom has preferred economic explanations - the boll weevil that ravaged the cotton fields and the more plentiful jobs up North. Mr, Ballard, a professor of political science at the City University of New York, contests the sufficiency of the economic explanation in ''One More Day's Journey.'' He is convinced that, for most blacks who moved north, ''the oppression in the South was the major reason for leaving.'' His argument is both refreshing and seminal. The journey in Mr. Ballard's title refers to two waves of migration from the South to Philadelphia that occurred in 1917-18 and in 1922-23, demographic transfers that increased the city's Afro-American population from more than 85,000 in 1910 to 134,000 a decade later, and to almost 200,000 by the mid-1920's. This was the time of the Great Migration, an era of extraordinary increase of Afro-Americans throughout the urban North, what Theodore Hershberg, another student of Philadelphia migration, has called the tale of the third city. Unfortunately, rather than offering data and analysis to support his plausible assertion that racial oppression caused this post-industrial migration, Mr. Ballard confines himself to personal conviction and the narration of corroborating examples. Not that facts and analysis are slighted in ''One More Day's Journey.'' Although the author has set himself the task of recreating the Philadelphia of 20th-century Afro-American migrants, he has conscientiously placed that experience in large focus. The chapters on Philadelphia's early history use a representative number of scholarly sources in order to approach their subjects with the sophistication demanded by their complexity. The author writes perceptively of those early, conflicted, slave-owning Quakers who ''believed in equality, but thought the lower classes should obey the higher.'' Commercial and family ties to the South imparted to the city's white ruling class a distinctively conservative, if schizoid, attitude toward slavery - opposition to it in principle, but stolid acceptance of its existence, and of the social inferiority of its chief victims. Thus, in a city noted for philanthropy among the poor and oppressed, and for Underground Railroad activity, the rulers tolerated recurrent, Irish-led, working-class pogroms in 1829, 1834, 1838, 1842 and 1849 against Afro- Americans. Frederick Douglass called the city a ''mean, contemptible, and barbarous place.'' In the 10 years after 1840, episodic flight held the number of nonwhites in Philadelphia to 18,000. A few of those who stayed did remarkably well. James Forten, a sailmaker, amassed a great fortune and, with the religious leaders Richard Allen and Absalom Jones, gave Philadelphia's Afro-American community such militant, yet dignified, leadership as to influence decisively the course of Northern abolitionism and the African homeland debate. If the stories of Richard Allen, 18th- century founder of African Methodism, O. V. Catto, Civil War-era scholar and civil rights activist, and of the Quaker-founded Institute for Colored Youth, Afro- America's first high school, are familiar to many Americans of African descent, the vivid economy with which Mr. Ballard retells them should, given the wide readership ''One More Day's Journey'' merits, contribute to a broader sharing of this past. The fragility of that past could not be more strikingly illustrated than by the family revelations generated by Mr. Ballard's 10-year quest for personal and collective rediscovery. ''Go to Bob Gardner, everybody said,'' and from his cousin Bob, Mr. Ballard is ''dumbfounded'' to learn that his own lineal, maternal ancestor, Jean-Pierre Burr, prosperous barber and Underground-Railroad activist, was the natural son of Aaron Burr, third Vice President of the United States. It is a tribute to the author's steadfastness of purpose and healthy sense of self that he is neither overly impressed nor distressed by his new-found pedigree. Mr. Ballard recounts in a lively manner the alternating horror and compassion with which the ''O.P.'s'' (''Old Philadelphians'') - cultured descendants of colonial-era Afro-Americans - reacted to the newcomers of the post-industrial migration. For him, the ultimate value of an elite is its ability to combine with and defer to new talent from below. ''That's how we moved ahead,'' he quotes approvingly the aged, elegant Arthur Huff Fauset, an anthropologist and, like his sister, the novelist Jessie Fauset, a prime mover of the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920's. ''It was much better to have that than to have those Old Philadelphians doing nothing because they were so busy being Old Philadelphians,'' Mr. Ballard quotes Mr. Fauset as saying. What Mr. Ballard's Philadelphia mother knew of the South ''she did not particularly like,'' and his South Carolina father ''was just plain ashamed of the South.'' AND so Mr. Ballard, of the bluest blood, charmed and worried his way into that rural, migrant past from which his father had hastily detached himself. In fervent Philadelphia congregations of Baptists and Methodists, he finds scores of close and distant relatives - Bradleys, Ballards, Logans, Crawfords and Tolberts - names of the most recently assimilated ''O.P.s'' - and, more surprisingly, finds that nearly all of them made the journey north from Abbeville County, S. C. Most of them came from the town of Greenwood. He discovers that Philadelphia churches - Morris Chapel and Bright Hope Baptist Church - were modeled on and even named after Greenwood churches. In Philadelphia, at markets like George Bailey's in Oxford Street, and at the Chesterfield Hotel for dancing and drinking, Mr. Ballard discovers that these people transplanted a culture, recreating its institutions and an economy to sustain it. Through his own childhood memories of in-group color prejudice, rampant disease, upward mobility through crime, family breakdowns and individual breakthroughs, Mr. Ballard movingly animates his Greenwood-Philadelphia statistics on marriage, mortality, crime, income and education. A good ear, clear eye and sustained empathy during his sojourns (in Philadelphia and in South Carolina) have enabled Mr. Ballard to recover the energies of migrant identity and to interweave large social changes with the voices of average people who participated in them. The effect, as the following example shows, is often startling in its ramifications. The Afro-American Greenwood landowner Anthony Crawford, Methodist stalwart, Masonic grand officer, bankroller of the sole local school for Afro-Americans, was a figure revered by Abbeville County's young Benjamin Mays, future college president and role model for Martin Luther King Jr. People like Crawford, Mays recalled in his autobiography, ''took pride in the fact that they never had to work for white people.'' In the white firestorm after Crawford was lynched for disputing the price of a few cotton bales, his family was chased away, Afro-American merchants were shut down, and remaining black property owners ordered to sell. ''If you're going to kill me,'' the novelist Ralph Ellison's grandfather told the mob, ''you'll have to kill me right here because I'm not leaving.'' Two generations later, the Crawford atrocity is still remembered in Philadelphia, and Mr. Ballard finds Crawford descendants successful and active in several northern cities. On the whole, Aaron Burr would probably have been proud of the hardy, quick-witted migrants from Mr. Ballard's Greenwood. B The Lynching of Anthony Crawford Anthony Crawford was a wealthy and prosperous Black farmer who owned ''427 acres of the prettiest cotton land in the county.'' Born in 1865, Crawford was the the personification of Booker T. Washington's call to Black people to ''cast down their buckets where they were.'' . . . So important was education to him that he built and financed a school on his land. Crawford was a religious man who was the secretary of Chappelle A.M.E. Church and its chief financial supporter. . . . Clearly, he was not an ordinary Black man. Said to have been strong-willed, he declared ''the day a white man hits me is the day I die.'' One day during the cotton-ginning season, Crawford went into a store in Abbeville Square to sell some bales of cotton. He got into an argument about the price to be paid and did some strong cussing. A mob soon formed and went after him, but the sheriff rescued him, put him in jail for a short time, then released him. Crawford headed back to the store determined to recover his bales of cotton. By this time, a large mob of Abbeville whites had formed to kill this Black who had been crazy enough to swear at a white man. Crawford was as good as his word. When they came for him, he had a four-pound hammer in his hand and he crushed the skull of the leader of the mob. Then the ''citizens . . . took Crawford into the road where everybody could get at him.'' They took his crumpled body back into the jailhouse, where he regained consciousness long enough to tell the sheriff to give his bankbook to his son and to say, ''I thought I was a good citizen.'' - From ''One More Day's Journey''

343-> GUNN NEEDS SOME LINKS FOR HIS CHAIN OF COMMAND
SUZANNE DALEY It is not only the subway tracks and the stations, the repair shops and the bus depots that have deteriorated in New York after years of neglect. Inside the New York City Transit Authority, the management structure may have crumbled, too. Since arriving in New York last winter, the authority's new president and the new chairman of its parent agency, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, have been insisting that physical improvements won't come without managerial ones. The previous administration of the city's transit system emphasized the need for money and managed to secure a $6.5 billion program to repair the 70-year-old system's aging facilities. But David L. Gunn, the president of the Transit Authority, and Robert R. Kiley, the M.T.A. chairman, have turned their attention to the people who run the system. It is people, after all, who decide how to spend the money and who make sure that work is done properly - and they may be harder to find than the billions already secured. ''The physical stuff is easier to deal with than the people problems,'' said Mr. Gunn. ''If I could wave a magic wand and have one wish it would be to fix the managerial side. In the long run, that's the one that is more important.'' The effort has already begun. Last week, Mr. Kiley filed a formal application with the city to free the Transit Authority of Civil Service restrictions in promoting upper-level supervisors. The request is part of a larger plan to remove supervisors from protections provided by Civil Service and union contracts, thus allowing top management more control over the promotion and replacement of supervisors. In addition, Mr. Gunn recently decided that the only way to prevent waste of the authority's multibillion renovation plan was to slow down spending until its management structure can be reshaped. The changes he plans for the engineering department alone could take as long as a year, he said. To turn around the Transit Authority, Mr. Gunn said, he will have to break up some departments and alter others. He will also have to find and keep the right people. But Mr. Gunn is unlikely to find many good mass-transit executives whom he can hire to help upgrade the country's largest urban transit system, experts agree. There is a nationwide shortage. ''It's pretty thin,'' said Joseph Mack, the general manager of Philadelphia's mass-transit system. ''The rewards aren't here; the pressures are here.'' Analysts cite many reasons for the lack of top- notch middle- and upper-level managers available to public agencies: Private industry pays much more; public transit people tend to get battered by political winds, and they operate in a ''fish bowl'' of public needs and attention. ''The mistakes are right there in front of everybody,'' said Dr. George M. Smerk, the director of the Institute for Urban Transportation at the University of Indiana. ''If a train doesn't come in on time today everybody knows it.'' The Human TollBut perhaps more than any other factor, industry officials point to the recent history of mass transit systems. ''People tend to describe what happened in physical terms,'' Mr. Kiley said. ''But it took a tremendous human toll as well. In the 1950's and 60's, a lot of people just left.'' ''There's a generation gap,'' said Vuchan R. Vuchic, a professor of transportation engineering at the University of Pennsylvania. ''For several decades transit was so badly treated - so badly neglected - that it did not attract young people.'' Besides failing to attract or to keep talented managers, the public transit industry also failed to invest in those who were in its employ. ''In most companies there are training and upgrading programs for the employees to keep them 'up-to-snuff' on the latest technology, for example,'' said Dr. Smerk. ''That just hasn't happened in transit.'' Recognizing this need, the Federal Urban Mass Transportation Administration has begun concentrating on the training of transit executives, according to Alfred A. DelliBovi, the agency's deputy administrator. ''You hear transit people talking about the problem all the time,'' he said. ''It starts right from the garage level right up to the top.'' Since taking office in February, Mr. Gunn has turned to the agency he left, Philadephia's Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, to hire most of his new executives. ''There was absolutely no recruitment capability at this place,'' Mr. Gunn said of the Transit Authority. ''I've been relying on what I know.'' Already, about a half dozen people, from two new senior vice presidents to the head of the 207th Street subway car shop in Manhattan, have come from SEPTA. ''I can't go back to Philadelphia,'' Mr. Gunn said. ''Really, they hate me now.'' But New York needs layers of good managers. Because so few are likely to be available elsewhere, Mr. Gunn said, he will groom people already at the Transit Authority. The best managers - and the most difficult ones to find, he said - are people who are technically capable of understanding the equipment and also able to manage subordinates effectively. In Philadelphia, Mr. Gunn set up training programs for his employees. The programs took about a year to complete and combined classroom instruction, training with people proven to be good managers and time spent working at well-managed transit systems, such as those in Toronto and Atlanta. Mr. Gunn said he will try the same approach here, although he is not ready to say when he can get started or how long it will take to bring good management back to the authority. ''If you can't find it, you've got to build it, create it yourself.'' he said. ''We'll do that.''

344-> KARPOV TAKES 3-0 CHESS LEAD AS KASPAROV LOSES 7TH GAME
The world chess champion, Anatoly Karpov of the Soviet Union, took a 3-0 lead in his title defense match in Moscow yesterday after his countryman, Gary Kasparov, resigned the seventh game. The 33-year-old Karpov now needs three more victories to retain the championship he has held since 1975. Draws do not count in the scoring. When the seventh game was adjourned Friday night with Karpov sealing his 42d move, the 21-year-old Kasparov was given little chance to hold his ruined position. Later, the challenger gave up without resuming play. When play began Friday at 5 P.M., Karpov shifted from his 1 P-K4 of Games 1, 3 and 5 to a queenside opening, possibly because he had not obtained real opening advantage against Kasparov's Sicilian Defenses. He could count on Kasparov using his favorite Tarrasch Defense against 1 P-Q4. Following an Earlier Game Up through 13 . . . B-KN5, the players were following a game between Wlodzimierz Schmidt and Murray Chandler in the Nis International Tournament last year, but in place of White's perhaps too casual 14 P-KR3, B-R4; 15 QR-Q1, R-QB1; 16 N-B5, B-QN5, Karpov immediately played 14 N-B5!? Should Kasparov now have tried 14 . . . B-N5, emulating Chandler? Instead, he developed with 14 . . . R-QB1, letting the champion obtain the bishop- pair by 15 NxBch, RxN. After 16 QR-Q1, it was becoming evident that Karpov was achieving what so many had currently found so difficult - a demonstration of the weakness of the isolated black QP that the Tarrasch Defense gives rise to. Indeed, the challenger had so little confidence in guarding it successfully (16 . . . R- Q2; 17 B-Q4, B-K3; 18 P-B4!, P-KN3; 19 P-B5! yields White a smashing attack) that he gave it up at once with 16 . . . Q-K1; 17 P-KR3, B-R4; 18 BxQP. The Russian Grandmaster David Bronstein, a challenger for the world title himself in 1951, suggested that Karpov ''could have played more strongly on the 22d move by transferring his queen to the king's side rather than chasing the black knight.'' This is very likely true, as may be judged from 22 Q-B4!?, NxP?; 23 R-K5!, Q-Q1; 24 N-Q5!, winning at least the exchange. Material Advantage Lost The champion's 22 P-N3, N-N3; 23 R-K5, Q-Q2; 24 Q-K3, P-B3; 25 R-QB5, RxR; 26 BxR, QxP saw him lose his material advantage, although after 27 R-Q1, he enjoyed control of the center of the board with his superior piece mobility. Naturally, after 28 R-Q4!, which stopped 28 . . . P-R5, it would have been an exchange-losing blunder to play 28 . . . RxB? and allow 29 R-Q8ch. After 31 moves, Karpov had 20 minutes left while Kasparov had only 5 in which to get to the time control at the 40th move. On 34 . . . Q-N3, it would have been wrong to take a pawn by 35 QxQ, NxQ; 36 RxP? because Black retaliates with 36 . . . NxB; 37 PxN, R-B7. Kasparov, who had been putting up a hard-bitten defense, should have seen the necessity for 35 . . . QxQ; 36 RxQ with chances to hold an inferior ending. Instead, he finally blundered with 35 . . . R-B7?, overlooking Karpov's 36 Q-K3! with a terrible threat of 37 R-Q8 and 38 B-Q6. This cost him a precious tempo for protection with 36 . . . R-B1, which Karpov used to penetratae the black position with 37 Q-K7, P-QN4; 38 R-Q8!, RxR; 39 QxR. The upshot was that after 41 Q-R8, Black would have to drop a pawn and face a lost end game. With full reliance on the champion's technique, Kasparov gave up.

345-> PUTNAM STARTS A SUICIDE AWARENESS PROGRAM
State and local officials have begun an effort in suburban Putnam County to fight the growing number of teen-age suicides. The program will train 4,367 participants in the warning signs of depression and how to handle it. Eleven young people have committed suicide in the suburbs north of New York City since Feb. 4. The State Division of Youth is supplying $28,000 for the project, the first of three proposed suicide awareness programs planned for the state. 'Merited Immediate Attention' ''We're concerned that young people have essential services to get them through difficult phases of their lives,'' said Leonard Dunston, director of the division. ''This issue merited immediate attention.'' Mr. Dunston said programs for rural Yates County, in the Finger Lakes region, and New York City were being planned. According to Lieut. Gov. Alfred B. Del Bello, the size of Putnam County, which has a total population of about 80,000 in its six towns, will make it easy to evaluate the success of the program and whether the program could be implemented statewide or even nationwide. The Putnam program will involve training of teachers, parents and students in the Carmel, Mahopac, Haldane and Brewster High Schools and in the eighth grade in the Garrison School District and 9th grade of the Putnam Valley School District. ''There are no simple solutions,'' Mr. Del Bello told administrators, guidance counselors and school representatives from six school districts in Putnam County in announcing the program Wednesday. One Every 90 Minutes Suicide is the second leading cause of death for youths between 15 and 24 in this country, Mr. Del Bello said, noting that 6,000 teen-agers committed suicide nationwide in 1983. ''A teen-ager takes his own life about every 90 minutes. It's a national tragedy.'' Experts have speculated that the actual number may be as much as four times higher, since many suicides are mistakenly reported as accidents or homicides, said Mr. Del Bello, who is chairman of the State Council on Youth Suicide Prevention and co-chairman of the National Committee on Youth Suicide Prevention. Speaking at Carmel High School, Mr. Del Bello said: ''This tragedy is not going to go away by itself, but instead is mounting at record rates. We must reach into the schools to attack its causes and inform people of what can be done to reduce the incidence of teen suicide.'' 3 Suicides This Year The shotgun suicide of Maureen Fitzell, 15 years old, on Sept. 11 was the third by a Putnam County youth this year. State statistics show that there were no suicides in the county, whose southern border is about 40 miles north of New York City, in 1982 or 1983. Miss Fitzell was a student at Mahopac High School, one of the four high schools in the county participating in the program. The heart of the issue, he said, ''could be very painful for society. But it's something we have to do.''

346-> 2 GERMANYS AT ODDS OVER LEADER'S VISIT
East Germany today accused ''certain forces'' in Bonn of trying to sabotage a visit to West Germany next month by Erich Honecker, the East German Communist Party leader. In a commentary, the East German party daily Neues Deutschland attacked Alfred Dregger, the parliamentary floor leader of the West German Christian Democratic Party, who two days ago declared that ''our future does not depend on whether Mr. Honecker pays us the honor of a visit.'' The editorial assailed Mr. Dregger, who voices right-wing concerns of his party, and the anti-Communist Springer newspaper chain, saying they ''do not want the possible visit'' to take place. It described Mr. Dregger's remarks as ''scandalous and provocative sallies.'' ''The campaign of such forces,'' said Neues Deutschland, ''does no small damage.'' It said that in light of the purported campaign, it should be clear that Mr. Honecker ''is not pushing to visit'' West Germany. The Neues Deutschland commentary was the first to hint that the visit, which would be the first by an East German party leader to West Germany, might not take place. But officials here noted that the editorial avoided criticism of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who returns from vacation Monday. Although the visit has not been formally announced, Bonn officials have been fleshing out the details of a busy, five-day swing that would start on Sept. 26. The Neues Deutschland article maintained that ''no date, catalogue of discussion topics or program have yet been agreed upon.'' Criticism in Soviet Press Since the beginning of this month, the Soviet press has sharply criticized the warming ties between the two Germanys, charging the Kohl Government with trying to undermine East Germany's stability. The press blasts are widely seen as an expression of unease over the implications of the Honecker visit, although Western diplomats express uncertainty over whether Moscow will try to veto the trip. As East Germany's links with West Germany have tightened, Mr. Honecker has emerged as an ally of Janos Kadar of Hungary and Nicolae Ceausescu of Rumania in defending broadened ties with the West to spur both economic growth and East-West detente. This line of argument has tended to undercut Soviet efforts to convey a chill in East-West relations in the wake of the deployment of American medium-range missiles in Western Europe. This week Mr. Honecker was conspicuous as the sole Eastern European party chief to attend the 40th-anniversary celebrations in Bucharest of Rumania's ''antifascist liberation.'' Rumania recently underscored its maverick standing in the Warsaw Pact by spurning the Soviet-led boycott of the Los Angeles Olympics. Two days ago Mr. Honecker and Mr. Ceausescu issued a communique that urged ''a turning to a politics of reason'' between East and West. With Mr. Kohl on holiday, other Bonn politicians tried to limit the possible fallout from Mr. Dregger's remarks. J"urgen Sudhoff, a Government spokesman, said Friday that Mr. Honecker was welcome in West Germany. Campaigning for local elections in Essen, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher today urged politicians to be circumspect in their remarks about East Germany and ''not gamble away'' the chances for better relations between the two states. If trim is needed take graf beginning ''Two days ago....''

347-> Hope Is What Makes the Giants
To the Sports Editor: Sidney Zion shouldn't worry about exposing his kids to the Giants (''When the Giants Rule the World,'' The New York Times, Sept. 16). I, too, am a Giant fan of some longevity. During what is considered by many to be the finest single contest on the gridiron, a certain obstetrician could not bring himself to shut off the radio in the delivery room. So, on Dec. 28, 1958, I was born to the sound of the Giants' struggle with the Colts. Since that day some inner fire has always burned for the Giants. For years that fire kept me warm as I sat in the Arctic cold of Yankee Stadium. My father and I had seats behind one of the large columns that filled the old stadium. Those of you who sat in section 13 may remember a little boy weaving back and forth in his seat whenever there was any action between the 20- and 40-yard lines, an area obliterated by the architecture of a stadium designed for a different sport. Although those were the best seats we were ever to have at Yankee Stadium, and despite the trek to a college field in New Haven, we went. We went because there is something about the Giants that keeps us all tethered. Perhaps it is something about our ability to take such constant, and at times crushing, losses without losing hope. I remember leaving Yankee Stadium when the Giants were eliminated from the wild-card spot by the Rams. Never before or since have I seen so many thousands of people leave a place so quietly. Yet we were all back the next year, and will always come back. If the Giants go further this year than before it will be wonderful. But Giant fans, both those born and those made, will be fans regardless. Mr. Zion need not worry about bringing his kids to see the Giants. After 25 years of loyalty to a team others have scoffed at, I have none of the cynicism or doubt one might expect. I have hope, and hope, Mr. Zion, is what makes Giants.

349-> FIELD HOCKEY IS HIS CITY GAME
DOWN his street, in a navy blue U.S.A. sweatsuit, walks Rawle Cox, who, to the ignorance of many of his neighbors, will play in the Olympic Games. ''There he is,'' yells a young man who is an exception. ''Olympic team,'' another calls out without deference. ''Win one for us,'' cries a third, more to tease than to praise. He laughs. ''Win one for us.'' Rawle Cox smiles and walks on. Maybe if he were a boxer, he says, people would make a fuss about him. But Cox plays field hockey, which is not a spectator sport in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn. Nor is it a game that arouses passions in much of the country he will represent. When he tells people that he plays field hockey he is often asked by unenlightened sorts why an athletic fellow like himself bothers to play ''a women's sport.'' Indeed, when women see him carrying his case of field hockey sticks they sometimes tell him how they played the game when they were in school. ''I really wasn't interested in it because it seemed like you could get hurt,'' Cox says, recalling his first exposure to field hockey. But then, he adds, ''the game started getting interesting.'' That interest, in five years of playing, has grown, so much so that the 23-year-old Cox admits that the more he plays the more he sees how much there is to learn. The other day, for instance, he went to practice a bit at a neighborhood park where basketball, softball and graffiti penmanship are the primary forms of recreation. He found a vacant handball court, unzipped his carrying bag, chose a stick, detected a crack, lamented the waste of the $40 purchase, chose another, and began whacking the game's baseball-sized sphere against the wall. It bounced hard off the spray- painted names of Zoomer and Boomer and off the place where Sophie and Peaches announced their involvement. He hit the ball the way every golfing duffer dreams of hitting - two hands held in no special fashion slamming the ball with a vengeance. That, however, was the easy part. Then he practiced dribbling. A field hockey stick, which is about the length of a baseball bat, has a curved end with two sides - one flat, the other crescent-shaped. The ball, however, can be struck with only the flat side. Dribbling means steering the ball while spinning the stick to keep the flat surface on the ball. Simple this is not. Cox dribbled back and forth across the concrete. He is stocky and muscular and he danced across the court, moving the ball away from imaginary opponents, cradling it on the end of his spinning stick. He has mastered dribbling, but not the scoop. The scoop is a pass that is sent sailing over opponents' heads. He aimed, hit and smiled as the ball soared the way it should. ''Must be my lucky day,'' he said. ''I'm getting pretty good now.'' Still, Cox is quick to point out that he cannot play the way the best players can - those from India, Pakistan, the Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand and West Germany. The Australians are the world champions. And in India and Pakistan the game is regarded with reverence. It was an Indian author, M. L. Kapur, who wrote ''Romance of Hockey.'' It was an Indian player, Dyann Chand, who, aficionados say, was the game's equivalent of Babe Ruth. And it was a Pakistani crowd, Cox says, that stoned their national team's bus after a loss to the West Germans. Cox and the rest of the American team saw them play in Pakistan. He took pictures of the stands because, unlike those at American games, the stadium was packed. Against each other, he says, the best teams did things that made the American players gawk in wonder. ''We'd look at each other and say, 'Did you see that?' '' Cox says. ''It was like Doctor J coming down and doing a reverse dunk.'' Their exclamations, however, were unseemly. ''You're supposed to be a national team,'' Cox says. ''Youre supposed to be doing stuff like that.'' After that the Americans just looked at each other with raised eyebrows when the champions did something they could not yet do. The Indians were introduced to field hockey by the British, who, although not the inventors of the game, gave it form in the shape of rules and organizations. These were then passed along to places where they enjoyed considerable influence. The colonies are gone; but the game endures. There are bas reliefs found in Athens dating from 514 to 499 B.C. showing men squaring off with hockey sticks in hand. And in Canterbury Cathedral there hangs a 600- year-old window showing a boy hitting a ball with what appears to be a field hockey stick. Its long history not withstanding, field hockey in more recent times took on a patrician air, says Allan Woods, general secretary of the Field Hockey Association of America. It was, and remains, a decidedly amateur sport; nowhere in the world, Woods says, is it played professionally. And so, in places like the United States, where athletics could be profitable for a good athlete, the sport did not attract many players. ''A kid would say, 'Why should I play field hockey?' '' Woods says. '' 'I'm not going to make any money at it.' '' Instead, it became one of the few sports that women were encouraged to play in school. That is not to say that it remained alien to men. A club was formed in Rye, N.Y. So rare, however, were male players that the club's president was called upon in 1932 to try assembling a host team for the Los Angeles Olympic Games. That team won a bronze medal by virtue of its finishing third out of three teams. It remains the only Olympic medal the United States has won in the sport. Harold Cox played for the Trinidad national team, which won a silver medal in the 1967 Pan Am Games. Cox, although not one to push his sons to play, brought them along when he did. First, his son Keith began to play. But not Rawle, who liked basketball and baseball better and would ride around the field on his bicycle while his father played. If the team was short a player, however, he was called upon to stand in. When, at the age of 18, Rawle Cox found that he liked the game he began to practice dribbling and shooting in his backyard. He joined his father's team. He practiced shooting and passing off handball court walls. His father, meanwhile, seeing his rapid progress, thought that he might be able to make the national junior team. And although Rawle made the junior team in 1981, and although he played for the Pan American team - as his brother Keith had, and although he made the United States national team, Harold Cox is not given to flattering his son. ''I'd always tell him, 'To show me you're good, win a medal. Show me you're better than me. To be better than me you got to win a gold because I won a silver medal,' '' he says. The father, the sons and an uncle played together on the New York Field Hockey Association team, but Rawle wanted a more demanding training schedule. When he left to play for another, more competitive team, he incurred his family's wrath. Then they played each other. ''The night before the game my father told me, 'When you get on that field I don't know you,' '' he says. ''I scored two goals. The next time we played I'd get the ball and he'd say, 'Come to poppa.' He took the ball away from me every time. After the game he just smiled and said, 'See, I told you.' '' In 1979, the American Pan American team on which Keith Cox played lost by 12-0 to the Dutch. This year, the American team lost by only 2-0. Still, the team will play in the Olympics not because it is highly ranked but because it is the host nation. Although much of his time is spent training with the national team in California and traveling abroad for games, Cox has rejoined his family's team and plays with his father, brother and uncle when he comes to New York. Rawle is the best player on the team because he plays all the time. But when the Olympics are over, he says, he will go back to school and perhaps earn a degree in engineering.

351-> CURRY BEATS LA ROCCA
A pair of undefeated Americans, Don Curry and Richie Sandoval, retained their World Boxing Association titles on the same card today. Curry, of Fort Worth, Tex., defended his welterweight title with a knockout of Nina La Rocca of Italy at 1 minute 27 seconds of the sixth round. Sandoval, of Pomona, Calif., his left eye swollen and cut, retained the title he won five months ago with a unanimous decision over Edgar Roman of Venezuela. Curry sent La Rocca to the canvas twice within 10 seconds of the sixth round for his fourth successful title defense. La Rocca staggered under a left hook from Curry and went out for the count at 1:27 of the sixth round in the scheduled 15-rounder. ''I tried to pick my shots. I was patient,'' Curry said moments after the victory. ''Back home in Texas, people know I'm not a big talker. I just waited to catch him.'' A Big Left Hook The victory brought Curry - undefeated after 20 bouts - a $400,000 payday. The champion went into the fight weighing 145 3/4 pounds to La Rocca's 146. Referee Stanley Christodoulou of South Africa scored it 49-47 for Curry when the fight was stopped. Judge Ove Ovensen of Denmark had Curry ahead, 48-47, and Judge Roger Perez of Panama had it 48-48. ''I caught him with a left hook,'' Curry said. ''I got off to a bit off a sluggish start, but I knew I had him with that punch. Then I just started putting on more pressure.''The loss was La Rocca's second of a 60-fight career. Sandoval won with a 150-138, 149- 139, 149-137 sweep against the hard- hitting but inneffectual Roman. The victory ran Sandoval's four-year career record to 24-0 with 16 knockouts.

352-> Sohio to Resume Beaufort Drilling
The Standard Oil Company (Ohio) said it planned to resume drilling at a Beaufort Sea site that had been an earlier disappointment. Drilling operations are scheduled for late January through April on the east side of Prudhoe Bay. That area is within a few miles of the Endicott field, which earlier had been labeled marginally economical by Sohio. The well, Niakuk No. 4, is a follow- up to other wells drilled in the area in the late 1970's. Those earlier wells were plugged, but a Sohio spokesman, Hugh Depland, said that ''we've learned some new things'' as a result of recent studies, including more seismic testing in the area. He declined to comment on how much oil Sohio believes is in the field, but added: ''If we didn't expect the well to be productive, we wouldn't drill it.''

He has the National Football League record of catching passes in 127 consecutive games, and he has caught more passes (589) for more yards (8,918) and more touchdowns (79) than any other receiver in the history of the Philadelphia Eagles. But at age 34, Harold Carmichael no longer fits in with the team's plans. Yesterday the club announced it had put the 6-foot-8-inch wide receiver on waivers after failing to find a team that would take him in a trade. Calling Carmichael ''one of the finest receivers in N.F.L. history,'' Coach Marion Campbell said the club had acted so Carmichael, who played 13 years with the Eagles, could try to find another team. ''I have decided to continue playing professional football,'' he said, insisting that he can still ''make a winning contribution to a football team.''

356-> TALKS ON NAMIBIA OPEN WITH A DISPUTE
The insurgents who oppose South Africa's disputed control of South-West Africa and their white South African adversaries and other political foes met here today in a major effort to seek a settlement, but a procedural wrangle held up substantive deliberations for hours. Delegates from the insurgent group said the complication, which stretched into the night, partly offset what optimism preceded the talks and reinforced insurgent skepticism about the outcome. The negotiations are being held under the auspices of President Kenneth D. Kaunda of Zambia. South Africa, which governs South-West Africa, or Namibia, under an expired mandate from the League of Nations, is represented by its administrator general - a kind of viceroy - in the territory. The administrator general, Dr. Willie van Niekerk, is co-chairman of the talks with President Kaunda. The other delegations are the South- West Africa People's Organization, a Soviet-armed insurgent group that has been fighting a low-key bush war for more than 17 years, and what is called the Multiparty Conference, an amalgamation of six internal parties seen by the insurgents as fronts for South Africa. American Present for Talks Insurgent delegates said a State Department envoy, Robert Cabelly, came to Lusaka this week, apparently to monitor the discussions. Delegates from several parties said the procedural squabble broke out before the conference opened. They said members of the Multiparty Conference objected to both the size and composition of the insurgent delegation, which includes allied political groups and breakaway groups from some organizations in the Multiparty Conference. The dispute was resolved after midnight when the insurgents agreed to modify their delegation. The talks are expected to get under way on Saturday. ''This is playing games,'' a senior insurgent figure, Hidipo Hamutenya, told reporters in reference to the dispute. President Kaunda, whose personal prestige is bound to a successful outcome, spoke at the formal opening of the talks and urged the territory's political groups to unite against South African occupation. ''Your meeting should not be an occasion for apportioning blame,'' he said. ''It should not be an occasion for confrontation, retribution or recrimination.'' ''Let it not be said hereafter,'' he said, ''that yet another wonderful opportunity to achieve significant progress toward the freedom and independence of Namibia has been missed for no really valid reasons.'' But the dispute had alredy broken out. Reasons for Some Hope Before the formal opening of the talks today, there was some optimism that they would lead to a breakthrough because the insurgents are under pressures to seek a political settlement and South Africa has committed itself to honoring agreements worked out between the guerrillas and the internal parties. African diplomats said that if the quarelling South-West African parties could be persuaded to form a united front to demand a settlement, the discussion could move on to the details of a cease-fire and the terms of a settlement leading to independence.

Policing Nassau's Third Precinct The article ''Assignment: Nassau's Busiest Precinct'' (Aug. 26), contained high praise for Inspector Tracy Smith, and we could not agree more. Ours is an association of business people whose stores, warehouses and factories are within the area discussed. Naturally, we have been involved with Inspector Smith on several local projects, and we have found him completely cooperative in all respects. He has gained a reputation for quick implementation and responsiveness among the industries in the area. We have been particularly impressed by the time that he takes to listen personally to our concerns and involve himself with projects affecting our community. The article prompts what I think is a valid question: Why must the Third Precinct handle some 4,000 cases a year with only 27 detectives, while the adjacent Sixth Precinct handles 1,900 cases with 22 detectives and the Second Precinct some 1,800 cases with 24 detectives? Our hats are off to Inspector Smith, but he sure could use some help. DORI L. EVANS Vice President and Counsel New Cassel Industrial Association Westbury

361-> Radiation Tests Are Assailed
Four union leaders representing hundreds of workers in nuclear weapon plants have accused the Department of Energy of manipulating test results to minimize the health effects of radiation exposure in the plants, and have asked that responsibility for the tests be shifted to the Department of Health and Human Services. The union leaders sent a letter this week to lawmakers seeking support for a bill requiring the Department of Health and Human Services to perform studies that the unionists said showed an excess of cancer deaths among employees at uranium and plutonium facilites under contract to the Energy Department, which makes the studies under current law. The letter, signed by officers of unions at Department of Energy weapon contractors in Tennessee, Ohio and Colorado, accused the Energy Department of the ''manipulation of important health effects research'' that the unionists said ''indicate that serious health problems are occurring at several D.O.E. nuclear facilities.'' A spokesman for the Energy Department, Gail Bradshaw, said that she could not comment on the letter, but she denied that radiation exposure studies have been distorted. ''These studies are very difficult to understand,'' she said.

362-> LETTERS; Jersey
To the Editor: As a Jersey-American, I was delighted to read John Vinocur's article on Jersey (Travel, Aug. 12). He does not, however, do justice to the island's ''micro-climate'' on the basis of a four-day visit. From my experience, it can even be cloudy and dreary over a weekend in south Florida! The Jersey climate is different from that of southern England, and from that of the Normandy peninsula. Tomatoes are grown very successfully outdoors in Jersey, but cannot be commercially grown outdoors in England. Hydrangeas, fuchsias, azaleas and other warm weather vegetation grow abundantly on the island. One of my memories of the island is of being in brilliant sunshine, watching rain clouds build up over the French coast a few miles east. Another quibble is that Jersey is not a part of the United Kingdom (of Great Britain and Northern Ireland). It has an independent tricameral government with a lieutenant governor representing the Crown. One of Jersey's more famous governors was Sir Walter Raleigh. The people of Jersey are of mixed English and French stock, but are loyal subjects of the Crown. Natives call themselves Jerseymen and Jerseywomen, not Englishmen and Englishwomen. The local English has a near-Cajun accent; the local French is a Norman patois. Among points of interest are the lobster tanks at St. Catherine's Bay: those lobsters end up on tables in London, Paris and Brussels. Jersey deserves at least a full week for exploration and appreciation, and I would agree with Mr. Vinocur that July and August are months to avoid because of crowds. Spring and fall are excellent times to visit. PHILIP S. BENTLIF M.D. Houston

364-> PROSPECTS; Inflation Heating Up?
The Producer Price Index, which has served as a security blanket for many inflation worriers since January, should show signs of fraying next Friday. Some economists, such as Jason Benderly of Kidder, Peabody & Company, say the September index could rise as much as one- half of 1 percent, compared with an increase of three-tenths of 1 percent for August, and no change at all for the previous three months. ''You can blame the rise mostly on the surge in oil prices that started in August, the month that the September figures actually measure,'' he said. ''By comparison, the Consumer Price Index for September, which is due out on the 24th, will be reflecting current prices.'' Mr. Benderly also noted that the P.P.I. only covers prices at the wholesale level, including imported goods, which are relatively cheaper because of the dollar's continuing strength. That ameliorating effect keeps the lid on the P.P.I. But the C.P.I. weighs the cost of goods and services at the retail level. Those services - such volatile items as medical costs, housing costs and repair bills - are increasing. Thus it is likely that inflation, as measured by the C.P.I., will be rising at an even faster rate than the P.P.I. indicates. U.S. Bonds in Demand While the strength of the dollar has been a nightmare for companies trying to export goods, it has been a boon for corporate borrowers tapping the foreign credit markets. The eagerness of overseas investors to buy dollar- denominated American bonds has enabled many corporations to replace bothersome short-term financing with long-term, fixed-rate debt. This is why a record $14.4 billion, or one-third of all American corporate bonds, were issued overseas in the first nine months of 1984, compared with $7.3 billion, or 10 percent, for all of 1983. The previous record was in 1982, when domestic corporations issued $15.1 billion of bonds overseas, or 21.1 percent of all American bond issues, according to Salomon Brothers Inc. ''In fact, more U.S. corporate bonds were issued abroad in September than domestically,'' said Ronald M. Stuart, managing director of the international corporate bond department at Salomon Brothers. A Dubious Indicator Few important economic statistics are as unreliable as Washington's monthly national retail sales figures. That is because the early figures are usually revised radically the next month. For example, in July, the initial figure showed a drop of nine-tenths of 1 percent in retail sales; a month later the figure was amended to reflect a drop of 2 percent. ''Nobody knows what the September figure will be or whether the August figure of minus eight-tenths of 1 percent will be revised,'' said Joseph H. Ellis, retailing specialist at Goldman, Sachs & Company. ''At best, the figures are of dubious and short-term value. We prefer to look at inventory numbers, and why people are shopping or not shopping.'' Recently, Mr. Ellis found that on July 30 the combined inventories of 10 major retail chains he monitors were up a huge 19.5 percent from the 1983 level. This led to heavy sales promotions in August. Why, then, were sales poor in August? The Olympics, he replied. ''If only 5 percent of potential shoppers watch TV, it can have a tremendous impact on retail sales.'' Looking ahead, Mr. Ellis expects the inventory number to shrink to 15 percent by the end of this month, and the rate of growth in sales to slow over the next nine months. Why? ''Credit loads and other factors normal at this stage of an economic expansion should slow the growth of sales during this period,'' he replied. Toy Boom Expected Because more adults are entertaining at home with games, 1984 promised to be a boom year for many toy makers well before they prepared for Christmas. Alfred C. Weber, financial director of the Toy Manufacturers of America Inc., a trade group, said: ''Worldwide retail sales of just one adult game, Trivial Pursuit, have passed $700 million thus far this year. Sales of related question- and-answer games, as well as such theme games as Raiders of the Lost Ark, are also adding up.'' Sales of Cabbage Patch dolls, particularly those that come with babies, are still strong, Mr. Weber noted. So are the new ''Gobots,'' toys that children can break down and reassemble in various forms. The toy makers expect wholesale sales of all toys this year to rise 12 to 15 percent from last year's $7.5 billion. That was off 1 percent from the 1982 level, partly because of the collapse in computer games, a sector still moribund.

365-> Domestic and Foreign Affairs
To the Editor: I was glad to see that you took some notice of my book ''The Marshall Plan: The Launching of the Pax Americana'' (Sept. 9) and sorry that my lack of clarity and awkwardness of style and other mistakes made it hard for the reviewer, A. W. DePorte, to focus on what I think the book is about. A great deal of the book is taken up with domestic politics, not just international affairs, and tries to give readers an opportunity to consider the interrelationships among domestic and foreign affairs. In particular, the book tries to address itself somewhat to the strain that an internationalist foreign policy places on the Republic itself. It tries to suggest that even the Marshall Plan - not an evil piece of foreign policy - played a part specifically in the rise of McCarthyism and more generally in the making of the imperial foreign policies of the past 40 years that have so strained, and in some instances destroyed, constitutional usages in America. The book tries to suggest that we ought as a nation - if we feel a certain international role is necessary or inevitable for us - to pursue our aims in the world with modesty, caution, circumspection and a respect for the lessons of the past - not only because of the effect we have on others in the world, but because of the effect our foreign policies have on freedom at home. By implication, I hope some readers might be led to consider that if even the Marshall Plan can have such unfortunate consequences, they can imagine what truly nasty foreign policies in El Salvador can, and I fear will, have. I regret that my book didn't make these points clearly, and I appreciate having the chance to try again in this note. CHARLES L. MEE JR.New York

367-> MUSIC: STRAUSS'S 'INTERMEZZO' AT SANTA FE OPERA
We in this country know so little first hand of Richard Strauss's ''Intermezzo'' that its appearance this summer at the Santa Fe Opera comes as both a surprise and a delight. According to the Santa Fe company, their production of Strauss's endearing ''opera domestica'' is the first professional one in the United States. We can only wonder where it has been keeping itself since its premiere in Dresden in 1924. ''Intermezzo,'' which alludes to an event in Strauss's own private life, centers on Christine, the wife of an eminent musician named Robert Storch. She is willful and selfish but warmly loving as well; and when she reads a billet doux misdirected to Storch but intended for a colleague with a similar name, the race for divorce is on. The progress of this opera is toward reconciliation, and the opera ends at the piano - Storch's hands on the keys and his mouth open to receive a fork full of cake from his penitent wife. Instrumental Interludes ''Intermezzo'' is a series of brief scenes each connected by instrumental interludes. The latter offer Strauss at his most attractive and ingratiating. Indeed, the orchestra is used with such skill and grace that it shines like a chamber ensemble at one moment but can burst into something much grander in the next. These brief orchestral intermezzos connect the vignettes on stage, and provide the opera's most beautiful music, so it is a shame that Friday night's audience seemed to misunderstand them so. At any rate, when the stage went dark and the orchestral bloomed, the whispering and chatter from this otherwise attentive audience more or less obliterated the effect. Adding to the problem was Santa Fe's orchestra, conducted by John Crosby, which played Friday with uncharacteristically ragged - sometimes almost crude - ensemble. Carl Friedrich Oberle has designed a bare raked stage which he alters by the addition and removal of uniformly colored sets of furniture. The chairs and tables, in bright hues moving from blue to yellow to green to red, have a ''hip'' Biedermeyer air about them, and they appear to us with each new scene in brilliant flashes of light devised by Craig Miller. Opera Sung in English Santa Fe has been wise to present this intimately conversational opera in an English translation - this one is by Andrew Porter from Strauss's own text. Not every word comes through, but the majority survive. Elizabeth S"oderstr"om is wonderful as Storch's wife. She sings with great authority and makes Christine both exasperating and appealing. Alan Titus in the role of Robert Storch and John Stewart as the chiseling young Baron Lummer were excellent. Mr. Titus must have one of the creamiest, most smoothly produced baritone voices on the opera stage today. As is usual at Santa Fe, ''Intermezzo'' has been rehearsed and performed until it works. G"oran J"arvefelt's direction creates the Storch household in all its domestic chaos and engineers a charming card game scene with the musician's cronies. What so impresses us about ''Intermezzo,'' aside from the loveliness of the music, is the depth of its characters - Strauss's clear, benevolent look at the Storches and their world, his sympathy for their nobility as well as the concommitant foolishness. Two nights earlier, the Santa Fe Opera presented Hans Werner Henze's ''We Come to the River,'' a gory condemnation of world evil. Mr. Henze wrote in his accompanying notes that ''Art is realism or it is trivial;'' and if I read this correctly, Mr. Henze would probably find ''Intermezzo'' trivial. I wonder if it really is. ''We Come to the River'' creates a landscape of abstract political ideas where not a recognizable human is to be found. It preaches humanity but dismisses people. Strauss, on the other hand, has celebrated us all with a palpability that no abstraction can approach.

AFTER 12 years of effort, the Communist Party in Connecticut will have its Presidential candidate, Gus Hall , listed on the state ballot this November. Also on the ballot will be Dennis Serrette , who is a New Jersey telephone worker running for President on the new Alliance Party ticket, according to the Secretary of the State's office. Last Tuesday was the deadline for town clerks to hand in petitions from minor parties. Minor parties had to collect the signatures of 1 percent of the state's electorate, 14,235 validated names in all, to qualify for the ballot. The Citizens Party, which put the environmentalist Barry Commoner on the state ballot in 1980, fell short this year of getting Sonia Johnson on the ballot for President. The Communists have handed in well over the required number of signatures every Presidential year since 1972, but had too many signatures disqualified by town clerks. Each year the party protested, making gains but never entirely succeeding. The changes resulting from their unsuccessful protests helped the Communists this year, according to Joelle Fishman , executive secretary of the state party. About 100 volunteers helped collect about 25,000 signatures for the Presidential ticket of Mr. Hall running with Angela Davis , as he did in 1980. The Communists spent about $700 on this year's drive. (The Libertarians, on the other hand, spent $12,000 to collect 20,000 signatures, according to the state chairman, Thomas Ross .) ''This has really been a long and tough struggle,'' Miss Fishman said. ''The changes have been very important to give voters an alternative.'' She said, though, that some people still oppose the idea that minor parties have a right to be on the ballot. She cited a recent controversy in Waterbury where local politicians called for the resignation of a State Representative who signed a petition to place Mr. Hall and Miss Davis on this year's ballot. Though many city officials were not amused and thwarted his sales, Gregory Fisher's bumper stickers and T-shirts at the recent Norwalk Oyster Festival and Boat Show ''made 150,000 people laugh - and that's worth it all,'' he said. Mr. Fisher, a 28-year-old piano rebuilder from Norwalk, recently ordered 10,000 bumper stickers and 500 T-shirts with the logo, ''Connecticut - the Unabridged State,'' featuring a sketch of a bridge with its center missing. He devised the slogan, he said, not to be sarcastic about the series of problems with bridges, but to portray Connecticut as ''unabridged, meaning the most complete of its class.'' Having watched the traffic backed up for miles as the State Transportation Department repaired the Yankee Doodle Bridge recently, he decided ''to do something for all the angry people.'' ''At least I could entertain them,'' he said. He considers the slogan ''a positive statement.'' ''It's art for humor's sake,'' he added. A jazz guitarist, Mr. Fisher owns Fisher Piano Technology in the redevelopment zone of South Norwalk, in which he tunes pianos as well as repairs their broken bridges. In fine print, at the bottom of his bumper stickers, is an advertisement for his piano-bridge repair service - a double meaning, he said, to help his business. Though he has sold only a few T-shirts and has given away many bumper stickers, all of which are printed in the state colors of blue and white, Mr. Fisher is pleased his project has entertained so many people. The T-shirt, at $6 plus $1.50 postage and handling, and the bumper sticker, at $1 with postage included, can be ordered from him at 17 Butler Street, Norwalk, Conn. 06850.

369-> FIGURES ON STATE'S HISPANIC HIRINGS DISPUTED
The State Civil Service Commission said last week that it had provided incorrect information on the appointments of Hispanic people made by Governor Cuomo and that it was exceedingly difficult to provide accurate figures. In the midst of a dispute over the percentage of Hispanic people named to positions, Cuomo aides had insisted the figure was 8 percent, rather than 4 percent as reported by a Hispanic advocacy group. ''In the final analysis,'' a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo said in March, ''we stand by the percentages of minority hirings of 8 percent for Hispanics and 10 percent by blacks.'' The Civil Service Commission was the source of the figures. But Karen S. Burstein, president of the state's Civil Service Commission, said on Friday that a subsequent analysis showed the figures she had provided were not accurate. Less Than 8, More Than 4 ''I cannot be comfortable in saying that it was 8 percent,'' she said. ''It is something less than 8 percent and somewhere more than 4 percent.'' She said that a review of a computer- generated list of 520 posts filled by the administration without Civil Service examination confirmed only 28 Hispanic appointments, a little more than 5 percent. Five additional Hispanic employees were included in her original survey in March. But of that number, she said, at least one Hispanic appointment had been ''lost on the computer'' and that four other previously counted Hispanic appointees should not have been counted for the purposes of her review. ''We are still very primitive in our data collection,'' she said. ''I don't know how many others are lost on the computers.'' Inconsistencies Charged In March, the Institute for Puerto Rican Policy, a research and advocacy group, said there were ''serious inconsistencies'' between Mr. Cuomo's stated hirings and the actual appointments, based on a list of both salaried and unpaid appointments provided by Mr. Cuomo's appointments office. ''This whole thing is a shambles in terms of their reporting,'' Angelo Falcon, the institute's executive director, said last week. ''We have no idea what the Cuomo record is at this point - except that it isn't what they said it is.'' Miss Burstein said that there was no foolproof way to count Hispanic appointments, since ethnic information is confidential, and that personnel officers ''tend to guess.'' She said the 10 percent figure for blacks was accurate. She declined to provide the policy institute with the names of those she counted as Hispanic. And after at one point offering to seek voluntary affidavits from the appointees, she decided that this could be coercive. 'A Straight Answer' ''I don't see how we can distinguish a request like yours,'' she said in a letter to Mr. Falcon, ''from one that might be made by the Nazi Party or the Ku Klux Klan. '' Mr. Falcon, responded that ''all we have been seeking for the past year has simply been a straight answer from the Cuomo administration on it Latino appointments record.'' He said that the 4 percent figure his group reported was a ''respectable number.'' Miss Burstein said that this figure was also inaccurate and that the administration was planning steps to increase the hiring of Hispanic people throughout the Government.

370-> CONNECTICUT GUIDE
GROUP FOR BIRD LOVERS Regional centers of the National Audubon Society ''have become conservation organizations, not focused on birds any more,'' said Roland Clement, a former vice president of the society. As a result, another group has been formed with the purpose of ''bridging the gap between the ornithologist and the amateur bird-watcher, who without assistance merely counts the number of sightings in a day,'' he said. The group, the Connecticut Ornithological Association, elected Mr. Clement its president during a meeting last month. To introduce itself to prospective members, the association will hold a hawk watch at Lighthouse Point Park in East Haven at 9 A.M. Saturday. Roger Tory Peterson, the well-known field-guide author and artist, will be present. Membership in the association costs $10 a year, and includes a monthly newsletter, The Connecticut Warbler. ''We are not going to compete with Audubon centers and have field trips or monthly meetings,'' said Mr. Clement. ''Our first project will be the production of a new, fully annotated checklist of Connecticut Birds - the first since 1913. ''It will take two years to compile and publish. Connecticut has no birds that are unique to the state, but it is a borderline state - its vegetation attracts birds at both the northern and southern end of their range.'' Mr. Clement, who has been a lifelong student of birds, said ''we thought we knew all about birds, but biological science is turning the whole thing around. Unsuspected relationships and relationships we had erroneously identified are being turned up as a result of D.N.A. studies.'' For example, he said, an amateur referring to a field guide would mistake an East African Long Claw for a close relative of the American Meadowlark, when they are from completely different lineages. ''But they look alike and sound alike,'' he said. A revamping of the classification of birds of the world through the study of genetic replicating molecules has been undertaken by Professor Charles Sibley of the Peabody Museum at Yale University, a founding member of the new ornithological association. The work will not be published in completed form for a year or more, Mr. Clement said. The Connecticut Ornithological Association is receiving inquiries by mail at the Birdcraft Museum, 314 Unquowa Road, Fairfield, Conn. 06430. NEW ENTREPRENEURS Whether it is done as a cottage industry, small business or just puttering around, millions of Americans have latched onto the production of crafts for fun and profit. The fun part is easy, but how to reap the profits and successfully market the product often is not. To assist entrepreneurs along those lines, the Cooperative Extension Service of the University of Connecticut and the Small Business Administration will hold a seminar from 8 A.M. to 3 P.M. Saturday at Quinnipiac College in Hamden. Addressing the audience will be a panel of men and women experienced in developing such businesses. Merle Peery, who owns Ramparts Woodcraft in Granby, will talk about ''Developing a Craft Into a Business.'' Paul Behling, a lawyer with the firm of Copelon, Schiff and Zangari, will outline ''The Legal Aspects of a Small Business.'' ''Entrepreneurship: Marketing Your Design and Product'' will be discussed by Connecticut artists and craft purveyors, including Doe Bartlett, oil and fabric artist; Martha Gold, ceramicist; Gloria Hoffenberg, stitchery artist and Sally Endleman, co-owner of the Endleman-Kraus Gallery in New Haven. The session will be moderated by Joanne Hale, owner of Captivating Characters, Cheshire. Afternoon hours will be divided into workshops: ''Tax Aspects of a Small Business'' with John Scinto, an accountant; ''Bookkeeping'' with Richard P. Silkoff of Silkoff and Malone, of New Haven; ''Marketing Your Business'' with Cheri Libby, owner of C. L. Associates, marketing consultants; and ''Presenting a Positive Image'' with Nancy Davidson, customer relations consultant. Insurance, product liability, packaging and pricing will also be covered. A registration fee of $12 includes lunch and printed materials. Call 789- 7865 or mail checks to Cooperative Extension Service, 670 Wintergreen Avenue, Hamden, Conn. 06514. WILDERNESS TRIP The Allagash wilderness of Maine, 500,000 acres located 65 miles east of Quebec, 80 miles north of Bangor and 50 miles west of Caribou, is the destination of a canoe and fishing trip to be led by the Thames Science Center of New London. Allagash is the Anglicized Indian name for the Allequash River. Departing by van on Wednesday, a dozen or so hardy souls will stay in cabins at Spider Lake, where the nighttime temperature drops to 25 degrees in September and an abundance of trout is to be had by cutting through thin ice on Chamberlin and Eagle Lakes. Whitewater canoeing down Chase Rapids, sightseeing in a float (pontoon) plane, exploring the habitats of ospreys and loons and learning about local Indian lore will be acomplished under the guidance of John McPhee, Alan Rider and Jane Holdsworth of the center staff. The all-inclusive fee is $375 and reservations may be made by calling 442-0391. ABOUT VAN GOGH Meredith Johnson, an administrator of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, will give a talk about Vincent Van Gogh from 1:30 to 3:30 P.M. Saturday at the Stamford- Greenwich Center for Higher Education of the University of Bridgeport, 6 Riverside Avenue, Greenwich. Admission is $20 and includes a ticket to the Van Gogh exhibition at the Metropolitan. The museum ticket must be used at 10 A.M. on Oct. 24, Oct. 31 or Nov. 7. Call 637-4563 for reservations and more information. IRISH HISTORY A history of the Irish in Connecticut through displays relating to immigration, politics, religion and the military, spanning a 350-year period, will be on view Monday through Jan. 15 at the Connecticut Historical Society, 1 Elizabeth Street in Hartford. In conjunction with the exhibition, a series of lectures begins at 7:30 P.M. Monday with Dr. Ray Raymond of UConn discussing ''Ireland Now, A General Overview.'' Subsequent talks by Dr. Paul Bew of the University of Belfast, Dr. Conor Johnston of Massasoit Community College, Boston, and Donna Hotaling, researcher, will cover Irish history in Connecticut, Irish literature and genealogy. Exhibition hours are from 1 to 5 P.M. daily and admission is free. 236- 5621.

372-> SHULTZ SAYS SOVIET OLYMPICDECISION IS PART OF PLAN TO 'FREEZE' TIES
Secretary of State George P. Shultz said today that the Soviet decision not to attend the Olympic Games in Los Angeles this summer was part of an overall Soviet plan to put relations with the United States ''in a sort of deep freeze.'' Today Vietnam and Mongolia, two of the Soviet Union's Asian Communist allies, joined in the Soviet-backed move to boycott the Los Angeles Games. After the Russians announced their decision Tuesday not to attend, Bulgaria and East Germany were the first two nations to follow suit. Others are expected to do the same soon. State Department officials said they had received word that Moscow was applying diplomatic pressure on certain African countries, like Ethiopia, which receive considerable aid from Moscow, to stay away from Los Angeles. Reports of Soviet Debate Some State Department officials said that there were unconfirmed intelligence reports circulating in the West that the Soviet decision on the Olympics was made after a spirited debate within the Soviet leadership. According to these reports, officials said, the Soviet K.G.B., its state security agency, as well as Dmitri F. Ustinov, the Defense Minister, and Grigory V. Romanov, who has jurisdiction over the internal security, argued strongly that the risks of defection and possible harm to Soviet participants made it necessary to avoid the Games. State Department officials also said that they had been told by East European diplomats that the East Europeans were not consulted by the Soviet Union beforehand and that the Hungarians, in particular, resented being forced into a position where they will have to go along with the boycott. Olympic Chief to Keep Trying In Lausanne, Switzerland, Juan Antonio Samaranch, the Spaniard who is president of the International Olympic Committee, said he would ''fight to the last minute,'' which is June 2, to change the minds of Soviet leaders. He said he was waiting for Soviet permission to fly to Moscow to try to speak directly with Konstantin U. Chernenko, the Soviet leader. He made public the text of a letter from President Reagan to him, pledging that the United States would fulfill all its responsibilities as host of the games. Addressing the American Society of Newspaper Editors convention in Washington, Mr. Shultz said the Soviet justifications for staying away from the Games were not credible because ''tremendous efforts have been made and continue to be made by the United States to insure the security for the Olympics and a warm welcome for the athletes.'' ''Right now,'' he said, ''we see the Soviet Union engaged in a tactic of negotiation that involves withdrawal, that involves a kind of scare campaign, and that involves a sort of deep freeze. We will not be intimidated.'' Election Seen as Factor Other Administration officials said Moscow appeared to have decided to avoid doing anything that could possibly seem to benefit President Reagan's re-election. The decision by Vietnam and Mongolia, two countries heavily dependent on Soviet military support, to stay away from the Olympics was not unexpected. It is anticipated that all the Warsaw Pact countries except Rumania will not attend. It is not known whether Cuba, which also depends on Soviet support, will also stay away. Reagan Letter on Olympics Mr. Reagan's letter to the International Olympic Committee president was dated Tuesday, the day the Russians pulled out and also the day Mr. Reagan met with Mr. Samaranch. In the letter Mr Reagan said ''the Olympic Games should not be used for political purposes.'' ''Athletes and Olympic officials of all countries will find a warm welcome in Los Angeles and will be treated equally and without discrimination,'' he said, ''in accord with the Olympic Charter and Olympic spirit.'' He also said all Federal agencies had been ordered to cooperate fully with Olympic and local officials ''to insure the safety of all participants.'' Soviet Scorns Reagan Assurances MOSCOW, May 11 - The official Soviet press agency Tass today scorned assurances given by President Reagan on the safety of athletes who will compete in Los Angeles. ''The U.S. President has issued promises and assurances whose name is legion,'' a Tass commentary said. ''In reality, however, they proved to be nothing but a fig leaf to cover Washington's perfidy.'' Efforts to persuade the Kremlin to reverse its decision gained momentum tonight with the arrival here of Mario Vazquez Rana, president of the Paris- based Association of National Olympic Committees, who was asked by Mr. Samaranch to make the trip. Says Andropov Was Better LOS ANGELES, May 11 - The head of the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee suggested today that if Yuri V. Andropov, the former Soviet leader, who died in February, were still alive, the Soviet Union would be planning to send athletes to the Games. ''The change in power there has had a very negative effect on these Games,'' said Peter V. Ueberroth, president of the Olympic Committee. He said several high-ranking sports officials in the Soviet Union were replaced by Mr. Andropov after he succeeded Leonid I. Brezhnev as the Soviet leader in 1982. From that point, Mr. Ueberroth said, relations with Soviet Olympic officials gradually improved. They reached a high point, he said, when Konstantin Andrianov, head of the Soviet delegation to the International Olympic Committee, praised preparations for the Los Angeles Games in an I.O.C. meeting at Sarajevo, Yugoslavia.

374-> KARAJAN LEADS BERLIN PHILHARMONIC AFTER TALKS ON DISPUTE
Herbert von Karajan conducted the Berlin Philharmonic's first concert of the season tonight, hours after he and musicians' representatives held preliminary talks aimed at settling a long dispute. A joint statement, issued after several hours of talks between the 76-year- old maestro and the musicians' representatives, said they had agreed ''to undertake a new beginning on the basis of partnership.'' Mr. Karajan had been boycotting the orchestra's performances since June. 'Things Can Go Forward' Rainer Zepperitz, a member of the orchestra board, said that the talks were a good beginning but that more discussions would have to follow. ''At least it has reached a point where things can go forward,'' he added. The talks were the first between Mr. Karajan and the 120-member orchestra since they began quarreling over who was empowered to name new musicians and to run the orchestra's internal affairs. At one point the dispute centered on Sabine Meyer, a 23-year-old clarinet player whose appointment to the orchestra was backed by the conductor. Mr. Karajan declined to follow the tradition of putting her membership to a vote of the other musicians. Several orchestra members objected to the hiring of Miss Meyer, saying her style of playing was not suited to the Philharmonic. She eventually resigned, but Mr. Karajan began boycotting performances in June to show his displeasure over the case. 'More Openness' The meeting today resulted in a pact to deal with future disputes with ''more openness and more sensitivity,'' Volker Hassemer, West Berlin's Minister of Culture, told reporters. Mr. Karajan had sought to break the impasse by writing a conciliatory letter to the orchestra last month, asking the musicians to perform under his baton at the Berlin Festival here this weekend. In the letter, he proposed that he and the Berlin Philharmonic, which many critics regard as the world's finest orchestra, ''resume our earlier cooperation'' by playing Bach's B minor mass. The letter implied that the stirring religious cadences of the Bach mass would be a balm to the orchestra's troubled soul. ''Then,'' said Mr. Karajan, ''the outstanding questions can be settled in greater calm and factualness.''

375-> CUTS FOUND IN U.S. WORK ON PRIVACY ISSUES
The Reagan Administration has sharply reduced the number of Federal employees working to protect individuals from improper use of public and private records, according to a report by the General Accounting Office. The office, an investigative arm of Congress, found that one staff member of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration was concentrating on privacy matters. It said 15 employees had been assigned to such problems at the peak of official interest in the subject, when President Carter was in the White House. Representative Glenn English, Democrat of Oklahoma, chairman of the House Government Operations Subcommittee on Information, said the report showed the Reagan Administration had ''dismantled'' the telecommunications office, which is responsible for developing Federal privacy policy, at a time when ''the accelerating use of computers threatens to further erode privacy rights.'' He said that public opinion polls had also found an increasing interest in the issue. Mr. English added that the public was concerned ''about the implications for personal privacy of the increasing use of Social Security numbers, whether there is a need for a national identity card, the role of computer matching, and the creation of new data banks.'' Elimination of 'Expertise' ''Instead of responding to the privacy concerns of the American people,'' he said the Reagan Administration was ''eliminating the privacy policy expertise'' in Government. David J. Markey, head of the telecommunications agency, denied that the Administration lacked concern about ''privacy protection and related information issues.'' In a letter to Representative English, Mr. Markey noted that, with the support of both the Carter and Reagan Administrations, 180 large corporations in the United States had indicated their general support of the voluntary guidelines on privacy adopted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an international body. While acknowledging that the Reagan Administration had not proposed major legislation on privacy issues, he noted that a large number of Federal statutes were on the books and that many states had privacy safeguards. 'Decline in Activity' But the General Accounting Office said it had found ''a decline in the activity and resources devoted to privacy policy matters in recent years.'' In addition to the substantial staff reduction, the investigators said that in recent years the funds earmarked for privacy activities within the telecommunications agency was about one-sixth of that budgeted for such purposes in the Carter Administration. In 1980, for example, the agency spent $639,000 on privacy matters. In 1984, it is spending approximately $100,000. Investigators said the decline in those funds was signifianctly larger than the overall budget cuts imposed on the telecommunications agency by the Administration. In 1980, the total budget for the agency was $17.6 million. In 1984, the budget had dropped to $12.8 million. The agency was established as an arm of the Commerce Department in 1978 to develop Federal communications policies. In its first two years, the investigators said, the agency was ''actively developing and coordinating domestic privacy policy initiatives''for the private sector and seeking to develop privacy policy in international commerce. Beginning in 1981, however, the report said, resources ''diminished substantially'' leaving the agency with a ''minor residual capability to respond or refer requests for information on privacy matters.'' The conclusions about the agency parallel those reached in a report by the House Government Operations Committtee last November on the privacy activities of the Office of Management and Budget. Under the Privacy Act of 1974, that office is the only other Federal agency with specific responsibilities for privacy policy.

377-> THE WORKING MOTHER AS ROLE MODEL
I found Anita Shreve's article somewhat one-dimensional since it almost exclusively deals with the positive aspects of two-career families. How do these men and women manage a normally productive workday after having been up the previous night with a wakeful child? What happens when the child is ill? Several professionals I know arrive home at 6 or 7 o'clock in the evening. Even under the best circumstances, where there is no ''take-home work'' and where, for whatever reason, dinner is ready and on the table, there remain perhaps one and a half hours for parent-child time before bedtime. A career is more than a job and human beings only have so much energy. Children need to spend time with their parents. They need the understanding that results from carefully constructed relationships and they need a supportive presence as well as role models. However good it is, long-term surrogate care means that a child spends many crucial developmental hours away from a parent. I think that the complete picture on how well adjusted and happy these children are remains to be seen. DIANE FOLEY Pittsford, N.Y.

378-> COLUMBIA LOSES IN NEW STADIUM
For the overflow crowd of tailgaters wearing Columbia blue - the old grads who were here not for a seminar but a football game, and the students who once poked fun at the players when they bothered to notice them at all - this was a homecoming day of a different sort. More than an annual reunion, this marked a return of football to Baker Field, where a crumbling, old wooden stadium was now a fond memory, and a modest new one made of concrete had taken its place on the site along the scenic Harlem River. During the pregame ceremony yesterday, Michael I. Sovesn-!uhe qresident of Columbia, and Mayor Koch saluted Lawrence Wien, the real estate investor who donated $3 million to the stadium fund-raising drive, and in whose honor the stadium is named. In a burst of enthusiasm, in which he conveniently overlooked 13 consecutive losing seasons and five consecutive losses to Harvard, Mayor Koch sounded the rallying cry that made the Lions roar. ''We're going to beat the hell out of them,'' Mayor Koch said. ''We did it when the stands were wooden. Imagine what what we can do now?'' Another 'Nice Try' Well, Mr. Wien's money and Mayor Koch's pep talk may have helped rekindle interest in Columbia's football team, but alas, there still was a game to be played. And once again, the Lions were forced to settle for ''nice try'' as Harvard won the opening game for the Ivy League schools, 35-21. It would be easy to dismiss the result as just another Columbia loss, and perhaps some of the 10,500 fans who attended more out of curiosity than a strong belief that the Lions will soon be more than the caboose that more often than not brings up the rear of the Ivy League standings. But if putting on a good show counts for anything, then perhaps Mr. Wien's money was well invested. ''For the whole university this was a big day, but for the players, it was something special,'' said Dan Upperco, the tight end who caught six passes, among them a 65-yard touchdown pass from the quarterback Henry Santos. ''You could see there was more pride out there. There was more pride out there and the players showed more heart. We wanted to win for everybody but we wanted it more for ourselves.'' The Lions' last winning season was in 1971 when they finished 6-3. They have had 19 losing seasons in the last 20. They have lost 47 of their last 54 games - among them two ties - and they won their only Ivy league championship in 1961 when they shared the title with Harvard. This is not exactly a legacy of football excellence. The decline of the program was mirrored in the steady deterioration of Baker Field, an eyesore and then a potential hazzard. ''I remember my freshman year late in the season when we played Cornell,'' Santos said. ''There was hardly anyone here and parts of the stadium already were condemned. That's why I hope the fans come back again after today. We are a good team but we tried too hard to prove it.'' First Sellout Since 1954 The capacity crowd provided the first sellout for Columbia since 1954 when 30,000 attended a game against Navy at Baker Field. This was the largest crowd since 1974 when 13,050 came to watch the Lions play Harvard. And it was the Lions' first home game since Nov. 20, 1982, after which the stadium was closed and renovation began. The Crimson have played a significant role in Columbia's football history and have not been a cooperative guest. Harvard won that game in 1974 and spoiled today's return after Columbia spent all last season on the road. ''But I was impressed,'' said Joe Restic, the Harvard coach. ''Columbia will win some games this season and scramble this league.'' Harvard won because it was able to mount the necessary scoring drives it needed after Columbia had gotten back into the game; the first came after the Lions cut their deficit to 14-7, the next when they pulled to 17-14. Late in the game, with Harvard ahead, 27-21, but the Lions in position to write a storybook ending, the linebacker Brent Wilkinson intercepted Santos' pass and returned it 45 yards for the clinching touchdown. Santiago Gains 204 Yards The running back Robert Santiago had previously done his part, gaining 204 yards and scoring two touchdowns to keep Harvard a step ahead. Trying so hard to please, the Lions were intercepted twice, lost one fumble and were penalized 10 times. Coach Bob Naso cited inexperience and, indeed, Santos, a junior, was a defensive back last season. Santos's inexperience cost the Lions a possible touchdown and changed the nature of the game at the end of the first half. An interception put Columbia in scoring range and gave it a chance to narrow the deficit to 17-14. But the poor use of time outs and the decision to try to sprint for a touchdown from the four yard line by Santos with 19 seconds remaining, left the Lions one yard from the end zone but with no time to get there. ''I lost the game up here,'' Santos said, pointing to his head. ''But we'll win. And we'll fill that stadium again.''

379-> CHUGGING THROUGH THE BERKSHIRES
Moss and ferns cover an old cut in the granite. The scent of pine needles blows in an open window. Overhead, maple branches interlace in a receding tunnel of green. ''At first I was antsy because it was so slow,'' said David Klausemeyer, a paper company executive. ''Then, when I got off I realized how tranquil it had been.'' For people who race all week, the Berkshire Scenic Railway in Lee, Mass. offers 15 miles of nature and history on the weekends at 10 miles an hour. Inaugurated in July, the railway makes three round trips each Saturday and Sunday, and links the towns of Lee, Stockbridge and Great Barrington. Each station is within a five-minute walk of the town center, and the Lee and Stockbridge stations have restaurants offering lunch and dinner. A family can make the ride a leisurely daylong excursion. The towns are easy to explore on foot, and the railroad line offers an absorbing mix of natural vistas and unexpected insights into 19th-century American history. Today's passengers contemplating stands of purple loosestrife or a quarry that supplied marble for the Washington Monument can give thanks to the underpowered steam locomotives of the 1840's. ''The surveyors in 1842 always searched for the easiest grade, so the line wanders a bit and ends up being terribly scenic,'' said James N. Parrish, a local historian whose great-grandfather was an engineer on the line from 1868 to 1938. So trains on the Berkshire line - of today and of 140 years ago - leisurely rock and sway along the path of least resistance, which in this case is the bank of the Housatonic River. The ride starts at Lee Station, a carefully restored board-and-batten building constructed in 1893. Now a restaurant, the station is ticket office and home depot for the Berkshire Scenic Railway. Maintaining a 19th-century railroad tradition, Dan Sullivan, the stationmaster, posts sports news and stock tables from The Berkshire Eagle each day on a cork board in the men's room. He has also carefully stripped black paint from the station safe, revealing two paintings - one a river scene and the other a seascape - on the front of the approximately four-by-four-foot safe. The station's yellow pine waiting room is now a pleasant dining room in which to eat before or after the train ride. Called Sullivan Station, the restaurant offers turn-of-the-century railroad fare - steaks, chops and beer - as well as sandwiches ($4 and $5) with names such as ''The Club Car,'' ''The Lionelle'' and ''The Superline Burger.'' The train theme continues in a 1941 red caboose where railroad buffs can buy blue-and- white-striped engineer caps, antique signal lamps and potholders, dish towels, aprons, quilts and calendars - all printed with the railroad motif. The railroad's locomotive is parked on a siding nearby. An industrial workhorse, it is an 80-ton, 1947 diesel General Electric Center Cab. The passenger coaches, four 1920's-vintage Erie Lackawanna coaches, rolled for decades with the New Jersey Transit Authority before coming to the Berkshires for a genteel retirement this summer. Several gallons of paint thinner and no small amount of elbow grease were used to remove decades of New Jersey grime; now the Berkshire Railway is one of the few where you can lean your arm on the windowsill without worrying about dirtying a sleeve. Volunteers stripped off coats of paint and uncovered mahagony arm rests, globe lamps with brass collars and cast-iron bases as well as two sets of clerestory windows. The seats are comfortable padded vinyl or wicker. Next season, the Sullivans hope to add a dining car. A blast from the locomotive's air horn is the signal to climb aboard (it will also become a reminder to sit in the back, after one makes the mistake of sitting directly in the horn's line of fire). During the 90-minute ride to Great Barrington, the engineer gives loud blasts at unprotected crossings, and the air horn soon loses its appeal. As passengers pull out of Lee they see on their right two houses listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The first is the Hyde House, a Federal structure built in 1793. Painted maroon and gray and standing on a knoll, the house was the home of Lee's first minister. To the left is the largely abandoned 500- foot-deep chasm of Lee Marble Company. During the second half of the 19th century, marble blocks from the quarry were shipped down the rail line to help build the Washington Monument, the Capitol and St. Patrick's Cathedral. Soon on the right, one sees the back of another National Register house, the red brick, with white trim, Merrell Tavern. The Federal-style structure was built in 1794 by Timothy Witten, a businessman who later became a general in the state militia. During the early 19th century, the tavern catered to passengers riding stagecoaches of the Red Bird line, which ran between Hartford and Albany. After decades in private hands, the house reopened in 1982 as a bed and breakfast. Immediately afterward on the right is the Hurlbut paper mill built in 1868. In the late 19th century, Lee had 18 paper mills, but the Hurlbut mill, now owned by Mead Specialty Papers, is one of only three remaining. Rolling through a wilder stretch, the train passes lily ponds where duck hunters have set decoys among the cattails and bulrushes. Stretching along the horizon to the left is Beartown State Forest where, after a long absence, black bears were spotted this year. Underbrush along the line has yet to be cut back for some of the better views and occasionally a branch slaps in an open window. Dick Hover, a conductor, discourages passengers from sticking their arms out of the windows, and in an amiable way wishes everyone a good time. Even so, some passengers insist on reaching out to pick black-eyed Susans, goldenrod and Queen Anne's lace. ''It used to be that you could ask the engineer to stop if you wanted to pick foliage in the fall,'' recalled one passenger who rode the Berkshire line in the 1920's. ''This is a real nice stretch of track,'' Mr. Hover said on a recent run. The conductor spent 15 years with Penn Central as brakeman, swingman, fireman and conductor. But after a prolonged layoff, he now drives a truck during the week for the state highway department. ''I'd go back in five minutes,'' Mr. Hover said of his life on the rails. A volunteer, he rides the Berkshire run every weekend wearing his old Penn Central cap. Shortly before pulling into Stockbridge Station, passengers can spot a single-span suspension footbridge. The bridge leads to a limestone chasm called Ice Glen and was built by the Laurel Hill Association. Founded in 1853, the association is believed to be the first village improvement society in America. In 1889, the association complained to the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad about their town's depot, which they disdained as ''an ugly little frame building.'' By the late 19th century, the Berkshire line had become chic as wealthy families from New York started building elegant summer ''cottages.'' In the pre-income tax era, Sloans, Vanderbilts and Westinghouses arrived by private railroad car to visit their estates in what was rapidly becoming a Newport in the mountains. Twelve trains a day on the line was not unusual, and the Friday night train out of Grand Central to the Berkshires was called ''The Millionaire Special.'' ''The millionaires would often have milk and eggs sent down from their farms in the Berkshires so they would arrive in New York by dinner time,'' said Mr. Parrish. In this gilded era, Stockbridge's drafty depot was no longer suitable. According to Mr. Parrish, Joseph Choate, then the Ambassador to Britain, enlisted Stanford White to draft blueprints for a new Stockbridge station. At the time, Mr. White was designing Naumkeag, Mr. Choate's summer home in Stockbridge. The result, completed in 1893, is a well-proportioned English Gothic-revival building, with blue dolomite walls and an American shingle roof. The station is now a restaurant called John Henry's. For passengers who want to explore Stockbridge, the Red Lion Inn, the Mission House and the Norman Rockwell Museum at the Corner House are a five-minute walk away. A few minutes out of Stockbridge, the single track follows the river bank in a long double-S curve. At one turn in the river, one spies water spilling over the dam of an old stone powerhouse. Built in 1907 on the fastest stretch of rapids in the area, the powerhouse was abandoned in 1948. But the energy crisis made small- scale hydroelectric projects viable again, and, in 1979, the powerhouse reopened. The train runs through a cool glade of long-needle pines, and then suddenly emerges into the sunlight. Crossing a river trestle, passengers get an unexpected view of Monument Mountain, a 1,710-foot peak. Looking downriver, one can also sight the remains of a dam for the power station of Monument Mills. In the 1890's, William Stanley, a Great Barrington native and inventor of the transformer, used this hydro station to experiment with alternating current. In 1894, he made the world's first long-distance transmission of high-voltage alternating current, sending 1,500 volts from the power station to Great Barrington, seven and a half miles away. Rising on the right, shortly after the river is crossed, is the brick complex of Monument Mills in the town of Housatonic. Monument Mills, founded in 1850 when the railroad was completed, came to reign for 60 years as the world's largest producer of woven cotton bedspreads. The first workers were Irish immigrants who had fled the potato famines of the 1840's, built the Berkshire line, and then stayed on to work in the mills. During the Civil War, Monument Mills churned out material for uniforms. Now, the partially abandoned complex recalls the earliest days of America's industrial revolution. A far cry from the today's leafy hills, Berkshire county was a national textile center in the mid-19th century. About 85 percent of the land was deforested and given over to raising sheep for wool. A few miles down the track, after crossing a flat farming plain, the train passes an oddly familiar Gothic church on the left. Built as a farmer's chapel in 1887, the deconsecrated structure gained national fame in 1969 as the home of Alice Brock in the counterculture movie ''Alice's Restaurant.'' Approaching Great Barrington, one glimpses on the left the last paper mill on the route, the Victorian towers of the Centennial Mill. Built in 1873 and now the Rising Paper Company, the mill produces what is considered to be among the finest quality rag papers in the world. The Metropolitan Museum of Art has used Rising paper to back paintings and prints in its collection. Arriving in Great Barrington, passengers disembark at the 1901 beaux arts-style station. The last train to New York rolled through in 1972, and the brick station has long since been converted into offices. However, the town, with numerous shops and restaurants, is a two-minute walk away.

380-> HARMONY IN TRADE URGED BY SHULTZ
Secretary of State George P. Shultz warned today that efforts to compel allies to abide by American sanctions and jurisdiction were causing disputes that threatened ''the moral foundation of our common defense.'' He urged the Western countries to undertake ''cooperative solutions'' to the problems. In one of the Administration's most comprehensive discussions of issues raised by ''extraterritoriality,'' the term used when one country tries to apply its laws or regulations beyond its borders, Mr. Shultz said ''disputes over extraterritoriality could become a bigger threat to our economic interests than the present concerns about tariffs, quotas and exchange rates.'' In advance of the economic conference next month in London, Mr. Shultz focused on an issue that he noted had caused more dissension than any other within the Western alliance in recent years, and defied any easy solution. Speaks to South Carolina Lawyers In a speech to the South Carolina Bar Association in Columbia, S.C., this morning, Mr. Shultz sought to portray the Administration as frank and approachable in dealing with the problem, which will be discussed in London. He offered a four-point approach to narrowing differences and preserving the fabric of the world trading system and the Western political alliance. Mr. Shultz, a former economics professor and business executive, has taken the lead within the Reagan Administration in trying to avoid repetition of the pipeline conflict of 1982. In that year, President Reagan tried to block companies in allied countries from providing equipment, made in part with American technology, to the Soviet Union for a natural gas pipeline to Western Europe. A few months after taking office, Mr. Shultz persuaded Mr. Reagan to lift the sanctions after securing an allied pledge to undertake a broad review of East-West economic policy. Another example of the problem, Mr. Shultz said, was the decision by 12 states in the United States to impose what is known as ''a unitary tax,'' by which multinational corporations are assessed state taxes on the basis of worldwide operations of the parent corporation as well as local operations. Thus, in California, which has such a tax, if a subsidiary represented 10 percent of a corporation's activities, the state would tax the corporation 10 percent of its overall profits, even if the California operation showed no profit that year. ''In my tenure at the State Department, few issues have provoked so broad and intense a reaction from foreign nations,'' he said. ''Fourteen countries submitted a joint diplomatic communication to the Department of State over this issue,'' he said. They were the 10 European Community members, Japan, Canada, Switzerland, and Australia, ''representing 84 percent of total foreign direct investment in the United States - that's $85 billion.'' Discusses Four-Point Approach In discussing the four-point approach to resolving differences, he said the first effort should be the use of diplomacy. But he said that ''harmonizing policies is not easy.'' American allies, he said, ''are strong, self-confident, and independent-minded, and they do not automatically agree with American prescriptions.'' It might be possible, he said, to agree on some pragmatic ground rules to protect the most sensitive technology. He cited the recent cooperation in intercepting computers that were being diverted to the Soviet Union. Second, he said, when diplomacy fails, the United States should apply sanctions only after ''trying to take foreign interests into account.'' The United States, he said, should be prepared ''to talk through potentially significant problems'' as soon as possible. Third, Mr. Shultz said, procedures were being developed to assure that other agencies consult the State Department ''when contemplating actions that may touch foreign sensitivities about conflicts of jurisdiction.'' This involves law enforcement and anti-trust matters, in particular, that are handled by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department, he said. Fourth, he said, the United States was discussing procedures with individual countries and internationally, through the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the United Nations, for ensuring advance consultation. Examples of Harm Done As examples of the harm done by sanctions to allied unity, he said some countries, such as Britain, had passed laws blocking companies from complying with American laws. The prospect of application of American laws has impeded new investment in this country and also has led foreign manufacturers to seek alternative sources of supply to replace American sources that are considered unreliable, he said. He said the threat of the unitary tax had led some foreign companies to delay plans to build in California. The other 11 states imposing the tax are Alaska, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Massachusetts, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oregon and Utah. Last week a panel of business and state leaders agreed that multinational corporations should not be subject to taxes earned outside the United States. Mr. Shultz said he was pleased by that.

381-> THE WORKING MOTHER AS ROLE MODEL
I read with interest Anita Shreve's important and informative article. I feel however, that the terms ''working'' and ''nonworking'' are misleading. To refer to mothers who are not employed outside the home as nonworking is not only inaccurate, but contributes to the devaluation of work outside of the home that involves child care and housework. BARBARA COHN SCHLACHET Brooklyn, N.Y.

382-> SUSPENDED LIFTER CAN ENTER TRIALS
A Federal judge today cleared the way for the world-class weight lifter Jeff Michels to compete in the Olympic trials, which begin Saturday in Las Vegas, Nev. District Judge Milton Shadur issued a temporary restraining order in a lawsuit brought by the 22-year- old Michels. The weight lifter was suspended from competition for two years last summer because a test following the Pan American Games turned up what was considered an abnormal level of the male hormone testosterone in his blood. The International Weightlifting Federation, which handed down the suspension, also stripped Michels of the three gold medals he had won at the games in Caracas, Venezuela. ''I'm happy it came out the way I wanted,'' Michels said. Michels filed the lawsuit Tuesday, contending the test results were inconclusive and that he was never given a chance to contest the suspension. He has said that levels considered abnormal at the Pan Am Games were not consistent with international standards. He had also asked for $1 million in damages. However, his attorney, Brian Rocca, said that demand would be ''re-examined.'' The United States Weightlifting Federation has protested the I.W.F. suspension. A hearing by the international body is scheduled May 21, after the Olympic trials. Judge Shadur said that, while the suspension was being appealed, it would be harmful to bar Michels from the trials. Women's Trials Set OLYMPIA, Wash., May 11 (AP) - This city of 27,000 will hold the first Olympic women's marathon trials Saturday, with the physical condition of Joan Benoit casting a shadow over the race. Miss Benoit normally would be the prohibitive favorite in the race, which will determine the three-woman United States marathon team, and two alternates. However, Miss Benoit, who holds the world's best women's time for the marathon, underwent arthroscopic surgery on her right knee April 25. This is the first time the women's marathon will be held in the Olympics. Olympia was awarded the trials by The Athletics Congress, the national governing body for track and field, at the 1982 TAC convention. If Miss Benoit falters, Julie Brown is expected to beat the rest of the field, which had to qualify at 2:51:16 or under. Miss Brown has the second- fastest qualifying time and the fastest ever in an all-women's marathon, 2:26:26. Cycle Mark Reported MOSCOW, May 11 (AP) - Lutz Hesslich, the East German sprint cyclist who won a gold medal at the Moscow Olympics in 1980, set a new world record in competition Thursday, the official Soviet press agency, Tass, said today. Hesslich completed the 200-meter outdoor trials in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi in 10.441 seconds, breaking the previous record of 10.58 seconds set by Gord Singleton of Canada in 1980, Tass said. Hesslich will not defend his Olympic title because East Germany will not participate in this summer's Games. Mark Gorski of the United States was second in 10.631. Tass said it was the first time that American cyclists were competing in the Georgian contest. Tass Corrects Report MOSCOW, May 11 (AP) - A United States volleyball squad defeated a team from the Soviet Union, 3-0, Thursday in Kharkov, Tass said today. The official news agency erroneously reported Thursday that the Soviet team had won by 3-0. Tass said in both reports that the scores were 15-10, 15-11, 15-10.

383-> JAZZ: BUSHKIN LEADS SEPTET
After saluting Louis Armstrong for the first five weeks of an engagement that will keep him in the King Cole Room of the St. Regis-Sheraton Hotel until Dec. 8, Joe Bushkin is now turning his attention for four weeks to Fats Waller. Mr. Bushkin is, like Mr. Waller, a pianist, but he and his septet are making no effort to capture Mr. Waller's musical style. His group, which lives up to its billing as ''All Stars'' - Warren Vache, cornet; Al Grey, trombone; Buddy Tate, tenor saxophone; Phil Bodner, clarinet; Major Holley, bass, and Butch Miles, drums - uses a few of Mr. Waller's tunes, such as ''Ain't Misbehavin' '' and ''Honeysuckle Rose'' as a basis for their own swinging skills. But when they are given solo features, each musician chooses material that he has honed and polished, none of it by Mr. Waller. They are, however, basic jazz selections - ''St. Louis Blues'' for Mr. Grey's growling trombone, ''Lover Man'' for a dark and breathy saxophone solo by Mr. Tate, ''After You've Gone'' for some dazzling Benny Goodman-style clarinet by Mr. Bodner. The end result is actually a salute to the Swing Era. But that's just fine, because Mr. Waller was a part of that period and Mr. Bushkin's combo is a joy to hear no matter what it plays.

385-> G.M. TO CLOSE PLANTS IN U.S. BECAUSE OF STRIKE IN CANADA
The General Motors Corporation will begin shutting down automobile assembly plants in the United States on Monday as a result of the strike at its Canadian operations, an official said today. The action will idle nearly 11,000 American workers initially, with the number likely rise next week as the closings spread. Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Canadian United Automobile Workers in Toronto said bargainers for both sides did not appear to have narrowed their differences, although talks were to continue through the weekend. Top negotiators for the union and General Motors of Canada met late this morning for what Robert White, the union leader, said was ''a sharp exchange of views.'' He said there were still ''fundamental disagreements'' over what would constitute an acceptable agreement after the two-hour meeting at the main negotiating table. Strike Felt Quickly in U.S. In Detroit, John Mueller, a General Motors official, said all the workers at the company's plants in Orion, Mich., and Moraine, Ohio, had been told not to report to work on Monday because of a shortage of parts produced in Canada. In addition, he said, assembly workers at the two Cadillac plants in Detroit and those on the second shift at the facility in Willow Run, Mich., had also been told not to report for work Monday. The 36,000 Canadian auto workers have been officially on strike since noon Wednesday, although wildcat walkouts closed some plants the night before. Because Canadian plants are the sole source of some components used in vehicles assembled in the United States, G.M. officials had said the effects of the Canadian walkout would be felt ''quickly'' on this side of the border. Harvey Heinbach, an auto industry analyst with the brokerage concern of Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner & Smith estimated the strike in Canada alone was costing General Motors about $30 million in lost profits a week. With an additional four plants closed, he said the loss would mount to more than $60 million a week. If all nine United States plants dependent on Canadian production are closed, he said, the losses would exceed $100 million a week. The Canadian section of the union, which is about one-tenth the size of the American part, has been resisting accepting an offer patterened after the contract recently ratified by General Motors in this country and signed today in Detroit. Mr. White had said the Canadians were not interested in the job security and profit sharing contained in the contracts negotiated in the United States. Instead, he said, Canadian workers are seeking a return to the 3 percent annual pay increase that was once customary in both countries, higher pension payments and a shorter work week. The Canadian strike was authorized by Owen F. Bieber, the president of the U.A.W., and the strikers in that country will be paid benefits from the strike fund of more than $500 million accumulated by the union. However, Mr. Bieber expressed the hope that the Canadian dispute might be settled quickly. The union's contract in the United States contains an innovative job-security feature, which assures the incomes of workers who lose their jobs to automation or a transfer of production overseas. It also includes a $100 million fund, jointly administered by G.M. and the union, to invest in new businesses that would employ workers displaced from automobile plants. But the wage increases average only 2 1/4 percent in the first year, and the payments, although the same amount in the second and third years, are to be paid as lump sums and not included in the wage base. Mr. White has said these provisions are not acceptable in Canada.

387-> GM 'FACTORY OF FUTURE' WILL RUN WITH ROBOTS
The General Motors Corporation said today that it planned to invest $52 million in what it calls a ''factory of the future'' - an automated, highly flexible manufacturing complex that can operate for an eight-hour shift without any human production workers. The new operation, to be housed in an existing building at the Saginaw Steering Gear division, will be in partial operation by next fall, officials said. Because the technology is so new, G.M. said, the plant will not be in full production until late 1987. ''This will be a learning laboratory where the concepts of vastly increased efficiency can be tried out in actual production, perfected, and then spread to the rest of G.M.,'' said W. Blair Thompson, G.M.'s vice president for the mechanical components group. Ralph Behler, an executive with G.M.'s advanced manufacturing engineering staff, said the new plant could advance factory technology by 5 to 10 years. Mr. Thompson said it was an effort to ''leapfrog'' advanced plants in operation elsewhere in the world, notably Japan. Although some Japanese companies already have fully automated plants, G.M. officials said their plant would be the first American venture that ties all facets of production into a master computer. Plant to Produce Axles The Saginaw plant, about 120 miles north of Detroit, will machine and assemble a ''family'' of axles for different models of cars. It will produce the complex front axles used on modern front-wheel-drive cars. Unlike the relatively simple axles on older rear- wheel-drive models, those used in front-wheel-drive cars have to allow the wheels to steer and move up and down, as well as propel the vehicle. Some 50 robots will move parts within 40 manufacturing and assembly ''cells.'' Driverless carts will move parts between cells and will transport finished products to shipping areas. Even floor-sweeping will be automated. In addition to automation, G.M. officials said, the other key feature of the plant will be its flexibility. Machines will be able to adjust to parts of different size in minutes and a central computer will be able to change a machine's functions to continue production if another breaks down. 'A Paperless Factory' The computer will also keep records, manage inventory and order raw materials. ''This is a paperless factory,'' Robert Zeilinger, the project manager, said. The emphasis on flexibility represents a change in the auto industry, where emphasis has been on fixed automation and long production runs. ''Increasingly we are seeing products with shorter life cycles, as customers seek out the new, the different and the better,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''Manufacturing must accommodate itself to rapid design changes and customization of products.'' G.M. officials said human workers would still be needed for maintenance and other tasks that require greater skills. But they conceded that far fewer production workers would be employed as the automation concepts being developed here spread throughout the company. They declined to estimate how many jobs would be eliminated. Despite the potential for job loss, officials of the United Automobile Workers union said they were supporting the project. ''This kind of thing requires less manpower, we realize that,'' said Joseph Malotke, a union representative. ''But we realize we have to cooperate or be out of business totally.''

390-> AROUND THE NATION; Banks Will Reimburse Texas Robbery Victims
Two banks have changed their policies, saying they will reimburse customers who are forced at gunpoint to make withdrawals from automatic teller machines. The banks' policies on theft from the machines came under scrutiny after a rash of robberies here, the authorities said. A rapist forced three women to make cash withdrawals ranging from $140 to $500 from the machines and a man was robbed of his card, his secret access code and $500 by a man poking a gun in his ribs. Texas Federal Savings and the Union Bank and Trust Company, which refused earlier this month to reimburse three victims, have refunded customers' stolen money and will make compensations in the future, bank officials said.

392-> BASEBALL; SURGING ORIOLES DOWN MARINERS BY 4-1
Kirk Gibson's bases-loaded single drove in two runs during a five-run first inning as Detroit beat the Oakland A's, 8-4, in a rain-shortened game tonight. The Tigers have now won 30 of their first 35 games. Dan Petry (6-1) allowed seven hits, walking two and striking out four in the five and one-third innings that the game lasted. With one out, Alan Trammell started the Tigers' first-inning spurt by being walked by Bill Krueger (1-1) Barbaro Garbey singled and both moved up on a double steal. Trammell scored on Lance Parrish's infield single just inside the bag at third, and Larry Herndon singled Garbey across. After Darrell Evans grounded out, Chet Lemon was given an intentional walk to load the bases. But Gibson singled to score Parrish and Herndon, and Marty Castillo singled Lemon home to give the Tigers a 5-0 lead. Rangers 2, Royals 1 KANSAS CITY, Mo. (UPI) - Gary Ward's two-run eighth-inning homer spoiled George Brett's brilliant debut. Brett, activated earlier in the day after missing the first 33 games with torn knee ligaments, stroked two singles and a double, drew a walk and scored the Royals' run. After inducing Curt Wilkerson to ground out to open the eighth inning, the Kansas City starter, Bud Black (4-3), allowed a sharp single to left by Billy Sample, then surrendered Ward's towering shot over the 380-foot sign in left field. Dave Stewart scattered five hits over seven innings to win his second straight after an 0-6 start. Brett doubled into the left-field corner in his first at-bat in the first inning and gave Kansas City a 1-0 lead when Hal McRae followed with a loop single to right. Willie Wilson played his first home game after being reinstated this week from a drug-related suspension and went 0-for-4. The 27,573 fans gave him a standing ovation. Orioles 4, Mariners 1 BALTIMORE (AP) - Eddie Murray hit his eighth home run and Storm Davis gave up only six hits as Baltimore got its 16th victory in 20 games. Davis (4-0) struck out six batters in dealing Seattle its fifth straight loss. The 22-year-old right-hander completed his third game in his last four starts and lowered his earned run average to 1.56. After Al Bumbry opened the first with a double, Murray smacked Jim Beattie's first pitch far over the right-field wall. Blue Jays 4, White Sox 3 TORONTO (AP) - Dave Collins broke a sixth-inning tie with a double and Damaso Garcia got three hits, stole two bases and scored a run to spark Toronto. Alfredo Griffin beat out a bunt to lead off the Toronto sixth and took second on a groundout. Collins then excuted a hit-and-run, doubling into the gap for the winning run. Jim Clancy (3-3) went six and two- thirds innings, walked three and struck out four. A rookie left-hander, Jim Key, earned his second save. Twins 8, Red Sox 3 MINNEAPOLIS (UPI) - Tim Teufel hit a home run and singled in another run, and Tom Brunansky rapped a three-run double Friday night to lead Minnesota. The Twins scored five runs in the first inning off Mike Brown (1-5).

393-> AROUND THE WORLD; Nobel Prize Group Asks Soviet to Free Sakharovs
The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which awards the Nobel Peace Prize, sent a letter today to Konstantin U. Chernenko, the Soviet leader, asking him to allow Andrei D. Sakharov and his wife, Yelena G.

395-> Alternate to Race at Indy
Chris Kneifel today became the first alternate driver added to the Indy 500 field since 1929. He replaces Jacques Villenueve of Canada, who suffered a concussion after crashing last week during a practice run. After the track doctors ruled that Villeneuve had not recovered enough to compete, the owner of his car withdrew from the race. The vacant spot went to Kneifel, who will start from the 33d and last position. But his entry into the race created a statistical oddity: He is the only driver who did not average 200 miles an hour in this year's qualifying heats. He missed it by a fraction, and raceway officials reported today that the average speed for all drivers had thereby been reduced by .006 miles an hour, to 203.686. The defending champion, Tom Sneva, and his 32 rivals in Sunday's big race flashed more speed today as they shot around the two-and- a-half-mile oval track during the final practice session. Rick Mears hit 208 miles an hour, Mario Andretti was next at 206 and Sneva reached 205. They were chiefly interested in testing their cars, not high speeds.

397-> FILM: DEPALMA EVOKES 'VERTIGO' IN BODY DOUBLE
BRIAN DE PALMA goes too far, which may be not only the most consistent quality through all his films but also the most important and, possibly, the most endearing. Each of his films is guaranteed to offend some of the people all of the time, including his staunchest admirers. He never leaves well enough alone. He's someone at an otherwise friendly dinner party who can't keep himself from saying the one thing that will infuriate everybody. It's as if he were daring the host to ask him back. Mr. De Palma's early, independently made comedies, including ''Hi, Mom'' and ''Greetings,'' set standards for informed rudeness and bad taste that many of us continue to remember with fondness. When he turned to horror films, his ebullient satire occasionally put off the very audiences for which the films were supposedly made, though the on- screen demolition of John Cassavetes' head in ''The Fury'' set a standard for sheer gore that other, less talented directors are still imitating. His ''Dressed to Kill'' and ''Blow Out'' unashamedly quoted from the films of Alfred Hitchcock, and when last year he remade ''Scarface,'' he couldn't resist ending it with a comic- book Gotterdammerung that produced helpless laughter in part of the audience and outrage in everyone else. ''Body Double,'' opening today at the United Artists Twin and other theaters, again goes too far, which is the reason to see it. It's sexy and explicitly crude, entertaining and sometimes very funny. It's his most blatant variation to date on a Hitchcock film (''Vertigo''), but it's also a De Palma original, a movie that might have offended Hitchcock's wryly avuncular public personality, while appealing to his darker, most private fantasies. The new film, written by Robert J. Avrech and Mr. De Palma, is a murder mystery that has the effect of sending up the kind of sleaziness that Paul Schrader found so solemnly significant in ''American Gigolo.'' It's about Jake Scully (Craig Wasson), an aspiring but none too promising Hollywood actor who, when first seen, is in process of being fired from his first big break, playing an androgynous vampire in a third-rate horror flick. Jake's problem is that he has claustrophobia and panics every time he has to climb into his movie coffin. When he gets home that afternoon he finds his girlfriend in bed with another man. That's bad enough but, as he reports later, she was positively glowing. Says the morose Jake, ''She never glowed with me.'' Having no place to live, Jake accepts a house-sitting offer from Sam (Gregg Henry), a fellow actor who's off for a job in Seattle. It's not exactly an ordinary house. It perches like a giant spaceship atop a cement column on a hillside overlooking Los Angeles. It also comes equipped with a high-powered telescope and something very special to watch. Each night at the same hour, as Sam shows Jake, the beautiful, dark- haired young woman in the house just below puts on a sort of modified, one- woman porn show, possibly knowing that telescopes all over the neighborhood are trained on her. Night after night Jake watches for the pleasure of it - he's a far less respectable Peeping Tom than the one played by James Stewart in ''Rear Window.'' In time Jake falls in love with the woman who is, it turns out, a battered wife whose name is Gloria (Deborah Shelton). Jake also comes to realize that someone else is watching Gloria and that, indeed, someone is out to murder her. It's difficult to say any more about the story without giving away its secrets, though ''Body Double'' does give one of its main secrets away rather sooner than it means to. However, the film's secrets are not as important to one's enjoyment as the spectacle of poor Jake's dogged pursuit of answers, a journey that introduces him to the world of porn films. In particular, it introduces him to Holly (Melanie Griffith), a pretty, model-thin, absolutely up-front porn actress who has some of the comic candor of a contemporary Billie Dawn in a punk hairdo. Mr. Wasson (''Four Friends'') is extremely good as Jake, a guy whose code of honor doesn't prevent him from accepting a job in a porn film in order to get to the bottom of the mystery. In spite of his actions, Jake goes through these adventures radiating down-home decency, which is funny for being so out of place. Miss Shelton hasn't a great deal to do but she is a lovely victim, even when Mr. De Palma upstages her and Mr. Wasson by photographing them in their first - and last - embrace in one of those lyrical, 360-degree pan-shots that prompt laughter for the way they so brazenly evoke Hitchcock. Though she comes into ''Body Double'' quite late - initially as the star of a film-within-the-film titled ''Holly Does Hollywood'' - Miss Griffith is the movie's real focal point. The daughter of Tippi Hedren, of Hitchcock's ''Birds,'' Miss Griffith gives a perfectly controlled comic performance that successfully neutralizes all questions relating to plausibility.

398-> BASEBALL ; ; A's Beat Orioles, Then Drop Boros OAKLAND, Calif., May 24 (AP) - The Oakland A's defeated the Baltimore Orioles, 3-2, today even though they committed two errors and collected only six hits. But the victory did not save the job of Manager Steve Boros, who was dismissed less than an hour later.
Jackie Moore, the A's first-base coach, was named by the club's president, Roy Eisenhardt, as the new manager. The pitching coach, Ron Schueler, also was dismissed. Eisenhardt said Boros and Schueler both were offered other jobs in the organization. Wes Stock, a former A's pitching coach who began this season as a minor league instructor, was named to succeed Schueler. Boros, 47 years old, became manager after the 1982 season, following the dismissal of Billy Martin. It was his first major league managing job. Dave Kingman's bases-loaded sacrifice fly in the eighth inning gave the A's the victory. The club is 14-7 at home but only 6-17 on the road. Boros received the news in a 20- minute meeting with Eisenhardt, Executive Vice President Wally Haas and Alderson. Cubs 10, Braves 7 Cubs 7, Braves 5 CHICAGO (AP) Chicago Cubs got the better of the 53 hits in Wrigley Field, including six of the seven home runs, to sweep a doubleheader. Leon Durham ripped a pair of three-run homers and the Cubs held on to take the opener after leading 9-0 going into the seventh inning. In the second game, Ron Cey smacked a three-run homer and Jody Davis added a solo shot. It gave the Cubs their longest winning streak of the season, at six games, and it was the Cubs' first doubleheader sweep in almost four years and solidified their hold on first place in the National League East. Phillies 4, Dodgers 3 PHILADELPHIA (UPI) - Len Matuszek's bases-loaded infield single with two out in the ninth scored Juan Samuel from third base to give Philadelphia the victory. With one out, Samuel tripled to right center off Pat Zachry (2-1). After Greg Gross and Mike Schmidt were intentionally walked, Sixto Lezcano struck out swinging for the second out. Matuszek then hit a 2-2 pitch up the middle that the second baseman Steve Sax was able to glove, but his throw to the shortstop Bob Bailor to force Schmidt was not in time and Samuel scored. Pirates 5, Reds 1 PITTSBURGH (UPI) - Lee Lacy smashed a solo home run and Lee Mazzilli and Dale Berra drove in two runs to lead Pittsburgh. Larry McWilliams gave up eight hits and two walks but struck out 10. Rangers 4, Brewers 3 ARLINGTON, Tex. (AP) - Dave Hostetler's fourth-inning solo homer backed Dave Stewart's six-hit pitching for Texas. Hostetler hit the first pitch in the fourth into the left field stands for his second homer of the season, giving Texas a 4-2 lead.

403-> GEORGE CHAFFEE, 77, DANCER, BALLET TEACHER AND COLLECTOR
George Chaffee, a ballet dancer, teacher and a prominent collector of ballet materials, died yesterday at Roosevelt Hospital after suffering a stroke. He was 77 years old. After dancing with the ballet companies of Michel Fokine and Mikhail Mordkin, Mr. Chaffee became a leading star of the Metropolitan Opera Ballet in the late 1930's. He also headed his own chamber ballet company, but he was best known for his lecture-demonstrations on French Romantic ballet. In the late 1940's Mr. Chaffee wrote a regular column, Balletophile, for Dance Magazine. His collection is part of the New York Public Library Dance Collection at Lincoln Center and was exhibited in various New York museums. Born in Oakland, Calif., Mr. Chaffee studied with leading ballet teachers in Europe and the United States and taught for 33 years at his own studio on West 56th Street. Among his students were Alicia Alonso and John Gilpin. He was well known for his collection of dance lithographs, drawings, painting, sculpture and books on the history and art of ballet over five centuries. He also wrote on dance history for Dance Magazine, Dance News, Lincoln Kirstein's Dance Index and the Dance Encyclopedia. In 1948, Mr. Chaffee organized ''A Retrospective Exhibit of the French Court and Opera Ballet (1851 to 1948),'' shown at the French Embassy in New York in connection with the first visit to the United States of the Paris Opera Ballet. Almost all of the 100 items were from his collection, and represented only a fraction of his holdings. The following year Mr. Chaffee was decorated by the French Government with the Palmes Academique. Mr. Chaffee is survived by three brothers, Porter Myron, Jess and James, all of California.

404-> WESTERN JOURNAL ; THEY RELY ON WATER OR STEAM
Mayor Dianne Feinstein's all-out campaign to persuade the Navy to pick San Francisco as the home port of the U.S.S. Missouri has run into resistance from some other local politicians and opponents of nuclear weapons. In one sense the 40-year-old battleship is a relic of World War II. After decommissioning in 1955, she was mothballed in Sinclair Inlet at Bremerton, Wash., until May, when she was towed to Long Beach, Calif., for recommissioning. In those years thousands visited the Missouri to see the small museum built into a deckhouse to commemorate the signing of the Japanese surrender in 1945 and hear a recording of Gen. Douglas A. MacArthur's words at that time. But when she comes out of the shipyards in 1986, the Missouri will be a modern warship, equipped with rockets. While the Navy says only that the Missouri will probably be ''nuclear capable,'' opponents of having her based here say the rockets will be nuclear-armed Tomahawk missiles. ''This issue has been on my conscience for more than a year, this homeporting of nuclear vessels,'' Representative Sala Burton, Democrat of California, said last month in announcing opposition to berthing the ship here. Richard Hongisto, a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, agrees. The Missouri is a sister ship to the Iowa, whose stationing in New York Harbor has also drawn protests. A third battleship of the Iowa class, the New Jersey, is stationed at Long Beach, while the future of the fourth ship of the class, the Wisconsin, has not been decided. Honolulu, where nuclear-armed naval vessels of all sorts commonly pass in and out of Pearl Harbor, also seeks to be the Missouri's home port. Long Beach is in the running, too. Mayor Feinstein said the Missouri and five smaller vessels that will be in a surface action group will have an annual payroll of $125 million. ''This is our opportunity,'' the Mayor said when she started her campaign this fall to get the Missouri stationed here. ''We have a deepwater port that's been moribund for years. This offers us the largest new blue-collar resurgence we've had in the last decade.'' The Navy's decision is expected next month. Last year the Puget Sound cities of Seattle and Everett, Wash., were asked by the Navy for concessions that would entice the assignment of one or the other as the anchorage and home port for a 15-ship task force that would be built around the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Nimitz. Seattle listened to requests that included building a power substation. Through Mayor Charles Royer and the elected members of the Seattle Port Commission, it replied, ''no thanks.'' But Everett, which had been asked for dredging and other considerations, seized the proposition. Then began a strong countercurrent in which various groups urged the city to reconsider, to think of a demand for rental housing that would overwhelm Everett's supply, of increased school costs, of nuclear dangers and even of rowdy sailors. On Tuesday the City Council asked voters of Everett if they wanted the city to be the Nimitz group's home port. The answer was 68 percent yes, 32 percent no. There will be a sweat lodge at the McNeil Island penitentiary. State officials in Washington have promised it after meeting with Indian leaders who spoke in behalf of Indians confined in the state prison. There are 24 Indian reservations in Washington, a state with 58,000 native Americans, 1.4 percent of its population. There are about 250 Indians among the 6,500 state prison inmates. Among them, native American religious practices are on the rise. ''Central to this religious practice is the right to sweat,'' said Donald Moore, correctional program administrator. ''It is a complicated concept, but as I understand it, the idea is that a purification is reached by sweating. This idea of purification is central to many other religions.'' Rituals vary from tribe to tribe, but almost always a sweat lodge is a part of the ceremony, he said. The one in the prison yard at the Walla Walla Penitentiary is like a tepee, with saplings set into the ground and covered with a canvas. Prison administrators designate one Indian as the ''keeper of the fire,'' and he is allowed to go to the sweat lodge ahead of the others. When the keeper of the fire is ready, other members of the religious group are allowed to go to the lodge and help roll the heated rocks inside, where water is spilled on them to create steam. Then the Indians chant and follow rituals advised by Joe Washington, a member of the Lummi tribe, who has been retained by the prison authorities to create an acceptable ritual drawn on the ceremonies of various tribes, just as the construction of the sweat lodge followed some, but not all, of any of several tribal designs. ''We believe it is very beneficial to the inmates when conducted under the guidance of bona fide native American religious leaders,'' said Mr. Moore. ''Most of those who choose native American religion in prison are young offenders who have had little contact with their culture on the outside. This seems to do something for them.''

405-> THE REGION; F.B.I. Gets Order For Hair Samples
A Federal judge has ruled that investigators can take handwriting and hair samples from five suspected radicals, including one arrested in the slaying of a New Jersey state trooper. Chief Judge Frank J. Battisti of the Northern District of Ohio authorized the sampling in an order Friday. A spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, John Sommer, said the bureau hoped to use the sampling, to begin Tuesday, to help link the suspects to a variety of terrorist activities in New England. The suspects, who remained in Cuyhoga County Jail in Cleveland today, were arrested Nov. 4 in northeast Ohio. The F.B.I. claims they are members of a New England-based radical group, the Sam Melville- Jonathan Jackson Unit. One of the suspects, Richard Williams, 37 years old, of Beverly. Mass., is wanted in connection with the slaying of the New Jersey state trooper, Philip Lamonaco, in December 1981. Besides Mr, Williams, Raymond Luc Levasseur, 38, of Sanford, Maine; Jaan Karl Laaman, 35, of Muenster, West Germany; Mr. Levasseur's wife, Patricia Gros, and Mr. Laaman's wife, Barbara Courzi, are being held.

406-> WASHINGTON WATCH; Synthetic Fuels Mystery
It looks as if the battered Synthetic Fuels Corporation, immobilized for the last seven months for lack of directors, is about to get back in business. Just who will be calling the shots, however, remains a mystery. Will it be Edward E. Noble, the current chairman, who as head of President Reagan's 1980 transition team for the corporation, recommended abolishing the infant organization? Or might it be four-term Representative Tom Corcoran, an Illinois Republican, who sponsored legislation this year to wipe it out? With the election over, most people expect Mr. Reagan to move shortly - perhaps this week - to make recess appointments, installing three directors who could serve for up to a year without confirmation by the Senate. This would give the board, which now has only two of its seven slots filled, the quorum it needs to make policy decisions. The three are Mr. Corcoran, who lost a primary challenge to Senator Charles H. Percy; Paul W. MacAvoy, dean of the Graduate School of Management at the University of Rochester, and Eric Reichl, an engineering consultant who was formerly president of the Conoco Coal Development Company. For a time Mr. Corcoran was led to believe that the Administration had decided to make him chairman. Mr. Noble has been widely criticized for weak leadership and the cronyism that led to a number of resignations involving alleged conflicts of interest. But Mr. Noble shows no sign of leaving his $69,630-a-year job, and the game now is to figure out what post Mr. Corcoran will get. Until now, all directors have been part-timers, paid just $10,000 a year, and the retiring Congressman needs full-time employment. One possibility is the now-vacant post of president, which was worth $135,000 a year to its previous holder, Victor M. Thompson Jr., who was forced out last spring. More likely, however, is that a new job will be created - either vice chairman or full-time director. In either of these, Mr. Corcoran would be a powerful figure, one who could succeed Mr. Noble later. Both Mr. Noble and Mr. Corcoran now say they support the agency's role as catalyst in building an American synthetic fuels capability.

407-> WASHINGTON WATCH; Volcker Remark Reviewed
When Paul A. Volcker was nominated by President Reagan in mid-1983 for a second four-year term as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, he told the Senate that he might not serve out the full four years. That remark sometimes has been taken to mean that Mr. Volcker said he would resign next year, after the inauguration. He said no such thing, says a loyal Volcker associate, and the hearing transcript bears that out. In fact, adds the associate, ''I think he's going to serve out his term.'' Maybe he is. And maybe the loyal associate seeks to dispose of a canard that could make Mr. Volcker prematurely lame.

408-> TAX CODE CHANGE WILL RAISE SOME TAX BILLS, SENATORS SAY
Two Republican Senators, Bob Dole of Kansas and Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, predicted today that Congress would alter the tax code in a way that would increase tax payments for some Americans. Both Senators, who are among those competing to succeed the retiring Senator Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee as Senate majority leader, said any move to change the tax code would mean some people would pay more. They appeared on the ABC News program ''This Week.'' Mr. Dole, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which is in charge of tax proposals, predicted simplification ''phased in over a period of years'' would pass Congress. He said President Reagan was ''not going to raise taxes on individual incomes.'' ''If you have a big loophole out there you're using, you're sheltering income, you ought to pay more taxes,'' Mr. Dole said. ''I think the President is going after that.'' Reagan 'Misspoke' Mr. Dole said he did not know if the Federal tax deduction for state income taxes would be among the loopholes to be closed, but he predicted that indexing, which prevents taxes from rising with inflation, would survive. Mr. Lugar said Mr. Reagan ''misspoke'' in saying individuals would not pay higher taxes. Mr. Reagan promised in his re-election campaign that he would not support increases in taxes paid by individuals, but would consider simplification of the tax system. ''He did not think through all the implications,'' Mr. Lugar said. ''Clearly, in the event you've got a huge national tax bill, someone is going to claim they are paying more and they'll be right.'' Increase Not Ruled Out LONDON, Nov. 11 (AP) - Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan is refusing to rule out cuts in defense and Medicare or a tax increase as part of the effort to trim the national budget deficit. ''Well, what we're saying is tax increases only as a last resort,'' Mr. Regan said in an interview today on ''The Business Program'' of Britain's commercial television channel. In the interview, taped Thursday, Mr. Regan said he was confident the Reagan Administration would find plenty of fat in the budget. Asked whether the cuts would include military spending, Mr. Regan noted that Congress had limited the rate of growth in military spending in 1983 and 1984. ''I would suggest that that's an area that should be looked at,'' he said. Mr. Regan said Medicare, too, should be examined to determine ''how to control some of those costs.'' Operating Costs Stressed WASHINGTON, Nov. 11 (AP) - Mr. Regan's spokesman, Alfred Kingon, said the Secretary's remarks in London did not mean to suggest benefit cuts, only cuts in the costs of operating the program.

409-> OUTDOORS; CONSOLATIONS ARE RICH
WENTWORTH LOCATION, N.H. My goal, in addition to bagging a deer, on our first day of hunting in this remote wilderness area in northeastern New Hampshire, was to have a look at Lamb Valley Pond, but I accomplished neither. I wanted to visit the pond because it is one of the several back-country trout waters in the region that I would someday like to fish. Finding the pond, which is about two miles upstream from the confluence of the brook that flows from it with the Dead Diamond River, represented no special challenge: I could simply have followed the brook all the way. I rejected that approach, because the alders and other bushes and young conifers along the brook and on an overgrown trail beside it were so thick I couldn't have seen an elephant, let alone a deer, 50 feet away. Trying to sensibly blend my two aspirations, I struck off on a westerly compass course along the lower slopes of Round Mountain, where the forest opened up into a mixture of conifers and hardwoods. There were deer and moose signs, both tracks and droppings, and on one sapling there was a rubbing made by a buck within the last few days. As is my usual fashion, I hunted hard and moved as silently as wood smoke the first hour, but then began to think of other things - lines of poetry, snatches of arias, deeds left undone, promises not kept - and soon was walking rapidly, sticks breaking underfoot and branches slapping against my clothing, thereby announcing my arrival to whatever wildlife lay before. Finally becoming aware of this, I sat on a boulder in the midafternoon gloom of some ancient, dripping hemlocks (it had rained hard the day before, and a light mist was falling) and had a pipe. The other hunters in our party - my brother Dan and my sons Steve and Jeff - were southwest of me, and when a rifle coughed in the distance from that direction I wondered if one of them had been successful. That speculation was ended a moment later when five more shots were ripped off in less than two seconds. My sons carried lever-action rifles and my brother a bolt action, and what I had heard had to have come from a semi-automatic. I arose and moved on until I reached the head of a valley from which, according to my map, the pond lay about a mile to the north. I descended into the valley and was probably less than half a mile from my destination when I once again entered a tangle of alders. It was clear to me that if I shot a deer of respectable size in that spot, it would take the four of us half the following day to get it back to camp. I abandoned my quest to visit the pond and began my return to the Dead Diamond. During that walk, I put up one small deer and one large one. I did not see them, but heard both take off and found their tracks. I reached the river shortly before dusk, and about 40 yards away on the far shore a magnificent bull moose and a yearling bull were grazing on aquatic vegetation. They hadn't seen or heard me, so I grunted at them to see what they would do. They looked in my direction - standing motionless for about three minutes - resumed feeding, looked again and then ambled upriver, crossing it about 100 yards above me and vanishing into the alders. New Hampshire, I should add, has no moose-hunting season. Making no further effort to move quietly, I thrashed my way down river through alders and young hemlocks to where the others were waiting for me at the spot where we had canoed across the river that dawn. Only Steve had seen a deer, near the summit of Round Mountain, but it had been a doe and we were hunting during the bucks-only portion of the New Hampshire season. The temperature had been dropping all afternoon and our cabin was cold when we reached it, but 40 minutes later a hardwood fire in its logging stove had us in our undershirts as we dined. By 6 o'clock, the dishes were done and, as is usually the case when one moves into the undemanding silence of the woods, there was a slight sense of astonishment that between then and bedtime there was nothing to do but read or talk. Good talk came - occasionally halted while we listened to weather reports on our battery radio - and shortly before midnight a light snow began to fall, amounting to an inch and a half before it stopped near sunup. Exhilarated by our good fortune - snow not only makes for better tracking, but enables one to spot deer more easily - we hunted from dawn to dusk the next day, but without success. The only bright moment came when a fisher intent on hunting red squirrels passed less than 30 yards from Jeff. A large (8 to 12 pounds) dark brown weasel, the animal has a principal range in this country that includes the northern portions of Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont, and the Adirondacks. Its pelt is extremely valuable, and there is a short hunting and trapping season, from Dec. 3 to 17, for it in New Hampshire, where it has made a strong comeback in recent years. ''Even if the season had been open, I wouldn't have shot it,'' Jeff said. ''It was a beautiful animal.'' The following morning - and we had only a half day to hunt - we discovered that there were many deer in an area between the cabin and the river that we had hitherto ignored. We hunted that spot until early afternoon, feeling certain that at least one of us would succeed, but the animals eluded us. At one point, Steve and Jeff even patrolled a short section of the stream in our canoe. One may hunt deer from boat or canoe in New Hampshire, but deer may not be shot on an island or while they are in the water. We did not depart disconsolately, however. We had found a new area to hunt, and, while dining at the Errol Restaurant in Errol, about 15 miles south of where we left the woods, we made plans to visit the place next year. That restaurant is always part of my ritual in a visit to the region. It offers nothing fancy, but the food and service is first rate. Once, some 200 miles south of Errol, I discovered that I had left my battered but highly prized Irish tweed hat there. They mailed it to me at home. One pleasant surprise awaited us on the drive home. Shortly after crossing the Connecticut River into Vermont on Route 2 from Lancaster, N.H., a large, dark gray bird swept out of the forest before us, visible for perhaps three seconds. The sun had set, but there was enough light to identify it as a falcon. Its size and coloration convinced us that it was a gyrfalcon, the largest and most powerful of its species, a bird that spends most of its time in the Arctic but occasionally ventures into the northern United States.

411-> RUCKELSHAUS SAYS E.P.A. IS IMPROVED
Bidding farewell to employees of the Environmental Protection Agency, William D. Ruckelshaus said today, ''The agency is no longer in trouble.'' Mr. Ruckeleshaus took over as Administrator of the agency in May, 1983, when it was in a crisis after the resignation of his predecessor, Anne McGill Burford, and virtually all other political appointees. The resignations came amid Congressional investigations into charges of wrongdoing in the management of toxic waste programs. The agency was widely viewed at the time as demoralized and floundering. Today, he told hundreds of employees packed into the auditorium of George Washington University for an awards ceremony, ''Our programs have momentum, our resources are up. I couldn't feel better about the E.P.A.'' Operating Budget to Be Frozen The White House announced Mr. Ruckelshaus's resignation last week, and he is scheduled to depart from the agency on Jan. 5. He assured the employees that reports he was leaving because the White House planned to chop the agency's budget by 30 percent were incorrect. In fact, he said, he had been told at a White House briefing yesterday that the operating budget would be frozen at current levels. Cuts are being contemplated for the $2.4 billion a year program administered by the agency to help states and localities build sewage treatment plants, he said. Referring to the the gas leak from a pesticide plant in Bhopal, India, Mr. Ruckelshaus told the workers that death toll ''is a grim reminder'' of the importance of protecting the environmental. ''The lives of Americans are tied up in how well we do our jobs,'' he said. An Affectionate Send-off The workers gave Mr. Ruckelshaus an affectionate send-off, with a standing ovation before and after his speech and cheers in between. A hand-lettered sign hung from the proscenium of the auditorium's stage said: ''Thanks Bill!'' Mr. Ruckelshaus had a few words for Lee M. Thomas, who was selected as the next chief of the agency at his suggestion. ''You get two days in the sun at the E.P.A.,'' he said, ''once when you come and once when you leave. Every day in between it rains on you.'' In a separate development, the agency has published a list of ''E.P.A. Accomplishments'' for the fiscal year ended on Sept. 30. Among the accomplishments it pointed to was the fact that the agency had achieved its second highest number of enforcement activities in history in carrying out the anti- pollution laws. According to the report the agency issued 3,036 administrative orders and referred 240 civil and 31 criminal actions to the Justice Department during the year. Before Mr. Ruckelshaus took office, the number of enforcement actions taken by the agency had fallen and he found it necessary to berate the enforcement staff for not producing enough results. The report also claimed substantial progress in developing and enforcing rules to for cleaning the air and water and protecting citizens from the hazards of toxic substances. In many cases, it said, the agency had surpassed its own targets for moving ahead on environmental programs. The report also admitted to a few failures including an inability to meet goals for requiring industries to clean up their waste water before discharging the water into municipal sewage systems.

412-> THEATER:ALVIN EPSTEIN IN BECKETT'S 'ENDGAME'
''NOTHING is funnier than unhappiness,'' says one of the world's last survivors in Samuel Beckett's ''Endgame.'' This is not loose talk. ''Endgame'' is as grim as any classic of the modern theater - far bleaker than its predecessor and companion, ''Waiting for Godot'' - and yet it is monstrously funny. The game the characters play in their shabby little bunker may resemble an endless, stalemated chess match, but it is also one of the most fiendish Laurel and Hardy routines ever devised. As the despotic blind man, Hamm, and his quivering servant, Clov, beat their heads against their walls both literally and spiritually, Beckett creates verbal slapstick out of the miserable business of existence. In ''Endgame,'' the task of being alive is every bit as antic and terrifying as getting a grand piano down a flight of stairs. It's no surprise that the play's revival at the Samuel Beckett Theater is in touch with the author's gallows humor. The director and co-star is Alvin Epstein, who was Clov in Alan Schneider's original American production of ''Endgame'' in 1958. This time, Mr. Epstein plays Hamm to Peter Evans's Clov. The two actors, both of sterling quality, work well together; Mr. Epstein's staging is keenly sensitive to every nuance of the text. Still, there's a difference between an ''Endgame'' that wants to be funny and one that actually is funny. Though there's not an errant move in this wholly conscientious version, the results have a dusty whiff of artiness about them. The evening sometimes plays as if it were an academic simulation of a model ''Endgame'' instead of the genuine article. What makes Hamm and Clov comic and tragic is their efforts to keep going - even though they're specks in a void where there's no hope of salvation (or of the arrival of a Godot). Outside the walls of their soot-colored room is nothing but desolation - ''zero and zero and zero.'' As we are constantly reminded, there are no more gods, bicycles, rugs, navigators, sugar plums, pain killers or even coffins. There is, however, plenty of time; the end is near, but refuses to arrive. As if subjected to water torture, Hamm and Clov endure time ''grain by grain'' - vainly hoping that the moments will ''mount up to a life.'' ''You're on earth, there's no cure for that,'' says Hamm. ''I say to myself that the earth is extinguished, though I never saw it lit,'' says Clov. Hamm and Clov pass the time by enacting a farcical sadomasochistic relationship. Though Hamm can neither see nor stand, he barks out orders like a ham actor from his thronelike chair. The shuffling, whiningly obedient Clov cannot sit. The bond that connects the men may be that of king and knave, of father and son, of ''Godot'' 's Pozzo and Lucky - or, given the many Shakespearean allusions, of Lear and his fool, of Prospero and Caliban. But it's the ''game,'' the ''play,'' that really matters, whatever explications we might attach to it. The text is full of theatrical references - to dialogue, asides, soliloquys, exits. The roles taken by Hamm and Clov parody the self-perpetuating roles that anyone must play to ward off the universe's meaninglessness, silence and ''infinite emptiness.'' To Beckett, we're all solitary children who ''babble, babble, words'' and concoct imaginary dramas to avoid feeling alone in the dark. Mr. Epstein and Mr. Evans don't come by this theatrical child's play naturally, but they have their lively turns. Mr. Epstein's stentorian Hamm is most amusingly sardonic when he wonders at the absence of ''phone calls'' in the void - or repeatedly recounts his life's single ''chronicle,'' about a ''wonderfully pale and thin'' beggar who once came crawling to seek his help. The chalk-faced Mr. Evans, his body curled over like a question mark, recalls a haunted-castle retainer in a Hammer horror movie; he emits an unsettling repertory of strangled cries and wheezy, stillborn laughs through his big gash of a mouth. One nonetheless wishes that these actors could just be the characters instead of acting at being them. In Beckett's reductivist, modernist theater, people must be innocent, self-contained creations rather than intellectual comments upon those creations. ''Endgame'' also demands born clowns, because Hamm and Clov must do so much with so little. The laughter is in spare dialogue, repeated lines and pauses. Though there are some physical gags and comic props, the immobility of Hamm and his spectral parents Nagg and Nell (who reside in ashcans) limits the action severely. Aside from their ever-shifting Irish and American accents, Mr. Epstein and Mr. Evans have exemplary technique - but technique it remains. If Bert Lahr was the ideal Estragon in ''Godot,'' then probably the ideal Hamm and Clov might be Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder, or Jackie Gleason and Art Carney. Mr. Epstein and Mr. Evans think too hard and work too busily. They must pile on layers of stylized, carefully calibrated gestures to approximate effects that master comics would instinctively achieve through effortless timing or one precisely raised eyebrow. James Greene and Alice Drummond are utterly true to the smaller roles of the stumpy remains of Hamm's abusive parents - especially when they make their doomed attempt to reach out to each other from their separate bins. The production design, notably Jennifer Tipton's lighting, is always correct. It says a lot about ''Endgame'' that even a reading more faithful than inspired doesn't betray its fascination. That fascination is stirred up by the gripping subject and striking vision of Beckett's dead-end comic play. What's missing is the elemental fusion of laughter and anxiety that is the play itself. Eternal Stalemate ENDGAME, by Samuel Beckett; directed by Alvin Epstein; setting and costumes by Avigdor Arikha; lights by Jennifer Tipton. Presented by the Harold Clurman Theater, Jack Garfein, artistic director, and Byron Lasky. At the Samuel Beckett Theater, 410 West 42d Street.

417-> ONLY THE INCREDULOUS NEED NOT APPLY
''Some career opportunities are as big as your imagination and as broad as your vision,'' the cover of the glossy brochure says. In the background, a hazy sun rises over the majesty of purple mountains. Go on, turn the page. ''A language, mathematics or technical/scientific degree, while not required, is a valuable start. It helps explain how things are and why. To see how things might be requires curiosity, imagination, innovation.'' What's this? An invitation to join one of those hotshot California computer companies where everybody gathers for Harvey Wallbangers in the gym on Friday afternoon? Keep reading. ''The National Security Agency provides this opportunity.'' The who? ''Your career at N.S.A. contributes to a dynamic professional community that is unique in the Western World, perhaps the entire world. You may develop and apply techniques which are in advance, sometimes by 20 years, of those utilized by any other group - anywhere.'' The brochure unfolds to reveal a panorama of the Land of Pleasant Living, from ''sun-filled'' Ocean City to ''fashionable'' Georgetown, with an oversized N.S.A. headquarters building smack-dab in the middle. For a Federal agency whose very name has been a closely guarded secret for much of its 30-year history, this recruitment brochure reveals a lot more about the state of American intelligence professions than meets the eye. The world's biggest electronic eavesdropper is about to embark on its biggest hiring spree ever, according to a spokesman, Caroline Johnson. And there is nothing covert about it. ''Because the Agency requires a certain degree of autonomy, it enjoys a high degree of freedom in establishing its administrative policies.'' Context: The N.S.A. was created by a 1952 executive order from President Truman that is still secret, was established without legislative charter and was operated almost totally outside Congressional or judicial controls until the passage of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in 1978, so it is as close to being able to do whatever it pleases as any democratic institution is ever likely to be. ''In addition, engineers and scientists at N.S.A. enjoy extremely stable job security due to the consistently high priority of this Agency's contribution to the national defense.'' Context: The agency's mission and annual budget are supersecrets known to only a handful of Government officials. ''If you're the type of person who is looking for more than just a career, then we urge you to take the next step. Check with your college placement officer.'' Context: Times really have changed.

419-> PERSONAL COMPUTERS; THE BOOKS GET BETTER ON NONTECHNICAL TOPICS
COMPUTER books are entering a new era, one that allows for books that are a pleasure to read in and of themselves. There is certainly no dearth of supertechnical texts of interest to a specialized audience, and volumes on machine language, computer graphics and artificial intelligence abound. Yet in the midst of the deluge there are occasional new releases that are not only informative but, as editors put it, ''a good read.'' One such volume is ''The Planiverse,'' by A. K. Dewdney ($9.95 in paperback from Poseidon Press). For those who enjoyed Edwin Abbott's classic tale of a two-dimensional society, ''Flatland,'' here, almost as if it were a centennial celebration of Abbott's 1884 book, is a computer-bound sequel. It is far more encompassing and thought-stirring than the original. ''The Planiverse,'' an offshoot of Dr. Dewdney's computer science classes at the University of Western Ontario, recounts the adventures he and his students shared while perfecting a program called 2DWORLD designed to introduce the students to the concept of scientific simulation. When summer came along, and one of the school's large computers had some free time, lo and behold, a distant voice was heard from the supposedly made-up two-dimensional world encompassed by the software. The voice was that of Yendred, a Nsana from a place called Arde. It was not, strictly speaking, a voice, since all communication between Yendred and Dr. Dewdney's students occurred via the alphanumeric characters on a video terminal. The messages delivered by the ''voice,'' however, were enhanced by a visual portrayal of the curious two-dimensional world on which Yendred and his friends live. What the reader of ''The Planiverse'' is made to see is a Yendred whose two-legged and four-armed outline is filled in with black so as to avoid depicting his internal organs. Since Yendred is absolutely flat, his internal composition is always visible to us when we are viewing the plane on which he lives, and never visible to his fellow Ardeans, who look at each other as we would look at a piece of paper held edgeways. The book follows Yendred as he crosses Arde on a personal quest, taking the reader through an amazing world of two-dimensional technology. On Arde, the task of building even a house is a complex matter since any structure rising up from the ground would block everyone's way. The obvious solution is to build downward, though with a trapdoor so that others may pass overhead. Obstacles of any sort are a problem in a two-dimensional world. For example, when two Ardeans meet going in opposite directions, one must crawl over the other. The Ardeans have found ways around what to us appear as the terrible limitations of their civilization's thin environment. They have constructed factories, printing presses and even rockets of sorts. Cars, however, have never been perfected on Arde. The Rdidn brothers' strange vehicle, the nearest thing to an automobile devised there, consists of a capsule-shaped passenger compartment encircled by a tread of wheels. Traveling in this vehicle is akin to being inside the schematic of a flat roller bearing. Unfortunately, in planar space, it appears to be impossible to incorporate a motor in such a contrivance, so the the only means of propulsion imaginable for the conveyance is the power of other Ardeans pushing it from the outside. I have spent hours trying to help the Rdidn brothers out by conceiving of a way to motorize their vehicle, so far without success. But therein lies the beauty of the ''The Planiverse.'' Once you have been captivated by the two- dimensional Ardean world, the problems facing its difficult technology haunt you, begging for more solutions. Arde easily becomes a puzzle without an end. S TEVEN LEVY'S ''Hackers'' ($17.95 from Anchor Press), subtitled ''Heroes of the Computer Revolution,'' is more down to earth - our earth, with three- dimensional people and problems and machines. Hackers are people whose lives revolve around machines, specifically computers. For them, be they programmers or hardware designers, Nirvana is a state of being totally at one with computing. A book populated with such individuals might seem, at first glance, rather limited in its appeal. These are not ordinary folk like the rest of us. Then again, neither are those collections of great industrialists, military men or politicians that form the subject of other biographical or historical volumes. We are a nation suddenly preoccupied with the personal computer. What better way to become ''literate'' about it than by a study of its addicts? Mr. Levy's book will no doubt be compared with Tracy Kidder's 1982 Pulitzer Prize-winning ''The Soul of a New Machine.'' But ''Hackers'' is much broader in scope. Mr. Levy's story opens in Cambridge, Mass., where during the 1950's hackers first climbed into the technological picture via the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Tech Model Railroad Club. Communications, just in the process of becoming computerized, was what kept all those tiny trains running on time and avoiding collisions. From that modest starting point of the computer revolution, through the early game-oriented 1980's, Mr. Levy makes a panoramic sweep of a very narrow field in history, populated with very narrow, though nevertheless three-dimensional, people. They were obsessed with the hacker's ethic, a strange blend of radicalism and technology. All the visionary wonders that electronic technology could perform should belong to the people, as should the right to explore this technology unfettered. Laws were meant to be broken if they interfered with these goals. I do quibble with Mr. Levy's choice of the word ''ethic,'' almost as if he feels a need to justify the behavior of his subjects, which was as likely as not to include breaking and entering and theft. ''Code,'' a word more connotative of moral neutrality, I think would have been more appropriate. Yet for 25 glorious years, a small band of misfits, for the most part not easy to get along with nor easy to like, explored the world of electronic information processing, and the end of their explorations and driven dreams was the personal computer. It is a tribute to Mr. Levy's writing that one leaves off reading his book with a feeling of sadness. So many of its inhabitants were brilliant as machine people, and pathetic as human beings.

421-> SCOUTING; Poster Campaign
When Ray Perkins left the Giants to take over as head coach at Alabama last year, he was receptive to a suggested addition to the Crimson Tide recruiting program. ''Alabama had been sending out little, if any, recruiting material,'' he said. ''The other major colleges in our area were mailing calendars and exercise programs and things like that to recruits. Someone in our athletic department suggested we mail weekly color posters about our football program to the 400 high school boys on our list. To be competitive with the other colleges, I O.K.'d the plan.'' During the football season, the posters mainly show a scene from a recent game with a one-word caption above it. ''The word is supposed to be positive and suggest what the game was all about,'' said Perkins. Recently, Alabama sent out an extra poster, showing two attractive Alabama Belles wearing football jerseys and posing with a football and helmet. The Belles, 50 female students chosen from 400 candidates, escort visiting recruits around the campus and to home football games on Saturdays in Tuscaloosa. ''We want the recruits to know there are pretty girls at Alabama,'' said Wayne Atcheson, the sports information director. ''The boys will get the message if they take a look at that poster,'' Perkins said. Asked if he had received any complaints from persons or groups who might find the poster offensive to women, Perkins said: ''Absolutely not. I don't think it offends anyone. Everyone I've spoken to seems to think it's fine. It's not a poster of half-naked women. It's just a picture of the faces of two pretty girls. What's wrong with that?''

A new $20.2 million international-arrivals area was dedicated today at Newark International Airport, the country's fasting growing airport. Governor Kean; Alan Sagner, chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the airport; Mayor Kenneth A. Gibson of Newark, and the chairman of People Express Airlines, Donald Burr, were among the dignitaries attending the ceremony in Terminal C. ''With the opening of this facility we take another step forward in the effort to increase international air travel in the region,'' Mr. Sagner said. Mr. Kean said he hoped the new terminal would bolster the state's ''efforts to attract more international commerce and tourism.'' As the ceremony began, 400 passengers arrived on a People Express flight from London and made their way through the 65,000-square-foot Federal inspection area, which can serve 700 travelers an hour. People Express, the only commercial airline based in Newark and the only one using the new terminal, will soon begin transcontinental jumbo- jet service, Mr. Burr said. Mr. Sagner said passenger volumes at the airport have jumped roughly 70 percent, from 1.1 million to more than 1.8 million in the last two years. The Port Authority, which obtained $9.3 million in Federal aid for the terminal, approved plans in April for a $16.5 million departure area to be completed next year in the upper level of Terminal C.

-hander, and Claudell Washington, the Atlanta Braves' top hitter, both drew fines and suspensions for an incident in a game June 16. Both appealed the penalties, and yesterday the National League announced that it would uphold the three-game suspension of Washington, who also was fined $1,000. The Atlanta outfielder, who began serving the suspension last night in a game against the Mets, stands to lose about $10,000. Soto could lose more, but he says he won't let the incident affect his pitching style. Soto, pitching while his appeal is pending on a $5,000 fine and five- day suspension for the incident, said he was not afraid to brush a batter off the plate if the situation warrants. ''I'm not going to let it change me,'' Soto said. ''I'm going to do it the way I have always done it.'' Soto and Washington drew suspensions for a fight that started after Washington hit a homer and Soto brushed him back in his next time at bat. Later in the game, Washington let his bat fly near the mound and went out to retrieve it. The fight broke out, and Soto hurled the baseball into a pile of players. Soto also served a five-day suspension earlier this season for a brawl in Chicago during which he brushed an umpire.

426-> Gurdon F. Flagg Dies at 83; Developed the Duquesne Club
Gurdon F. Flagg, who was instrumental in developing the Duquesne Club into one of the nation's foremost private clubs, died Wednesday night at St. Francis General Hospital. Mr. Flagg, who was 83 years old, had suffered several strokes. Mr. Flagg joined the staff of the Duquesne Club in 1931 and retired as general manager in 1981. He retained the title of secretary-treasurer. Under his direction, the club prospered as a gathering place for Pittsburgh executives in the steel, aluminum, oil, glass and coal industries. In 1980, it broke with tradition under Federal pressure and admitted women as members. In recent years about 30 Jewish members were admitted. The club, a downtown labyrinth containing 63 private dining rooms, has 2,500 members who reportedly dine there with guests on some of the best cuisine in Pittsburgh. A native of Hartford, Conn., Mr. Flagg was a 1924 engineering graduate of Carnegie Institute of Technology, now Carnegie-Mellon University. He worked as a clerk at the William Penn Hotel here as an undergraduate and joined the hotel staff after graduation before moving to the Duquesne Club.

The Suffolk County Legislature voted, 10 to 8, today to ask the State Legislature to approve a one-quarter of a cent increase in the county's sales tax, bringing it to 7.5 percent. The measure would raise $115 million over five years to stabilize sewer tax rates in the county's Southwest Sewer District, which covers nearly one-third of county residents. Without it, the sewer tax would double next year. Four Republicans and two Democrats who represent areas in the district, voted for the resolution. Four other Republicans also approved the measure. Five Democrats and three Republicans opposed the resolution. Legislator Jane Devine, Democrat of Huntington, said, in opposing the increase: ''It discriminates against 70 percent of the people of Suffolk County who are not connected to sewer systems and must maintain their own on-site sanitary facilities.'' The State Legislature is ready to act before the session ends, she said.

George Argyros , the owner of the Seattle Mariners, hinted that he might move the club, perhaps to Denver, because of a dispute with the Kingdome over a schedule conflict with the Seahawks of the National Football League. In contracts signed in 1976, the two teams were given conflicting priority over fall dates. Both have home games scheduled for Sept. 2, and each has refused to relinquish its claim. This has prompted speculation that Argyros, whose club has been lagging in attendance, might try to use the dispute to break his Kingdome lease, which runs throuh 1996, and he has not contradicted the speculation. ''We want to stay here and be successful,'' he said, ''but we can't be successful in a stadium that treats us like second-class citizens.''

Dangerous chemical fumes from fertilizer and pesticides in a smoldering warehouse here forced hundreds of nearby residents to flee today and caused minor injuries. Flames had shot 30 to 40 feet in the air after the fire broke out about 10:30 P.M. Wednesday at the Farmer's Mutual Exchange. By sunrise the flames were out, but smoke continued to pour from the ruins northwest of town. Today firefighters built earthen dikes around the warehouse and sprayed foam to smother the toxic smoke from the fire, which caused about $150,000 damage.

431-> NEW YORK'S HIGHEST COURT RULES LIFE ENDS WHEN THE BRAIN DIES
New York State's highest court ruled yesterday that a person may be deemed legally dead when the brain has ceased to function, even if the heartbeat and breathing are being maintained by artificial means. The decision, by the State Court of Appeals, marks the court's most extensive attempt to define the moment and mechanism of death in light of recent medical advances. With it, New York joins 37 other states that by statute or court decision have expanded the traditional definition of death - that is, when the heart and lungs stop functioning - to include the functioning of the brain. The court's unanimous decision, written by Chief Judge Lawrence H. Cooke, upheld manslaughter convictions in two shotgun deaths. It was hailed by law enforcement officials, who said it helped clarify the law and would encourage organ transplants. Two Were Deemed 'Brain Dead' Hospital administrators and doctors expressed support for the ruling and said it would permit hospitals to establish clear policies on the use of life-support systems. (Page B28.) In both of the cases before the court, physicians treating the wounded individuals, both shot in the head, determined they were ''brain dead,'' even though their hearts' continued to beat and they could breathe with the aid of respirators. Once this decision was reached, various organs were removed for transplants and the respirators were disconnected. Lawyers for the defendants in the cases argued that under the traditional definition of death in New York - a definition made by physicians but never explicitly outlined by the courts or the Legislature - neither victim was technically dead when the organs were removed. The transplants, not the shootings, were the cause of death, they argued, so the defendants could not be convicted of homicide. ''Ordinarily, death will be determined according to the traditional criteria of irreversible cardio-respiratory repose,'' Judge Cooke wrote. ''When, however, the respiratory and circulatory functions are maintained by mechanical means, their significance, as signs of life, is at best ambiguous.'' Under such circumstances, he continued, ''death may nevertheless be deemed to occur when, according to accepted medical practice, it is determined that the entire brain's function has irreversibly ceased.'' The court did not lay out detailed scientific standards for what constitutes brain death, though it repeatedly cited a set of criteria developed in recent years at Harvard Medical School. These include lack of responsiveness to painful stimuli; the absence of spontaneous movement, breathing and reflex action; and the use of electroencephalographs, which chart changes in electric charges in the brain. The court did not address what role family members could play in decisions to disconnect patients from life- support systems. The Harvard criteria, Judge Cooke stressed, are objective and scientific. In upholding the notion of brain death, he wrote, the court in no way meant to address the panoply of complicated moral concerns surrounding a patient's ''right to die.'' ''This court will make no judgment as to what is for another an unacceptable quality of life,'' he wrote. Decision Is Hailed District Attorney Elizabeth Holtzman of Brooklyn, whose office argued one of the cases involved in yesterday's ruling, called it a ''landmark decision.'' ''By taking into account modern scientific advances,'' she said, ''the Court of Appeals has recognized that brain death is death in New York State. The decision makes clear that a killer can be prosecuted for homicide when his victim is declared brain dead and the organs are subsequently removed for transplant, and also clarifies the legality of removing organs in such circumstances.'' To change the legal definition of death in New York, defense lawyers countered, was a matter more appropriate for legislative than judicial action. The New York Legislature has repeatedly considered adopting a brain- death standard, but the matter has never got out of committee. ''The court is not in as good a position to discern the will of the public as is the Legislature,'' said David Samel of the New York Legal Aid Society, who represented one of the defendants. ''The Legislature can hold hearings, can find out what leaders of legal, medical, religious communities feel about the issue, and can look to the experience of sister states.'' Safeguarding the Patient District Attorney John J. Santucci of Queens, who has advocated legislative action to define brain death, called the decision ''a major advance'' but said it did not go far enough. ''What the top court's ruling does not address is the question of establishing safeguards to assure the accuracy of the brain-death determination and to preclude any improper influences in reaching that determination,'' he said in a statement. The defendant in the Brooklyn case, Robert Bonilla, confessed to shooting a small-time marijuana dealer, Orlando Miranda, also known as ''The Little Man,'' in February 1979, after Mr. Miranda had given him a ''bad look.'' The defendant in the other case, John W. Eulo, shot his girlfriend in the head after an argument at a volunteer firemen's fair in Suffolk County in July 1981. Both victims quickly fell into comas and were placed on respirators. Shortly thereafter, doctors performed a number of tests on each to ascertain the extent of brain damage. In each case, stimuli were applied and yielded no reaction, and electroencephelograms were flat, indicating no activity in the parts of the brain tested. Because of these tests, each patient was declared ''brain dead,'' although their hearts remained beating. With the approval of their families, organs were removed and the respirators were disconnected. Each defendant was found guilty of manslaughter. 'Opposite of Life' While a person's death has many important legal consequences, notably in family and testamentary law, Judge Cooke noted, the law has never really defined death or the precise moment when it occurs. On one previous occasion, for instance, the Court of Appeals defined death simply as ''the opposite of life.'' The law initially accepted the traditional medical definition of death - that is, the ''irreversible cessation of cardiac and respiratory functions.'' But as medical technology changed, Judge Cooke wrote, it has become clear that such vital signs are not always ''independent indicia of life'' and can be, when a dead body is attached to a machine, ''demonstrably false.'' In the 1970's, partly to aid the transplantation of organs, which deteriorate quickly once breathing ceases, many state legislatures began amending their laws to incorporate definitions of brain death. Elsewhere, the change was made by court decision. The New York State Legislature's failure to enact a brain-death statute, Judge Cooke wrote, did not preclude the court from stepping in. ''Advances in medical science have caused a focus on the issues of when a jury may find criminal responsibility for homicide, of when physicians may transfer donated organs, and of when a person's body may be accorded the dignity of final repose,'' he declared. ''It is incumbent upon this court to instill certainty and uniformity in these important areas.''

432-> AROUND THE NATION; Man Given Year in Jail For Burning U.S. Flag
A six- member jury convicted a Georgia man Thursday of burning a United States flag while the Republican National Convention was here last summer and sentenced him to a year in jail and a $2,000 fine, the maximum punishment. The man, Gregory L. Johnson, an avowed Communist revolutionary from Atlanta, was found guilty of desecrating a venerated object, a misdemeanor. Mr. Anderson, 28 years old, testified that he did not burn the flag in front of Dallas City Hall on Aug. 22, but said he supported the political protest. Mr. Johnson and his lawyer, Stan Weinberg, contended that the burning was protected by the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech. Mr. Weinberg said he would appeal. Mike Gillett, an assistant district attorney, said he would prosecute three other people charged in the incident.

433-> Topics: Criminal Misunderstandings
Anti-Crime Credit The surge of crime in the 60's and 70's, President Reagan told the National Sheriffs' Association Wednesday, was the fault of ''liberal illusions about crime.'' Crime is going down, he said, now that political leaders seem less lenient, less sure that it is caused by poor social environment. Well, maybe. But researchers remain unable to demonstrate a relationship between such shifts in attitude and crime rates. The demographic argument is far more persuasive: Crimes are mostly committed by young males. For 20 years, with the baby boom, the number of them went up dramatically, and so did crime. Since about 1980, the number of young males has been declining and so has crime. Why has the birth rate dropped? There are a host of reasons, like improved contraception, and more moderate laws and views on abortion. But no reason is more important than the changed role of women in society. Women who want careers, like women who have to work, have fewer children. Whether ''liberal illusions about crime'' made crime worse remains to be proved. ''Conservative illusions'' about the role of women seem more relevant.

434-> SPORTS PEOPLE;
Ray (Boom Boom) Mancini , the former World Boxing Association lightweight champion, has completed a series of physical tests and has been given permission to return to the ring. Mancini lost his title June 1 in Buffalo, when he was stopped by Livingstone Bramble in the 14th round. Mancini, who had severe cuts around both eyes and was bleeding from the nose, was taking heavy punishment when the fight was stopped. ''He underwent tests by five doctors in the last day and a half,'' said Dave Wolf , Mancini's manager. '' He had a CAT- Scan, an EKG, an EEG, his eyes, nose and hearing were tested as well as his motor coordination and reflexes. Ray is ready to go again.'' Wolf said Mancini was pointing toward a rematch against Bramble. ''We'd like to fight somebody in the top 10 before September,'' Wolf said.

436-> SUFFOLK IS SUED BY LILCO FOR BLOCKING SHOREHAM
The Long Island Lighting Company asked today in a $4 billion suit that Suffolk County pay for the Shoreham nuclear power station because of the county's efforts to block emergency planning and make licensing of the reactor impossible. Suffolk's ''acts and omissions'' in its effort to block the development of an emergency plan ''constitute a deprivation of Lilco's rights and property without due process of law and without just compensation,'' asserted the suit, which was filed in Federal District Court in Uniondale. The suit seeks reimbursement under a legal doctrine known as ''reverse condemnation.'' This is often invoked when a governmental authority takes regulatory action that reduces the value of property, even if the authority does not condemn the property. The County's Position But the attorney handling Suffolk's fight before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission against the reactor said he doubted that the argument would win in court. ''Suffolk County has acted pursuant to the inherent constitutional police power and obligation it has to protect the welfare, health and safety of its citizens,'' the attorney, Herbert H. Brown, said in a telephone interview from his Washington office. He said Lilco's suit ''begs the question because it fails to recognize this inherent and serious obligation.'' The suit also charges the county with breach of contract regarding a September 1981 agreement under which the Suffolk Planning Department was to develop an emergency plan, with the expenses paid by the utility. The following spring, Suffolk ended the arrangement and returned a check for $150,000 to Lilco. The county government eventually developed its own emergency plan, but the County Legislature rejected it as inadequate. In Search of Cooperation Company officials, who spoke on the condition that they not be identified, said the goal of the suit was not to have the county pay for the plant, but to have it cooperate in emergency planning. Since early 1983, the county's position has been that the geography , road network and population density around Shoreham, which is 55 miles east of Manhattan on Long Island's north shore, would make evacuation impossible in an emergency. Therefore, according to the county, the reactor should not operate. Emergency planning was a minor consideration when Lilco purchased the site in the mid-1960's. But the Nuclear Regulatory Commission instituted extensive requirements after the March 1979 accident at the Three Mile Island reactor near Harrisburg, Pa. At the time that the stricter regulations were adopted, critics argued that the licensing of nuclear plants would require the cooperation of state and local governments, which, unlike utilities, are not under the jurisdiction of the commission. 'Usurping' N.R.C. Powers Lilco said today that, when the Suffolk Legislature made judgments about the feasibility of emergency planning and the adequacy of the county's own plan, it was acting to ''unlawfully usurp powers that have been exclusively vested in the Nuclear Regulatory Commission by Congress.'' Company officials noted that Suffolk had gone so far as to devise its own criteria for emergency planning, including an evacuation zone of 20 miles, instead of the 10 miles specified by commission regulations. The company is also arguing that ''the county has intentionally withheld from Lilco, on a discriminatory and selective basis, numerous services and facilities which are otherwise provided to the public.'' A major hurdle in Lilco's effort to devise its own emergency plan is that it cannot use the police powers of the county to take such steps as directing traffic or limiting access to threatened areas. Other Shoreham Cases Several other legal actions concerning Shoreham are in the courts. A suit by a Long Island-based group called Citizens for an Orderly Energy Policy is seeking to invalidate county actions intended to stop Shoreham. In addition, Suffolk County and the Cuomo administration are seeking a declaration under state law that Lilco cannot institute an emergency plan without governmental participation. The county has also taken action against Lilco for the utility's refusal to pay taxes on Shoreham. The company has skipped two semiannual payments of $26 million each, saying the reactor is overassessed.

437-> INQUIRY ON DISNEY TRADING
The Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an investigation of stock market trading in Walt Disney Productions, the big West Coast entertainment company said yesterday. The New York Stock Exchange said that it also had an investigation under way. Erwin Okun, a Disney spokesman, said that the company had received a phone call yesterday morning from the Los Angeles regional office of the Government agency telling them of the investigation. Spokesmen for both Reuters, the big British news service, and Saul P. Steinberg, the New York financier, said they had also been approached by the S.E.C. The Disney spokesman said that, as he understood it, the S.E.C. was mainly interested in Disney trading last Monday, the day it was announced that Mr. Steinberg had agreed to sell his stock in the company back to Disney, and on the preceding Friday. Gershon Kekst, who is senior partner of Kekst & Company and Mr. Steinberg's spokesman, said that the S.E.C. had spoken to Mr. Steinberg's lawyer late yesterday. Mr. Kekst said that he had been told that it was an informal investigation by the Los Angeles regional office ''related to trading on Monday.'' Margaret Klein, managing editor of Reuters North America, said that the S.E.C. had also approached the news organization. ''They asked us for what we carried on Disney on Monday,'' she said, ''and we supplied it to them.'' In a news item that reached the Wall Street investment community at 1:18 P.M. - four hours before the official announcement - John Crudele, a Reuters reporter, quoted ''Wall Street sources'' as saying that Disney ''is considering whether to buy back'' a big block of Disney stock. Mr. Crudele went on to quote a rumor that Disney's offering price to Mr. Steinberg would be $77 a share. Reuters carried its first flash of the official announcement at 5:16 that evening in which Mr. Steinberg accepted $297.5 million in cash plus $28 million to cover expenses, or $77.50 a share. Three days earlier, in what then seemed like a takeover bid, Mr. Steinberg said he had teamed with Kirk Kerkorian, the West Coast film executive, and the Fisher real estate interests of New York, to offer $72.50 for enough stock to give his group 49 percent of Disney. By that Sunday, or within 48 hours, he was negotiating the sale of his stock to Disney. With the threat of a Disney takeover by Mr. Steinberg now ended, Disney stock has plunged $16 a share so far. On Friday, June 8, the last day before the buyback, the stock stood at $65.125, unchanged for the day. By Monday morning, Disney had asked for a trading halt on the New York Stock Exchange. At 11 A.M., however, with the stock trading in the third market, Disney stood at $62.75. By 3:19 P.M. , with trading once again under way on the Big Board, Disney stood at $58.125, down $7 from the Friday closing price. By the close of trading on Monday, largely on the Reuters report of a buyback in the works, Disney stock fell $10.875, to $54.25.

440-> PLAINS JOURNAL; FOR A CITY, MODESTY IS NO VIRTUE
Kansas Cityans don't seem to do a lot of bragging, but when they do, they brag with a moderation that brought some facetious scolding the other day from a popular columnist. The citizens merely note that Kansas City is ''livable,'' said George H. Gurley Jr. of The Kansas City Times, or that it has more fountains than any other city besides Rome, or more landscaped boulevards than any besides Paris. Why not claim first place in something, he asked; ''Where's our chutzpah?'' But Mr. Gurley seemed to have forgetten about the American Royal, which promoters in Kansas City call, as they have for decades, ''the largest combined livestock, horse show and rodeo in the world.'' The event could also be described as the longest of its kind, Oct. 26-Nov. 17. Mr. Gurley's omission seemed strange, for the American Royal is impossible to ignore. On its first weekend, a parade with colorful floats and marching bands snaked through midtown. It brought in thousands of Future Farmers of America, 4-H Club members, their parents and others. Some estimate it also brings in about $20 million a year. And it involves the city fathers as nothing else does. As Robert W. Boyle, president of Boyle's Famous Corned Beef, said, ''It's the civic responsibility of everyone in Kansas City to support the American Royal.'' But one thing was not quite the same this year. An annual highlight, the auction of the grand champion steer, passed without a bid from Tom Williams. Mr. Williams, president of Guaranteed Foods, had bought the champion each of the last six years. He explained that he felt it was time to share the honor, or the ''bragging rights,'' as some people called it. Besides, he said, he had found another cause to sponsor, a leadership conference for young people. No matter. Dwight and Norma Sutherland stepped in. Their winning bid was $18,000, and the money went to Denise Klehm, the young 4-H member who raised the steer, which the Sutherlands said they would donate to charity. Hannibal, over in eastern Missouri, exhibits justifiable pride in some of its natives, including Mark Twain, but some people had misgivings over the attention given to another native the other day by the American Civil Liberties Union. About 40 people gathered under cold, gray skies in a lonely hilltop cemetery Nov. 10 to dedicate a marker the organization had placed on the grave of Clarence Earl Gideon, a drifter and habitual thief and gambler whose hand-written note to the Supreme Court led to a ruling 21 years ago that every defendant has a right to legal counsel. Mr. Gideon died in 1972, but his grave has remained unmarked. ''If my mother had wanted a grave marker, she probably would have put one there,'' Mr. Gideon's half-sister, Frances Ogden, explained earlier. Mrs. Ogden herself had been ''a little ambivalent'' about marking the grave, said Joyce Armstrong, an A.C.L.U. official who organized the ceremony. People from as far away as Boston were on hand. So, too, was Mayor John Lyng, who delivered appropriate remarks. But few other Hannibal residents attended. Bill Schneider, a former mayor, explained: ''I didn't believe in honoring someone of his type. He was just an ordinary punk.'' But among those on hand was Jim Alexander, who was once robbed by Mr. Gideon at shotgun point. Said Mr. Alexander: ''I think the Lord used him to make this point of the law.'' The Arkansas River is only 30 feet wide at its broadest stretches in the area where it crosses the Colorado- Kansas border, and in long reaches it is nothing but a dry riverbed. It is that section that has made the Arkansas one of the most litigated of rivers. Now Kansas, which fought Colorado in court over its water for nearly 50 years, has threatened to sue again. The two states cannot even agree on pronunciation for the river. In Colorado, it is called the Arkan-SAW, like the state. In Kansas the name is Ar-KAN-sas, like that state. In 1948, under an edict from the Supreme Court, the two states formed a compact, agreeing that at least 40 percent of the water entering the Arkansas in Colorado, where the river originates and which farmers have long tapped for irrigation, should be allowed to flow into Kansas. However, the Attorney General of Kansas, Robert T. Stephan, has charged that Colorado violated the agreement by impounding some of Kansas' share of the water in an upstream reservoir. Colorado officials have denied the charge. Mr. Stephan will ask for $225,000 in the next state budget to continue preparation for a lawsuit. Some Kansans contend that Colorado is at least partly to blame for conditions that have led to another lawsuit. Most of the Arkansas' riverbed in Gray County is dry. And two brothers who own land on each side, say that under an old English principle of law the land belongs to them down to the water's edge. Since there is no water, they have staked a claim to the riverbed itself, and have begun to farm it. Kansas has argued it is still officially a navigable stream and, therefore, the property of the state. A ruling is expected soon from a state judge.

441-> PETE JOHNSON, A CASTOFF, FINDS THE GOAL LINE WITH DOLPHINS
MIAMI Half a dozen times a game, someone taps Pete Johnson on the shoulder pad and says, ''Score us a touchdown.'' Funny thing is, Johnson has quite a record of delivering. He is the National Football League's leading rusher for touchdowns, with 12, including 9 in the 9 games since the Dolphins acquired him in a trade with the San Diego Chargers. As the designated goal-line, short-yardage fullback, he has carried only 58 times for Miami. That Johnson has done so well for the Dolphins and Coach Don Shula is not surprising. Things seem to work better for Miami than for virtually any other team. The Dolphins, who have clinched their division title, enter tonight's game against the Jets following their only loss after 11 victories. To Shula, it is a game ''to get things back together.'' Johnson is a symbol of how Shula and his organization fit in the pieces. The Dolphins are not afraid to make trades for established players, even one such as Johnson, who was suspended for drug involvement while with the Cincinnati Bengals in 1983. Johnson was the third player the Dolphins acquired after their fullback, Andra Franklin, was injured in the second game and lost for the season. His injury followed the death of the highly regarded runner, David Overstreet, in a car accident last June. To replace Franklin, the Dolphins first dealt with the Chargers for Chuck Muncie. That deal was negated when he failed their drug test. Then they picked up Rickey Young, a free agent. He, too, failed the drug test. ''If you need a player, it's better to get a guy who's on a team, rather than a guy who's unemployed,'' said Charley Winner, the Dolphin director of pro personnel. Winner also happens to be responsible for the last trades the Jets made for a player. That happened in 1975, when Winner was the coach. The deals were bad. Since then, the Jets have never specifically dealt for a player with another team. Craig Penrose, a backup quarterback, was a throw-in in the 1980 deal that sent Matt Robinson to Denver for draft choices. While not commenting on the Jet philosophy, Winner says, ''What makes us think we're the only ones who can build talent?'' Shula says of the deal that brought Johnson here: ''I've been a guy who's gone both ways. I believe in making trades for key players. I wouldn't have made the deal if we wouldn't have lost Andra. But that was a key player. I could never operate the way George Allen did, trading away all your draft choices. But I couldn't operate the way some clubs do by never making a trade.'' Johnson has been a significant player for most of his career. In 1981 at Cincinnati, he played in the Super Bowl and the Pro Bowl, and rushed for more than 1,000 yards while catching 46 passes. He cost the Dolphins a second- round draft choice next year (who will probably be about the 50th player selected), and the rights to Dewey Forte, a defensive lineman with the Los Angeles Express of the United States Football League. The 30-year-old Johnson is in his eighth pro season, which is longer than his six-year career in high school. His background is intriguing. Whimsically, he once suggested that he had changed his name from Willie James Hammock to Pete Johnson because he wanted to go on the stage. ''Could you imagine Willie James Hammock, opera singer?'' he said. In Georgia, where he was raised by great-grandparents, Willie James Hammock was called Pete because he used to chase a Peter Pan ice-cream truck. Hammock was his mother's name; his father's was Johnson. ''In the seventh grade I played high school football under the name Pete Johnson,'' he said. ''I took that as my pen name.'' He was able to pass as a teen-ager because of his size and weight, which has been a subject of controversy since. He is probably the heaviest back in recent pro football history. When the Dolphins acquired the 6-foot runner on Sept. 22, he weighed 268 pounds. When his great-grandfather died, Johnson moved to Long Island to be with his mother. He played football at Long Beach High, but only for one year. He also performed in the school's production of ''Brigadoon.'' At Ohio State, he changed his name legally to Pete Johnson because, he said, there was confusion over his having attended classes under his real name, Hammock, but having played football under his pen name, Johnson. His career with the Bengals was marked by continual battles with the scale, but success on the field. Then, before the 1983 season, he testified in a Federal investigation into cocaine trafficking, saying he had purchased the drug. He said he had made about 15 purchases, but they had been for someone else. A teammate, Ross Browner, was involved in the same investigation. Commissioner Pete Rozelle, in a decision involving four players that inadvertently left an impression with some that Johnson had been convicted of criminal charges involving drugs, suspended Johnson, Browner, E. J. Junior of the St. Louis Cardinals and Greg Stemrick of the New Orleans the same day. Junior and Stemrick had been found guilty of felony offenses involving cocaine. Browner and Johnson had not been. All were suspended for the first four games of the 1983 season. ''Pete Rozelle messed up,'' Johnson said. ''He put my name with others and people just assume I was convicted.'' The league's public relations director, Jim Heffernan, said of Johnson's complaint: ''We defined very explicitly why each one was suspended. As in all cases involving discipline, each case was judged on its own merits.'' Johnson was reinstated after the suspension, and went on to score 14 touchdowns and gain 763 rushing yards with the Bengals last season. They traded him after the season to the Chargers, who were attempting to vary their pass-dominated offense. ''After Franklin was injured, we called every team in the league looking for a runner,'' said Winner. ''Pete wasn't available. But he always said he had wanted to play for Don Shula. And I remembered him from the time I was with Cincinnati and I liked him.'' The Dolphins finally made the deal on a Saturday morning. The next day they were to play the Colts in a 4 P.M. game in Miami. ''I got into the hotel about 8 o'clock Saturday night,'' Johnson said. ''They gave me a physical and I must have got to bed about 1 in the morning. Then I got up at 7:30 in the morning so they could talk to me about the game.'' For two hours in the hotel dining room, Shula and Carl Taseff, the running back coach, instructed Johnson on Dolphin terminology. Jim Jensen, a wide receiver, simulated lining up and Johnson walked through plays in the middle of the room. That afternoon he scored a touchdown. According to Shula, concern over Johnson's weight has not changed. ''I said, 'Pete, do you remember how much you weighed when I coached you in the Pro Bowl?' '' the coach said. '' 'Two forty-eight? Does that tell you something? You know how much you weigh now?' He was way out of shape. He just let himself go the last couple of years.'' He is now down about 20 pounds, and has a few more to go. He runs three miles a day and says he eats a meal only at night, and ''I don't go out drinking as much.'' Apparently, the program has worked out for Johnson and Shula. ''I always wanted to play here,'' said Johnson. ''At San Diego, all they do is pass. When they got me, they said I'd run, but they didn't give me the ball. It's a tough job at the goal line here, but somebody's got to do it.'' He would probably like to get the ball more times, but he has not complained too often. He spends most of the game ''stretching, so I can be ready for when they need me; you never sit down.'' Taseff wants Johnson at the lighter weight because the Dolphin style near the goal line requires the running back to make quick decisions and not simply go for a predesignated hole. Johnson has mastered that technique. Of Shula, Johnson said: ''Just the way he coaches - he lets coaches coach - he knows all phases of the game. He don't believe in mistakes. Neither do I.'' Shula said: ''I took Pete because he paid his dues. He has been a joy since he came here.''

442-> STEPS TO EASE FLIGHT BOTTLENECKS ARE ANNOUNCED BY AVIATION CHIEF
The head of the Federal Aviation Administration announced several steps yesterday to help ease air traffic congestion that has caused a 55 percent increase over the previous year in flight delays. The measures include a Government-industry study of better scheduling and traffic flow as well as a new evaluation of the ultimate size of the controller force. The agency's Administrator, Donald D. Engen, warned the airlines, ''We already may have run out of cubic airspace and airport capacity in a few areas.'' He said the airlines would have to the adjust to the fact that the increase in flights that has been brought by deregulation of the industry and by a resurgent economy could not be accommodated after a certain point. Admiral Engen, a retired Navy pilot, also made a significant move that may ease disgruntlement among some controllers and improve the efficiency of the air traffic system. He announced the abandonment of a system that has frozen nonradar controllers in jobs limiting their training and pay. The two-tier system was put into effect as part of the program to rebuild the traffic-control system after the illegal walkout and subsequent firing of 11,400 controllers in August 1981. Growing Pressure on Agency The Administrator's comments were made in a luncheon speech to the National Aviation club in Washington. They came at a time of growing pressures from the public, the industry and controllers to deal with difficulties that have long been anticipated. Airline passengers have been increasingly inconvenienced by traffic delays, notably in recent weeks as the vacation season has added to flight schedules. Many airlines have complained that delays imposed by congestion of the traffic system have resulted in lost revenue because of missed connections, wasted fuel and turned-off customers. Some controllers have complained of too much work and stress, and they have moved to organize new unions to replace the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization, the group that was decertified after the illegal walkout. For the first four months of this year, according to Government sources, traffic was up about 10 percent over the same period in 1983. The 55 percent figure for the increase in delays was also for the January- through-April period, and the situation is believed to be worsening. A delay is defined as a takeoff or landing that is 15 minutes or more behind schedule. For a particular flight, either the takeoff or arrival is counted, not both. Northeast Is a Major Concern Admiral Engen made clear that a focus of special concern was the Northeast, though he emphasized that the issue was one of management, not safety. He said a downtrend trend in accidents had continued in the three years since the controller strike and that safety would always be the top priority. Government figures showed that the average number of flights handled daily by the New York traffic center increased from 5,135 in June 1981, before the strike, to 5,739 now. The center, located in Islip, N.Y., handles traffic bound for the area's three major airports, La Guardia, Kennedy International and Newark International, but hands over control for the last 60 to 80 miles to special approach and terminal radar facilities. The center also handles traffic to and from smaller peripheral airports and handles traffic flying over the region. Airline Scheduling Criticized Admiral Engen implicitly chided the airlines for the ''bunching of airline schedules,'' much of it a result of the post-regulation trend toward the greater use of airports that serve as a hub for an airline's flights, allowing passengers on many short flights to transfer to other flights on the same carrier. This a method enables an airline to route customers to many destinations and to fill as many seats as possible on each flight. Noting that the bunching of airline schedules creates built-in delays, the aviation agency chief warned that his agency was beginning to re-examine the airlines' ''right to hub operations at airports indiscriminately.'' ''Layering one traffic hub on another,'' he said, ''produces peak traffic loads that frequently exceed airport capacity and can freeze out general aviation and military flight operations as well.'' ''Traffic choking can result, with the air carriers pointing to F.A.A. as the reason when in actual fact it could be a scheduling problem,'' he added. The Admiral's agency has no legal power to dictate when and where an airline may schedule its flights. But if too many flights are scheduled the air space or runways available, controllers can hold departing flights on the ground, or they can delay them en route by calling for slower speeds or circling over ''holding'' points. To illustrate the problem, Government officials said the official airline schedule currently listed 27 flights scheduled to arrive in Atlanta in a single seven-minute period. They said the schedule showed 63 flights to land at Kennedy between 8 P.M. and 9 P.M., far more than the capacity of the runways. Admiral Engen noted complaints by some that the target figure of 14,300 controllers in the rebuilt air traffic system, which has not been reached, ''just can't do the job.'' The comparable pre- strike figure was 16,400. ''I am evaluating the number I feel may be required and haven't made a final decision,'' he said. The statement was viewed as encouraging by the airline industry because it opened the door for a possible increase in the number of controllers, which the airlines have been advocating.

443-> BHOPAL RESIDENTS CONTINUE TO FLEE
Tens of thousands of residents continued for the third day today to flee this city, emptying entire neighborhoods before a Union Carbide chemical plant is restarted Sunday to neutralize its stock of poisonous gas. The Government helped evacuate hundreds of residents from the area around the plant where the gas leaked last week, killing at least 2,000 people. All educational institutions in the city have been closed until Dec. 23, and 10 of them have been converted into camps to house refugees moved from the area around the Union Carbide Corporation plant. A railway official reported this evening that three special trains had left for the townships of Bina and Itarsi. Three more were scheduled to steam out of Bhopal later tonight for the same destinations. Passengers packed first-class compartments as well as second-class coaches. ''There's even no standing room,'' said one man as a train chugged out of the city toward New Delhi. Police Reserves Arrive Among the relatively few people who arrived in Bhopal today were several contingents of the central reserve police force from the neighboring state of Maharashtra. They are among 2,000 paramilitary troops brought to this central Indian city to help the local police maintain order and prevent looting. The army has been put on alert and may be called in should an emergency occur, state officials said today. The railroad and bus stations reported that the hectic activity of Thursday continued. Thousands of men, women and children milled on the platforms and many stood in long queues to buy tickets. Others, carrying bags and children, pushed and jostled their way into already crowded coaches. ''I have not seen anything like this in my 36 years with the railways,'' said R. K. Rastogi, the station superintendent, who took over the post Dec. 5 after his predecessor died, a victim of the poison gas. He said ticket sales Thursday and today totaled about 36,000, more than twice the normal figure. He acknowledged that many passengers were traveling without tickets. From One Extreme to Another ''They know where to go,'' added Mr. Rastogi, a short, white-haired man of 58. ''There doesn't seem to be the kind of panic that existed yesterday. There will be very little traffic between the 16th and the 21st, but once the detoxification process is over, we'll get a massive influx of people returning. We always seem to be going from one extreme situation to another.'' At the bus station, people climbed onto the roofs of vehicles, sat beside their luggage and formed long queues at ticket counters. Jitendra Verma, a senior state transport official, said about 10,000 passengers - about the same number as fled the city Thursday - had packed 225 buses today. Thousands more have left in their own vehicles or in buses and taxis run by private operators. According to the state Government, about 70,000 people have left Bhopal in the last 72 hours. Reports from a number of other sources place the figure at more than twice that. Residents of Jayaprakash Nagar, the neighborhood hit the hardest by the toxic gas, reported that most of its inhabitants had fled. ''We have no faith in the Government,'' said Faird Khan, a laborer who said he lost 11 members of his family in the disaster. ''Look how they failed us last time.'' Government Camps Scorned Mr. Khan, his wife and four others were to travel this evening to the township of Karwai, where his father-in-law lives. He and many others have scorned a Government offer to bus them free of charge to any of the 10 camps, where they were told they would be fed and looked after for the four or five days it is expected to take to convert the deadly gas into a pesticide. Others willingly accepted the Government's offer. ''Everyone is leaving,'' Laxman Singh said. ''We have been told that we will get two meals a day, a roof over our heads, so we are taking blankets, mattresses and plates for our food.'' Ten green and cream-colored buses lined up outside Jayaprakash Nagar this afternoon to move those who wanted to go to the camps. Traffic was light for the first two hours but picked up later. At a camp at Kamala Nehru School, the refugees are living in spacious classrooms emptied of students, desks and benches. ''This is excellent,'' said Bashir Khan. ''We have light, fans, water, and we don't mind sleeping on the floor for the next four or five nights.'' Camp Population Grows R. P. Kashiv, a bank manager who is in charge of the camp, said 600 people were settled there. He said he expected the figure to swell to 1,000 later tonight. ''By tomorrow, we may be cooking for about 5,000 people,'' he said. The refugees have made themselves at home, spreading their mattresses on the floors, sprawling on the ground and putting plates and mugs on the broad window sills. Children shrieked with laughter as they chased one another through the long corridors outside the classrooms. Some drew figures and wrote their names on blackboards. In the playground, cooks stirred 14 large iron pots over log fires and women kneaded dough. The camp's inhabitants are to be fed two meals a day. Mr. Kashiv said the kitchen would feed the inhabitants of Kamala Nehru School and two neighboring camps. A control room, manned by policemen and Mr. Kashiv's aides, has been set up at the school. Frequent announcements are made from loudspeakers, directing people to the registration center, asking for help for the sick and informing others where the newly built toilets are.

444-> THE CITY;
A Transit Authority crew spends 3,300 hours to rebuild one of the subway cars used on the No. 7 Flushing line while a private company spends 2,000 to 2,500 hours on the same job, the authority's chief mechanic said in a report yesterday. But production at the authority's repair shop in Coney Island is better than in early 1983, said the chief mechanic, A. Richardson Goodlatte. Then it took 4,700 hours to overhaul such a car, an R-36. Productivity improvements at the shop ''will be a major determining factor as to whether or not any future overhauls are performed in-house,'' he said.

445-> QUESTION BOX
QUESTION: Why did an obituary on George (High Pockets) Kelly last month neglect to mention that he once hit four home runs in a game? There have been 10 major leaguers with four homers in a game, but Kelly is not among them. However, he is among the 253 players who have hit three home runs in a game - and he was the first player to do it twice, both times with the New York Giants: Sept. 17, 1923 against the Cubs in a 13-6 Giant victory in Chicago and June 14, 1924 against the Cincinnati Reds in an 8-6 decision at the Polo Grounds. Against the Cubs, Kelly hit the homers in three successive innings, and also had a single and double in the game. Against the Reds, he drove in all eight Giant runs, while hitting a grand slam, a game-tying single in the seventh inning and a game-winning two-run homer, which came off Pete Donohue with two out in the ninth. Johnny Mize, who did it six times, holds the major league record for hitting three home runs in a game, and Dave Kingman, who has done it five times, leads active players. QUESTION: How long have the University of Southern California and Notre Dame been football rivals and have there been any overwhelming victories by either team? How often has Southern California prevented Notre Dame from finishing a season undefeated? When the Irish meet the Trojans Saturday, it will be for the 56th time in a series that began in 1926 with a 13-12 victory by Notre Dame. The Irish still lead the series, with 28 victories, 23 defeats and 4 ties, after holding a 25-11-2 margin through 1966. But Southern California has won 11 of 14 games since 1970, including five straight from 1978-82. The most one- sided outcome in the series was the 51-0 game that capped Notre Dame's unbeaten season in 1966. The most one-sided victory by Southern California came in 1974, a 55-24 triumph after Notre Dame led, 24-6, at halftime. Four times U.S.C. has spoiled unbeaten seasons for Notre Dame - in 1938, 1964, 1970 and 1980. In 1973, Notre Dame's 23-14 victory ended a 23-game unbeaten streak for the Trojans. QUESTION: Just as Team A in a National Hockey League game is changing skaters, a player from Team B breaks away with the puck and begins to skate toward the Team A goaltender unimpeded. If one of the Team A players preparing to enter the game leaves the bench prematurely and checks the Team B skater cleanly in order to prevent the shot on goal, will Team A receive any punishment worse than a two-minute minor penalty for having too many men on the ice? What if the Team A goaltender had been removed and the Team B player was skating toward an unguarded net? In the case where a player on a clear breakaway is interfered with by an opponent who enters the game illegally, the referee will award a penalty shot to the puck-carrier instead of charging the offending team with a minor penalty. If the breakaway interference occurs with no opposing goaltender in the net, the player carrying the puck will be awarded a goal, even if he does not get off a shot.

446-> FEDERAL JURY FINDS A COOKS COUNTY JUDGE GUILTY OF CORRUPTION
A Federal jury today found John M. Murphy, a Cook County Associate Circuit Court Judge, guilty of 24 out of 27 counts of racketeering, mail fraud and extortion. The verdict, which came after more than 14 hours of deliberation, was the first involving a judge in the 42-month Federal investigation of the judicial system of Cook County, which includes the city of Chicago and some suburbs. The complex and controversial Federal investigation, code-named Operation Greylord, involved dummy defendants, bogus cases and a judge wearing a hidden tape recorder to gather evidence against colleagues. The 68-year-old Judge Murphy, looking drawn, sat with his hands folded as the verdict was read on the 21st floor of the Dirksen Federal Building here. He was one of 17 men, including four former or current judges, to be indicted so far in the investigation. A court clerk was convicted in connection with the investigation in March and four others who were indicted have agreed to plead guilty. Test of Witnesses' Credibility Judge Murphy's trial was seen as a test of the credibility local jurors would give to the testimony of prosecution witnesses who themselves had been involved in the judicial corruption. United States Attorney Daniel K. Webb called the outcome ''a resounding verdict'' that confirmed the credibility and legality of the Greylord investigation. He said it was the first conviction of an Illinois judge in connection with the performance of his judicial duties. Mr. Webb said the three counts on which the judge was acquitted were the ones with the least evidence. They were one count of mail fraud and two of extortion. ''The jury convicted the defendant,'' the prosecutor said, ''on every count of every witness that took the stand.'' Judge Murphy showed no emotion as the verdict was read in the packed downtown courtroom, but a defense attorney patted him on the back sympathetically afterward. As he left the building the judge would say only, ''I am not prepared to comment publicly on the American judicial system that I have faithfully served all my life.'' Judge's Resignation Expected The judge has been suspended from court work while still receiving his $60,500 annual salary. It is expected that he will resign from the bench now. Federal Judge Charles P. Kocoras set sentencing for Aug. 31. Judge Murphy faces a maximum penalty of more than 200 years in prison and fines of more than $100,000. He said this afternoon that he would appeal the verdict. Prosecutors said during the trial that Judge Murphy fixed cases on behalf of Judge Richard F. LeFevour when Judge LeFevour was the supervising judge in Cook County Traffic Court. In return, the prosecutors said, Judge LeFevour assigned Judge Murphy to courtrooms where it was likely that he would be offered bribes. Judge Murphy's attorney, Matthias Lydon, denied the charges, saying that the judge had been falsely implicated by a lawyer and two former Chicago police officers who had been caught in the investigation of court corruption. In a statement read to reporters after the closing arguments, Judge Murphy had said that until his indictment last December, his reputation for honesty and integrity had not been challenged. ''It was attacked for the first time here in this courtroom,'' he said. ''I believe the evidence shows that I am not guilty.'' The Cook County court system was on trial with Judge Murphy. Though Chicagoans often listen to tales of corruption with the resignation they reserve for discussions of bad winters, they were riveted by the testimony. Fixing of Cases Described Spectators in Judge Kocoras's courtroom heard the Government's chief witness, James LeFevour, a former Chicago police officer and personal aide to his cousin, Judge LeFevour, tell the jury he fixed cases every day for Judge LeFevour when he worked for him in Traffic Court. James LeFevour said he had relayed messages that lawyers had paid for a particular ruling by Judge Murphy and ''10 to 15'' other judges. Judge LeFevour headed the Traffic Court until 1981 when he became presiding judge of the First Municipal District Court. Mr. Webb, the prosecutor, told of a ''hustlers' bribery club'' of lawyers who he said paid $2,000 a month to Judge LeFevour and $500 to his cousin. In exchange, he said, they solicited cases outside certain courtrooms. The judges referred clients to them and they were given the defendants' bond money for fees, Mr. Webb said. James LeFevour testified that judges who did not cooperate were transferred to other courtrooms where less serious cases were heard. ''A judge didn't sit in a major courtroom for long unless I could see him,'' he said. Judge LeFevour, who has not been indicted, has denied wrongdoing. Mr. Webb said he presented testimony about Judge LeFevour because his alleged actions could not be separated from Judge Murphy's. Among the methods employed in the Greylord investigation were these: A former assistant state's attorney in Chicago posed as a corrupt lawyer; a downstate Illinois judge masqueraded as a dishonest judge and wore a recording device in his boot; Federal Bureau of Investigation agents pretended to be victims and offenders in bogus cases designed to seek out corruption, and a judge's telephone was tapped and a microphone placed in his chambers.

448-> CRITICS' CHOICES
Diana Ross's rain-plagued free concert in Central Park last July may have triggered plenty of controversy, but it was still a one- of-a-kind event in which the woman who symbolizes Motown glamor brought a touch of high fashion to the bucolic expanse of the Great Lawn. The event, which was originally shown on Showtime, returns to prime- time cable on Wednesday, when it will be shown at 9 P.M. on WHT (the service will also be presenting the two-hour program at 1:30 that afternoon; in addition, Showtime will rebroadcast the same show later this month.) ''Diana Ross From Central Park'' features most of Miss Ross's biggest hits, both as the lead singer of the Supremes and as a soloist. In addition to songs like ''Ain't No Mountain High Enough,'' ''Touch Me in the Morning,'' ''Endless Love'' and ''Stop! In the Name of Love,'' the singer also offers her version of Michael Jackson's ''Beat It.'' A shameless pop sentimentalist, Miss Ross instinctively touches more stylistic bases than most pop singers, blending echoes of Frankie Lymon, Billie Holiday and Barbra Streisand with a rhythmic flair that still more or less defines the Motown style.

449-> COMOPUTER MAY PLAY KEY ROLE IN TRADITIONAL MUSIC STUDIES
NEW BRUNSWICK COMPUTER music has begun to take root in the American culture in a way that could revolutionize the older, more traditional ways of making music. From motion pictures to concert halls to grade-school music classes, computers attached to synthesizers and other electronic gear are providing composers and musicians with greater fleixibility for producing instrumental sound. For Dr. Gary Greenberg, an assistant professor of creative arts education at Rutgers, the State University, and a composer and specialist in computer music, that's all to the good. ''The fact that one can sit down with a computer and do things with music in one's own way and in one's own time gives people many options,'' he said. ''There are composers who are writing music for computers alone, for computers and solo instruments and for computers and small ensembles and orchestras.'' Professor Greenberg, who holds a Ph.D. in music and composition from Harvard University and has taught composition, theory and electronic music at Yale, sees a new generation of musicians turning to computer music to express their creativity. In the process, he feels, traditional music studies of notes, scales, chords and pitch, and possibly even the study of individual instruments - such as the piano, violin and trumpet - may give way to studying the computer as an instrument. Central to the computer - and for most people that means the small personal computer - and its facility to deliver musical sounds are the computer software programs or languages that are fed into it. One such computer language is LOGO, which Professor Greenberg became familiar with in 1973 while working on a project at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to investigate music perception and learning. Using the computer with LOGO has enabled him to experiment with new musical forms and structures. His students, he said, ''do not have to play any musical instrument, nor be able to read music or know anything about music. By developing new fragments and adding them to others, the composer can then structure larger and larger blocks of music and, finally, a composition. ''Many composers - Stravinsky, for example - worked that way,'' said Professor Greenberg, but did so, of course, without the aid of a computer. Along with many other educators and musicians, Dr. Greenberg believes that the computer has opened an entirely new and exciting way for both the young and old to learn, explore and enjoy music. He said that nearly everyone enjoyed some form of music, and could be caught, almost subconsciously, humming a tune or singing some popular melody. ''As soon as you have to learn about notes and intervals or have to learn about chord progressions and inversions, people get turned off,'' he said. Professor Greenberg instructs computer and LOGO workshops in music, art and language for elementary and secondary school teachers who belong to a network of 40 districts in central and northern New Jersey. Some music teachers, he said, have reported, that 7-year-olds are making their own ''tune blocks'' when given the use of a computer. ''Kids can learn to do this very fast,'' he noted. Yet, while children and schools are obvious focal points for the future development of computer music, these institutions are not progressing very quickly, according to Professor Greenberg. ''The big problem'' he said ''is that they (the schools)) are really concerned wih trivial matters like computer literacy - knowing, for example, what a 'disk drive' or 'hardware' is - rather than how the computer can be used as a tool for learning.'' Looking ahead, Dr. Greenberg envisions the computer and such computer language programs as LOGO resulting in youngsters gaining learning experiences in music that can be transferred to learning how to read, write and do arithmetic.

450-> DANCE: THREE SEASON PREMIERES BY AILEY TROUPE
The Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater turned out some sensational dancing in the three works it presented Thursday night, all seen for the first time this season at the Metropolitan Opera House. These were Mr. Ailey's ''Isba'' and Talley Beatty's ''Blueshift,'' both dating from last year, and ''Treading,'' choreographed in 1979 by Elisa Monte. It has taken the Ailey company a few days to find its bearings on a stage that is much larger than its usual one at the City Center, although possibly the dancers perform on huge stages abroad. Nonetheless, the Met is a big house, and it has a big stage. When George Balanchine's New York City Ballet moved from the City Center to the New York State Theater, Balanchine found it necessary to rechoreograph some of the patterns in his ballets so that they would fill the larger stage. The sets often had to be redesigned to a larger scale. As Thursday's performances proved, dancers and choreography that project can overcome these obstacles on their own. In ''Blueshift,'' the dancers whirled in and out with the metaphoric force of a tornado. They were terrific. But a quieter, equally fine example came in the way Mari Kajiwara and Keith McDaniel, two small figures within a high proscenium frame, filled the stage powerfully and emotionally in ''Treading.'' Many in the audience rose to give them a standing ovation. ''Treading'' has modular and repetitive music by Steve Reich, but Miss Monte's choreography is a ceaseless flow that is nearly exclusive of any duplication. One suspects that the work gains a great deal from its superb performance - from Miss Kajiwara's extraordinarily smooth technique and phrasing as well as Mr. McDaniel's strong support and empathy. The movement has a gymnastic look, suggesting matter forming and maturing - a metaphor for an encounter between the male and female of a species. Miss Kajiwara, one of modern dance's best dancers, seems to ooze into human shape through the suppleness of her torso and back arching. When she and Mr. McDaniel interlock, the dancers offer a magnificent display of control and concentration. Lying on his back, Mr. McDaniel seemingly allows Miss Kajiwara to swim on his upturned soles. As the music dies down, they have formed a couple. The dynamics of ''Blueshift'' are radically and excitingly different. Mr. Beatty has captured the spirit of the street here with gusto and invention. At its premiere, the work seemed a lesser sequel to Mr. Beatty's hit ''The Stack-up.'' Now it might even be the superior piece, a symphony of color and throbbing movement that turns urban tempo into art. Set to popular recordings, most with a driving piston beat, the choreography's basic pulse is a jogging rhythmic skip, punctuated by gyrations, kicks and Mr. Beatty's own variations on a jazz vocabulary. The stage is awash with the vibrancy of Romare Bearden's decor - a cityscape of panels and bridge shadows. ''Blueshift,'' which is an astronomical term, resembles a big block party. ''Isba,'' a word invented by Mr. Ailey, shows his affinity for the ritual. Sharrell Mesh is the virgin initiated into love by Michihiko Oka under the priestly supervision of Kevin Brown. ''Autumn,'' the score by George Winston, meanders at length. The choreography, however, has a galaxy-like swirl for the ensembles and it is marvelously danced.

453-> LANCE SAYS HE'S CONFIDENT OF PASSING PARTY'S SCRUTINY
Bert Lance left here today expressing confidence that he would survive the fresh round of scrutiny touched off by his appointment as general chairman of Walter F. Mondale's Presidential campaign. Mr. Lance has privately assured Democratic leaders at the party's convention this week that his personal financial dealings will yield no surprises. But some Democrats say that in any case, the Georgia Democratic Party chairman has added political baggage to the Mondale campaign. ''I think Lance can hang on if he survives this new period of investigation,'' said one Democratic politician close to both Mr. Mondale and Mr. Lance. ''Lance obviously has baggage and talent, but how it all plays out remains to be seen,'' this politician said. ''What is clear is that he is an unpopular choice.'' Mr. Lance's role in the Mondale campaign does not win favor with a number of Democratic constituencies, including Jewish groups that have begun to focus attention on Mr. Lance's past financial dealings with Arab investors. At the same time, there have been reports about $3.2 million in unsecured loans made to Mr. Lance by a Tennessee banker who is the subject of a Federal investigation. But there have been no major new disclosures about his financial dealings, and Mr. Lance, in interviews this week, refused to discuss his finances. 'Down the Primrose Path' He faces other problems in his efforts to take charge of the Mondale campaign. To the surprise of the campaign, the unhappiness over the Lance appointment, which was in part a gesture to the South, extends to some state party chairmen there. ''Some of us feel that Lance had an agenda he never made us aware of and we feel like we were led down the primrose path,'' said a Southern state chairman. He said the Southern chairmen had cooperated with Mr. Lance to create a unified front as a way of increasing the region's role in Presidential politics. ''We were telling other state chairmen we weren't pushing Bert and now some of us feel used,'' the Southerner said. Asked whether Mr. Lance would be an asset to Mr. Mondale in the South, he replied, ''Other than his organizing and fund- raising abilities - and that will help - I think that's about the end of it.'' John C. White, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee and an ally of Mr. Lance, said, ''If Bert thinks he's hurting the ticket, he'd be the first to make the right decision.'' Low Profile Is Suggested Some Democratic strategists said that most of the political damage may have already been done and that Mr. Lance could best serve Mr. Mondale by assuming a low profile. There were indications this week that Mr. Lance planned to do just that. The normally gregarious and glad- handing Mr. Lance was barely visible at the Democratic National Convention. He avoided parties and spent most of his time out of sight in meetings with the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Mondale campaign officials. ''We expected the press to recycle the other charges against him and to look for new ones,'' said one of Mr. Lance's political associates. ''After everyone has done that, things should settle down.'' In an interview, Mr. Lance said he did not expect his financial affairs to become an issue. ''Look,'' he said, ''I've been through the process and there are some on the other side who have not.'' He was alluding to questions of impropriety in the financial affairs of a number of Reagan Administration officials. Some Democrats gleefully refer to this as the ''sleaze factor.'' But some delegates said the designation of Mr. Lance as the top official of the Mondale campaign has effectively deprived the Democrats of that issue. ''How in God's name can Mondale talk about the sleaze factor with Bert Lance running his campaign?'' said a Middle Western party leader, who did not want to be identified. ''There goes one of our best issues.'' Defendant in Federal Trial Mr. Lance, a banker from Calhoun, Ga., was forced to resign as director of the Office of Management and Budget in the Carter Administration in 1977 to defend himself against charges of banking law violations. A Federal jury in Atlanta acquitted him on nine fraud counts but deadlocked on two counts of making false financial statements and one of misusing bank funds. Federal prosecutors, saying a new trial would be too expensive, declared the case closed. This week, after Mr. Lance emerged as a major figure in the Mondale campaign, newspapers in Tennessee published reports describing $3.2 million in loans made to Mr. Lance by his close friend and associate, Jake F. Butcher, and his brother, C. H. Butcher. The Tennessean of Nashville and The Knoxville Journal said the loan documents were among banking records subpoenaed by a Federal grand jury looking into the collapse of the Butcher banks. The reports said Mr. Lance was not a target of the investigation. They said documents showed that Mr. Lance has not repaid $2 million of the loans.

455-> Let Stock Crime Fit the Punishment
Congress, at long last, has approved stiffer penalties for illegal insider trading in securities. The Securities and Exchange Commission asked for them two years ago. Investors who benefit from information not available to the public could be fined up to three times the amounts they gained. But the bill leaves a critical question unanswered: What's illegal trading? A fair criminal statute tells the citizen precisely what's forbidden. Plainly all investors should be able to act on the same information and those privileged to know more sooner should be curbed in their trading. The rules are quite clear about regular insiders, like the executives and directors of a publicly traded company and members of their families. Also, their corporations are required to disclose everything relevant to their value to give all investors an equal chance. But who else might be an ''insider'' has never been fully defined. Even the proponents of a better definition disagree about how it might be written. Certainly, a lawyer engaged to work on a company merger should be subject to the same rules as the company president. But what about a friend who's tipped off in advance, or a waiter who overhears the lawyer's conversation? Until now, the reach of the rule has been decided by the courts ad hoc, in response to S.E.C. charges. This page has previously argued for continuing with that routine, but the protests against that position have been persuasive. The only penalty for illegal insider trading so far has been loss of the ill-gotten gain. Now that the penalties are to be substantially increased, the posted notice should be as precise as possible. Congress, the S.E.C. and corporate managers have failed to write clearer rules because they can't agree on the unknown. Some are afraid the law will reach too far; others fear that tight language would let too many cheaters escape. All foresee years of litigation about the definitions. If the definition were to prohibit ''unfair use of material non-public information,'' as some propose, who would know what's ''unfair'' and what's ''material''? If the definition tried to identify all those who might stumble onto inside information, it would surely miss some. What to do, for example, about an ''outsider'' who breaks faith with his employer, say the typesetter who learned of an upcoming merger in the print shop? No definition can be perfect, but vagueness is unacceptable. Why not write a definition and let experience guide its revision? With insider trading becoming more frequent, Congress has properly voted to increase the penalties. It has also increased the urgency for spelling out the crime.

456-> MINI-BRAVETTES COME HOME WITHOUT TITLE, BUT SATISFIED
The Mini-Bravettes of Brentwood, L.I., headed home from Kansas yesterday without a world softball title. But while they lost, they said, they also won. The hard-slugging 11- and 12-year- old girls finished near the bottom at the World Tournament of Slow-Pitch Softball, peewee division, in Hutchinson, Kan. ''But we tried our hardest, and that's what counts,'' said Deana Varricchio, 11, who plays third base. The girls from Long Island also won the friendship of girls on a team from Tecumseh, Okla. - the Oklahoma Bruisers - even though the Bruisers talked ''different'' and were not interested in break dancing. Dreams of winning the world title evaporated Saturday when the Florida Americans broke a tie in extra innings and beat the Mini-Bravettes 12 to 9. The Mini-Bravettes had won their first game, on Friday, beating the Oklahoma Moore Peppers 12 to 9. ''They were battling all the way,'' Jim Allen, their manager, said in a telephone interview yesterday as the team packed up to return home while the tournament continued. ''I've been watching the Olympics all week, and now I know how the Olympic losers feel,'' said Alma Scarpati, whose daughter Lenore, 12, is a catcher. ''There is only one winner and they all go through a lot of sacrifice to get there.'' In the case of the Mini-Bravettes, even the trip to Kansas had seemed impossible last month. After a week of trying to raise money at Long Island shopping centers, they had only $2,500 of the $7,000 needed for the trip. But on the day of the deadline for entering the tournament, a surprise benefactor, Irving A. Lawner, president of the Regent Sports Corporation of Smithtown, donated the difference. Once in Kansas, the girls discovered that they faced 38 tough teams from 15 states. ''They were a bundle of nerves,'' Mr. Allen said. ''For them it was like playing in Yankee Stadium - there were air horns blowing and the stands were packed with hundreds of people.'' The girls came away with new pen pals, the players on the Bruisers. ''They were very nice, but it was hard to understand what they were saying, because they talk different,'' said Melissa Alvarez, 12, another catcher. ''They call stupid people 'muffins.' We couldn't understand that.''

459-> AROUND THE NATION; Grass Fire Peril Eases In Oklahoma and Kansas By The Associated Press
Grass fires that scorched more than 400 square miles of Oklahoma rangeland were reduced to ''a few hot spots'' yesterday, but a 15-day ban on open burning was in effect in Kansas, where fires broke out in 11 counties, destroyed a home and temporarily routed nursing home residents. The authorities in both states said the wind-driven fires were aggravated by the parched condition of grasslands, but rain yesterday eased some of their fears that new fires could spring up. There were no serious injuries from the fires, which raced across northeastern Oklahoma for two days, although an unknown number of cattle died. A fire in El Dorado, Kan., destroyed a home and outbuildings as it traveled 17 miles before being extinguished, and a second fire near Towanda stretched 12 miles. About 30 residents of the Wichita Care Center in Sedgwick County were evacuated Friday afternoon when a grass fire approached, but the flames were put out within 30 feet of the building, the authorities said.

They said Hawkeye would pay $10 million in cash and four million shares of Hawkeye common stock, giving the proposed transaction a current value of $78 million. The companies said the combination, which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 1985, would create the largest bank holding company in the state, with combined assets of $2.9 billion. Separately, United Central said its board had cut the quarterly dividend to 4 cents a share, from 7 cents, payable Oct. 26 to stockholders of record Sept. 28. It said the reduction had been made to preserve cash and maintain a low debt ratio.

464-> ISRAELI PRESIDENT DESIGNATES PERES TO FORM CABINET
Shimon Peres, the Labor Party leader, was asked today to form a new government of Israel. Mr. Peres received the mandate from President Chaim Herzog nearly two weeks after national elections that left both the Labor Party and Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud bloc without a parliamentary majority. Standing in bright sunshine outside the President's residence, Mr. Peres said he would seek ''as broad a government as possible, a government of national unity, which will bridge the rifts that have been discovered in the ground of our existence.'' Meeting With Shamir ''Mr. Shamir told me he would cooperate in forming such a government,'' Mr. Peres said, in response to questions, adding that the two political leaders were discussing whether the first meeting should ''be between the two of us with our delegations.'' ''I invited him to sit together to try to respond to what we both think is the desire of the people'' to create a national unity government, Mr. Peres said. He added that President Herzog also was pushing for a broad coalition. Mr. Peres, who has 42 days to form a government, said Israel's economic situation, security problems and political challenges ''demand the formation of a government as soon as possible.'' A Plea to All Factions He appealed to ''the factions of the 11th Knesset to lend a hand in order to form the government rapidly.'' Political commentators here predicted a lengthy negotiating process. Mr. Peres was asked if he would try to form a narrow coalition and then broaden it, a strategy that might oblige Likud to join although it might otherwise be reluctant to serve under Mr. Peres. ''I plan first to think,'' Mr. Peres said as he stepped into his car, ''and then to act.'' A group of Israelis applauded as the huge gates of the President's house swung open to let the car drive away. President Herzog said he had given the mandate to Mr. Peres not only because Labor received 63,000 more votes in the July 23 elections than Likud, but also because he had determined in meetings with party leaders that more members of the new Parliament favored Mr. Peres than Mr. Shamir. A 60-54 Advantage The figures on those meetings, released Friday, showed that 60 members of Parliament favored Mr. Peres and 54 Mr. Shamir, with five choosing no one. Rabbi Meir Kahane, whose Kach Party won one seat on a militant anti-Arab platform, was not counted because Mr. Herzog did not invite him for consultations. Labor won 44 seats in the elections and Likud 41, while 13 other parties shared the remaining 35 seats. A total of 61 seats are necessary to control the 120-seat Parliament. Mr. Peres said the new Government would attack the economic situation first, then turn to the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Lebanon, two policy areas where Labor and Likud could forge a joint policy. Mr. Peres then spoke of ''carrying out the Camp David agreements and resuming the peace process in the entire region,'' an apparent reference to resolving points of friction with Egypt and opening a dialogue with Jordan. He also spoke of the need to ''guarantee equal rights to all citizens of Israel,'' an apparent challenge to Rabbi Kahane, and he said his government ''will maintain the status quo in matters of religion.'' Labor and Likud delegations had met twice in recent days to discuss a unity government. Mr. Peres said in an interview Friday that they were ''very cautious discussions,'' with each side waiting to see who would be called to head any such broad coalition. Mr. Peres, answering questions after meeting with President Herzog, said that he had been in contact with Ezer Weizman, whose three-seat Yahad Party would probably join Labor in a narrow or a wide coalition, and that he planned to confer with other leaders of smaller parties. Complex Coalition Talks Both major parties started coalition talks immediately after the elections, but it quickly became apparent that neither side would be able to convince President Herzog that it had a ruling majority. That was true in part because some parties, particularly some of the religious factions, would not commit themselves. Meanwhile, as Mr. Herzog noted when he named Mr. Peres, the need for a decision was becoming increasingly imperative because ''we have reached an economic situation that may well be the most dangerous and difficult this state has ever known.'' Israel's economic problems include a large trade gap, a weak currency and a 400 percent annual rate of inflation. Mr. Herzog also said Israel's democracy was in danger. The President spoke of an ''absence of tolerance and dialogue'' that has received ''frightening and disgraceful public expression,'' an apparent reference to the election to Parliament of Rabbi Kahane, who has said he will introduce legislation calling for the expulsion of all Arabs from Israel, the West Bank and Gaza. President Herzog said Israelis wanted a ''strong and stable government,'' perhaps one of national unity ''based on cooperation among all the central groupings in the nation.'' A Lack of Progress The President said the Labor-Likud talks were not advancing ''in a meaningful manner'' because he had not decided ''in whom to entrust the task of forming the government.'' Thus, he said, he decided to act. Traditionally, he said, the person chosen to form a new government is the leader of the party with the largest number of seats, with the only exception being in 1983 after Menachem Begin resigned as Prime Minister. Labor had a few more seats then but Mr. Begin's Likud bloc had the largest coalition. President Herzog noted that the nation was approaching Tishah b'Av, commemorating the destruction of the Temple, symbolic of the Diaspora. He said he hoped the memory of ''that disaster 1,900 years ago, because of polarization and unnecessary hatred,'' when divided Israelites were conquered by the Romans, would help today's citizens unite. Mr. Peres had said any broad-based coalition would include one or two religious parties. Leaders of some of those parties had expressed concern that a Labor-led coalition would be less amenable to their interests than a government led by Likud. ''We will therefore all make a supreme effort to rise above the differences of opinion,'' he said in his speech today, ''to fix feasible priorities, and we will set up a government that will place the will of the people above the positions of its factions.'' The sun had not set before radio broadcasts were offering statements by Likud party members saying that Mr. Shamir still felt he could form a narrow coalition or even lead a broad- based government. The speakers said the left-wing Mapam section of the Labor alignment had said it would be very uncomfortable in any government that also contained Likud, and that if it withdrew its support Mr. Peres would no longer be able to claim to be the largest faction in Parliament.

465-> CRITICS' CHOICES; POP/JAZZ
The Celtic folk tradition extends through the British Isles, across to America and - surprisingly - into France. And while British bands such as Fairport Convention revived and electrified old songs, the French band Malicorne did something similar across the Channel. Malicorne plays French Celtic folk music on a combination of electric and early-music instruments (including krummhorns and penny whistles), and sings spirited vocal arrangements like those of the British folk-rock band, Steeleye Span. Malicorne is making a rare United States appearance Saturday at 8 P.M. at Hunter College Auditorium. Since the 1950's, the keyboardist Sun Ra has led his own kind of big band. The Omniverse Jet Set Arkestra is likely to play anything from Fletcher Henderson swing arrangements to raucous full-group improvisation to Mr. Ra's own compositions, such as ''Space Is the Place.'' Occasionally, they pause for an old-fashioned, bluesy piano solo by Mr. Ra himself. The band was originally considered avant-garde, but now it seems to have been a precursor of today's ''avant-gutbucket'' groups, who romp through the entire history of jazz. The Arkestra has also fulfilled the traditional role of big bands by introducing young soloists with potential; recent Ra graduates include the trombonist Craig Harris. The 15-piece band, including the Sun Ra stalwarts John Gilmore and Marshall Allen on saxophones, is performing on Monday nights this month at Sweet Basil.

466-> IN THE WHALE COUNTRY OF CANADA'S TUNDRA, WILD NORTH ROUNDUP FOR LOCAL AQUARIUMS
It is almost 10 o'clock on a sunny night here in the tundra. Polar bears lumber through the rocky, treeless countryside. Huge chunks of white ice float just offshore in Hudson Bay. And at the mouth of the Churchill River, the roundup is on. Like aquatic cowboys, Eskimos stand at the bows of speeding motorboats, swinging lassos and shouting, ''Go! Go! Go!'' Suddenly, a young whale flashes past the side of a boat, rising partly out of the water to breathe. An Eskimo leaps onto it, throwing his rope around its head. The whale darts off, rider and all. Two Eskimos - then six - leap into the river after them. In the end, two dozen men will help handle the whale - almost 10 feet long, almost 1,000 pounds - one of five captured here this week as two aquariums in New York and Connecticut held their first whale expedition in eight years. ''This is 'Frank Buck bring 'em back alive,' '' said Louis E. Garibaldi, associate director of the New York Aquarium at Coney Island. ''It's incredible. It's somewhere between shooting them with a gun and taking their picture.'' There are so few beluga whales in captivity that officials of the New York Aquarium and the Mystic (Conn.) Marinelife Aquarium, the expedition's sponsors, estimate that the five they took will increase the total worldwide by 20 percent. Living Longer in Captivity The capture this week and another here last week for an aquarium in Tacoma, Wash., marked the first time in four years that live whales in Canada were taken by foreigners. In part, that is because the animals are living longer in captivity (more than 20 years) and replacements are not needed as often. But it is also because of the expense (aquarium officials estimated that this week's trip cost between $25,000 and $30,000 a whale), because of mounting public pressure against the capturing of any whales and because of the lengthy process of getting permission. It took New York and Mystic more than a year to win approval from the United States and Canadian Governments, a process that included an inspection of their aquariums by representatives of the Canadian Government. ''The world isn't going to see a lot more of these expeditions,'' said Laura E. Kezer, a spokesman for Mystic. But out on the Churchill River this week, where science and sport came together under blue skies and in 40- to 50-degree temperatures, those concerns were of another world. A total of 710 beluga whales were counted in the mouth of the river Monday - drawn, in part, by a plentiful supply of fish to eat and by the warm shallow water that the young calves need. It is that abundance of the whales and the shal- lowness of the water - in addition to experienced hunters and the presence of an airport, for easier transport - that make town 1,00 miles directly north of Minneapolis the best place for capturing the animals alive. Commercial whalers, which used to kill 600 animals a year in the area, have been banned since 1968. Natives are still free to take as many whales as they want, but they kill only a handful, mostly to feed sled dogs. At one point in the two-mile-wide river this week, it seemed possible to cross by walking on the backs of whales. They swam parallel to the boats, occasionally crossing under them, coming up for air every 10 or 15 seconds. Everywhere the river was filled with the sounds from their blowholes, like that of hundreds of people sucking in deep breaths. For each capture, the natives set out in three 18- foot aluminum chase boats, buzzing through the river and banging on the boats' hulls as they drove the whales into the shallowest water. They moved in ever-tightening semicircles closer to the shore, trying to tire out the animals, watching for ones that were the right size. Beluga whales grow to be about 15 feet long, but all the whales taken this week were between 7 1/2 and 10 feet, which roughly translates into animals 2 to 3 years old. Younger ones would not yet have been weaned. When a ''jumper,'' the native on the bow, thought he had found the right-sized healthy whale, he leaped on it. ''They're not dumb creatures, I can tell you that,'' said John Hickes, the native who led the capture and who wound up with a fat lip and a broken tooth. ''They're just playing with us. As soon as you're on top of them, they try to drag you down to the bottom, to roll over and scrape your leg against a boulder. You can see them looking at you.'' Once the Eskimos had secured a whale in chest- high water - wrapping a fleece-lined plastic sling around it with the help of handlers and zoologists from Mystic and New York, who had followed the chase in 20-foot canoes - Mystic's resident veterinarian, Dr. J. Lawrence Dunn, tried to determine the animal's sex. Although no calf born in captivity has survived, both aquariums hope to breed the whales. Mystic, whose only whale, Alex, died last month, wanted a male and a female. New York, which already has a male and a female, wanted two more males and another female. An error in determining the sex would be a disaster. ''We all remember the time 'Katie' turned out to be 'Kojak,' '' Mrs. Kezer said of a former Mystic fiasco. Covered With Blankets When a whale of the right sex was found, a dozen men lifted the sling into one of the 20-foot canoes, where the pearl-gray animal lay on a four-inch-thick foam rubber mat and was covered with wet blankets. An official of the Canadian Government boated over to make sure the whale looked healthy and was within the size limit. Then it was taken to the shore, where more than two dozen men lifted the sling from the boat and carried it a hundred feet to a holding tank. The tank is guarded 24 hours a day - a few years ago a polar bear broke into it and killed a whale. The animals will remain in the tank until Sunday morning, when they will be placed in uncovered crates and flown on a Boeing 737 charter flight to Kennedy International Airport and trucked to the aquariums. The whales' extremities, including their fins, are sort of biological radiators that are filled with blood vessels and help control body temperature. So to keep the animals cool during the flight, their extremities will be packed in ice. Because they will not be in water, their skin will be coated with Crisco to keep it from drying out. A Tourist Attraction In the days before the flight, the whales are undergoing tests; one was thrown back because of a lung infection and another caught in its place. Within hours after the last of the whales had been captured, they were already drawing tourists. A group of 27 Canadians arrived by bus, cameras in hand, and surrounded the 25-foot-by-25- foot holding tank. Some reached out to pet the animals. Others just clicked away. The tourists were gone as quickly as they had come. But one woman, Esther Greene, lingered a moment, just listening to the rhythm of the breathing coming from the tank. ''I think they know we're here,'' Mrs. Greene said. ''They know we're watching them.''

HE WORLD HOW RUSSIAN Dissidents Live Four years ago, the Kremlin banished Andrei D. Sakharov to the city of Gorky, which is closed to foreigners, to cut him off from the rest of the world. Although it has succeeded in throwing a veil of secrecy over the lives of the dissident and his wife, the silence has spoken loudly to international public opinion. Conflicting information last week renewed concern about Dr. Sakharov, who was reported to have begun a hunger strike May 2 after his wife, Yelena G. Bonner, was not allowed to go abroad for medical treatment. Friends of the nuclear physicist said two letters from Miss Bonner had cast doubt on their report earlier in the week - based on a source who had not been in direct contact with Miss Bonner - that he had ended his fast and was being held against his will at a hospital. In the letters, she is quoted as having said she had not seen her husband since May 7. The letters did, however, confirm earlier statements that she has been charged with anti-Soviet activities and expects to go on trial at the end of the month. Life is no easier for Anatoly B. Shcharansky, a former activist in the Jewish emigration movement who has been in prison since he was convicted on spying and other charges in 1978. Last week his mother said his rations and visiting and correspondence privileges had been curtailed, a move that could indicate his sentence will be extended. The prison warden told her that Mr. Shcharansky, whose health has deteriorated since a 110-day fast, had violated rules, and did not meet his basket- weaving quota.

Iraq said it had destroyed five ships and shot down three Iranian F-14 jets near the Strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf.

472-> A VISIONARY ARTIST'S NEW OUTLOOK
It was impressive how much of an impact Susan Rothenberg's first horse painting had on the Minimalism- saturated art public of the middle 1970's. Along with Joel Shapiro's tiny chair sculptures, Rothenberg's horses did more than any other artworks of that period to ''break the back'' of reductive art. When I saw her first paintings at the 112 Greene Street Gallery, I was struck by how these simple figures scratched into canvas were as elemental and pure as any white square or steel slab that the most tyrannical of Minimalist artists could come up with. Beyond the child's rendering of a horse (the exclusive craft of young girls and not young boys), Rothenberg's paintings had tapped into a far more universal iconography. With the hand-worked energy of her horse's outlines, she had managed to evoke the earliest of mankind's imagery, namely the prehistoric animal paintings of Lascaux (France) and Altamira (Spain).

473-> Italy Wins Cycling; U.S. Takes Bronze
Italy captured the last cycling gold medal today winning the 100-kilometer team trial in Olympic-record time. Americans took the bronze, capping a sensational performance that yielded nine medals, the first of Americans in Olympic cycling since 1912. On the final day of the seven-day competition, the quartet of Marcello Bartalini, Marco Giovannetti, Eros Poli and Claudio Vandelli coveed the 100 kilometers of California freeway in 1 hour 58 minutes 28 seconds. The previous Olympic best was ":01.21 set by Soviet cyclists at the 1980 Moscow Games. Switzerland finished second, in 2:02.38, to earn the silver, while the United States took third, in 2:02.46. The finish dashed the hopes of an American cyclist, Davis Phinney, of bringing home a gold medal to complement that won by his wife, Connie Carpenter-Phinney, who won a gold in the women's road race on the first day of Olympic competition. Phinney said he was not disappointed. ''We support each other, and really our premier goal here was for Connie to win the road race, and for me to do the best I could,'' he said. The two had sought to become the first husband and wife to win gold medals at the same Olympics since Emil and Jana Zatopek of Czechoslovakia did it in tracks and field at the 1952 Helsinki Games. The California Highway Patrol estimated that some 75,000 people lined the course to watch the 26 teams race against the clock. The finish left the Americans with four gold, three silver and two bronze medals in eight events in a sport ruled by Europeans formost of this century. Never before had an American won a gold medal in the sport. The next-best team was West Germany, which went home with one gold, two silver and pair of bronze medals. Australia, Belgium and Italy each won a gold. Canada took home two silver, while Norway, Japan, France Mexico and Italy each won a bronze. The Italians led at every post - 25, 50 and 75 kilometers. Their time could have been even better, but they were delayed some 30 seconds when one of their riders had a flat. Vandelli said the whole squad stopped because they operate better as a team. The Soviet Union, which is boycotting the Games, won the 100-kilometer team race each of the last three Olympics. The Italiams last won the gold in the 1960 Rome Games.

474-> Kohl Pays Tribute to Officers Who Tried to Kill Hitler in '44
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany paid tribute today to the German officers who tried to assassinate Hitler 40 years ago today. ''Today, 40 years on, we remember the Germans who paid with their lives for their courageous stand for human rights and freedom, for justice and truth.'' said Mr. Kohl, who was 15 years old when World War II ended in 1945. The Chancellor has said that Count Claus von Stauffenberg, the leading figure in the unsuccessful plot, is the historical figure he most admires. Colonel von Stauffenberg planted a briefcase bomb under a heavy table at a military command meeting with Hitler on July 20, 1944. The bomb attack at Hitler's East Prussia headquarters by a small group of army officers, which left the Nazi leader with only minor wounds, was part of a nationwide coup plot designed to end a war that already seemed lost. Mr. Kohl said about 200 people were executed and 5,000 arrested after the plot failed.

475-> SPORTS PEOPLE; Offer for Tripucka
Kelly Tripucka , the Detroit Pistons' 6-foot-6-inch free-agent forward, has signed a multiyear offer sheet with the Cleveland Cavaliers that would reportedly pay him more than $700,000 a season. The Pistons have 15 days to match the offer or lose the 25- year-old Notre Dame graduate, who last season averaged 21.3 points in 76 games. Although offer sheets are commonly matched by a free agent's original club, binding him to that team under the right of first refusal, there was speculation yesterday that Tripucka would end up in Cleveland through a trade with the Pistons. ''Clearly we consider Kelly Tripucka a blue chip, top-notch player,'' said the Cavaliers' general manager, Harry Weltman , who described the signing as further evidence of the determination of the club's owners to build a winning team. The move came just a day after Cleveland had signed its first-round draft choice, Melvin Turpin , the center who starred at Kentucky, to a four-year contract worth $2.3 million. It also marked the second potential loss of a free agent by Detroit in two days. On Thursday, a Detroit guard, Vinnie Johnson , signed an offer sheet with the Knicks.

476-> JAZZ: SHANK-ROGERS QUINTET
When Bud Shank, the jazz saxophonist and flutist, came to New York from California three years ago, it was the first time he had played here in more than 20 years. He is back in town again at the Blue Note through tomorrow, and this time he has brought with him another California- based musician who has not been heard in New York for an even longer period - the trumpeter and fluegelhornist Shorty Rogers. Mr. Rogers, who was a trumpet player and arranger for Woody Herman's band in the late 1940's and with Stan Kenton in the early 1950's, has spent most of his time since then in California recording studios - writing, conducting and producing records. Like Mr. Shank, who had been playing behind studio doors for two decades, Mr. Rogers, at the age of 60, is responding to an urge to get out in front of audiences again. Both men still show the influences that touched them in their early years in the 1940's - Charlie Parker and be- bop in the case of Mr. Shank, Miles Davis and ''cool'' jazz for Mr. Rogers. Jointly leading a quintet that includes Kenny Barron, piano; Rufus Reid, bass, and Carl Allen, drums, they create an aura of the 50's, when Mr. Rogers's cool approach was laying a foundation for ''West Coast jazz,'' which also assimilated the California boppers. Mr. Shank is now an awesomely fluent alto saxophonist whose tumultuous firestorms ignite Tiny Kahn's ''T.N.T.'' and some variations on ''What Is This Thing Called Love?'' Mr. Rogers, playing fluegelhorn, is meticulously dry and precise, a musical contrast to Mr. Shank that is matched by Mr. Rogers's erect and proper posture, as opposed to his colleague's impersonation of an agitated stork. When Mr. Shank shifts to flute for Mr. Rogers's tune ''Love Spot,'' however, he reveals that he can be just as involved musically and emotionally in calmer surroundings.

477-> A VILLAGE IN INDIA: RELUCTANT PROGRESS
James Traub is the author of the book ''India: The Challenge of Change.'' By James Traub How,'' I asked Mihil Lal Shukla one fine morning, ''has the village of Chirora changed since your boyhood?'' I had had trouble finding anyone to answer this question, but Shukla was the village priest, a venerable Brahmin whose round, wire-rimmed glasses lent him an air of sagacity. Shukla rocked on the balls of his feet, scratched his skinny chin and lapsed into silence. He couldn't think of anything either. ''What about the dirt road I came in on?'' I coached him. True, said Shukla, that's pretty new. Someone in the crowd of goggling onlookers in the dusty village square volunteered that the road was 15, maybe 16 years old; new enough by Chirora's standards. What if someone got sick in the old days? Well, said Shukla, they had to carry him out to the main road, and the nearest doctor in those days might be five or six miles away. Now the doctor is two or three miles away. What happened during the rainy season? ''We were completely cut off,'' said Shukla. And if someone got sick then? As often as not they died. That afternoon, as the sun was sinking toward the edge of the vast table that is the north Indian plain, I walked through the fields with Indrapal Singh, a tall and solemn man, a ''youngblood'' - a forward-thinking, model farmer. Indrapal used high-yielding seeds, fertilizer, herbicide. Here, I thought, was someone who could not only recognize change but would welcome it. ''Why don't you buy a tractor?'' I asked. The Government, which considers the modernization of farming crucial, makes interest-free loans for farm equipment. Indrapal pondered for a moment. ''Why should I go into debt?'' he answered. ''I have enough to eat and drink, to provide for my family. Why do I need a tractor?'' I had arrived in Chirora, a village of 1,500 souls in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, to try to understand the reality of what is habitually called ''the real India'' - the villages where more than half a billion people live. In my two previous trips to India, spanning more than a year, I had passed through many villages but had never stayed in any of them. Only by living in one place, and falling into its rhythms, even for a short time - a week, as it turned out - did I think I might be able to understand the scope and speed of economic and social change in India. Chirora looked like most of the other north Indian villages I had seen. Narrow mud alleys snaked among mud houses, leaving the village awash in muck after the rain; cows and bullocks wandered glassy-eyed across tussocky courtyards; temples disclosed gaudy clay idols. Yet the village vindicated no stereotype. Here was not the rural India of our imagination, sleeping an endless sleep outside of the laws of modern history. Nor did Chirora correspond to the vibrant modern India that blooms in the campaign speeches of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and members of her ruling Congress Party, who face an election sometime before February. In this mythic India of political rhetoric, the caste system and the curse of untouchability are crumbling, economic development programs are stimulating the poor, and, to use the prevailing poster language, ''the nation is on the move.'' Nor, again, did Chirora speak of the terrifying India of religious and ethnic violence, an India where Sikhs and Hindus slaughter one another in Punjab and Moslems and Hindus riot in Bombay. Chirora, like most Indian villages, consisted almost entirely of Hindus. Chirora's basic theme was the enigma of change. We want change, I would be told by old Brahmins and young farmers alike. But, of course, it will never come, they would add, even though I could see that it had. The instruments to shape the better life they all wanted were close at hand - schools, banks, factories, agricultural extension projects. But something happens: Between the hand that reaches out for change and the instrument it tries to grasp, some shadow falls. When I first arrived in Chirora, I was taken by a group of friendly, if bemused, farmers on a tour of the fields. We wound between tiny plots of a half-acre or less, each with its microenvironment of crops - onions, potatoes, carrots, eggplant, wheat and millet, and the high bristling bushes of arhar dal, the common yellow lentil. The delicate, white-flowered mustard known as shenwa edged many of the plots like embroidery on a green napkin. We wandered past two shirtless, slender men who were watering a raised field by rhythmically dipping a bucket in an irrigation ditch and depositing the water in another ditch 12 inches above. We fetched up at the pump-operated tube well that was supposed to be irrigating the fields, but which received power only between 9 P.M. and 4 A.M. The state government, perennially short of power, has to ration it out among homes, industries and farms, and this week the farmers were irrigating by moonlight. (The next week it was 5 A.M. to 11 A.M.) ''Power supply,'' said a well- dressed farmer as we stood around the idle pump, ''is bilkul bogus'' - absolutely bogus. The speaker of this fractured English turned out to be the owner of the machinery he was cursing. His name was Natwar Singh, and he was the very image of what you could and could not achieve if you were well-born in Chirora. Natwar, like Indrapal, was a Thakur, the principal landlord caste in central Uttar Pradesh, and he owned 35 bighas , or 17 1/2 acres - a very big farm by local standards. The average farmer owned about two acres. After much prodding, he agreed that his annual profit might go as high as $1,500. Natwar was Chirora's sharpest dresser - city shoes, black leather jacket, sweater vests, and - the crucial touch - a pen in his pocket. He was also the proud owner of Chirora's fanciest diploma: He had graduated from college and taken a degree in law. Sometimes Natwar talked of finding some clients and doing the work for which he was trained, but he couldn't take his professional ambitions very seriously. ''You see,'' he said (in Hindi, since the English could only be trotted out with some forethought), ''I am my father's only son. I have to stay in the village. What else can I do?'' Natwar was a passionate adherent of the tenet that physical labor is beneath the dignity of a Thakur, a belief that idled a good many people in the village. I once asked him what he did with himself all day long. He was stumped. Finally, his friend Tripathy, the village merry-andrew, said, ''Checking.'' Natwar rocked no boats. He flatly refused when I asked him if I could speak with his wife; married women don't talk to strangers. Natwar did try to use his learning to make himself a model farmer, but nothing ever came quite right. A few years back, the nearby Ramganga Command Project was pushing poultry farming, and Natwar bought some chickens. But the chickens took ill and the project never sent over a doctor; soon Natwar had more dead chickens than live ones. A 7,000-rupee ($700) rice mill now rusts on his verandah, since the village already had two or three mills when Natwar bought his. And then there was the tube well, whose water, as Natwar should have figured out, almost nobody needed save himself. The fields were generally well-watered by the nearby Rind River. Always at the periphery of Natwar's large, cheerful entourage was a character named Guria. He was gloomy and taciturn, with rudely chopped hair and dark, moony eyes. Always he wore the shapeless, grimy pale shirt and baggy white pajamas common throughout northern India. Guria was a member of one of the ''backward'' castes, a term used in contrast to the ''forward'' castes, the Brahmins and Thakurs. He was a Mallah, meaning fisherman - this because his father had been a fisherman, though Guria himself had turned to farming. He had also gained a measure of formal political power as the u-pradhan , or sub-head, of the elected village organization known as the panchayat . Probably owing to this position, he was able to rent four acres from the gram seva , another village organization that controls common land, in addition to the measly half acre he owned. Guria's tiny brick home had but one room; here, amid sacks of grain, he lived with his wife and two little children. He also supported his parents. His household possessions amounted to a few cooking utensils, a family-planning poster - for decoration rather than propaganda purposes - and a thumb-sized sliver of mirror, almost buried in the thatch of his roof, to shave by. On my initial tour of the village, I was surprised to see that perhaps half of the houses were built of brick, whereas in many Indian villages only the rich own brick houses. Chirora, with its good water supply, may have been marginally better off than the average. But one of the village's neighborhoods, the one that faced out toward the fields, was a sea of crumbling mud huts topped by piles of thatch. Most of my tour guides had sheered off by the time we reached this squalid cluster, and I had to ask who lived there. Here, it turned out, was Chirora's third and lowest caste group, the Untouchables, known in India as Harijans, or as Scheduled Castes, since they are scheduled for affirmative-action type benefits. When I walked into the Scheduled Caste compound after a few days, nobody seemed to be about; but within minutes 40 or 50 people assembled, their faces lean, anxious and deeply seamed, their clothing pale and ancient. Even more than the others in the village they looked prematurely aged. After a moment of hesitation they proved eager to talk, and in their talk there was little but woe. As little as the backward castes had, they had less. In Chirora, as elsewhere in India, the state government has had common land distributed to the landless, most of them Scheduled Caste. But by the time distribution began about 15 years ago, population pressure had brought virtually all of Chirora's land under cultivation; all that remained were 10 acres of sandy soil, near the river. The land, though useless, was duly allocated to the Scheduled Caste families in tiny plots. Only a few of the families owned enough land to make a living; the rest got by haphazardly. Most of them worked as mazdoors , or day laborers, earning five to eight rupees (50 to 80 cents) a day. They preferred public-works construction projects, but these were only occasionally available. So they made baskets, which they could hardly sell, and waited for the harvest, when their hands would be needed once again. Wrapped in a sense of defeat, the Harijans were excluded from the life of the village. They did not wander with me from home to home, as others did. At the end of each day a group of boys and young men gathered to play volleyball in a swept court at the edge of the village; the Scheduled Castes did not play or even watch. Practically everything in the village turned on caste, but not quite in the way I had expected. I had assumed, for example, that the Scheduled Caste farmers were denied sharecropping work out of age-old prejudice, but it turned out to be something far more modern. Landowners, according to Indrapal Singh, were ''afraid that the cultivators will claim the farmer's land, and since the Government always comes down on the side of the Scheduled Castes, they may get it.'' It hadn't happened yet, Indrapal conceded, but you never know. I could scarcely believe that the forward castes, as well as the backward castes, feared the ''power'' of the most powerless group in the village. Among the young forward-caste men who dropped by my house of an evening - I stayed at the edge of the village in an ''inspection bungalow'' built for touring civil servants - it was an incessant topic of conversation. Nothing provoked them more than the Government's ''reservation'' policy setting aside development assistance, scholarships and a wide range of public-sector jobs for Scheduled Castes and tribes and several other disadvantaged groups. In Uttar Pradesh, I was told, almost 45 percent of government jobs are reserved for these minorities, and there are preferential loans and scholarships set aside for them. In a magnificent display of ire, Natwar Singh even composed an entire English sentence for me: ''All facilities Scheduled Caste, no facilities other caste.'' ''But what about the Scheduled Caste families in Chirora?'' I objected. ''They're miserably poor.'' ''You're right,'' said Tripathy with a grin. ''But they used to be poorer.'' I told some of the Scheduled Caste laborers about the exalted status imputed to them by the others. They hooted. Yes, said one, we have jobs reserved in the police, ''but to get the police job we must bribe the police sahibs .'' How much? Someone said 300 rupees; someone else said 3,000. Too much, in any case, for a poor man. What about scholarships? ''Even for scholarships,'' said one Ram Chander, sitting cross-legged in the dust across from me, ''we must go here, go there, fill out this paper and that paper. Papers alone will cost 50 or 100 rupees.'' Yet the Scheduled Castes had a success story - Pralad Kureel, a Harijan who had graduated from college and become a big wheel in the government in Lucknow, the nearest big city after Kanpur. When I went to visit Kureel, I found that he had ascended to a level simply incomprehensible from the villagers' point of view. As the accounts officer of a railway research institute, he occupied a position of authority, and underlings bustled in and out of his office with documents to be signed. He addressed these functionaries sternly, as is the fashion in India, and often in English. At age 47 he was earning 2,500 rupees ($250) a month, plus a housing allowance, and his eldest son was doing postgraduate work in physics at the renowned Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur. Yet Kureel was a bitter man. ''Here,'' he said, surrounded by telephones and memo pads, ''they respect me like anything. Then I go to the village. If I walk past any of these Thakurs, they expect a salute from me.'' In a burst of passion, he recited a long train of humiliating and harrowing incidents from the time of his youth to the present. Kureel had shaped an ideology around his anger. Since his family had been relatively prosperous, he felt that his own example proved nothing. The same castes that rule at the village level, he said, run state and local institutions. ''Until the domination by the Thakurs is ended, nothing will ever change.'' But a great deal already has changed for the Scheduled Castes, even if the basic situation remains depressingly familiar. A generation ago the Harijans were barred from the village wells and temples. These formal caste restrictions are now spoken of incredulously by right-thinking citizens. A Thakur, Bechan Lal, told me proudly, ''We have no caste feelings at all.'' (Of course, he added, he wouldn't think of taking food cooked in a Scheduled Caste home, but that counted as part of the order of nature.) On its own, the Harijan community has achieved something quite unprecedented in Chirora. In 1982, when elections for the panchayat, or village council, were held for the first time in 10 years, the Scheduled Castes voted as a bloc and elected one of their own as pradhan, or council chief. Their choice was Jawala Prasad, a respected Harijan landowner who had taken vows of sannyas - holy poverty - after the death of his wife 25 years earlier. The panchayat only meets a few times a year and has severely limited powers, and Jawala was more concerned with not giving offense than with pressing any imaginary advantages, but his election was a modest statement of independence by an oppressed class. Certainly it had alarmed the other castes. As I was hearing how the Brahmins and Thakurs had pressured Jawala not to help his own people at their expense, Guria, the minor village official who kept close tabs on my whereabouts, suddenly paid a rare visit to the Scheduled Caste compound. ''There's no need to discuss these matters,'' hissed a woman - and that was it. The old caste harmony, based on an unquestioned tyranny, is giving way to a modest level of rivalry. The Scheduled Castes have made a tiny bid for power; the upper castes, so accustomed to unquestioned authority, are wildly overreacting. Caste relations have come to resemble class relations as the ritual element of caste has begun to dwindle. Elsewhere in India, especially in areas where powerful landlords exercise feudal control over entire villages, the competition between the landless and the land-owning class has led to riots and horrible violence. In Chirora, where - more typically - no one owns more than 20 acres, it's just raised the temperature a few degrees (though, during my visit, one farmer publicly beat up his nephew when the young good-for- nothing loudly claimed that he had been euchred out of a five-acre inheritance). The peasants of Chirora thought long and hard before grasping any nettles. Like the Brahmin Mihil Lal Shukla, they didn't quite believe in change. Like the ''youngblood'' Indrapal Singh, they weren't sure how much change they wanted. Vinod Kumar Shukla, a Government officer responsible for rural development, had been trying to convince some of the young farmers to buy tractors (two older farmers already had), but without success. ''They've always used the bullock,'' he said, ''so they feel that the bullock must be better.'' The village's biggest economic problem was probably the lack of nonagricultural employment, since its population has shot up while the available acreage has scarcely grown. But Shukla said he couldn't interest anyone in village-level industry. One failure, like Natwar's chickens, quickly persuades everyone to stick to his farming. The villagers' skepticism about the future made their ambitions touchingly humble. The very subject of ambition provoked nervous laughter, sidelong glances, embarrassed silences. Everyone wanted something better for their children, but anything really better seemed absurd. Indrapal Singh told me proudly that one of his sons was in high school (ninth or 10th grade), the other in Inter (11th or 12th). Both would go to college. And then? Indrapal had a brother working as a road contractor in Gwalior, 200 miles away. But he could not imagine his boys doing anything so lucrative or so distant. He hesitated for the longest time. Finally he said, ''The force'' - the police force. A policeman, after all, wears a nice uniform, lives in town, and commands a regular income frequently supplemented by bribes; his lot was Chirora's universal aspiration, and the limit of its imaginative reach. The problem is not exactly one of belief. By now practically everyone in Chirora professes modern ideas like education and the abolition of untouchability; but they can't bring themselves to act on them. Mrs. Gandhi's 20-point program states, for example, that dowry is a social evil, and the villagers are genuinely embarrassed about its persistence. At first, everyone insisted that dowry was unheard-of in the village. Then, Ram Shanker Pathak, a prosperous, aggressive and decidedly indelicate Brahmin, told me that 20-odd years ago he had received in dowry 10,000 rupees ($1,000), a sofa set, a cabinet and plateware; nowadays, he said, the sum would be 50,000 rupees. Pathak laughed when I told him that everyone else had claimed that dowry had been abolished. ''Not even 1 percent of the families who have money won't ask for dowry,'' he said. Perhaps one can gauge the power of new ideas by the impression they have made on Chirora. No one, for example, was embarrassed at the degraded status of their wives and daughters. India's extremely tentative feminist movement had made no inroads at all. Women, especially married women, were invisible. They stayed behind brick walls in their darkened homes, kneading dough, chopping vegetables, nursing fires, spoiling babies. At times as I walked down a dusty lane, I could see clusters of women circling their saris over their heads, alarmed lest a stranger see them and even look them in the eye. The rule of purdah, which Hindu India inherited from its Moslem occupiers, was complete in Chirora. Certain women did not qualify for modesty, and thus could be seen outside the home - unmarried girls, widows and Scheduled Caste women, who had to work alongside men in the fields. An unmarried girl is a most insignificant thing, a pair of hands and a mouth, if also a giggle. A villager with three boys and two girls will answer, ''Three,'' when asked how many children he has. Nowadays many of the girls graduate from eighth grade at the local school, but with very few exceptions they don't go any further. And once a girl marries at 14 or 15 her life is fixed; her future is her mother's past. There is one institution that breaks this eternal cycle, at least for the boys - school. No young man wants to stay in Chirora, though he's probably resigned to doing so; but the only route to town is through school. Chirora built its very own junior high school five years ago, and in that time the school has made a modest contribution to social mobility. This year there were 146 children enrolled in seventh and eighth grades and as many as 50 or 60 graduates. The seventh-graders sit out in the courtyard among marigolds and sunflowers while the teacher writes on one of the building's red-painted pillars. The eighth-graders sit in a little cell inside, like monks in one of the old cave monasteries. Six boys are lined up on the left, six girls on the right. When I came in, the children were being taught how to calculate the area of plots of land shaped like squares or triangles or parallelograms. The eighth-grade teacher, Kailash Narayan, who had come earlier in the year from the district seat of Etawah, had an attendance problem. ''You see,'' he said, ''the children must be busy in the fields.'' One day I saw hardly 20 children in the whole school. Half a dozen of the boys, after much prompting from Narayan, said that they planned on going to college; none of them knew why. The only ambition I could wring out of them was an inaudibly muttered, ''Force.'' I decided, foolishly, to try the girls. Extracted from their cell, they clustered together, bumping shoulders, like deer fearing attack. They weren't going to college. Then what was the point of school? As if they should have an opinion! One girl took refuge behind a pillar. Two others turned face to face, their shoulders hunched. A fourth turned right into the pillar. I had never known a conversation to be quite so decisively killed. The villagers of Chirora do not see themselves as backward, fearful peasants stubbornly refusing their Government's entreaties to face the 20th century. Quite the contrary; they think the problem lies with the Government, not themselves. Among them it is an unquestioned article of faith that the Government, by which they mean all the politicians, public institutions and Government servants with whom they come in contact, is indifferent to their welfare, hopelessly corrupt and utterly clumsy. I asked some of the Scheduled Castes about their political preferences. ''What difference does it make?'' said Sunderlal, a tall and stooped man. ''Every election they make the same promises: We'll give you land, we'll give you electricity, we'll give you bricks.'' And do any of these promises come true? ''Nothing, sir. We don't believe any of it anymore.'' The villagers say the officials are so corrupt that the Government's schemes of self-improvement cause more trouble than they're worth. Even the patriotic Vinod Kumar Shukla had to bow to reality on this score. ''Say a farmer wants to take out a 50,000-rupee loan for a tractor,'' he said. ''First he has to bribe the Government officer to sanction the loan. Then he has to bribe the banker to give him the money. And then he has to bribe the tractor dealer to give him the tractor.'' The farmers gathered around, nodded grimly and offered more horror stories. Everyone agreed that ''bribery has reached the highest peak ever,'' and that ''there are no morals from top to bottom.'' Perhaps they would have said the same things 20 years ago; but 20 years ago the Government had so little to offer in the way of rural development that corruption scarcely made a difference. Today, few developing countries can bring as many government programs to the village doorstep as India. Yet the vast Government machinery seems to move toward the villagers as sluggishly, as haphazardly, as the villagers move toward it. I couldn't believe that virtually no one in Chirora had heard of the Ramganga Command Project, three miles away, until I found that nobody at the project had heard of Chirora. The project conducted classes in beekeeping, food preservation, horticulture, sewing - crucial skills - but the Government officers who ran it considered promotion or recruitment unnecessary. And then there was the medical and family-planning program. I found out by accident that Chirora had someone called a community health guide. It seemed that he couldn't get his stock of medicine replenished every three months, as he was supposed to, and sometimes went half a year or more with nothing to distribute. He also said that he went around the village telling people that ''a big family is bad for you,'' but without any more success than one would expect. In the whole village only about 20 women had been sterilized, virtually the only means of birth control that has worked in India (though Mrs. Gandhi's one-time campaign of forced sterilization was largely responsible for her 1977 election defeat and left sterilization - even voluntary - in some disrepute). Everyone had become aware of the need for family planning, though they remained suspicious; yet nobody was even attempting the passionate persuasion that might have overcome their resistance. Some combination of forces prevents the villagers from recognizing the changes all around them, and from accepting the idea that they can have a larger hand in their own destiny. The obvious reasons are despair, resignation, complacency, caste tyranny, corruption and neglect. And then there is beauty. That there might be beauty in such a life sounds almost condescending. Of course there was beauty in the sun's quick descent through a perfectly clear sky; in the last rays crossing the immense plain and lighting up the yellow mustard and green wheat; in the acrid, pungent smell of dung fires at dusk. But was there the kind of beauty that makes pain bearable and ambition foolish? Was there something fundamentally attractive about this life? My last night in Chirora I was invited to dinner by the brother of Babu Singh Chauhan, a landlord whose father had virtually owned the village, and whose massive, pillared home now dominated it. We dined on the roof. Sitting at a rickety table, my host, my translator and I were surrounded by a group of friends, who had happily agreed to assume the role of servants for the momentous occasion. My host had, inevitably, bought a bottle of whisky - nothing too good for the foreign guest. Since I didn't want to drink unfiltered water and he had not heard of whisky-soda, I was compelled to drink neat whisky throughout the evening. As an additional gesture, he served meat, and his goat curry was fiercely hot, as the villagers like it. I had to eat it, and each bite was like taking a step on hot coals. And I had nothing to wash it down with except neat whisky. My host, who had satisfied his obligation by feeding me lavishly, made no attempt at conversation. But the night was beautiful. Thousands of stars, more than I had ever seen, lit up the sky. From below us, on the verandah, came the sound of several dozen men chatting and laughing softly as they sat around fires in the gathering chill. Beyond them the village lay utterly silent, though it was barely 8 o'clock. And then, quite out of nowhere, my host spoke. ''Would you recite a poem?'' he asked. That took me by surprise. But I knew that in India a poem is a kind of gift, and that noble sentiments, formally expressed, are counted a high form of sincerity. I culled from my tiny stock of memorized verse a poem by Emily Dickinson. It was translated line by line. My host and the little knot of servants listened in grave silence and applauded; they were thrilled. ''Now you recite a poem,'' I said. They all looked at each other; they had expected a one-way transaction. Then, without warning, a voice rose from within the group. I never found out who had sung. After a few couplets the poem was finished; and yet it expressed a complete thought, even a complete philosophy. Ambition, striving, worldliness, the verses said, were for others; far better were peace and solitude. The poet took the voice of a flower. This, more or less, is what the flower said: I don't wish to be braided in a prince's garland; I don't wish to be strewn at a queen's feet; I don't wish to be given as a gift between lovers; I want only to be left alone to diffuse my own fragrance and essence.

478-> PAZ BIRTHDAY IN MEXICO PROMPTS WEEK'S SALUTE
Latin America's intellectual community, which thrives on political infighting as much as on art, put aside its differences this week to celebrate the 70th birthday of one of its most renowned members, Octavio Paz. Mr. Paz, the poet and essayist, was the centerpiece for a weeklong series of poetry readings and discussions of poetry, literature and intellectual life. Literary figures from Latin America joined in the celebration to pay homage to Mexico's best-known writer. The event opened last Monday night before an audience of more than 2,000 people at Mexico's Palace of Fine Arts, with the country's President, Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado, calling Mr. Paz ''the pride of Mexico.'' Wide Career Span In more than 50 years of artistic life, Mr. Paz has continually expanded his range. In addition to being a poet and a political and philosophical commentator, he has also served as Mexico's Ambassador to France, Japan and India, and has lectured at home and abroad, including courses at Harvard University. Even now, vital and youthful-looking despite his years, he is the editor of Vuelta, a monthly political and literary magazine, and is the host of a weekly television interview program here. Mr. Paz has published more than 30 books of poetry, prose and criticism, and is believed to have garnered more prizes than any of his Mexican literary colleagues. Among United States audiences, his best-known work is ''The Labyrinth of Solitude,'' published in 1950, which is still regarded as the foremost work on the complicated Mexican psyche. The novelist Carlos Fuentes, in a testimonial given at the opening ceremony, said that Mr. Paz had ''changed forever the face of Mexican literature.'' While acknowledging that the two were not always in political agreement, Mr. Fuentes said that ''as writers and as Mexicans, there is much more that unites us than separates us.'' Literature as Uniting Force ''We are united by love of literature as a tradition, as creation and as risk,'' Mr. Fuentes said. ''We are united by the concerns over the great problems of our country and that violence, repression or terrorism cannot be resolved without rationality, adherence to law, popular support, imagination, knowledge of our past and the bringing up to date of our culture.'' In keeping with the traditional workings of Mexico, the birthday celebration, sponsored by the Mexican Government, was a bit late; Mr. Paz turned 70 on March 31. Even later will be a special exhibition at the Tamayo Museum, involving artists about whom Mr. Paz has written. The show was originally scheduled to accompany the homage, but will take place next year. The fact that the Government sponsored the weeklong celebration is of note, and not only because Mexico has not habitually honored its artistic personages in this manner. Mr. Paz left the service of the Mexican Government in 1968, after more than 20 years as a diplomat, in protest over the Government's bloody handling of student demonstrations, and he had been somewhat alienated from the Government since. A Link to Love But at this week's opening celebration, Mr. Paz had kind words for the Government. ''A writer,'' he said, ''celebrates 70 years of age and more than a half century of writing and publishing poems, articles and books, and something incredible happens. The state invites his friends and colleagues so that, for five days, they can talk freely between themselves and with the public over the themes he would like, without shortcuts and without excluding the most controversial.'' The author is also celebrating 20 years of marriage to his wife, Maria Jose, and he linked art to politics, and politics to love. ''Love and politics are the two extremes of human relations, the public and the intimate, the plaza and the alcove, the group and the couple,'' he said. ''Because of this, the multiplication of forced labor camps and the threat of atomic extermination are inseparable from the crisis of love in the 20th century. They are symptoms of the same illness. If our world is to recover its health, the cure should be dual: political regeneration includes the resurrection of love.''

481-> CITY TO TEST NEW PLAN ON LAND SALES
THE corner of Wythe Avenue and Ross Street in Brooklyn may prove to be something of a turning point for New York City housing policy as well as for the troubled neighborhood of Williamsburg. On one side of Ross, just across Kent Avenue from the Brooklyn Navy Yard, a private developer has nearly completed 45 houses, each with three four-bedroom condominiums. At $75,000 to $82,000 each, all 105 apartments were sold before construction had begun, according to Aryeh L. Gutman, principal in the Williamsburg-based Paz Development Company. The buyers were chiefly members of the rapidly expanding community of Orthodox Jews east of the Ross site. The success of the Ross project, in an otherwise desolate area of abandoned factories and empty lots, has demonstrated a market for development here that has led the city to start its own development program. The intent is to recycle city-owned property and at the same time assist lower-income Williamsburg residents. Under the program, called cross-subsidization, the city Department of Housing Preservation and Development would sell its vacant properties to developers and use the proceeds to assist housing production or improve other city-owned properties in the neighborhood. ''The basic thing is that everybody benefits by the neighborhood's development,'' said Anthony B. Gliedman, the city's commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development. ''Development becomes a unifying factor rather than a divisive factor.'' If successful, the technique may also prove useful in the city's efforts to sell other marketable vacant land and empty buildings in Manhattan, efforts that have been resisted by advocates of using the land for lower-income housing. Often the issue has an ethnic dimension, as it does in Williamsburg, where Hispanic and Orthodox Jewish communities have differing housing objectives. Although the cross-subsidization experiment in Williamsburg was announced more than a year ago by Mayor Koch, it has been delayed for months, partly by requests from the Department of City Planning for additional environmental-impact studies. Another stumbling block has been in the establishment of a committee to advise on the use of the subsidy fund. A compromise worked out after months of discussions calls for a committee of three Hispanic members and three Jewish members, with Vincent V. Abate, chairman of the local planning board, as the seventh member. Mr. Abate will probably be a nonvoting chairman, although the committee has yet to formalize its rules. The housing agency says requests for proposals will be taken in the next few weeks on the first lots to be sold, which are across Ross Street from the Paz-Ross development site. City housing officials are clear about how they want the cross-subsidy system to work. They have selected four ''donor'' sites in the predominantly Jewish section of Williamsburg near the Paz-Ross site. Funds from the sale of these lots would be used at nine or more smaller ''recipient'' sites in the predominantly Hispanic section of Williamsburg on the north side of Division Avenue. The initial lots to be sold total slightly less than 400,000 square feet. The median family income in the predominantly Jewish sections of Williamsburg averaged nearly $9,000, according to city planning officials using 1980 census data. The median income was less than $7,000 in the predominantly Hispanic areas being considered for assistance under the cross-subsidy fund. The city wants the sale proceeds to be used to help low- and middle-income residents buy private homes on the recipient sites. There would either be direct grants to assist buyers with their down payments, or ''mortgage shaving'' subsidies to reduce the interest rate on the buyers' financing. The cross-subsidy committee will make the spending recommendations, but city officials emphasize that the department will make the final decisions. The recipient sites are mostly on South Eighth and Ninth Streets between Wythe and Driggs Avenues. The amounts to be contributed to the cross- subsidy fund in Williamsburg are expected to remain small. Estimates range from $2 million to $3 million from sale of the first three city lots selected, including the site at Ross and Wythe. Mr. Gutman, director of the Paz-Ross project for Paz Development, said his company paid about $3 a square foot two years ago for the 120,000-square-foot lot on Ross and Wythe, which is the company's first major residential project. He estimated that the land in the area was worth about $4 a square foot. That would put the value of the city's 134,000 square-foot lot on the other side of Ross at about $540,000. Land values are closer to $5 a square foot nearer the center of Williamsburg's commercial area, Mr. Gutman said. New York City's property inventory in Williamsburg includes not only sites where property has been taken in tax-foreclosure proceedings, but also urban-renewal land, which includes the site on Ross Street. Herb Siegel, the housing department's director of Brooklyn planning, estimated a development potential for at least several hundred housing units if all the marketable land were made available for nonsubsidized development. After the lot on Ross Street has been sold, two other vacant primary Williamsburg parcels, one on Division Avenue and one on Ross Street, are expected to be opened for developers' proposals within a few months. A fourth site on the corner of Ross and Bedford Avenue was sold for $140,000 earlier this year, before the cross-subsidy fund had been established. That money is also to be available for the fund. The largest lot is the Division Avenue site, which runs from Division to Clymer Street, on the north end of the block. It totals more than 163,000 square feet. The cross-subsidy approach is being considered for the Lower East Side of Manhattan and the Clinton neighborhood in the West 40's and 50's. The potential contributions from a Lower East Side project would be much higher than in Williamsburg, city officials believe - perhaps as much as $15 million. The key to cross-subsidization, city officials say, is marketability. While many areas of the city contain large blocks of city-owned land, only in those neighborhoods being considered - all of which also have a substantial number of low-income residents - does that land co-exist with areas with a market for unsubsidized housing. If there are no buyers for the city lots, or if the market price for the land is negligible, then cross-subsidizing may be ineffective. Williamsburg, which sprawls along the East River north of Brooklyn Heights and Fort Greene and west of Bedford-Stuyvesant, was selected by the city because it represents a singular mix of ethnic and religious groups and income ranges living in a narrow area. The population is also growing rapidly, particularly among the Orthodox Jewish population, where it is not unusual to find families of seven or eight children. Moreover, according to the precepts of their faith, the Jews must live near their rabbi and their synagogue. All these factors, city planners say, have contributed to a rapidly growing demand for housing that has raised real-estate values and rents and threatened to push many lower-income residents out of Williamsburg. Although Jews and Hispanic people are neighbors in some of Williamsburg's large subsidized housing projects - notably the Roberto Clemente Plaza housing project, which has a court-ordered ratio near 50-50 - the two groups have generally lived apart. Rising rents throughout the neighborhood, however, mostly fueled by the increase in development among the Hasidim, have threatened to change what Charles Reiss, deputy housing commissioner in charge of development, called the neighborhood's ''integrity.'' ''Cross-subsidization is an attempt to let people stay where they want to stay,'' he said. ''We did not, and will not, choose between one group and another.'' The Rev. Matthew Foley, pastor of the Epiphany Roman Catholic Church, perhaps the central cultural institution of Williamsburg's Hispanic community, said he thought the plan was also indicative of a change in attitude on the part of the city. ''In the past, you had to push to get involved,'' he said. ''Now the city seems very aware of the groups that they want involved here.''

482-> CITY'S FIRST NEW FIREHOUSE IN 12 YEARS OPENS IN QUEENS
Happy to have the big brick box in their tree-lined midst and eager to get a rare glimpse of their Mayor, the people of Bayside, Queens, filled Springfield Boulevard last Monday for the first opening of a New York City firehouse in 12 years. ''They got Koch here - oh, boy,'' said one to another as they looked over the quarters of two new Queens companies, Ladder 160 and Engine 326. Teen-agers lounged on the fire trucks outside. A few were chased off by a police officer who addressed each as ''Sonny.'' An almost suburban tranquillity was cracked by the sound of Emerald Society bagpipers as the ceremony began. ''They're very glad to see us,'' said Capt. Robert J. Downey of the ladder company, speaking about his new neighbors. One of them, Fire Commissioner Joseph E. Spinnato, said, ''People have been stopping by and chatting with the firefighters.'' Building Cost $2.1 Million With a grin, he added, ''The fact that I live right behind here has absolutely nothing to do with its location.'' The construction of the firehouse began before he was sworn in as Commissioner last year. Standing at Springfield Boulevard and 64th Avenue, the two-story, $2.1 million building is distinguished by little other than a black-and-white marble mosaic outside. It depicts firefighters at work. What is important about the structure, city officials said, is that New York is once again building firehouses. The last one opened in Astoria, Queens, in 1972. ''In the interim, the city suffered a slight financial embarrassment,'' Borough President Donald R. Manes said. ''It's a lot better to open a firehouse than to try to keep one from closing.'' There was no money for the ladder company in the budget proposed by Mayor Koch last April. It was added in negotiations with the City Council and the Board of Estimate. How the Mural Helps But the Mayor seemed happy to take credit for both companies yesterday before his very receptive audience. He even offered an esthetic assessment. ''The mural makes the firehouse look like a'' - pause - ''library,'' Mr. Koch said. ''Isn't that good? The mural is by Ned Smyth. Smith? Smyth?'' He was told it was Smyth. ''Well, it could've been Smith until you got hoity-toity.'' The Commissioner of General Services, Robert M. Litke, presented the second symbolic firehouse key to the Mayor. The first, made of wood, broke in half the other day when someone sat on it. ''The Mayor said it looked like a library,'' Mr. Litke said. ''The Comptroller said it blended with community design. Let me promise you it will act like a firehouse, and, when the bell goes off, it will sound like a firehouse.''

483-> NEW YORK DAY BY DAY;
Urban Wildlife Sanctuary On Prall's Island in the murky Arthur Kill between Staten Island and the oil tank farms of Linden, N.J., about 400 pairs of herons have taken up residence. The 600-by-2,250-foot island, south of the Goethals Bridge, is on its way to becoming the nation's first urban Audubon wildlife sanctuary, according to Margaret Kane, chairman of the Audubon Society task force guiding the plan through the New York City bureacracy. Community Board 2 has approved. The Department of General Services is preparing a long-term lease, which, its spokesman, Stuart Fischer, said, should be at nominal rates. The Parks Department is expected to assume jurisdiction for the city. Then the Audubon Society, according to Miss Kane, will expand its efforts and try to make another sanctuary on Shooter's Island - in the Kill van Kull, around the bend northeast of Prall's - which is a haven for dozens of species of water birds, such as herons and egrets. She said the two islands and Goethals Pond on Staten Island formed an ecosystem. Why would heron colonies nest in view of the tank farms, one of the eeriest of ugly industrial landscapes? ''Amazing,'' agreed Miss Kane. ''Probably because it's so isolated.'' To keep the birds comparatively free of human intrusion, the Audubon Society, in cooperation with Cornell Ornithological Laboratory, will set up ''some sort of community education component,'' she said, but will keep access limited.

485-> BRAZIL TESTS LIMITS OF LIBERATION THEOLOGY
Leonardo Boff, the Brazilian theologian who last week underwent four hours of interrogation by the Vatican for his advocacy of liberation theology, contends that he is not the real target. ''There's an old German adage,'' he said before his trip to Rome. ''You hit the yoke, but you think of the donkey. They're hitting me, but they're thinking of the church in Brazil.'' The presence of three influential Brazilian prelates in Rome last week to coincide with Friar Boff's ''dialogue,'' as the Vatican called it, suggested that much of Brazil's Catholic hierarchy shared this view. Nowhere has the controversial theology of liberation been carried out more consistently and widely than in Brazil, where its proponents have placed on the church the obligation to combat economic and social ills. Friar Boff, a 44-year-old Franciscan, has preached this thinking in his theology classes at a seminary near Rio de Janeiro, urging structural changes in society to fight poverty. Until now, the political and at times revolutionary roles played by some clergy in Central America, notably Nicaragua, have provoked sharper confrontations with Rome than the less spectacular social involvement of Brazil's bishops and priests. An official Nicaraguan delegation visited the Vatican last week in the hope of reversing an order that four Catholic priests resign their posts in the Sandinista Government. But the condemnation of Marxist aspects of liberation theology, issued last week by the Sacred Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith with the approval of Pope John Paul II, has led churchmen here to believe that Rome is now also intent on switching the focus of the church in Brazil and elsewhere in Latin America back to strictly evangelical work. The Vatican document shares the liberationists' condemnation of oligarchies without social conscience and military dictators who make a mockery of human rights. But it rejects the Marxist concept of the class struggle and warns against totalitarian and atheistic regimes that come to power ''precisely in the name of the liberation of the people.'' In Brazil's case, a change of emphasis would not come easily. Not only does Brazil have the largest single Catholic congregation and the third largest hierarchy in the world, but an overwhelming majority of its 358 bishops also supports identifying the church's with the problems of injustice. Further, the church here appears to have reached its position not through intellectual adherence to liberation theology, but through a gradual process of transformation. Political developments in Brazil were important catalysts. In 1964, most Brazilian bishops endorsed the country's military coup because they feared growing leftist influence among peasants and workers. But by the end of the decade, after numerous priests and nuns were detained, tortured and expelled in the battle against leftist guerrilla groups, several bishops jumped to their defense and, by implication, criticized the regime. From an initial concern with human rights, the church slowly broadened its vision to include social, economic and political rights. In 1975, for example, the Peace and Justice Commission of the Sao Paulo Archdiocese scathingly condemned Brazil's ''economic miracle,'' asserting that concentration of wealth during the country's boom years had made most Brazilians poorer. At a time when the army seemed the only nationwide power in the country, the church found itself playing the role of a broad-based opposition. The outspoken Archbishop of Recife and Olinda, Dom Helder Camara, was banned by censors from mention by the press, but his influence was felt across the impoverished Northeast. The biggest step has been to develop ecclesiastical communities that have provided the church with a huge grassroots base. These communities, which now number some 70,000 and have four million members, comprise small groups of Christians who meet regularly to discuss the Bible and their faith in the context of their daily lives. Since the communities are often organized by priests among peasants, workers and slum-dwellers, they provide a forum for wider analysis of social, economic and political problems. They also produce leaders who go on to organize trade unions or other activist outlets. Unlike some Nicaraguan priests, Brazil's clergy has not suggested a new ''people's church'' as an eventual rival to the bishops, although the Vatican is concerned that an attack on the established hierarchy might be one consequence of liberation theology. Proponents of this theology do favor a more humble and democratic church. Continent-Wide ChangeThe changes in the Brazilian church have not taken place in isolation from the rest of continent. The Latin American Bishops' Conference in Medellin, Colombia, in 1968 chose to exercise ''a preferential option for the poor.'' Socially engaged priests had appeared in most countries even before the Peruvian priest, Gustavo Gutierrez, published his influential work, ''A Theology of Liberation,'' in 1971. But Brazil's bishops and theologians carry special weight in the region, a fact seemingly confirmed by the Vatican's efforts to keep them in line. Friar Boff reported after his interrogation, however, that he had not been asked to change anything. The Vatican said it would ''study'' the results. Before flying to Rome to join Aloisio Cardinal Lorscheider of Fortaleza and Archbishop Ivo Lorscheiter, president of the Bishops' Conference, Paulo Cardinal Arns of Sao Paulo suggested that no dramatic ''surrender'' should be expected. ''The liberation of the poor is an aspiration rooted in human dignity,'' he said. ''The message of liberation is central to Christianity.''

489-> PENN STATE PREVAILS BY 25-24
Maryland missed a 2-point conversion pass after its final touchdown with 1 minute 57 seconds to play today and Penn State escaped with its 20th consecutive victory in the series, 25-24. Later, Maryland (2-3), which was out of timeouts, drove from its 28- yard line to the Penn State 35 with 4 seconds to play but could not get its field-goal team lined up before time expired. Doug Strang passed for two touchdowns and ran for a third for Penn State (4-1), which is 27-1 in the rivalry. Penn State had seemingly insured the victory by scoring 11 points in a 27-second span for a 25-11 lead with 14:33 remaining in the fourth quarter. Then Maryland rallied when Stan Gelbaugh passed to the split end Eric Holder, who was wide open at the 20, for a 45-yard touchdown that helped reduce the margin to 25-18 with 9:48 left. Then Maryland took the ball after a punt at its 43 and drove to a touchdown in five plays. Gelbaugh, a junior from Carlisle, Pa., who was playing instead of the injured Frank Reich, completed passes of 10 yards to Tom Neal and 15 to Greg Hill for a first down at the 23. Rick Badanjek ran 5 yards and Al Blount broke through the middle for 18 yards and a touchdown. With the score 25-24, Gelbaugh, who completed 22 of 48 passes for 308 yards, overthrew Hill, who was double-covered in the back of the end zone, on the 2-point try. ''When we were up 25-11, I thought we had it,'' said Joe Paterno, the Penn State coach. ''I guess we played too close to the vest. I should have opened up more.'' Paterno complimented Bobby Ross, the Maryland coach, for going for the victory rather than settling for a potential tie. ''He showed his class,'' Paterno said. About the time running out, Ross said: ''It was total bedlam. There were eight seconds left and we wanted to kill the clock by throwing the ball out of bounds. We had no timeouts. But somebody on the sidelines called 'field goal' and the next thing I knew the officials were walking away.'' D. J. Dozier, the sophomore tailback for Penn State, did not play due to a groin injury that had forced him to miss two other games this season. Pitt 17, East Carolina 10 PITTSBURGH (UPI) - Craig Heyward, a freshman running back from Passaic, N.J., rushed for 110 yards on 17 carries, and John Congemi passed for two touchdowns as Pitt (1-4) ended a six-game streak without a victory. It was Pitt's first triumph at home in four games this season. East Carolina fell to 1-5. After Mark Brasco's 37-yard field goal provided a 17-3 lead at 14:24, marking the first time Pitt scored in the final period this season, Jimmy Walden ran 22 yards for a touchdown with 10:14 remaining to help cut the margin to 17-10. Brasco then missed a 42-yard field-goal try with 6:28 to play, but East Carolina could not move on its final two possessions and ended the game deep in its territory. Boston U. 27, Delaware 3 BOSTON (AP) - Pat Mancini passed for three touchdowns and Dan Green made two field goals as Boston University (5-0), the nation's fifth- ranked Division I-AA team, achieved its best start since 1949. Delaware (2- 3) trailed by 17-0 at halftime. Delaware's deepest thrust was stopped inches shy of a first down at the 4. Lehigh 25, Northeastern 14 BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) - Marty Horn and Rennie Benn combined for two fourth-quarter touchdowns to rally Lehigh (4-1). Horn passed twice for 8-yard scores to Benn to overcome a 14-13 deficit. Rhode Island 20 Massachusetts 19 KINGSTON, R.I. (AP) - Tom Ehrhardt passed for 405 yards and three touchdowns, setting school records, as Rhode Island (5-1, 2-0) set five individual and three team school marks in the Yankee Conference game. Massachusetts is 2-3, 0-1. Ehrhardt set a one-game individual total-offense mark of 410 yards, a game-completition record of 37 passes and a career-touchdown passing record of 15. Tony DiMaggio set a game receiving record of 152 yards, and Brian Forster set a mark of 13 receptions in a game. The Rams set a total-team offense mark of 555 yards, surpassing the 533 set in 1952, and game records for first downs, 29, and offensive plays, 96. New Hampshire 13 Connecticut 12 DURHAM, R.I. (AP) - Scott Perry rushed for 177 yards and a touchdown for New Hampshire (4-1), which stopped a 2-point conversion attempt by Connecticut (2-3) with 1:35 remaining. After Chris Riley had passed 7 yards to Kane Winn for the touchdown, the Huskies twice failed on the 2-point conversion, even after a penalty gave them a second chance. Maine 22, Lafayette 20 ORONO, Me. (AP) - Bob Wilder ran for two touchdowns and completed 12 of 25 passes for 200 yards as Maine ended a four-game losing streak. The cornerback Gary Groves knocked down a 2-point conversion pass attempt after the final touchdown by Lafayette (2-3). Trinity 17, Williams 16 WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass. (AP) - Trinity (3-0) capitalized on three Williams fumbles. Tom O'Connor of Williams (1-2) ran 8 yards for 10-3 lead in the third quarter. Joe Shield, who completed 22 of 32 passes for 211 yards, threw 14 yards to Rich Nagy and 21 to Tim McNamara for scores in the fourth quarter for Trinity (3-0). Hobart 28, Rochester 7 GENEVA, N.Y. (AP) - Tom O'Hare passed for a touchdown and ran for another as Hobart (3-1) achieved its best start since 1977. Rochester (1- 3) was held to 49 yards rushing.

The Flying Dutchmen (4-0) trailed, 13-0, after the Cardinals (1-3) scored on Tony Gallis's 27-yard pass to Chris Veno with 9 minutes 45 seconds left in the contest. McLaughlin, who completed 19 of 31 passes for 264 yards in the game, then connected on a 47-yard pass to Tony Woods for Hofstra's initial score.

493-> IDEAS & TRENDS ; Luring RoachesInto a Fatal Trap
Cockroaches, as everyone knows, thrive on adversity. They have evaded countless and creative schemes to wipe them out, infesting six continents and probably most New York City apartments at one time or another. In recent months, however, scientists have found an effective way to ambush the mighty Periplaneta americana, or American roach, by taking advantage of one of its weaknesses: a very strong sex drive. It had been known for years when a trap is baited with the stimulant given off by the virgin female roach, the males will fight to get in. The females are in turn lured by all the commotion. The problem had been that 75,000 virgin roaches yield only 200 millionths of a gram of stimulant. Then, last December, Dr. Stuart L. Schreiber, an associate professor of organic chemistry at Yale, and Conrad Santini, a research associate, reproduced in a laboratory the cockroach aphrodisiac, called periplanone-B, to lure the bugs into pesticide-treated traps. A minute amount of the synthesized stimulant drove males into a frenzy and left them suffering from ''severe sexual fatigue'' - with broken antennae, gnawed legs and tattered wings. ''It was a flash of eureka,'' Dr. Schreiber said of his discovery. Earlier this month, he said that a company was negotiating with Yale to test and market the stimulant, although it will probably be years before the concoction makes it from laboratories to supermarkets. And the synthesized aphrodisiac appeals only to the American cockroach, the kind that plagues New Yorkers. In most of the nation's northern cities, they are outnumbered slightly by the smaller German cockroaches.

SPENDING POLICY To the Editor In ''Dangers of Off-Budget Antics'' (Sept. 2), Stephen Berger states that ''In addition to farming, major off- budget programs include housing (the biggest program), rural electric loans, guaranteed student loans, the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Export-Import Bank.'' The Export-Import Bank of the United States is not an off-budget program. The Bank borrows funds from the Federal Financing Bank for re- lending. These borrowings do not take Eximbank's lending off budget. The practice to which Mr. Berger was referring is selling loans to the Federal Financing Bank which can effectively take the loans sold ''off-budget.'' Eximbank does not sell loans to the Federal Financing Bank. J. RUSSELL BONER Vice President, Public Affairs Eximbank New York, Sept. 28

497-> SCHOOL DISTRICTS WARNED ON 'REPOS'
12 ALBANY, May 11 - The New York State Comptroller warned local governments and school districts today not to invest their idle funds through repurchase agreements such as those offered by the Lion Capital Group. Lion Capital, a small government securities dealer, filed for bankruptcy last week and listed among its 20 largest unsecured creditors 14 New York school districts and Saratoga County, just north of here. ''It sounds like good advice to me,'' George Gasser, the treasurer of Saratoga County, said after being informed of the directive. The county has $3 million invested in repurchase agreements with Lion Capital. In all, more than three dozen school districts and counties in the state had such agreements with Lion Capital, totaling some $20 million. The Comptroller, Edward V. Regan, said he was advancing a state aid payment - normally due May 15 - to two districts to help them with cash-flow problems. The two are Byram Hills in Armonk, in Westchester County, and Clyde-Savannah, in upstate Wayne County. Mechanics of Agreement In a repurchase agreement, or repo, in the traders' jargon, the lender (the local government or school district) uses its spare funds to buy government securities under an agreement in which the borrower (Lion Capital) agrees to repurchase the securities later at a price that includes the interest payments. This relatively sophisticated investment usually yields higher returns than many other investment opportunities available to local governments. But in the case of Lion Capital, the securities involved in the repurchase agreements were frozen when the firm filed for bankruptcy. ''The districts are unable to recoup their investments until the case is resolved by the Federal Bankruptcy Court,'' Mr. Regan said. Earlier Regan Staff Opinion Some of the school districts have sought to place at least part of the blame for their predicament on Mr. Regan. Last year a member of Mr. Regan's staff wrote an opinion saying it was legal for local governments to do business with National Money Market Services, a firm in Irvine, Calif. While the letter did not specifically deal with repurchase agreements, National Money Market used it, in effect, as advertising to attract the school districts and local governments to invest in repurchase agreements with Lion Capital, state officials said. In addition, a state education official, James P. Rourke, wrote a letter to National Money Market saying: ''In any investment program, safety and liquidity are our prime concerns and your program at National Money Market has met these concerns.'' Previous Warning Cited But Mr. Regan's spokesman, Marvin Nailor, said today that the Comptroller had previously warned local governments and districts about repurchase agreements. The warning cited by Mr. Nailor was in a January 1983 newsletter. That newsletter said, ''The State Comptroller has expressed the view that municipalities and school districts may properly use their monies to enter into repo agreements.'' But it cautioned them ''to carefully examine the terms and conditions of any proposed agreement to insure that they are in fact purchasing the underlying securities and not merely accepting them as collateral for a loan.'' Mr. Nailor said today that many local governments and school districts simply did not have the sophistication to assess the agreements. In the Lion Capital case, it appears that the securities involved were also being used as collateral in other dealings by Lion Capital, Mr. Nailor said. Mr. Nailor said the municipalities and school districts still had the legal authority to enter into repurchase agreements since today's directive by Mr. Regan is not binding. Mr. Gasser of Saratoga County said that, since the trouble developed with Lion Capital, the county had canceled all repurchase agreements with other firms except for overnight and over- weekend agreements. He said it would be difficult for the county to cancel those.

498-> BIRTHPLACE OF SUFFRAGIST TO GET NEW RECOGNITION
The parlor is painted pink, linoleum covers the white pine floors and a television aerial is nailed to the roof. Home to a private family for the last 35 years, the 1817 structure has long stood in oblivion on a back road in Berkshire County. On Sept. 24, in this season of Geraldine A. Ferraro and women's surge into politics, recognition and restoration are to come to the house, the birthplace of Susan B. Anthony, the suffragist. In a ceremony here, papers are to be signed passing ownership of the house to Dr. Alice Grellner, a professor at Rhode Island College. Dr. Grellner plans to restore the building and turn it into a public center for seminars for women planning careers in business and politics. She Campaigned for 50 Years Born here in 1820, Miss Anthony campaigned for more than 50 years to win the right to vote for women. This right, assured by the 19th Amendment, was adopted in 1920, 14 years after her death. The restoration of Miss Anthony's birthplace comes in this election year when candidates and parties are scrambling harder than usual to cloak themselves in the suffragist's mantle. In Washington last Feb. 15, President Reagan attended a Susan B. Anthony birthday gala sponsored by the Campaign Fund for Republican Women. Mr. Reagan reminded the cheering crowd that the only time Miss Anthony voted, illegally in 1872, she voted Republican. Across town, the Democratic National Committee countered with a seminar called ''Let's Save Susan B. Anthony's Reputation.'' Walter F. Mondale, the Democratic Presidential nominee, attended a Miss Anthony birthday party sponsored by the National Organization for Women. ''Everyone is trying to claim Aunt Susan,'' Susan B. Anthony 2d, grandniece of the suffragist, said at a third rally in Washington, sponsored by the Women's Voters Project. The center of this attention came into life here in the right front downstairs room of the house at the corner of East and Walling Roads in this old mill town in the Berkshire hills, now home to about 10,000 people. One of Seven Children Susan B. Anthony was the second of seven children born to Daniel and Lucy Read Anthony. The father was a Quaker and the mother was a Baptist. Mr. Anthony, a manufacturer of cotton yarn, purchased the half- acre lot for $50 from his father and built the 2 1/2-story house with lumber received from his father as a wedding gift. When Miss Anthony was 6 years old, her family packed their belongings in several wagons and moved to western New York State. They eventually settled in Rochester, where a memorial now stands to her. However, the house here remained in the family until 1895 and Miss Anthony frequently returned for family reunions. Outside the Berkshires, she rose to national fame, giving speeches for women's suffrage from 1853 until one week before she died in 1906, according to Ann Gordon, a co-editor of the Susan B. Anthony papers at the University of Massachusetts. The suffragist successfully lobbied for a law passed in New York State in 1860 that gave women control over their wages, the right to bring court actions and the joint guardianship of their children. She Voted for Grant ''The main, long term project of her life was to mobilize women to gain the vote,'' said Dr. Gordon, a historian. In the 1872 Presidential election, Miss Anthony, with the cooperation of a sympathetic male registrar, illegally registered in Rochester and voted for Ulysses S. Grant, the Republican candidate. She was arrested and fined $100, but the fine was never collected. The 1884 election year illustrates how far the women of 100 years ago were from participating in politics. As a leader of the National Women Suffrage Association, Miss Anthony wrote letters to 100 Congressmen pleading for the women's right to vote. In March of 1884 the association held its annual meeting in Washington. Miss Anthony and other women attending it also testified before Senate and House select committees on women's suffrage. The Senate committee voted to recommend passage, but the issue was easily defeated on the floor. In the House, some members spoke for abolishing their select committee. 'I Want to Protect Her' ''When a woman so far misunderstands her duty as to want to go to work on the roads and making rails and serving in the militia and going into the Army, I want to protect her against it,'' Representative John H. Reagan, Democrat of Texas, said in a speech that reflected the prevailing male thinking of the day. Despite Miss Anthony's defeats on the national scene, residents of of her birthplace never forgot their most famous daughter. Descendants of the original Quaker settlers, the Adams Society of Friends Descendants, maintained the house as a museum from 1926 until 1949 when, short of funds, they sold it a family. Before returning the building to public use, Dr. Grellner needs to raise funds to repair the sagging roof, repoint the twin chimneys, waterproof the leaking fieldstone foundation and shore up the support beams. With or without the homestead open to the public, the town continues to honor Miss Anthony. Every February, when most towns hold Washington's birthday sales, the Adams Chamber of Commerce promotes annual Susan B. Anthony birthday sales. Town boosters are still sensitive over the cool national reception to the Susan B. Anthony silver dollar, introduced in 1979. The state has honored her, too. In 1969, the state declared Aug. 26 the anniversary of the adoption of the 19th Amendment, to be ''Susan B. Anthony Day.''

499-> CAMPAIGN NOTES; 20 Groups Ask 4 Debates By Reagan and Mondale
Twenty groups representing labor, consumers and the elderly asked President Reagan and his Democratic challenger, Walter F. Mondale, on Friday to agree to four televised debates instead of two. Before he was nominated at the Democratic National Convention last July, Mr. Mondale challenged Mr. Reagan to six debates. Mr. Reagan originally proposed one. They compromised on two, the first to be held in Louisville on Oct. 7 and the second in Kansas City on Oct. 21. Among the groups joining in the call for four debates were the Consumer Federation of America, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the Citizen Labor Energy Coalition, the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Future, the Democracy Project, Environmental Action, the Voter Education Department of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the National Council of Senior Citizens, the National Organization for Women, Public Citizen, the Sierra Club and the United Food and Commercial Workers.

501-> MUNCIE FAILS TEST, VOIDING HIS TRADE
Chuck Muncie failed his physical at the Miami Dolphins' training camp today, voiding the trade that brought him to Miami from the San Diego Chargers earlier this week. Don Shula, Dolphin coach, announced the test results at a news conference this afternoon. Shula said the physical consisted of two parts, orthopedic and urinalysis, and that the 31-year-old running back had passed the orthopedic half but failed the urine test. Later in the afternoon, Commissioner Pete Rozelle issued a statement in which he ordered Muncie, who in 1982 entered a drug and alcohol detoxification center, to undergo ''a complete drug evaluation and to comply fully with any recommendations made as a result of the evaluation.'' Declared Ineligible ''Muncie will be ineligible to play with any team in the N.F.L. until successful completion of any prescribed treatment,'' Rozelle said. ''His failure to report for the evaluation, or to comply with any recommended treatment, will result in immediate suspension.'' Shula said results of the test were confidential. But as he was leaving camp, Muncie said t.h.c., the active ingredient in marijuana, had been discovered. ''They said they found traces of t.h.c. from rehabilitation 78 days ago, and I guess Don Shula doesn't want that,'' Muncie said. ''I am a little disappointed, but I have a lot more football to play.'' The trade, in which the Dolphins gave the Chargers a 1985 second- round draft choice, was contingent upon Muncie's passing the physical. ''He belongs to San Diego,'' Shula said. ''And we are now again going to look around to see what's available.'' Dolphins Short of Runners The Dolphins acquired Muncie Monday to fill the gap left when the starting fullback Andra Franklin was knocked out for the season with a knee injury. Muncie, a ninth-year player, ranks sixth among active rushers with more than 6,500 yards. But his career has been troubled. Twice he has missed team planes, once just after he broke into the league with the New Orleans Saints and again last weekend. Both times he said he was delayed because the tires on his car were slashed, an excuse that the Chargers' coach, Don Coryell, said he did not believe. In 1982, acknowledging a dependency on cocaine, he left the Chargers for three weeks in August and entered a detoxification center. In an interview on Monday, Muncie said he had not used drugs since then.

502-> CAMPAIGN NOTES; Mondale's Son Speaks To Labor Convention
Ted Mondale, the son of Walter F. Mondale, the Democratic Presidential nominee, brought hundreds of cheering union members to their feet Friday as he denounced President Reagan and told them what it would be like if his father were elected. ''Ronald Reagan wants a union-free country,'' the 27-year-old Mr. Mondale told the convention of the Connecticut A.F.L.-C.I.O. ''My father wants a country of free unions.'' That line brought him one of a half- dozen standing ovations from the cheering workers, who clapped and chanted, ''We want Fritz!'' Noting that Mr. Reagan frequently portrayed his father as a pessimist, the candidate's son said: ''Let's get one thing straight right now, Mr. President. My father's optimistic about America's future, but he's pessimistic about your ability to take us there.''

503-> North Bergen Wins And Stays Unbeaten
North Bergen remained unbeaten after three games when it scored a 24- 6 victory over Snyder of Jersey City yesterday in North Bergen. North Bergen opened a 14-0 lead in the first quarter. Pete Lomabrdi went 1 yard to cap a drive that began with a fumble recovery by Chris Neville and Tony Bartley ran 69 yards for another touchdown. North Bergen extended its lead to 24-0 when Ed Duran, who kicked 3 extra points, scored a touchdown on a 7-yard run and kicked a 25- yard field goal. Bartley, a senior halfback, led with 92 yards on seven carries. Chatham Borough, behind Chris Sheppard and Steve Schroeder, handed Glen Ridge a 42-6 setback in Glen Ridge. Sheppard, on a halfback option, threw a 35-yard touchdown pass to Chris Almgren in the first quarter when Chatham Borough grabbed a 21- 0 lead. Sheppard, who finished with 160 yards rushing on 27 carries, capped the scoring in the fourth period, also a 21-point showing, with his 5-yard touchdown run. Schroeder, a senior quarterback, who passed for 160 yards, hit Chad Apgar with touchdown passes of 57 and 40 yards. Dan Sims, a junior quarterback, ran for four touchdowns and passed for another to lead Kenilworth to a 42- 21 victory over North Plainfield in Kenilworth. Sims, who carried 21 times for 204 yards, scored on runs of 1, 11, 2 and 44 yards and threw a 47-yard touchdown pass to Frank Karovic. Mike Chalenski, who boosted the rushing game for Kenilworth with 95 yards on 20 carries, scored on a 2-yard run. Dennis Bock stood out for New Providence when he completed 15 of 30 passes, two for touchdowns, for a total of 256 yards. Mike Gibbons, a senior fullback, ran for two touchdowns to help Belleville in a 26-0 victory over Paterson Eastside in Paterson. Gibbons scored on runs of 2 and 3 yards to cap the scoring for Belleville. A successful extra-point kick by Jim Lacava after Ken Brown's 1-yard touchdown run in the first quarter was the difference in DePaul's 7-6 victory over Pequannock in Wayne. DePaul raised its record to 3-0. Green Brook, bolstered by a defense that prevented South Hunterdon of Lambertville from penetrating its 20-yard line, scored a 28-0 shutout in Green Brook. South Hunterdon was held to 83 yards. Manville improved its record to 3-0 for the first time since 1969 when it defeated Dunellen, 21-3, in Dunellen. Manville, which compiled 423 yards, got its touchdowns on a 3-yard run by Bob Pietryzk, a 2-yard run by George Connors and an 18-yard burst by John Bowman. John Sedlock kicked all 3 extra points. Connors completed 12 of 15 passes for 167 yards.

505-> 4 Families in Coal Fire Town Accept Homes Buy-Out Offer
Four families have become the first to agree to sell their homes in a $42 million Federal buy-out plan for this coal town, which has been plagued by a 22- year-old underground mine fire. The four were among 19 families who received sale offers last week from the Columbia County Redevelopment Authority, which is administering the buy-out program for the Government, Lynda Pinizzotto, spokesman for the redevelopment authority, said today. She would not say who had accepted the first offers. But Margaret Hause, a 76-year-old resident of nearby Byrnesville, said she was one of them. ''I'll miss the garden,'' Mrs. Hause said as she sat with her brother, who is 80, on the porch of their two-story, wood-frame house, which she had agreed to sell for $22,000. Byrnesville is part of the voluntary relocation program, which was set in motion by a $42 million Federal appropriation authorized last November. The money will enable about 400 residents to escape the sinkholes, fumes and anxiety created by the mine fire.

506-> OPERA: CAST CHANGES IN 'HOFFMAN' AT MET
Hoffmann's three loves in one became three again Friday as Gwendolyn Bradley, Isola Jones and Myra Merritt took over the disparate roles that Catherine Malfitano had combined in the Metropolitan Opera's opening ''Tales of Hoffmann'' performances. The greatest success was Miss Bradley's as the mechanical doll. She played it for grotesquerie rather than charm, with elaborately choreographed, wittily executed lurchings and jerkings that suggested a comic Frankenstein's Monster at times. She did the aria in its usual key of A-flat (Miss Malfitano had sung it in G, as it stands in the Oeser edition the score), and added to the traditional embellishments some adventurous extras that took her twice, impressively, to high F. From the standpoint of coloratura accuracy and brilliance it must be admitted that she sang only fairly well, but the total impression was one of such elan that only a pedant could begrudge her the generous applause she won. Myra Merritt had some lovely moments as Antonia, and also some others in which she threw herself into the role with more vehemence than was good for her. The high notes were exciting, but some flew higher than intended. First-night nerves, perhaps; calmed down a notch, this should be a fine portrayal. She caught both the fever and the frailty of the great trio. Giulietta offers less vocal scope than her sister roles, but Isola Jones made much of it, singing with full, even tone after an oddly ill-blended Barcarolle. The casting resulted, probably by happy accident, in a rare blend of vocal suitability and visual unity. Each role fell to an appropriate voice, as can hardly happen when one singer takes them all, but each voice Friday belonged to a slender black woman dressed in white; it was easy for the mind's eye to make three into one again. William Lewis was to have joined the cast, but was ill, and so Neil Shicoff sang Hoffmann once again.

510-> 18 Reported Killed In Rioting in India
Moslem-Hindu battles in Bombay and the nearby town of Bhiwandi killed at least 18 people Friday and injured 300. Authorities arrested 635 people and called out army troops for help. Fourteen of those killed perished in Bhiwandi, ''which looks as if it is on fire,'' a policeman there said by telephone. Rioting and arson went on into early today in Bombay. AMRITSAR, India, May 18 (AP) - The authorities of Punjab state have announced the formation of 23 police commando units to counter violence by Sikh extremists. The police reported that a 70-year-old priest, Surat Singh, was shot and killed by unidentified Sikh rivals on Thursday outside the city of Patiala, 155 miles southeast of here.

511-> CUTTING THROUGH MY SOUL
Walter Kendrick is a professor of English at Fordham University. THE CRIPPLE LIBERATION FRONT MARCHING BAND BLUES By Lorenzo W. Milam. 220 pp. San Diego: Mho & Mho Works. Paper, $9.95. ''CRIPPLE'' is a dirty word, to be avoided by all public speakers, as James Watt, the former Secretary of the Interior, found out. When the possessor of an intact body says ''cripple,'' he cannot help evoking the attitude of sneering condescension and cheap sympathy that the physically sound, in fear and self-defense, have traditionally adopted toward the lame. Like other ugly, guttural shorthand, ''cripple'' has a very different sense when it is used by a member of the group it brutally designates. It becomes a fighting word, a bitter emblem of anger and pride. This is how Lorenzo W. Milam uses it in ''The Cripple Liberation Front Marching Band Blues'': It stands emblazoned across the book's cover in inch-high capitals, runs boldly down its spine and, sometimes shortened to ''crip,'' slaps the reader in the face from every page. Mr. Milam is best known for his work in community radio on the West Coast, which he has described in several other books, including ''The Radio Papers: From KRAB to KCHU'' and ''Sex and Broadcasting: A Handbook on Building a Radio Station for the Community.'' Except for one brief episode, there is none of this in ''The Cripple.'' Instead we get a fragment of an autobiography, moving by leaps and lurches from Mr. Milam's hospitalization for polio in 1952, when he was 19, to his return from self-imposed exile in Spain 10 years later. Mission and achievement came later; he promises us he'll eventually tell that story, too. I hope so, because if all we ever had of Mr. Milam's intimate history were to remain ''The Cripple,'' we would know nothing of him but frustration. ''The Cripple'' is not for the fainthearted, nor can it be appreciated by those who believe that books ought not to grab your guts and twist them. ''Don't be angry with me. Or sick,'' Mr. Milam says. ''You see: I have vowed that I will tell you everything. Everything. I am going to cut a hunk a mile wide channelling through my soul, and lay it out on the page for you. The depths of my soul. The reaches of my workings.'' And so he has done, with a passionate immediacy and a lyrical extravagance that hamstring criticism. Much of ''The Cripple'' is unquotably obscene, both in its raw vocabulary and in the naked horror of the events - medical, sexual, and grotesque fusions of the two - it relentlessly narrates. Yet to quibble with Mr. Milam on this point seems irrelevant. The feelings he lets loose - rage, lust, terror, a lurid spectrum of primal emotions - owe their intensity to the absence of any object that might have reciprocated or corrected them. This is unhealthy, of course, and to read about it is often disgusting; but to say such things, even to claim to ''understand'' Mr. Milam's state of mind or body, would be patronizing and rather foolish. He announces over and over that everything in ''The Cripple'' is true; one can only, helplessly, agree. Nobody could write this story without having lived it. Mr. Milan begins not with himself but with his sister, 10 years older than he, who was admitted to the hospital on Sept. 2, 1952, and died of polio on Dec. 29 - 2,832 hours, as he tells us, 169,920 minutes ''to work on her sainthood.'' He spares us nothing in the harrowing months of her dissolution and death, neither loathsome physical details nor the chaos of his own feelings - a maelstrom of rhapsodic, horribly beautiful prose: ''The iron maiden continues to pump dead lungs for over an hour before the night nurse discovers the drowned creature, grey froth on blue lips. My sister, who never did anyone any harm, who only wished joy for those around her, now lies ice and bone, the good spirit fled from her.'' Mr. Milam's own disease, contracted at about the same time, was milder; after a year of therapy, he was able to walk with crutches. Nearly half of ''The Cripple'' is devoted to that year, spent first at a charity hospital angrily dubbed Hope Haven, then in the more humane environment of the Warm Springs Foundation. This part of the book, though grim enough, is enlivened by a rare brand of gallows humor that makes it bearable. I know of only one precedent for its perilous blend of clinical detail and high comedy - Betty MacDonald's undeservedly forgotten account of her struggle with tuberculosis, ''The Plague and I'' (1948). But Mr. Milam is much more graphic than Mrs. MacDonald was inclined or dared to be. He waxes eloquent on ''all those embarrassing questions we, or rather you, have about cripples and sex. I know, I know the question: namely, how does one make love in a basket?'' Well, there are ways, heartbreaking and hilarious at once, and he lays them all out for us. After Warm Springs, ''The Cripple'' turns episodic and dissipates much of its force. Mr. Milam's slow, painful return to mobility lends the first half of the book a focus and direction missing from the second. He goes home to an irksomely weepy mother and hypocritically helpful friends, enrolls in two or three colleges, marries and has a daughter (we are informed in three teasing pages that we won't be told about them), and then, in 1959, he makes the peculiar discovery that, though all his life he thought his family was poor, he possesses a personal fortune of $387,991. This midsection of ''The Cripple'' is scrappy and full of holes. All through it, Mr. Milam seems in haste to get over those disorganized years and on to the second great plague that God or blind chance burdened him with - homosexuality. THE last chapters of ''The Cripple,'' covering Mr. Milam's two years in Europe, devotes to this condition the same rhetorical ferocity that earlier went to physical disablement. Mr. Milam never explicitly says he was doubly crippled, yet the equation of homosexuality with polio is there to be made, and the whole structure of ''The Cripple'' implies it. The real lameness of Mr. Milam's desire, however, appears to have been not its choice of gender but its refusal to believe that it might ever be returned, its insistence upon objects from whom rejection was certain. Perhaps a man permanently on crutches must begin this way; perhaps the later chapters of ''The Cripple'' are intended to be another tale of rehabilitation. Finally, on a Spanish beach at dawn, Mr. Milam endured an obscure epiphany; he arose, returned to the United States and found (he seems to suggest) a measure of sexual fulfillment. The sequel, if there is one, will tell us how he did it. In the meantime, we are left with a maddening book that fits no category and allows no simple response. In an ''Afterward,'' Mr. Milam thanks his ''subconscious'' for having written it; indeed, few conscious minds, with their shields intact, could manage such a feat of naked, squirming self-revelation. Even the style risks everything; striving for constant incandescence, it sometimes achieves marvelous beauty, sometimes only a shriek. The failures of ''The Cripple'' are many and far outnumber its successes, but as a whole it exudes such power that it is pointless to pick and choose. Mr. Milam, I feel sure, would hardly care to see an inventory.B

LATIN DEBTORS To the Editor: Your article (''Latin Debt: Postponing The Burden,'' Sept. 23), should have been entitled: ''Latin Debt: Forget The Principal - Be Happy We'll Give You The Interest.'' It is impossible for any of the Latin countries to repay the principal, and everyone in the banking community knows it. They're just hoping to get interest payments. The banks have finally learned what our Government has known all along - it's possible to survive (indeed thrive) with deficit spending. No one suffers. Bankers still have their jobs, banking institutions postpone the debt and the debtor countries have their loans intact. What could be better? STANLEY SALLES Scarsdale, Sept. 25

514-> MorrisJ.Markowitz,83,Dies; Founded Advertising Agency
Morris J. Markowitz, founder of the Markland Advertising Agency and a former vice president of Alexander's Department Stores in New York, died Wednesday in a nursing home in Boca Raton, Fla. He was 83 years old and lived in Coconut Creek, Fla. Mr. Markowitz, who had held the advertising account with Alexander's since the late 1920's, joined the department store as director of publicity in 1935. In 1944 he was named vice president in charge of sales promotion and publicity, a post he held for the next 18 years. In 1962, Mr. Markowitz left Alexander's and founded his own retail advertising agency, Markland. He served as president of the agency until his retirement in 1970, when he moved to Florida. He is survived by his wife, Elsie; two daughters, Louise Levene of Westport, Conn., and Dorothy Botner of Mamaroneck, N.Y.; six grandchildren, and a great-grandchild.

515-> CRITICS' CHOICES
CBS will be repeating the TV movie ''A Caribbean Mystery'' this Tuesday at 9 P.M. Based on an Agatha Christie novel, the sleuth is the formidable Miss Marple, who used to be played in the movies by Margaret Rutherford with a kind of determined dottiness. For television, the role is being handled by Helen Hayes with her characteristically gentle perkiness. On this occasion, Miss Marple goes to a Caribbean resort to recover from a winter bout of pneumonia. She becomes chummy with an elderly British major who confides that while there is ''not much thievery in these parts, there are lots of scandals.'' Several of the other vacationers are regulars at the resort. Rambling on about one of his favorite murder stories, the major tells Miss Marple he has a photograph of a man who ingeniously murdered his two wives. Not long after, needless to say, the major is found dead and the photo missing. And so begins the tale that will involve more murders and a slew of Miss Christie's famous, and occasionally irritating, ''red herring'' clues. Thanks primarily to an exceptionally good cast, ''A Caribbean Mystery'' has its engaging moments. Miss Hayes is charming and she is given solid support. Apart from Maurice Evans playing the major, there are Barnard Hughes, Swoosie Kurtz, Cassie Yates, Stephen Macht, Beth Howland, Jameson Parker, Brock Peters and Zakes Mokae, Tony-award winner for his performance in ''Master Harold and the Boys.'' Under Robert Lewis's direction, the collection of actors proves understandably diverting.

518-> LAKE COMO'S PEERLESS VILLAGE
PAUL LEWIS is a correspondent in the Paris bureau of The New York Times. Tourist brochures call it the Pearl of Lake Como. But this seems wrong. Bellagio doesn't feel like a pearl. What it resembles is an exquisite, tiny island. Most visitors come overland to this village at the tip of the hilly promontory that splits Lake Como in three, following the narrow road that hugs the shorefront up from Como. But in the old days, the normal means of reaching any of the villages and villas that dot the lakeside was by boat. And once at Bellagio, you still have the feeling that the only way of leaving it will be across that wide, inviting plateau of water that seems to squeeze the lemon-colored houses against the dark green mountainside behind them. Here steep flights of shady steps serve as streets, cascading down the lower reaches of the hill to the water's edge, the tiled roofs almost closing over them. Above the roofs rises the romanesque spire of San Giacomo, a single finger of gray stone, crowned with bells and gears, tolling the hours. Along the lakeside flowered terraces, cafes, gardens and restaurants jostle in colorful profusion for the peerless view out over the water to the mountains of the westerly shore, waves of granite with bright villages nestling at their base. Blue and white striped awnings hang, Italian-style, between the ocher pillars of a shorefront arcade, shielding afternoon shoppers from the sun's blaze. Ferry boats hoot; gulls cry; bees buzz contentedly among the jacaranda trees; tourists gaze placidly at the brimming lake. And that's it. Strictly speaking, that's all there is of this tiny, perfect Italian lakeside village called Bellagio. You can walk all around it in half an hour. But then at the village's northern end you see the hotel. A huge yellow and white stucco wedding cake of a hotel, so luscious-looking you want to break off a piece and gobble it up. This is the Grand Hotel Villa Serbelloni, one of the world's great hotels. Like Bellagio, a piece of perfection, an experience in itself and the place to stay if you can possibly afford it. It is almost as big as the village, with balustraded gardens leading down to the lake, a big and well-maintained swimming pool, a man-made sandy beach with palm trees and, when the weather is fine, sun- drenched views up and down the lake. The interior is a triumph of trompe l'oeil; the high, cool halls and the big central staircase are cunningly painted to resemble the marbled walkways of some Roman temple. Sumptuous public rooms, with gilded ceilings, tapesteries and old paintings look down across the terraces to the lake below. It is a splendid, old-fashioned place with every modern convenience. Like Bellagio itself, like the whole world of the Italian Alpine lakes, the hotel is a place to put your feet up in, to enjoy the view, to think, to have a rest. This is not action country. Inevitably, perhaps, it attracts an older crowd, people who prefer the calm, ordered beauty of the Italian lakes to the bustle of the Mediterranean coast in summer. Panama hats and white shoes. Bridge in the evening. And a small band playing ''Tea for Two'' at midnight. Try to have dinner at least one evening in the main dining room of the Hotel Serbelloni; it rounds out perfectly the sense of living in an earlier age. This huge gilded room, almost half as high as it is long, contains a forest of tables, each covered with a stiff white linen cloth; each, seemingly, with its own white- jacketed waiter hovering in attendance. Individual dishes can be ordered, but most guests opt for the fixed-price menu at about $25, which offers spaghetti or some other pasta, fish from the lake, roast veal or another kind of meat, followed by fruit or dessert. The house wines, both red and white, are excellent. The best rooms in the hotel offer splendid views out over the lake while some of the lakeside suites feature sitting rooms decorated with the same classical motif that covers the main staircase and the halls downstairs. Piping hot water flows in the bathrooms, which is quite a rarity even among the best Italian hotels these days. But wherever your room, you will not escape the harsh chimes of the church bell that starts summoning the faithful at 7:20 every morning - unfortunately, they take quite a bit of waking. Bellagio is also an ideal base for exploring some of the palaces and gardens that ring Lake Como with a garland of flowers in summer. But first, the village itself holds two treasures. A few hundred yards along the Como road are the gardens of the Villa Melzi, a lavish array of lawns, flowers and trees around a neo-classical palace built by Duke Francesco Melzi, the first Vice President of the Italian Republic. The palace is closed, but the Duke's tomb can be found in a white chapel at the end of the gardens, while the orangery houses some relics of Napoleon's Italian campaign, including a letter from Duke Melzi that begins ''Cher Citoyen-President.'' Liszt composed part of the ''Annees des P elerinages'' in the blue Moorish temple on the water's edge and then named his daughter Cosme after nearby Como. But like all the gardens around Lake Como, those of the Villa Melzi are primarily a frame through which to view the lake and the mountains ringing it, in this case a frame of carefully contrived informality, very different from many of the other lakeside gardens. Quite other in style and far more dramatic are the gardens of the Villa Serbelloni itself, after which the hotel is named. The Villa Serbelloni and its huge grounds occupy the whole of the high promontory above the village of Bellagio, which dominates the confluence of the two halves of Lake Como and the more austere southeasterly waters of Lake Lecco. Here the Latin playwright Pliny the Younger first built a villa that he called Tragedy because it was supported by rocks resembling the stiltlike shoes of the actors in classical tragedy. He named a second villa farther down the lake Comedy. During the Middle Ages numerous fortesses occupied this high strategic point; in the 18th century the Serbelloni family built the present villa, which looks southeastward across the waters of Lake Lecco. Today the Villa Serbelloni houses the Rockefeller Foundation's European Studies Center, an anything-but-monastic retreat for scholars, and is closed to the public. But twice a day, at 10 A.M. and 4 P.M., visitors are conducted on a two-hour tour of the gardens that takes them right up to the top of the hill where the finest views of the lake are obtained. The tours take place between April and October, when the gardens are at their best. They start at the villa gates a few yards down the road from the church in the direction of Como. Your hotel will give you precise directions. The charge is around $1 each. Above the villa, paths wind on upward through the thickly wooded headland to the ruins of an old fortress on the dizzy summit, with rocky cliffs falling away on two sides into the blue waters of the lake. This is the famous Bellagio view, the most famous view on Lake Como and one of the greatest views in Europe - the view from the top of Bellagio mountain straight up Lake Como to the alpine screen at its northern end and then westward and eastward down its twin arms to Como and Lecco. Over the centuries innumerable writers, artists and travelers have climbed this hill to gaze out across the three branches of the lake the ancient Romans called Larius. For Pliny, the view offered ''as much peace as you can desire for meditation.'' Stendhal called it ''a sublime and enchanting spectacle'' only equalled by the Gulf of Naples. For Flaubert it was ''dramatic, almost Shakespearean.'' Those with a car should take a drive out of Bellagio up to the nearby Church of the Madonna del Ghisallo, both for the views of the lake and to see the church Pope Pius XII dedicated to racing cyclists. Follow the coast road toward Lecco down past Onno to the turning up the mountainside to Asso, with its splendid views across the water. The church turns out to be a yellow chapel on a high pass overlooking Lake Lecco and Lake Como. It is stuffed with votive offerings of racing bikes, club pennants and cyclists' shirts. Even in August, enthusiasts peddle up the hill to make their offerings. Follow the mountain road back toward Bellagio, stopping at the Belvedere Grigne, after the cemetery outside Civenna. This is a little park that offers a panoramic view across Lake Lecco to the Grigna mountains on the eastern shore. During the steep winding descent to Bellagio, known as the Bellagio Ladders, pull over and admire the view down over the peninsula to the Villa Serbelloni and the wooded promontory above it. But Bellagio is a lakeside town and the best way to see sites farther afield is by water. Ferries leave the quay every few minutes for all points around Lake Como. The fare anywhere is a matter of 2 or 3 dollars at most. Entrance fees for the villas and gardens around the lake are less, $1.50 or so. Barely five minutes' sail away lies the pretty village of Varenna. It is a more private place than Bellagio, with villas and walled gardens lining the lake's edge and few hotels. From the harbor, take the walkway that hugs the cliffside, stopping if the hour is right at the Vecchio Varenna Restaurant for an open-air lunch or at the more elegant glassed-in dining room at the Hotel du Lac. Then follow the signs to Villa Monastario and its gardens. The nuns were driven from their convent here in the 16th century, accused of immorality, and the property became a nobleman's palace. Today it is a science foundation, but the gardens are open to the public and offer a completely different experience from those at the Villa Melzi or the Villa Serbelloni. These are old, formal gardens in the Italian style, arranged in a thin strip along the side of the lake so that they almost merge into the water. Flowers cascade over worn, stone balustrades and the lake laps ceaselessly against the base of the terrace. From here look back at the green hump of the Bellagio promontory, dividing the lake like a proud ship's prow. Not to be missed, either, are the more famous gardens of the Villa Carlotta, a few minutes' boat ride from Bellagio at Tremezzo on the other side of the lake. Originally much smaller than they are today and of formal design, the gardens have been gradually enlarged and now form a park along the lakeside where visitors can stroll among banks of rhododendrons and azaleas and enjoy the view eastward to Bellagio and the mountains behind. The villa, a lofty, cool place full of marble statues and gilded furniture, is also open to the public. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow gets the last word on the Villa Carlotta and indeed on Bellagio and all the other famous sites around Lake Como. For it was at Tremezzo that he wrote: I ask myself, 'Is this a dream? Will it vanish into the air? Is there a land of such supreme And perfect beauty anywhere?' b

519-> CONNECTICUT GUIDE
DOGWOODS ON DISPLAY Fairfield's 49th annual dogwood festival, with a display of 30,000 pink and white blooming trees, will be open daily from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. Saturday through May 19 and from noon to 5 P.M. on Sundays. Lloyd Godfrey, the festival's arborist since 1946, said that ''in some places the bloom will be good - where there was good drainage and protection from freezing, but in other places there will be flowers with only one or two petals.'' A severe winter combined with a mysterious disease that has affected dogwoods throughout the northeast since 1979 killed 83 trees this year, he said. ''There are still 15 trees that are 200 years old, planted by Dr. Bronson,'' said Mr. Godfrey, ''and we will plant more than we lost.'' Dr. Isaac Bronson was the original owner of the property on Greenfield Hill, and initiator of the tradition in 1795 of bringing dogwoods out of the woods to where they could be admired along the roads and on private property. Festival activities are sponsored by the Congregational Church of Greenfield Hill and now require the services of 200 volunteers a day. Demonstrations of sheep shearing, wool carding, spinning, tinsmithing, coopering and theorem painting will be held on the town green in front of the church. A walking tour of private homes and gardens will cost $1, and there will also be a slide show in the church every 40 minutes, a folk-art exhibition, a craft show, a gift shop, a fine-art show and a musical program in the sanctuary at 1:30 P.M. daily. Picnic lunches and foods made from colonial recipes may be bought daily under a tent on the church lawn. A country auction will be held May 19. Admission is free. The church is on Bronson Road, off Exit 21 of I-95. For more information, call 259-0573. TRUMAN MEMORABILIA A framed copy of the famed front page of The Chicago Tribune proclaiming ''Dewey Defeats Truman!'' published in anticipation of the outcome of the 1948 Presidential election is among a few hundred items in a Truman memorabilia exhibition on view from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. today at the Byram Veteran's Clubhouse in Greenwich. ''Truman campaign items are at a premium because there weren't many,'' said Jim Cassidy, president of the Harry S. Truman Chapter of the American Political Items Collectors. ''Everybody thought he was going to lose.'' The exhibition contains an inch- wide, brown, 1920's campaign button from Missouri reading ''Truman for Judge'' that Mr. Cassidy says is worth $100. A 1948 souvenir cushion with a picture of George Washington in one corner and Harry Truman in the other ''sold for $1 in Woolworth's,'' he said, but ''may cost from $25 to $50 today.'' A metal plate for an automobile bumper bearing the names of Truman and his running mate, Alben Barkley, correspondence, anti-Truman material put out by the Republicans, photographs, pennants and campaign ribbons are also on display. Some items are for sale. Admission is free. The clubhouse is at 300 Delavan Avenue, off Exit 2 of I-95. For more information, phone 531-9846. 'UNDER THE ILEX' ''Under the Ilex,'' a two-act play opening Thursday at the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven, is set among the members of the Bloomsbury crowd in England in the early 1900's. The collective of artists and writers who met regularly for decades included Virginia and Leonard Woolf and E. M. Forster. The play centers on the love story between Julie Harris as an eccentric artist known only as Carrington, who would have preferred to be a man, and Lytton Strachey, the prominent biographer, who was a homosexual. First presented last year at the Repertory Theater of St. Louis, the play was written by Clyde Talmage, and this production was directed by Charles Nelson Reilly. Previews will be given at 8 P.M. on Thursday, Friday, next Sunday and May 15 and at 8:30 P.M. on Saturday, with tickets costing $9. Ticket prices thereafter are from $12.50 to $18. The show is to run until June 17, with performances at 8 P.M. Tuesdays through Fridays, 4 and 8:30 P.M. Saturdays, 2 and 7:30 P.M. Sundays and 2 P.M. Wednesdays. Call 787-4282 for reservations. RUGBY CHAMPIONSHIPS The 1984 United States Michelob Rugby Club Championships will be played off at 1 P.M. Saturday and next Sunday in Dillon Stadium in Hartford. Four territorial champions will be paired off in two games Saturday. Consolation and championship games are to be played next Sunday. The Boston Rugby Club and the Old Blues of Berkeley, Calif., are expected to be among the playoff teams. A tournament for players over the age of 35 will take place in Colt's Park, outside the stadium, from 9:30 A.M. to noon both days. Twelve teams from around the country, consisting of 15 players each, are expected to participate. Tickets for the stadium games are $4 a day at the gate or $7 for both days. In advance they are $3 and $5; phone 521-9707 evenings. There is no admission charge to Colt's Park. HORSE SHOW AND FAIR Prizes for horsemanship totaling $70,000 are to be distributed Wednesday through next Sunday during the 34th annual Child and Family Services Horse Show and Country Fair at the Farmington Polo Grounds. Leslie Burr, Norman dello Joio, Armand and Peter Leone, Jamie Mann, Melanie Smith and Barney Ward are among the expert riders expected to compete. Wednesday and Thursday will be devoted to preliminary jumping, equitation and children's classes. A series of grand slam jumping contests will take place Friday in five rings, and Saturday's feature will be jumping by the United States Olympic equestrian team. Dressage classes, speed stakes, match races and antique carriage parades will be held Saturday and Sunday, and the Grand Prix will be held Sunday afternoon. Hours are from 8 A.M. to about 5:30 P.M. each day. Exhibitions, children's games, foods and beverages, crafts and horse-related items will be available. Admission is $5 at the gate or $3 in advance. The polo grounds are on Town Farms Road, off the Farmington exit of I-84. Call 236-4511 for information.

520-> DINING OUT; THE NEW LOOK IS ART DECO
AT the beginning of last summer, the restaurant in the Long Island Hotel in Center Moriches opened with a new look, a new menu and a new chef. The new look is actually a studied old look, a romantic interpretation of 1930's Art Deco with black, gray and white tile floors, lots of pink and gray, potted palms and mirrors. The flattering pinkish glow from ceiling spots and plain wooden chairs in random pastel shades around the tables draped in pink complete the stylish ensemble. A clever decorator thought of placing, here and there, old porch columns painted white, an accent that is at once retro and chic. Sophie Schwartz, the owner, appropriately described the food as nouvelle American. The menu is about to be revised. (The new menu may actually be in effect by the time you read this but we had an opportunity to preview it, since several dishes that were specials over the past weeks have earned a more permanent position.) The revision also involves greater emphasis on fish and seafood dishes in the somewhat limited list of selections. It is a sophisticated array, attractively presented despite the somewhat skimpy, tearoom- looking glass dishes, and by and large is the work of a competent chef. He is adept at cooking fish and seafood perfectly '' a point'' and is almost as proficient in the meat and poultry department. His seasonings are often tentative, however, and he ascribes to the currently fashionable notion of avoiding flour or other starchy thickeners in his sauces. But with the exception of the butter-enriched beurre blanc, he has not mastered the technique of the glossy reduction that is just concentrated enough to coat a spoon. The sauces made with red wine or meat stock amount to thin, tasteless puddles. One of the best appetizers was a salad of mussels, shrimp and scallops marinated in a creamy vinaigrette dressing. The p^ate of duck and mushrooms was extremely attractive, with the medallions of rosy duck encircling a smooth mushroom forcemeat, and - with the addition of some salt and pepper at the table - was delicious. What the waitresses described as puff pastry is actually cream-puff shells. They came filled with verdant asparagus spears and napped with beurre blanc one evening. The seafood mousse was pleasant, if a trifle bland, and the chowder of fish and shellfish had plenty of carrot and potato and a reasonable amount of mussels in a thin, milky broth. No amount of searching turned up any fish, however. The mixed green salad with mustard vinaigrette is excellent. Boned salmon steaks in a tarragon beurre blanc sauce showed the kitchen at its best. The fish was seared golden brown but delectably moist inside. The sauteed farm chicken is nicely served with slices of boneless breast and a section of the leg with crisply burnished skin, but it needed a sauce with more character, not a red wine sauce that seemed to have been left out in the rain. Similarly, the poached boneless breast of duck (a bit overpoached for a dish ordered rare) depended more for flavor on a tangy onion relish and raisin garnish than the sauce. Roasted medallions of loin of lamb were also slightly overcooked and served in another insubstantial sauce, this one strongly seasoned with rosemary. The hefty veal chop, perfectly charcoal-grilled and a bargain at $12, will no longer be on the menu at that price, but may be offered as a special. It came in a thin cream sauce with apples, a preparation that was irrelevant and unnecessary with a serving of grilled meat like the chop. Fresh vegetables and potatoes, good when they are warm enough, are the accompaniments. Desserts include rich, sweet mocha pecan torte, linzer torte, lemon cheesecake, heavenly chocolate almond torte and a simple tart made by baking apple slices on a crisp pastry base. The wine list is a marvel of reasonableness, with Chevalier Lascombes, Alexis Lichine's smooth, blended Medoc for only $9, Beringer cabernet sauvignon for $12.50 and the well-made Joseph Drouhin Chablis for $13.50. Service is generally good, if occasionally neglectful, especially when it comes to refilling the wine glasses. A three-course dinner with wine is likely to average $28 a person, including tax and tip. Long Island Hotel v Main Street, Center Moriches. 878-0690.

521-> COUNCIL COMPARES COSTS IN STATE
FOR the cost of the average home in Greenwich, one could buy seven homes at the opposite end of the state and have a few thousand dollars left over, according to a tax watchdog group composed of business people in the state. A study released last week by the group - the Connecticut Public Expenditures Council - put the cost of an average Greenwich home at $280,197, compared with $38,613 for the average home in Thompson, in northeast Connecticut. Statewide, the average cost of a home is $79,590, the study found, and 9 Fairfield County towns were among the 10 most expensive places in the state to own a home. The study also compared educational costs, and again Fairfield County ranked highest with an average of $3,435.76 for each pupil, compared with $2,667.15 in Windham County. In half the remaining counties - Hartford, Litchfield and Middlesex - per-pupil spending ranged from $3,100 to $3,300. In the other three counties - New London, Tolland and New Haven - the figure was between $2,900 and $3,000 per student. A study of all municipal expenditures also showed the so-called ''gold coast'' on top; spending ranged from a low of $712 for each person in Windham County to a high of $1,119 per capita in Fairfield. The Public Expenditures Council issued its 40-page report at a time when many towns are struggling to prepare their budgets for fiscal 1984- 85, beginning on July 1. The Council studied municipal budgets and tax lists of all 169 Connecticut towns in preparing the report, which ranks towns according to the size of their tax lists, the amount of per-capita spending on police and fire protection, and several other categories. Fairfield County topped the state in most of the categories, and the study showed towns there paid for the extra services they received. Residents of five towns in that county paid more than $1,000 for each person in taxes during the current fiscal year, compared with a statewide average of $657.65. But Fairfield towns only paid more taxes because the property owned was worth more, the council study showed; in other areas of the state the tax burden on the property owner was relatively greater. New Haven, with a tax rate of 33.2 mills, and Hartford, with 31.8 mills, were the two most heavily taxed towns in Connecticut, the study determined. Bridgeport was the only Fairfield County town on the list of the 10 most heavily taxed towns, and only one other from Fairfield County - Norwalk - was among the top 20. Fairfield County towns spent less per capita on hospital payments for the indigent and other social services than several of their poorer cousins in Windham County. Thompson, Windham and Killingly were among the 10 heaviest spenders for social services, with expenditures of about $5 per capita in each town. In Fairfield County, only Bridgeport made the top 10, with a per capita expenditure on social services of $7.61, the council's study showed.

522-> Employees Bid For Wien Air Wien Air Alaska, a regional passenger carrier with
headquarters in Anchorage, said it was in preliminary negotiations with an employee group seeking to purchase the airline. Carla Beam, a spokesman for Wien Air, said the company's owner, James J. Flood, has periodically been approached by several parties interested in acquiring the carrier but he ''has expressed interest in some type of employee involvement.'' Over the past few years, Wien has fended off numerous merger offers, takeover attempts and proxy fights involving Western Airlines, Air Florida, Alaska Airlines and Alaska International Air. Gary Mercer, a former bush pilot who has flown with Wien Air for 14 years and is a representative of the employees group, the Wien Employees Acquisition Committee, said $3 million had been pledged as a down payment by 40 percent of the airline's 1,000 employees, and that arrangements for bank financing were being negotiated. Wien Air, one of Alaska's largest corporate employers, and the employees group declined to discuss terms.

524-> NETWORKS SHIFTING ROLE OF ANCHORMEN
A subtle shift appears to be taking place in the format of the network evening newscast. It is an effort, largely by ABC and to a somewhat lesser extent by NBC, to chip at the traditional mold of network news - an illustrated headline service within 22 minutes - by involving the anchorman in more stories and showing him as an interviewer in addition to a reader of the news. These maneuvers are also a refinement of attempts by all three networks over the past several years to differentiate themselves from the cascade of news on radio as well as well local early-evening television newscasts that in cities like New York and Los Angeles run two hours or more. Many local newscasts now run brief reports of national and world news that were once the exclusive province of the networks. There is in fact, a new assumption about the network news viewer. ''We want to be basically a service for those who have heard the headlines,'' said Roone Arledge, president of ABC News. ''We want to advance their level of understanding. The day has passed when you take each story of the day and treat it almost equally.'' ABC Moves Into Second Place At ABC and NBC, the changing role of the anchor represents a further variation on their continuing efforts to match the popularity of ''The CBS Evening News with Dan Rather,'' which has been the most widely watched of the three since May 1982. The shifts come at a time when ABC's ''World News Tonight'' with Peter Jennings has overtaken NBC's ''Nightly News'' with Tom Brokaw as the second-most-popular network newscast, some 14 months after all three networks began competing head-to-head with single anchors. Since September, CBS has attracted an average of 15.2 million viewers to its newscast each night, while ABC has drawn 13.4 million and NBC, 12.3 million. For a comparable period a year ago, CBS had 16.6 million viewers each night compared with 12.8 million for ABC and 13.7 million for NBC. In addition to competing among themselves, the newscasts on ABC, CBS and NBC are responding to increased competition for viewers from independent stations, cable television and other sources. For all three network evening-news programs, viewing is down, from a combined total of 43.1 million viewers at this time last year to 40.9 million today. Only ABC gained viewers from last autumn to this autumn, while both CBS and NBC lost viewers. The increase in popularity for the ABC newscast began after the network's telecasts of the Olympic Games last July and August, when Peter Jennings was seen by nearly 100 million viewers in his role as anchor for the opening and closing ceremonies. According to a new study of 500 ABC viewers conducted in May and after the Olympics in August, the exposure of Mr. Jennings during the Olympics significantly increased awareness of him. Of those polled who saw both the opening and closing ceremonies, 15 percent were aware of Mr. Jennings in May, while 37 percent knew of him in August. Jennings Focuses on Interviews Now, according to executives at all three networks, ABC is trying to enlarge the appeal of Mr. Jennings by having him conduct more interviews on the air. Since September, Mr. Jennings has augmented his reading of the news some 40 times to have brief exchanges - usually of two or three minutes - on the impact of various events with such officials as Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the Democratic Senator from New York. On NBC, Tom Brokaw has conducted 30 such interviews, while Dan Rather on CBS has done it only three times. ''One of the problems of a half-hour news program is you don't really get to see the dimensions of the anchorman,'' said Roone Arledge, president of ABC News. By having Mr. Jennings conduct interviews, said Mr. Arledge, ''we can show people that Peter is well-rounded and capable. It is partly to show off Peter but also to differentiate the program.'' Mr. Jennings said his interviews break what he called ''the sameness and ritual of the evening newscasts.'' ''It gives a measure of spontaneity,'' he said. ''A lot of us communicate better when we are talking than when we are reading what we have written.'' ABC's strategy has also included a new use of the commentator in conjunction with the anchor. On CBS Bill Moyers appears two to three times a week with a commentary that he delivers directly to the viewer. John Chancellor does the same four times a week on NBC. But at ABC, George Will, who joined ''World News Tonight'' in September, is queried by Mr. Jennings. The same approach is used for Dr. Timothy Johnson, ABC's new medical editor, who has been interviewed five times by Mr. Jennings on medical stories such as that of Baby Fae, the infant who was kept alive for 20 days with the transplant of a baboon's heart. 'Gee-Whiz of Live Interviews' NBC has increased its anchor interviews, according to Mr. Brokaw, because ''we think it enhances the program.'' ''Rather than jamming the program with pieces that are a minute and 10 seconds long, why not take a moment to find a leading authority and get three or four wise observations,'' he said. CBS officials are skeptical of the approach, however. They contend that they moved away from being a headline service several years ago by concentrating on more explanatory reports from their correspondents. ''You are seeing a struggle between NBC and ABC for second place,'' said Ed Joyce, president of CBS News. According to Lane Venardos, executive producer of ''The CBS Evening News,'' ''The chatter back and forth consumes more time than it is worth. We can inform viewers more by not having a live or nearly live interview as part of the broadcast. I think the gee-whiz of live interviews has been milked to death by local television stations.''

528-> Diner's Journal
-style restaurant, called Hometown, has opened at 210 Spring Street. It specializes in regional fare such as crab cakes, Smithfield ham, bay scallops and fried chicken. Although it is too early to make a definitive assessment of the cooking, there are at least two superior dishes worth checking out. One is called Cape Cod kale and sausage soup ($3.50), a swampy, spicy broth replete with hot sausage, kale, potatoes, carrots, kidney beans and bacon bits. It has a wonderful smoky and hot flavor but does not sear the lips. Another unusual and tasty dish is sauteed wild turkey steak with a semi-sweet raspberry-Madeira sauce ($17). The scallopine of turkey was moist and only vaguely gamey, and the sauce complemented it nicely. Fanciers of the traditional New England boiled dinner will be satisfied with the version served here ($11). The sleek and modern dining rooms, done in shades of gray, are both comfortable and accommodating - just like Biloxi. Tastings, a pleasant cafe-style restaurant at 144 West 55th Street which featured one of the first wine bars in New York, has opened a sister establishment, Tastings on 2, at 953 Second Avenue, between 50th and 51st Streets. It offers 32 wines by the glass, five Champagnes and sparkling wines, nine ports (four of them vintage ports from the 1960's) and eight sherries. The menu at Tastings on 2, like that of the original, features American and Continental style food - lunch entrees range from swordfish grilled over pine cones ($15.50) and grilled salmon with Riesling-dill sauce ($15), to warm Virginia ham and apple salad ($10). Dinner selections include dishes such as venison chops grilled over hickory ($17.50) and sauteed chicken breasts with black walnut sauce ($13.50).

529-> Israel Faces Further Cuts
The Israeli Cabinet was told today that 15,000 federal employees may have to be dismissed if the battle against 800 percent inflation is to succeed, a Government spokesman said. Finance Minister Yitzhak Modai told reporters he gave Cabinet colleagues a bleak option: either cut staff or prune all services. He said the Cabinet decided in principle to slash $550 million more from its budget over the next year, mostly from military spending. The coalition administration has already cut $250 million from the $9 billion budget available after debt repayment. Labor and Welfare Minister Moshe Katzav predicted that unemployment would rise 50 percent within a year. It now stands at 90,000, or 5.9 percent of the work force. The Cabinet appointed a four-man ministerial committee to supervise spending cuts and scheduled a special session next week to study the effects of military cuts on state security.

Molly Price, the author of ''The Iris Book,'' generally considered to be the definitive work on the subject, died of a cerebral hemorrhage Friday at Good Samaritan Hospital in Suffern, N.Y. She was 81 years old and lived in New City, N.Y. ''The Iris Book'' was published in 1966 by Van Nostrand. In addition, Mrs. Price, who was a graduate of DePauw University, wrote many articles on gardening for The New York Times from the late 1950's through 1977. She was also the founder of the Rockland County chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union in 1939 and ran for the State Senate on the American Labor Party ticket in 1944. Mrs. Price is survived by two sons, Dr. John M., of Great Neck, L.I., and Peter B., of Manhattan; a daughter, Emily R. Kennedy of New City; two sisters, Margaret Anderson and Esther Richmond, both of Gary, Ind.; five grandchildren, and one great-granddaughter.

531-> How the Poll Was Conducted
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Nov. 8 to 14 with 1,798 adults around the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii. This group amounted to 90 percent of 1,994 people interviewed Oct. 31 to Nov. 2, just before the election. All 1,994 were telephoned to be asked to participate in this survey, but 196 refused or were not reached. That group of 1,994 was derived from a sample of telephone exchanges selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were chosen so as to insure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted residential numbers. The results have been weighted to take account of household size and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region, race, sex, age and education. In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on samples of such a size will differ by no more than two percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by interviewing all adult Americans. The error for smaller subgroups is larger. For example, the margin of sampling error for Reagan voters is plus or minus three percentage points. In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Assisting The Times in its 1984 polling is Helmut Norpoth, associate professor of political science at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.

532-> PRIVATE SATELLITE ANTENNAS: ONE BATTLE IS ENDED
When President Reagan legalized possession and use of satellite earth stations by private individuals last month, he dispelled the legal miasma that had shrouded the big dish antennas that pull in programs directly from satellites. The Telecommunications Act that the President signed into law makes it clear that it is not illegal for owners of such antennas to view satellite programs intended for cable distribution or broadcast services as long as the signal is not used ''for private financial gain.'' In fact, the bill provides substantial penalties - six months in jail and fines up to $50,000 - for signal piracy, that is, the unlicensed commercial use of program material obtained from satellites. The new law, sponsored in Congress by Senator Barry Goldwater, Republican of Arizona, and Representative Albert Gore Jr., Democrat of Tennessee, reflects a compromise between program distributors and owners of earth stations. Conflict between these groups arose from the fact that virtually all cable programs, for which viewers normally must pay a special fee - such as the popular Home Box Office - are distributed via satellite to cable systems throughout the country. By turning directly to the satellite and bypassing the local cable system, owners of satellite antennas receive such broadcasts free of charge. Predictably, cable operators and program originators were raising accusations of ''theft of service'' and clamored for individually owned earth stations to be outlawed. Antennas Spreading Rapidly The pay cable services were further dismayed because home earth stations are by far the fastest-growing segment of the video industry. It is estimated that 600,000 such dish antennas now dot the landscape, and their number is expected to grow beyond a million in 1985. In remote rural areas, where ordinary television reception is erratic or impossible and where the population is too sparse to be economically served by cable, ''the dish'' is the only way for about four million Americans to come within the national fold of television watchers. Despite the anger of the cablecasters, Congress shied away from alie nating so large a segment of the population, especially in an election year. As a result, ample bipartisan support was readily mustered for a bill legalizing private earth stations, and the President lost little time in signing what was seen as a highly popular measure. The new law expressly permits private reception of any unscrambled satellite signal and makes it clear that free home viewing of pay cable programs with a satellite dish - that is, avoidance of the subscription fee - does not constitute ''private financial gain'' in the sense of the law and entails no culpability. ''Free lunch is legal now,'' exulted a satellite watcher in Berkshire County, Massachusetts, where the big dish is a common sight. But his joy may be premature, for Congress left an ample loophole for the pay services. The matter of scrambling has been left unresolved. Plan for Scrambling At present, virtually all satellite transmissions - including Home Box Office - traverse the sky unscrambled. They are free for the taking for anyone with a dish. But even before the new law was enacted, HBO announced that it would scamble its signal in the future to make it inaccessible to anyone without a special decoder. These decoders would be sold or rented to the clients of HBO; that is, the various cable services carrying the program. Other pay-program distributors would presumably follow suit. Nothing in the present law compels these program originators to make their decoders available - not even for appropriate payment - to individual satellite owners. Thus, if they wish, the pay services could exclude private earth stations from their programs unless additional regulations force them to negotiate some type of compensation from dish owners. At present the pay services have not yet articulated a policy in these matters. Prevailing Congressional sentiment was summarized in a recent speech in which Representative Gore described home earth stations as ''an American industry that has grown out of technological advances made in the space program - at public expense - with benefits intended for everyone.''

533-> SALVADORAN FOES WILL DEBATE IN U.S.
In an unexpected development, senior Salvadoran Government and leftist rebel officials have agreed to meet in Los Angeles this week for a public debate on the prospects for peace in El Salvador. The plan was confirmed by officials of both sides. At least one conservative Salvadoran political leader will also go to Los Angeles, according to organizers of the debate, setting the stage for the first discussion in public of this country's five-year civil war by a broad spectrum of Salvadoran political representatives. The meeting will take place on Wednesday, with a day of private discussions planned for Thursday. It is being sponsored by the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions at the University of California at Santa Barbara, according to Allen Weinstein, president of the center. Mr. Weinstein said he hoped for a ''fairly freewheeling'' discussion of the issues that have divided this country into warring factions. Political Consensus Sought The debate comes at a delicate moment, however, as President Jose Napoleon Duarte seeks to build a political consensus for further peace talks with rebel representatives. The two sides are scheduled to meet again somewhere in El Salvador at the end of this month, but final details have not yet been settled. Both rebel and Salvadoran Government officials expressed concern that the debate could upset the fragile negotiations now under way, but said they had decided to go to Los Angeles anyway in hopes of gaining increased international support for their respective positions. ''The danger of Los Angeles is that it could be converted into very rigid positions in our talks here,'' said Minister of the Presidency Julio Adolfo Rey Prendes, ''It's too much out of our control.'' The Government's strategy for future meetings with the rebels would depend in part on what is said in Los Angeles, Mr. Rey Prendes added. The debate was originally planned to take place early in October, but was canceled when Mr. Duarte made an unexpected decision to meet rebel leaders last month in the northern Salvadoran town of La Palma. Ban on Travel Is Ended The State Department appears to have supported the Los Angeles meeting by ending a ban on travel to the United States by Salvadoran rebel leaders. According to Mr. Weinstein, Secretary of State George P. Shultz personally approved visas last week for four rebel representatives. Hector Oqueli, a senior rebel spokesman in Mexico City, confirmed in a telephone interview that he had been informed that visas would be granted. But he said the rebel leaders faced practical difficulties in picking up the visas in time to make plane connections from Central America to Los Angeles for the debate Wednesday. The rebel representatives who will be given visas, according to Mr. Oqueli and Mr. Weinstein, are Guillermo Ungo, Salvador Samayoa, Oscar Acevedo and Mr. Oqueli himself. All are members of the political and diplomatic commission of the combined rebel political and military fronts. Another rebel official, Ruben Zamora, was reportedly denied a visa because he is believed to have publicly condoned the killing of an American military adviser by rebel gunmen here last year. The Salvadoran Government will be represented by Mr. Rey Prendes and Juan Ricardo Ramirez Rauda, the Salvadoran Ambassador to West Germany, Mr. Rey Prendes said. Ricardo Gonzalez Camacho, the Minister of the Economy and a member of the moderate Democratic Action Party, will also attend the debate, according to Mr. Rey Prendes. Conservative to Attend Conservative Salvadoran political opinion will be represented by Francisco Quinones, a businessman who is the head of the small Salvadoran Popular Party. Mr. Rey Prendes said he was trying to arrange for other conservative political leaders to attend the debate, but that none had so far formally agreed to go. Roberto d'Aubuisson, the country's chief conservative spokesman, has refused to endorse the meeting. Mr. Duarte may take part in the discussion by satellite relay from San Salvador, according to Mr. Weinstein. In an effort to demonstrate a formal status equivalent to Mr. Duarte, the opposition leader Guillermo Ungo is also expected to participate by satellite from a television studio in Washington. Mr. Zamora may also enter the discussion by telephone from Mexico City, Mr. Weinstein added. The meeting will be televised both in the United States and in Europe, Mr. Weinstein said. But at present it appears unlikely that it will be shown in El Salvador, although the local press is certain to give the meeting heavy coverage. Declarations made in Los Angeles are likely to echo loudly in San Salvador as Mr. Duarte feels his way toward the next formal meeting with guerrilla leaders. Two Committee Formed Mr. Duarte has formed two committees to guide him, the first composed of the leaders of all political parties here except Mr. d'Aubuisson's National Repbulican Alliance, which has refused to attend committee meetings. The second committee includes trade union and Salvadoran Army officials, as well as Government ministers and leading businessmen.

535-> MUSIC: YO-YO MA AND EMANUEL AX
It has been clear for several seasons that Yo-Yo Ma and Emanuel Ax are a cello-piano duo of the highest distinction. Observing that distinction, trying to put a finger on its precise nature, made for an unusually rewarding couple of hours as they played a trio of demanding sonatas Saturday at Carnegie Hall. Mr. Ax and Mr. Ma are very much modern players in their adherence to what might be called the strict constructionist school of interpretation. They rarely essay an effect that is not explicitly specified in the notes and markings on the printed page. One does not expect at their concerts the sudden larger-than-life rhetorical gesture, nor the easy, casual freedom that lends charm. Yet they were not inexpressive at Carnegie. Mr. Ma in particular played with a cleanness, a technical and rhythmic poise, that amounts to an interpretive statement in itself. This was illustrated most vividly in Richard Strauss's youthful F major sonata, where the final pages of the slow movement were done with simplicity, understatement, but rapt intensity. Then, counting on the close listening they must have known they had compelled, the pair launched the finale not with theatrical verve, but in a particularly delicate, unpressured way that flowed beautifully out of what had come before. This sort of sensitivity to connections within a work, and to the expressive possibilities arising out of restraint and meticulous execution, represent the modern school at its finest. There are some possibilities, though, that don't arise this way. The opening allegro of Mendelssohn's D major sonata can have sweep, and muscle. Here it had clarity. The textures were transparent, but to peer through them was not to find the piece's essence. The sforzando G-sharps in the second theme were wisps. When the broad melody came back piano during the recapitulation, it was taken not just softly but insubstantially, in a semi-staccato style. Mr. Ma's habit is to lighten the pressure on a sustained note within a tune, punctuating rather than pressing on in an urgent legato. Comparison of their Britten sonata Saturday with the recording by Mstislav Rostropovich and the composer, made just 20-odd years ago, throws interesting light on these contrasts. The earlier players take the first movement considerably slower, with fuller tone, with dynamic shadings at once subtler and more pronounced than those printed in the score, and with a good deal of rubato that is not specified there. A critical instance comes in the cellist's upward slides of a seventh, and the pianist's answering phrase. At Saturday's performance these just sort of went by; one might have wondered why the composer had written them. On the record, they are exquisite moments in themselves and signposts in the structure of the movement. And the performance as a whole is bigger-boned, more openly emotional. But this does not at all mean that Mr. Ma and Mr. Ax are somehow ''wrong'' in their interpretation: that they played the piece in their own style rather than attempting to imitate or recreate Britten's bespeaks artistic integrity. In all likelihood they would have been less convincing the other way - and they were convincing Friday (especially in the Britten, which emerged as a thing of sighs and questions) even if something precious, something bold, was missing. All this is to say: players of true excellence will shine in any era, and their gifts will speak through the practices of any stylistic school - but this does not mean that all stylistic schools are equal, or that they are equally suited to all music. Mr. Ax and Mr. Ma are brilliant representatives of their (our) age's manner, and have an individual manner of their own within it that is distinctive and special. Their ''strict constructionist'' playing is involved and committed; it is not the abdication of responsibility that a depressing number of their contemporaries make of it. But it was hard not to feel at Carnegie that their art was limited by it nevertheless, because it narrows the directions they can take and limits the parameters within which they can allow their impulses to speak.

536-> THE ALLIES PREFER OUR INCUMBENT PRESIDENTS
To the Editor: Michael Harrison offers a rather too sophisticated analysis of ''European'' thinking (''The Allies Prefer Reagan,'' Op-Ed, Oct. 23). Although he never reveals how he consulted everyone in Europe for opinions, he appears to be speculating on the preferences of some Western European leaders and opinion makers. Since World War II, such leaders and opinion makers have always preferred the re-election of the American incumbent, with whatever rationale seems applicable at the time. They preferred Harry Truman in 1948. With no incumbent in 1952, they preferred the general they knew, and they wanted him re-elected. In 1960 they preferred the incumbent Vice President, not the brash junior senator from Massachusetts. They strongly indicated preference for Lyndon B. Johnson, the 1964 incumbent, and were shocked when he dropped out in 1968. For all their criticism of the war in Vietnam, including a chilly reception accorded Vice President Humphrey in Paris, they still inclined toward him as the incumbent candidate. In 1972 they openly declared enthusiasm for Richard M. Nixon, and they seemed to cast their lot with Gerald R. Ford in 1976. And as Mr. Harrison himself says, they ''had strong doubts about Ronald Reagan in 1980.'' European leaders, of whatever political stripe, are conservative in foreign policy. They prefer known American quantities, however much they like or dislike their policies, and they prefer continuity to change. The paean Mr. Harrison has written to Ronald Reagan's European popularity - and to European perspicacity - is really a pretentious declaration of Mr. Harrison's own political inclinations. ELLIOT J. FELDMAN International Affairs Fellow Council on Foreign Relations Washington, Oct. 24, 1984

537-> NEWS SUMMARY; MONDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 1984
International Cocaine traffickers in Peru killed at least 17 people employed by a United States-financed program to destroy coca crops, the Peruvian police said. All of the slain people were identified as Peruvian employees of the Coca Reduction Organization, which is part of a $30 million program the United States is financing along the Huallaga River where most of Peru's illegal coca is grown. The slayings took place at a jungle campsite. (Page A1, Column 1.) Democracy stirred for the first time in KwaNdebele, South Africa's second smallest tribal ''homeland'' for black people, which is near Pretoria. Last week there was voting for the 16 elected places in the 72-member Legislative Assembly, the first elections ever. No votes were counted at some polling places. (A1:2.) Fidel Castro's style of leadership in domestic affairs in Cuba was described by a Cuban defector as personal, impulsive and sometimes intrusive. The assessment of the Cuban leader, who was said to have an almost obsessive hatred of the United States, came from Jose Luis Llovio Menendez, who was an official in the Castro government. He also said in an interview in New York that he and his wife were granted official asylum in the United States last month. (A1:1.) A large demonstration in Madrid was held to protest Spain's proposed regulation of most church-run schools. Hundreds of thousands of people took part in a peaceful show of support for the Roman Catholic Church against the Socialist Government, which sponsored the law. (A3:3.) National Some corporate taxes would be raised by the modification of depreciation rules and taxes of many other companies would be cut by a general reduction in rates under a legislative proposal the Treasury Department is completing, according to Reagan Administration officials. The Administration tax bill would also reduce tax rates and simplify the tax code by limiting special write-offs for individuals and corporations, but would not contribute to a reduction in the Federal deficit. Leading tax specialists in both parties in Congress say there is little support for the bill. (A1:6.) More Americans are confident about Government than they have been in a decade, according to a New York Times/CBS News Poll. The poll found that they also expected President Reagan to make a strong effort to negotiate arms control treaties and to break his campaign promise by asking Congress to vote an increase in taxes. (A1:4.) A breakthrough in solving equations that often grow too vast or complex for the most powerful computers has been made by a 28-year-old mathematician at A.T.&T. Bell Laboratories. The discovery, to be published next month, is already circulating through the mathematical world. It has set off a deluge of inquiries from brokerage houses, oil companies and airlines, which have millions of dollars at stake in problems known as linear programming. The A.T.&T. mathematician is Dr. Narendra Karmarkar. (A1:3.) The Federal crime reporting system might change substantially after a final consultants' report is submitted to the Justice Department early next year. The effectiveness of the Uniform Crime Reporting System, used for the last 54 years by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, has long been questioned by governmental officials and criminologists. (B11:1.) Metropolitan A cut in the state income tax will be enacted in Albany next year, Republicans and Democrats in the Legislature predicted. They said the reduction would be similar to the cut recommended by a special panel to Governor Cuomo over the weekend. Republicans said they had to drag Mr. Cuomo ''kicking and screaming'' into the tax-cut process. Democrats said the panel's recommendation merely reflected a consensus developed in the Legislature. (A1:5.) Overcrowded welfare hotels have forced some homeless families, mostly mothers with young children, to spend nights at New York City's Emergency Assistance Unit on Church Street in lower Manhattan, sleeping on the floor, on countertops and in chairs. City officials said they were struggling to keep up with the ever-increasing need for emergency and permanent housing for poor families. As of Oct. 31, the city was sheltering 3,178 families in hotels or in its four shelters, 1,000 more than at the same time last year. (A1:4.) Republican backing of Mayor Koch for re-election next year is opposed by three of the five Republican county leaders in New York City. The three, Alfred S. Pantaleone, of Brooklyn, John F. Haggerty, of Queens, and George Hart, of Staten Island, could block a Republican nomination of Mr. Koch because they control a majority of Republican executive committees, which must approve the nomination of a non-Republican. (B7:1.) The New York City Opera will stage a spring musical-comedy season starting in 1986. Beverly Sills, the company's director, announced that the new spring season has been made possible with a $5 million gift from Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence A. Wien. (C14:3.) Leonard Rose, the cellist, died after a long illness Friday at the White Plains Hospital. Mr. Rose, who was 66 years old, was also one of the most distinquished cello teachers. (D14:5.)

538-> NEW YORK DAY BY DAY; Of Books That Wiggle
''A pop-up is exactly what we stand for,'' said Bette Korman, director of the Manhattan Laboratory Museum. ''It combines beautiful writing, beautiful graphics and the participatory element where a child can learn by doing.'' But pop-up books aren't just for children, she learned, as parents wiggled tabs, peered into tubes and flipped intricately folded paper in the children's room at the New York Public Library's Lincoln Center branch the other night. It was the opening of ''Pop-Up,'' an exhibition that will be at the library through Nov. 21. It will then continue at the laboratory museum from Nov. 28 to March 15. The museum, on West 54th Street, is a combination museum-classroom- art center, which will have the making of pop-up books among its other programs when the exhibition opens there. A history of the pop-up begins the exhibition, where children were throwing popcorn while their parents sipped white wine at the opening. Philip F. Ruth, a real-estate executive, wore a Smurf doll in the breast pocket of his three-piece suit. It was, he said, the first cocktail party for his 3-year-old son, Joshua. There were exotic foreign pop-up books, and many with inventive, intricate graphics. The 60 books reflect theater themes, it being Lincoln Center, but 30 more books will be added when the show moves to the museum. A few are as much as 200 years old. Pop-ups are making a comeback, said Elizabeth A. Long, the senior children's librarian. ''They've become really popular in the last five years. Some of the modern ones are wonderful - they're really paper graphic works. They're just fun.'' But they're also fragile. So the library's pop-up books may only be read on the premises.

540-> THE COMPUTER SEARCH FOR FLUTIE'S AGENT
The future of Doug Flutie is being monitored not only by teams in the rival pro football leagues, but also by his father and a computer. Even though these are wonderful and strange days in the life of the first collegian to pass for more than 10,000 yards in a career, they also are sensitive times. America, his father explains, is watching how the exciting Heisman Trophy winner will react to the lure of the pros, and whether he will retain his amateur status by avoiding involvement in negotiations while he is still eligible to play for Boston College in the Cotton Bowl Jan. 1. ''No matter what you read or hear, we have never taken a dollar from anyone and we have never agreed to play for anyone,'' his father, Richard, said. ''If you play by the rules - and Doug always did - let's face it, it adds to his mystique,'' the elder Flutie said yesterday. Keeping Track of Contacts Richard is the head of the Flutie household in Natick, Mass., the same town in which he is an integrated-circuit analyst for an electronics company. He said he set up an intriguing program more than three months ago, when he realized that something special was going on in the race to land his son. Along the way, he said, representatives of the National Football League and of the New Jersey Generals of the United States Football League have contacted him about Doug. And so have agents and lawyers and accountants. The search for someone to negotiate for Doug Flutie, who is likely to generate the biggest contract in football history, has been his father's obsession this season. He admits it is especially difficult now because the U.S.F.L. training camps start in late January - barely three weeks after Boston College performs in the Cotton Bowl. Doug also plans to play in the Japan Bowl the week before the U.S.F.L. camps begin. N.C.A.A. rules forbid a player from negotiating until after his college's final game, which means contract talk can begin after Jan. 1. ''In his junior year Doug came to me and said that a lot of the seniors were not having good years because they were concerned about the pros, and about finding agents,'' the elder Flutie said. ''I don't want to get involved in agents. I want you to pick them for me,'' Richard Flutie recalled his son saying. Comparing Salaries So three and a half months ago, Richard Flutie put the names of 42 agents into a computer. ''When the letters started coming in, I checked the letterhead to see which ones are good and which ones are just Xerox copies,'' he said. ''I got the list down to 12. I learned a lot about the draft and how this game is played.'' He attacked the search in a high- tech way. He put down the names of the N.F.L.'s 28 first-round draft picks of 1982 and 1983 - or, more precisely, the names of their agents. He added the top picks of the U.S.F.L. ''I took the total dollar value of their contracts - for example, Steve Young's contract is misleading. I discount future dollars. In theory, the money should tail down. The top pick of the draft should get more than the 10th. But every once in a while you get a blip - such as Eric Dickerson. That's how I eliminate some agents. He wasn't getting as much as he should have.'' But some agents, he noted, seemed to be getting more money for their clients than their lower-round selection warranted. Young, the quarterback who went to the Los Angeles Express of the U.S.F.L., signed a deal with a total package worth $40 million, extended to the year 2027, with at least 80 percent of the money to be paid long after his playing career. He is represented by Leigh Steinberg, who has about a dozen pro quarterbacks, including Ken O'Brien of the Jets. Dickerson, represented by Jack Mills, signed a four-year deal last year as a rookie with the Los Angeles Rams worth $2 million. Last weekend, Dickerson broke O. J. Simpson's single-season rushing record. Steinberg was one of the few top agents who did not contact the Flutie family. ''I'm a lawyer, and I'm supposed to wait for referrals,'' Steinberg explained yesterday. ''The legal code says you don't do uninvited solicitations.'' Field Narrowed to Four The father said he had narrowed the choice to four people - Ed Keating of Cleveland; Bob Woolf of Boston; John W. Hawekotte Jr. of Santa Ana, Calif., and Ron Shapiro of Baltimore. Woolf lives in Chestnut Hill, not far from Natick. ''And he's watched Doug since high school,'' Richard Flutie said. In addition, Woolf also negotiated a condominium for Bill, the oldest of the three Flutie sons. ''I've never seen anyone of this stature,'' Woolf said yesterday of Doug. ''If I were to represent him, I think I'd have to have an open mind, especially to the New Jersey Generals who have the rights to Doug. The opportunity to play for Donald Trump and to play in the New York area is awesome.'' The N.F.L., meanwhile, has sent Flutie a brochure called ''The N.F.L. and You - 1984-85.'' According to Dick Maxwell, the director of information for the National Conference, ''it's sent to selected college seniors and tells about the N.F.L.'' But Richard Flutie, not giving any clues to which way he is leaning, said yesterday: ''I think he's worth a lot more to the U.S.F.L. - he would bring them respectability. If he went to the Generals, he'd be worth a tremendous amount of money. But of course, the N.F.L. is the standard right now.'' Trump, the Generals' owner, acknowledged that ''someone from the office'' had been in touch with Flutie's father. ''I do believe Doug is foolish playing in those bowl games,'' Trump said, referring to the all-star affairs after the Cotton Bowl. ''We'd love to get him, but it's a question of economics.''

543-> SPORTS WORLD SPECIALS; A Bettor's Dream
Can you think of one good reason why horse-racing fans shouldn't be able to sit back in the cozy comfort of their living rooms watching live telecasts of an evening's card and placing bets by telephone right up to post time? Rick Abrams can't, and if you come up with one, don't tell him. As the project manager of a year-old venture of TCS/Productions, a Pennsylvania-based sports production company, he is committed to making that dream a reality across the country. He is peddling a system known as BETS (Betting Entertainment Television Systems) in which TCS (Total Communication Systems) will help a track produce live broadcasts for cable television while accepting phone bets from viewers. Many of those viewers, according to the TCS theory, will be new fans - stay-at- home spectators drawn to the sport by the convenience and excitement of having a track, tote board and parimutuel window right in their living rooms. Based on a prototype TCS installation at the Meadows, a harness track outside Pittsburgh, the theory is right. According to Abrams and the track's manager, Terry Bove, since the Meadows network went on the air a year ago with some 300,000 cable subscribers, the handle at the track, including phone bets, is up 20 percent and growing, while attendance is holding steady. ''We started with 10 operators and we've just gone to 16,'' said Abrams, lead other tracks to sign up. Before that happens, however, he must persuade tracks to persuade state legislatures to change laws that bar live track telecasts and phone betting. Currently, he noted, only three states - Pennsylvania, Maryland and Kentucky - allow both, while one, Florida, allows phone betting but bars live telecasts. Unlike New York's offtrack betting, which also allows betting by phone, in the TCS BETS system the phone bets are received at the track and are incorporated into the track's parimutuel pool. The TCS system is patterned on one developed several years ago at Louisville Downs in Kentucky and more recently copied by Penn National, a thoroughbred track in Harrisburg. According to Abrams, however, TCS is the only company that is trying to extend its system to other tracks. Spending a day at the races at home may be convenient, but according to Abrams, it does offer occasional frustration, especially for knowledgeable bettors who watch the changing parimutuel odds on their television screens before placing bets at the last minute - only to get a busy signal. ''They become crazed,'' he said.

546-> LONG LEGAL WRANGLING LIKELY OVER GAS LEAK
The Union Carbide Corporation is expected to face an onslaught of damage claims stemming from the gas leak at its plant in Bhopal, India, and most experts are expecting months - or even years - of legal wrangling. The major legal questions seem to be whether the damage claims should be heard in this country or in India; which country's laws should govern the proceedings, and whether the claims will be against the parent company or the much smaller subsidiary that operated the pesticide plant, Union Carbide India Ltd. The subsidiary is 51 percent owned by Union Carbide and 49 percent Indian-owned. The answers to those questions could go far toward determining how much liability Union Carbide faces. American juries are thought to be far more generous with damage awards than juries in other countries, and most victims of the gas leak are expected to try to file suit in the United States courts. Already, American personal-injury lawyers have been trying to find a way to share in the legal action. A Variety of Suits Expected Lawsuits are expected from a variety of plaintiffs, including the Indian Government, the relatives of those who were killed, those who were injured by the gas, and perhaps also those who were exposed to the gas but have not yet developed symptoms of injury. Melvin Belli, a personal-injury lawyer in San Francisco, said his office had already been contacted by three relatives of those injured, and that he expected to file a class-action suit in the Federal court in San Francisco. ''We'll be going over there before the end of the week, and we'll probably file before we go,'' he said. ''I think the cases have to be tried here.'' Ved Nanda, director of international studies at the University of Denver Law School, says: ''Although Indian law is comparable to American, I think even $50,000 is considered a high wrongful death award there. Here, it's several million dollars.'' Lifetime Earnings Considered He emphasized the generosity of American jurors. The affluence of most American plaintiffs also plays a role in the size of awards. The legal compensation for wrongful death claims is based mostly on the victim's potential lifetime earnings, and the average Indian worker's earnings are said to be only about $200 a year. V. P. Sathe, the Indian Minister for Petroleum and Chemicals, said Tuesday that he expected Union Carbide to provide the same kind of relief that it would have provided if the accident had taken place in the United States. Many lawyers interpreted that statement to mean that the Indian Government will seek to apply American laws and American compensation standards to the claims, and to have them heard in American courts. ''The complaints shouldn't be filed and heard in India, because there is almost nothing to recover from the Union Carbide subsidiary there,'' said Raja Nikant Mody, a lawyer who is advising the Indian Consulate in New York. ''They should be here, against the parent, in accordance with the American scales,'' he said, ''and I think there will be sympathy for that because of the loss of so many lives.'' Jurisdiction a Question The American courts may not agree to hear the Indian lawsuits, however. In 1981 the United States Supreme Court dismissed a case arising out of a plane crash in Scotland in which several Scots were killed. Although the airplane manufacturer was American, the court said Scotland was the better forum for trying the case. More recently, however, in a similar case involving a plane crash near Bombay, the United States courts agreed to hear the case. Sheila Birnbaum, a New York product liability lawyer, said yesterday that she expected the cases to end up in India. ''I think this is more like the Supreme Court case than the Bombay crash case,'' she said. Generally, in deciding whether they are the best forum for claim, courts will consider the convenience of the parties, the availability of the witnesses, and whether the claim has a closer connection to another location.

547-> SUCH STUFF AS SPACE DREAMS ARE MADE ON
To the Editor: Your arguments against a manned station in ''The Wrong Stuff'' imply that manned versus unmanned is an either/or proposition. A manned sta tion, where humans carry out all tasks manually, is clearly too expensive. Life support is expensive, and many manufacturing processes require a low-vibration environment away from humans. Complex unmanned space platforms cannot operate long without human intervention. It is currently possible to run factories unmanned for several shifts, but not several weeks. This will not change for decades. You have argued that the shuttle can provide this needed human component. However, a shuttle launch is too expensive to carry out frequent service flights. The proper mix of human and robot is a combination of small manned space station, surrounded by many unmanned space platforms. This is the path NASA is pursuing. A continuous manned presence eliminates the need for frequent shuttle-repair flights. Since someone will always be nearby to do repairs, space factories do not have to be designed for extremely high reliability. This could reduce overall costs.

549-> SUCH STUFF AS SPACE DREAMS ARE MADE ON
To the Editor: ''The Wrong Stuff'' suggests you have learned nothing about space since your notorious castigation of Prof. Robert Goddard in 1920 for his naive belief that rockets could work in a vacuum. To write now that ''The next phase of . . . exploiting space could almost certainly be undertaken more efficiently, and perhaps more spectacularly, with robots,'' in the very month when astronauts brilliantly improvised the salvage of two stray communications satellites, shows truly uncanny timing. As with any major transportation project, reasonable men may differ sharply on costs and schedules, but there is almost universal agreement that a manned space station will be needed in the immediate future. In this context, we would make two proposals, one technical, one political. The present shuttle fuel tank represents 90,000 cubic feet of living space, which is currently allowed to burn up in the atmosphere. For very little extra cost, this could be injected into a stable orbit. Routine shuttle flights would then quickly provide the material for a very large space habitat. Second, an approach should be made to the Soviet Union - and any other spacefaring nations - to establish common docking and servicing facilities. The spirit of Apollo-Soyuz should be revived. President Reagan's recognition of the desirability of a space station may prove one of his wisest decisions, one for which his Administration will be best remembered, as John Kennedy's is for his decision to go to the moon.

550-> REBEL SEEKS ROLE IN NICARAGUA VOTE
Eden Pastora Gomez, a Nicaraguan rebel leader, held a series of meetings here today with members of Congress, Congressional sources said. They said that he was seeking to mobilize support for an effort to induce Nicaragua to open up the presidential elections scheduled for November. Some members of Congress and Central American specialists who have met with Mr. Pastora over the last 48 hours said he was apparently shifting from reliance on guerrilla warfare to political action. One of the lawmakers who met with him, Representative Jim Wright of Texas, who is the House majority leader, said Mr. Pastora had indicated that his insurgent group in Costa Rica would lay down its arms if allowed to take part in free and open elections. Others described Mr. Pastora as encouraging both Republicans and Democrats to join with politicians in Latin America and in Western Europe to press Nicaragua to liberalize the election rules, as the Reagan Administration has been urging, and to allow former insurgents to take part. Pact with Ex-Sandinista Reported Some Latin American specialists said they considered it potentially significant that Mr. Pastora had apparently joined forces with Arturo Jose Cruz, a former Sandinista leader who is now an economist with the Inter- American Development Bank here. Opposition leaders in Nicaragua have mentioned Mr. Cruz as a potential candidate, but he has thus far refused to be drawn into active politics or affiliation with any grouping. However, Nicaraguan rebel sources in Costa Rica said Mr. Pastora and Mr. Cruz had agreed to join forces to lobby for negotiations between the Sandinistas and their external opposition as well as for participation in elections. And today Mr. Cruz accompanied Mr. Pastora in the meetings on Capitol Hill. In addition to Representative Wright, they met with Representative Bill Alexander of Arkansas, who is the chief Democratic deputy whip. The two House leaders were among a group that wrote in mid-March to Daniel Ortega Saavedra, the Nicaraguan leader, to propose ''a fully open and democratic electoral process'' as an alternative to the insurgency. Pastora Seeks Safety Guarantee According to Representative Alexander, Mr. Pastora said today that ''he wants his party to participate in the elections and to be guaranteed safety.'' ''While Pastora does not say explicitly he will lay down arms, he implies that,'' Representative Alexander said. In the civil war leading to the Sandinista seizure of power in 1979, Mr. Pastora was a guerrilla commander known as Commander Zero. He served as a Deputy Defense Minister until he broke with the Sandinistas and went into armed rebellion two years ago. Representative Alexander said Edward Chamorro, a leader of the rival Nicaraguan rebel group, the Nicaraguan Democratic Front, said last month in Honduras that he also wanted to stop the rebellion and take part in elections. ''So we have a good beginning and that is the stuff settlements are made of,'' Representative Alexander said. Mr. Pastora's efforts, to be discussed at a news conference on Monday, came as the United States completed the first round of talks with Nicaragua, and the Senate joined the House in dropping money for the Nicaraguan insurgents from a spending bill. Shultz Expects More Fighting In a meeting with Washington correspondents of The New York Times, Secretary of State George P. Shultz said that, despite the Congressional refusal to vote more money, he expected the Nicaraguan rebels to go on fighting. He said the United States would give ''moral support'' to their efforts to raise money elsewhere. Although he treated the negotiations with the Nicaraguan Government as serious, he gave no indication that he saw evidence of an early breakthrough. In a separate development, Roberto d'Aubuisson, the Salvadoran rightist, said at a news conference at the Capitol Hilton Hotel here that he would support an effort by his Government to induce the Salvadoran insurgents to run candidates in elections next year. But he said any talks to share power with the rebels would violate the Constitution. ''Let the insurgents try to seize power, to share power, in the only permissible fashion, through the ballot box,'' he said. Speaking of President Jose Napoleon Duarte's plans to try to arrange for the rebels' participation in local and national assembly elections in 1985, he said, ''If that is what Duarte intends to do, we will support him on this.'' Mr. d'Aubuisson, who lost to Mr. Duarte in the presidential election on May 6, held up a map of El Salvador to show that Mr. Duarte had won geographically small, but heavily populated areas, while people in some 85 percent of the country, including guerrilla strongholds, had voted for Mr. d'Aubuisson's party, the National Republican Alliance. Mr. d'Aubuisson repeated earlier allegations by members of his party, which is known by the Spanish acronym Arena, that the Central Intelligence Agency and American Embassy officials had aided his rival during the elections. Mr. d'Aubuisson also contended that Nicaragua was supplying Salvadoran guerrillas with heavy weapons, including antiaircraft rockets and advanced communications equipment and codes that the Pentagon had been trying unsuccessfully to break. Mr. Shultz later said he could not confirm that heavy weapons were moving from Nicaragua into El Salvador and he declined to discuss any code-breaking efforts. Previously American officials have said that the flow has consisted of small arms and munitions.

551-> Crime Unit Backs Law On Money Laundering
A Presidential commission on organized crime, in a preliminary report, recommended new laws and administrative measures today to counter moves by criminals to conceal their sources of money. The White House did not make the report public. Larry Speakes, the Presidential spokesman, said the commission would make the report public in New York on Tuesday. The report, ''The Cash Connection,'' was presented to President Reagan by Judge Irving R. Kaufman, chairman of the commission. Mr. Speakes said the report ''describes money-laundering processes in detail'' and ''concludes that the problem is widespread, recommends voluntary administrative and legislative measures to counter them.'' He said the report ''proposes legislation that basically would make money- laundering a crime.'' Mr. Speakes said the commission, which is making a region-by-region analysis of the influence of organized crime, will make its final report to the President in 1986.

552-> POP/JAZZ
-day Kool Jazz Festival, which is dedicated to Count Basie this year, will reach an appropriate climax tomorrow evening at 8 with a memorial salute to the pianist and band leader as the last major concert of the festival. Basie had been scheduled to appear tomorrow night with his orchestra and some of its former members in a ''Basie Alumni Party,'' but after his death April 26 at the age of 79, the program became, instead, a memorial. It will look back to early phases of Basie's career, with the aid of all-star combos. His stint as the pianist in Bennie Moten's orchestra in the early 1930's is recalled under the direction of Dick Hyman. The band Basie led in Kansas City and that was the basis of his big band is being supervised by the trumpeter Buck Clayton, who played with Basie for a decade. Joe Williams, Basie's singer in the 50's, will do songs linked to his predecessor, Jimmy Rushing, and to his own days with the Basie Band. Illinois Jacquet, a Basie saxophonist in the 40's, will lead a saxophone group illustrating the styles of such Basie saxophonists as Lester Young, Herschel Evans and Don Byas. Al Grey, Basie's featured trombonist in the 60's and 70's, will recall Dickie Wells, of the earlier Basie band. A Night of Jazz History A miniature history of jazz will be encompassed this evening at 8 at Carnegie Hall (247-7459) in a program that brings together Benny Carter, who arranged and played for Fletcher Henderson in the late 20's and who led his own big bands in the 30's and 40's, with two stars of the 40's be-bop era, the trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie and the trombonist J. J. Johnson. The Gillespie-Johnson group will also include the pianist Tommy Flanagan, the bassist Ray Brown and the drummer Louie Bellson. They will share the evening with Sun Ra and His Omniverse Jazz Arkestra. Another concert tonight, which will have two performances, at 7 and 11 P.M., in Avery Fisher Hall (874-6770), focuses on soul and rhythm and blues with Ray Charles, his orchestra and his singing group, the Raelettes, and Gladys Knight and the Pips. Tomorrow at Avery Fisher at 8 P.M., Sonny Rollins will be paired with Flora Purim and Airto. Mr. Rollins, long an explorer of the possibilities of the saxophone, will lead a group made up of Clifton Anderson on trombone, Mark Soskin on piano, Russel Blake on bass and Tommy Campbell on drums. Miss Purim, who has been an assiduous experimenter with vocal effects since she arrived from Brazil in 1967, has been teamed with the percussionist Airto for 11 years, creating a blend of Brazilian music and jazz. The festival moves outdoors tomorrow and Sunday for the annual Hudson boatride and for Latin jazz at the Damrosch Shell in Lincoln Center. Aboard for this year's ferry ride will be a blues band led by the veteran James Cotton. Traditional jazz will be represented by the Dirty Dozen Brass Band from New Orleans, which has the instrumentation of a New Orleans marching band. But this group also plays be-bop, funk, rhythm and blues and modern jazz. The ferry leaves South Ferry at 10:30 A.M., 1 P.M. and 3:30 P.M. Free Latin Jazz On Sunday, in a free concert starting at 2 P.M. in the Damrosch Shell, Conjunto Libre, a Latin jazz band led by the trumpeter Jerry Gonzalez, will be joined by Concepto Latino, which won the opportunity to play at the festival after an elimination contest in Puerto Rico. Concepto Latino, a 13- piece Latin jazz and salsa band led by Jose Perez, was chosen by a panel that included the band leaders Tommy Olivencia and Roberto Roena and the trumpeter Juancito Torres. The festival finale will be given Sunday night in Carnegie Recital Hall at 8:30, when the Swiss-born pianist George Gruntz leads an international version of the Concert Jazz Band that he organized in 1972. It will have musicians from Denmark, East Germany, Switzerland, Finland and Argentina, along with 10 Americans. The daily piano solo recitals will end tomorrow at 5:30 at Carnegie Recital Hall with Joe Bushkin at the keyboard. He is an ebullient musician, whose big-band career includes stints with Bunny Berigan, Tommy Dorsey and Benny Goodman. The pianist today at 5 will be Jorge Dalto, who arrived from Argentina in 1973 , and who has moved from Latin jazz into the full jazz scene. Meanwhile, Up at Saratoga This weekend's out-of-town event will be the annual visit to Saratoga Springs for two noon-to-midnight sessions, tomorrow and Sunday at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center (518 587-3330). Saratoga will offer the only appearances by the singer Al Jarreau, the Horace Silver Quartet, the George Russell Living Time Orchestra, the Toshiko Akiyoshi New York Jazz Orchestra, the Louie Bellson Big Band Explosion, the pianist Adam Makowicz, the Jimmy Knepper Sextet, the Valeri Capers Quartet and the singer Angela Bofill. The jazz clubs affiliated with the jazz festival - Fat Tuesday's and the Blue Note - continue their programs through Sunday night. Fat Tuesday's, Third Avenue at 17th Street (533- 7902), will present a quintet led by the clarinetist Buddy DeFranco and the vibraphonist Terry Gibbs tonight through Sunday night. The Blue Note, 131 West Third Street (475-8592), will have the singer Carmen McRae and her trio and the pianist John Lewis, usually heard with the Modern Jazz Quartet, with his own trio. The Kool Festival's free-performance contribution this weekend to the Celebrate Brooklyn Festival, will bring Koko Taylor and her Blues Machine to the Prospect Park bandstand tonight at 8, John Lee Hooker and the Coast to Coast Blues Band tomorrow at 8, and the pianist and singer Mose Allison on Sunday evening. The number for Kool Jazz Festival information is 787-2020; the Celebrate Brooklyn number is 768-0699. Tickets may be ordered by calling the numbers listed for concert sites, or through Ticketron, 977-9020, Teletron, 947-9300 and Chargit, 944-9300.

553-> No Headline
Smoke Rings After citing the many hazards of cigarette smoking, Surgeon General C. Everett Koop has called for ''a smoke-free society by the year 2000.'' At the moment, however, that society seems a lot more than 16 years away. Take those heralded new warnings for cigarette packages and advertising - the ones that are going to spell out the most important dangers to health. Dr. Koop isn't going to see them as fast as he'd like because Congress has now put off the vote for at least another month. That'll give Senator Jesse Helms more time to talk the cigarette industry, which agreed to support the new warnings, into promising to buy more tobacco from American growers and less from Africa and Brazil. His threat to the industry is that otherwise he will block this bill and let Congress devise an even stiffer one. And to atone for this jarring message on every pack, House and Senate conferees are also working to make it easier to buy cigarettes - easier on the purse, that is. Last week's new tax package let stand a scheduled drop in the cigarette tax from 16 to 8 cents a pack, rejecting even a compromise of 12 cents. By next year, then, Government will let smokers pay appreciably less for a health risk it wants emphasized more. Is that any way to get the smoke out of America's eyes by 2000?

554-> AGREEMENT, NOT DISASTER, ATUNESCO MEETING
To the Editor: Readers of The Times may be interested in how the important Unesco executive board meeting turned out in Paris at the end of October. Before the concluding phase of the meeting, many press reports had pointed out that crucial questions of reform needed to be tackled, and ominous warnings were made that Unesco might indeed tear itself apart in the ensuing debates. I would like to inform your readers that an incredible degree of agreement was reached, and a most substantial record of accomplishment achieved before the board adjourned on Oct. 22. Here is a brief list of the possible disasters that might have occurred and what actually did happen: * The U.S. had criticized Unesco's budget growth as excessive, and so it was thought the majority developing- nation members would create a crisis by demanding continued growth. Actual result : All 51 board member states joined in consensus agreement in holding the line on Unesco's next budget to the same ceiling as this one, $391 million, for two years. * Since widespread criticism had been voiced over Unesco's recruiting and management procedures, many published stories predicted that the bombshell would explode here when suggested reforms were discussed. Actual result : All 51 nations once again joined in a consensus approving the reforms in these areas recommended by the working groups and the board's own special committee, with the endorsement of the Director General. * The U.S. Government's General Accounting Office study of Unesco had been leaked to the press just before the board meeting, and its reported critical findings had been expected to provide a platform for more fireworks. Actual result : The U.S. asked at the board that the report be considered, the Director General said that was fine with him, but the board decided, in the words of the Belgian delegate, George-Henry Dumont, that it couldn't discuss a report ''which didn't officially exist'' and that it would consider the findings when the final report was issued. It goes without saying that the G.A.O. report was informally discussed among delegates. * Finally, many reports had portrayed Unesco's program as ''anti- Western'' or ''hostile to Western values.'' Actual result : The guidelines for the program of the next two years were thoroughly discussed and then agreed upon by consensus by all board members. The United States was part of the approval process in this and the above actions dealing with budget and management. DOUDOU DIENE Director, Unesco Office at the U.N. New York, Nov. 9, 1984

555-> OSWALD JACOBY, TOP EXPERT ON BRIDGE AND A COLUMNIST
Oswald Jacoby, one of the greatest contract bridge players, died of cancer Wednesday at his home in Dallas. He was 81 years old. Mr. Jacoby was a key member of the Four Aces team that dominated play in the 1930's and won a string of national titles, including the Vanderbilt Knockout Teams and the Spingold Knockout Teams seven times each. He also won the first world team championship in 1936, playing against France in Madison Square Garden with the Four Aces. Mr. Jacoby also was known as an expert in other card games as well as in backgammon. He wrote many books, and, in 1950, began a bridge column syndicated to several hundred newpapers. His 10,000th column appeared on April 22, 1982, setting a record. In recent years, the column had been shared with his son James O. Jacoby, who also became a world champion in 1970, when his father was nonplaying captain of the American team. A Native of Brooklyn He was born in Brooklyn and had two months of Army service in World War I at the age of 15. After studying at Columbia University he became, at 21, the youngest man ever to qualify as an actuary. His long bridge career began in the 1920's when he began winning tournaments at auction and contract bridge. He burst into national prominence in December 1931 when Sidney Lenz, then a leader in bridge's establishment, selected him as a partner in a well-publicized challenge rubber bridge match against Ely Culbertson, then an upstart with new theories. Mr. Jacoby withdrew before the match was over in a partnership dispute with Mr. Lenz, creating a sensation. Mr. Jacoby was playing in a national championship in Richmond when Pearl Harbor was attacked. He departed immediately to join the Navy and served as a code expert, both during World War II and in the Korean War, reaching the rank of lieutenant commander. When he returned to tournament play he found that he had been overtaken by Charles Goren at the head of the national master-point standings. He regained the top spot in 1962. Between 1959 and 1963 he was a four-time winner of the McKenney Trophy, for overall tournament performance, and became the first player to win 1,000 master-points in a year. On Harvard's Board of Visitors He continued to practice as an actuary, and served six years on the board of visitors of Harvard University. Mr. Jacoby's well-deserved reputation for defensive skill was demonstrated on the diagramed deal, from the Culbertson-Lenz match. He was happy to make a penalty double when Josephine Culbertson, on his right, offered a jump overcall in spades, and had some thinking to do when he led the diamond ace and the dummy appeared. The problem was to cut down the potential club ruffs, and Mr. Jacoby solved it dramatically by shifting to the trump queen. This removed one trump from the dummy, and if South chose to take a club ruff, she would lose an additional trump trick. The result was down two, and without Mr. Jacoby's defense it would have been at most down one. This imaginative maneuver was completely original at the time that he made it. He pioneered many significant innovations in bridge theory, notably the Jacoby transfer bid, which has been adopted by a majority of experts. In 1983 he was selected as Bridge Personality of the Year by the International Bridge Press Association. His most remarkable victory occurred last December in Miami Beach. Though already seriously ill, he entered the competition for the Reisinger Trophy, perhaps the toughest national team event, and won. This was the first victory on such a level by an octogenarian. Besides his son James, he is survived by his wife, Mary Zita Jacoby, and another son, Jon P.

557-> SCREEN 'KARATE KID,' BANE OF BULLIES
A large part of ''The Karate Kid'' - the best part, really - seems to be taking place inside a fortune cookie. It is here, in the serene realm of Oriental wisdom, Hollywood-style, that a teen- ager named Daniel (Ralph Macchio) is taught lesson after lesson about life. His instructor is an elderly man named Mr. Miyagi, played by Noriyuki (Pat) Morita, who is first seen trying to catch flies with a pair of chopsticks. Throughout the film, Mr. Miyagi sustains a scene-stealing, if hokey, eccentricity. Mr. Miyagi easily becomes a perfect father figure for Daniel, thanks to the old man's patience, understanding and seemingly infinite knowledge. His incredible command of karate is another plus as far as Daniel is concerned, since the boy is newly transplanted from Newark to California, and frequently finds himself being savaged by large, affluent blond bullies who dress like Michael Jackson. Mr. Miyagi teaches him to defend himself and, along the way, to become a man. ''The Karate Kid,'' which opens today at the Ziegfeld and other theaters, has the makings of a genuinely heart-warming two-man drama, with Mr. Morita a charming cut-up and Mr. Macchio gently likable in the Robby Benson role. But neither the director, John G. Avildsen, nor the screenwriter, Robert Mark Kamen, is content to leave well enough alone. Their film is full of extras, from the supporting characters who barely have anything to do to the Bill Conti music that blasts annoyingly through the final climactic fight scene. Even deleting the fun-in-the-sun teen-age montages that crop up periodically would improve the film greatly, or at least cut down on its penchant for wasting time. Since ''The Karate Kid'' is essentially a fairy tale, Mr. Avildsen's broad directorial touches often shatter its gentle mood. Yet the bullies are shown to be unbelievably rotten (their leader is a drill sergeant-type karate instructor, who makes his students do pushups on their knuckles). The score is pushy and loud. And the extras, like the modelly looking parents of Daniel's rather superfluous young sweetheart, are made of wood. The only sections of the film that really work are those concerning Daniel and his mentor, and even this relationship is taken too far. Long after we know of their affection for each other, long after Daniel and Mr. Miyagi know this too, the film includes a dreadful drunk scene in which the old man confesses several key facts about his past and then shows his Medal of Honor. When karate is not being treated as the latest excuse for an ''Impossible Dream'' success story, and when the film is able to find more in Daniel's martial-arts career than pure ''Rocky''-esque competitiveness, ''The Karate Kid'' exhibits warmth and friendly, predictable humor, its greatest assets. Midway through the story, an obvious but highly effective sequence has Mr. Miyagi saddling Daniel with one herculean home-repair chore after another, tasks that have no apparent connection with his karate training. It is irresistible, if not surprising, to watch this culminate in the boy's angry outburst, the old man's quiet bemusement and the revelation that painting, sanding and waxing have plenty to do with karate after all.

558-> Scot Lad in Talks
Scot Lad Foods Inc., a food wholesaler based in Lansing, Ill., said it is negotiating the sale of most of its assets, including the company name, to Roundy's Inc. for about $40 million. Roundy's is also a food wholesaler as well as a distributor. The sale would leave a ''corporate shell with cash and a few investments,'' according to a Scot Lad spokesman, Gene E. Morrison. The company said that Scot Lad's president and chief executive, Robert T. Cross, would continue in that position, and that ''all operating personnel of Scot Lad will be retained.'' On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Scot advanced $1.125, to $8.875.

560-> RAWLEY DEFEATS ORIOLES
In a classic western film years ago, as Alan Ladd rode off into the sunset, Brandon de Wilde called to him, ''Shane, come back.'' Tonight Shane came back, Shane Rawley, that is. Rawley, recycled from the bullpen because Jay Howell had a tender elbow, pitched 7Z creditable innings as the Yankees trimmed the Baltimore Orioles, 5-3. Clay Christiansen pitched the final 1Y, gaining his first major league save by striking out Floyd Rayford with two on and two out in the ninth. Dave Winfield and Don Mattingly came back, too - with more hits. Winfield collected two singles and a double in five times at bat, raising his league-leading average to .356. Mattingly stroked a single and a double in three at-bats (he also walked twice), increasing his second-best average to .344. Mattingly Breaks Tie Mattingly's fourth-inning double drove in Butch Wynegar, who had singled against Scott McGregor with two out, and that run snapped a 3-3 tie. It gave Mattingly 25 runs batted in, with a .419 average, in his last 25 games. But it was Rawley who provided the most remarkable performance, looking shaky when the Orioles scored three runs in the second inning but rebounding with an efficient and effective effort. The length of his effort was perhaps the most intriguing aspect because he had not pitched more than seven innings in any of his previous eight starts and he had averaged only four innings per start. ''I've been hurt all year,'' said Rawley, whom the Yankees nearly traded earlier in the season. ''If it wasn't one thing, it was another. I feel like I'm healthy now. I just needed a few innings under my belt. After the first few innings tonight, I felt I was in a rhythm and I went back to pitching. ''When Yogi put me in the bullpen, he told me he was going to do that just so I could get some innings. As it is, I got only one. But I felt all along I'd be back. I won 14 games last year and that wasn't a mistake.'' Rawley's return from the bullpen did not look too impressive when he squandered a 3-0 lead the Yankees gave him in the first inning. Mattingly's two-out single and Don Baylor's 14th home run produced the first two runs, and Brian Dayett singled home the third after Winfield had singled and Toby Harrah had walked. But Rawley began the second inning by walking Eddie Murray, and Gary Roenicke doubled him to third. Ken Singleton then lashed a single to right field, driving both home. Later in the inning Rick Dempsey doubled across the tying run. From there, Rawley allowed just five singles, no more than one an inning, and only one runner reached second base while the left-hander was in the game. Double plays helped Rawley in the third and fourth, and he struck out Singleton with two out and runners at first and second in the sixth. Mattingly, meanwhile, doubled home the tie-breaking run in the fourth, and Willie Randolph doubled in another run in the sixth. Rawley got the first two batters in the eighth inning and thought he had the third out as well. But Tom Lepperd, the rookie third base umpire, ruled that Dayett had trapped Murray's sinking line drive, and Yogi Berra called for Christiansen. Wayne Gross singled Murray to second, but Singleton hit a fly to right for the third out. Christiansen was back in trouble in the ninth when Mike Young led off with a single and John Lowenstein singled one out later. John Shelby hit a pitch well but lined it to right for the second out. Then Rayford came up, and Christiansen said, ''I threw him a fast ball in, a curve ball and a cross-seamer up, out of the strike zone, and he chased it. I didn't throw him a strike.'' But all three pitches became strikes when Rayford swung at them, so Christiansen had his first save and Rawley had his second victory. Injury Slows Dent Bucky Dent collected 5 hits in 17 times at bat in his first four games at Columbus, but his progress toward a return to the Yankees has been slowed by a pulled hamstring that has put him on the bench.

565-> CAMPAIGN NOTES; Jackson Assails Decision On Seniority Over Race
The Rev. Jesse Jackson today criticized the Supreme Court's decision Tuesday that gave priority to seniority systems over affirmative action considerations in determining employee layoffs. He said the ruling was one ''designed to protect the privileged position of the white male minority.'' ''Race- and sex-conscious oppression must have race- and sex-conscious relief,'' said Mr. Jackson, a candidate for the Democratic Presidential nomination. He added that affirmative action was a way of offsetting ''centuries of negative action'' while the Court's decision was a futile attempt to achieve justice outside this context. Mr. Jackson's comments followed a meeting with members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, another in a series of meetings he has been holding in an attempt to win support from blacks and women who are lawmakers for his call for adjustments in the party's delegate-selection rules and against runoff primaries. Mr. Jackson pressed his case for changes in the delegate selection and primary rules in a separate meeting here Wednesday night with Walter F. Mondale's campaign manager, Robert Beckel and Bert Lance, the Democratic Party Chairman for Georgia. Representatie Robert Garcia, a Bronx Democrat who is chairman of the caucus, said that while he and other Hispanic members of the House individually backed Mr. Jackson's positions, the entire group could not endorse them, as the Congressional Black Caucus did earlier this week. Coalition Seeks to Ease Restrictions on Voting WASHINGTON, June 14 (UPI) - A coalition of voters' rights groups says it will try to convince the nation's governors to end restrictive voting registration procedures that the coalition contends keep 55 million Americans from the polls. The National Emergency Mobilization on the Right to Vote Conference met here Wednesday and plotted a strategy to confront what Hulbert James, chairman of the conference, called a ''national voting emergency.'' Leaders of 30 voters' rights groups decided to ''open dialogues with the nation's governors'' and then lobby them at the National Governors Association meeting next month, Mr. James said. Congressman in Atlanta Faces 4 Primary Foes ATLANTA, June 14 (AP) - Representative Wyche Fowler Jr., a white Democrat representing the Fifth Congressional District, which includes most of Atlanta and has a black majority, faces four black opponents in his re- election bid. Mr. Fowler was up against two Democratic opponents early Wednesday, the final day of qualifying for the Aug. 14 primary elections in Georgia, but quickly picked up two more - Robert Waymer, an Atlanta school board member, and former State Representative Henrietta Canty. Mr. Fowler also faces Hosea Williams, a civil rights activist, and former State Representative Alveda King Beal, a niece of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. No Republicans sought the Fifth District nomination. West Virginia Governor Files Financial Report CHARLESTON, W.Va., June 14 (AP) - A blind trust fund established by Gov. John D. Rockefeller 4th before he took office in 1976 was worth at least $4.9 million, and he made at least $482,000 from its investments in the past 16 months, his latest financial disclosure shows. The trust fund, which includes stocks, bonds and interest in companies, was detailed in a report filed Monday with the secretary of the United Sttes Senate. The report was required because Governor Rockefeller is running for the seat being vacated by Senator Jennings Randolph, a Democrat who is retiring.

566-> DANCE: GABRIELA DARVASH
GABRIELA DARVASH is known as one of the best ballet teachers in New York, attracting many professional dancers as well as young students to her classes. A number of these professionals, including Nancy Raffa of American Ballet Theater and Judith Fugate of the New York City Ballet, are appearing in the series of performances entitled ''Darvash Dancers on Display'' that run through tomorrow at The Open Eye, 316 East 88th Street. Miss Darvash has dedicated the programs to the late Nina Brito, a friend of many dancers. Wednesday night's opening had several points of interest. One was a work by German Zamuel, a choreographer who was with Leningrad's Maly Ballet before he emigrated. The piece featured his wife, Valentina Moukhanova, a former Maly ballerina. Medhi Bahiri, familiar from the Boston Ballet, and Maria Gisladottir, an Icelandic dancer who has been seen here with the Berlin Ballet, both offered a strikingly danced Adagio from Act II of ''Swan Lake.'' Miss Darvash, trained in her native Rumania and in the Soviet Union, has instilled in all her pupils an extraordinary stage projection. If this was very much a school performance, it was filled with young people who know genuinely how to perform. The results were impressively on display in Miss Darvash's ''Rumanian Rhapsody'' and a school piece, ''Rossiniana,'' led by Mariko Nagata and Mikifumi Nagata. The very promising Sharon Newton appeared in Miss Darvash's classroom vignette about a dancer facing injury. Mr. Zamuel, using music from Samuel Barber's ''Concerto,'' provided an interesting conceptual piece that pitted a six-member ensemble in a Neo-Classic style against Miss Moukhanova, a dancer of strong attack who wasdressed in a Romantic tutu. Many of the movement motifs came from ''Giselle,'' danced eventually by both factions. The result was comparable to a Cubist analysis of the key moments from ''Giselle.'' Miss Fugate and Mr. Bahiri danced Miss Darvash's ''Romeo and Juliet'' with sweetness and understanding. Aaron Dugger, a highly committed performer, brought down the house in a modern-dance solo by Ken Jeff.

567-> AS RELIGIOUS PARTIES FEUD, THEIR SECULAR POWER ERODES
More than ever before, Israel's religious parties seem to be fragmenting over nonreligious issues. Before the 1967 war, religious voters were offered a relatively simple choice: The Zionist National Religious Party, which sought to marry religious Judaism with modern secular nationalism, and the Agudat Yisrael party, made up of Orthodox non-Zionist Jews, whose primary concern was preservation of Jewish traditions until the coming of the Messiah. For the Agudat, Israel was just another secular state. The two parties, despite their small size, have always carried important political weight because the major parties, Labor and Likud, never had an absolute majority in Parliament. In return for taking part in coalition Governments, the religious parties won concessions ranging from grounding El Al, the national airline, on the Sabbath to maintaining strict Orthodox rabbinical control over marriages. Today, however, as Israelis prepare for national elections on July 23, the parliamentary influence of religiously oriented voters, roughly 20 percent of the population, may be diluted. They will face options ranging from an Orthodox ultranationalist party to an ultra-Orthodox Sephardic party representing Jews from Moslem countries. The fragmenting of the two older parties resulted from changes in Israeli society after Israel occupied the biblical - and to some, sacred - territory of Judea and Samaria in the West Bank. Before 1967, the religious parties were organized on primarily defensive lines to protect their interests and maintain a framework of religious institutions that would hold out against assimilationist trends. The larger National Religious Party took part in almost every Labor Government, using its position to fight for issues such as kosher food for the army, religious schools and observance of Sabbath rules. Foreign policy, economics and ethnic questions were left to Labor. After 1967, however, the party addressed a whole new agenda. ''Its frame of reference became no longer defensive,'' said Rabbi David Hartman, an Israeli philosopher. ''It began to feel itself part of the larger national issues, (supporting) the new 'grandeur' of the Greater Israel.'' Religious parties became concerned ''not just with the number of synagogues,'' he said, ''but with how they could affect the larger drama.'' As long as the religous parties stuck to religion, they remained relatively united. But when they turned to issues such as the West Bank and ethnic politics, their internal consensus began to crumble. ''We were a pluralistic and heterogeneous party,'' said Yehuda Ben Meir, a National Religious Party leader. ''And our attempt to keep the doves and the hawks in the same movement became difficult.'' One split developed in 1981 over the Camp David accords. Some elements objected to provisions dealing with autonomy for Palestinians in the West Bank and the abandonment of Israeli settlements in the Sinai. They started what is now the Morasha party. The National Religious Party also insisted on holding on to Judea and Samaria, but not at all costs. Absorbing one million Arabs, it argued, would fundamentally affect the Jewish character of the state. Such sentiments, however, did not appeal to the younger generation who were educated in the party's own school system and have turned out to be much more religiously conservative and nationalistic than their elders. A second split was along ethnic lines. Roughly 70 percent of the support for the National Religious Party was believed to be based on Sephardic Jews, but they were more or less frozen out of the party leadership by their European-born colleagues. In 1981, a splinter faction led by Aharon Abuhatzeira and calling itself Tami, or the Movement for the Tradition, won three seats in Parliament. Lately, a similar trend has begun to take hold in the Agudat Yisrael, which is led by a Council of Torah Sages, all of whom are of Eastern European origin and who conduct their business in Yiddish. This European or Ashkenazi domination prompted some of the Sephardic rank and file to form a party in last year's Jerusalem municipal elections. Their success encouraged them to run for Parliament as the Shas, the Sephardic Torah Guardians Associations. The biggest challenge to the National Religious Party has come from the Likud Party under Menachem Begin and now, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. The Israeli pollster, Mena Zemach, found that Likud had become the most popular party among Israelis identifying themselves as Orthodox. This was partly because of Mr. Begin's religious aura, which Mr. Shamir has sometimes tried to cultivate; partly because of Likud's unequivocally hawkish views on security matters, and partly because it poured millions of shekels into religious institutions in a far more unrestrained fashion than Labor ever did. Labor's present leader Shimon Peres has made no special effort to attract religious voters. While the religious parties' strength in the next Parliament will probably remain roughly unchanged at 12 to 14 of the 120 seats, their influence is likely to be diluted by their differing objectives. The National Religious Party has been effectively playing on this theme, apparently trying to return to its roots as a party concerned with religious affairs. In television commercials headlined ''The Day After'' (the elections), it shows three doors to Government offices, all closed. A voice asks, ''Who will pursue the struggle for religious education, for the sanctity of the Sabbath and for religious legislation? To whom will you turn? To religious splinter parties powerless to help? No ifs or buts. A strong national religious movement is in your vital interest.''

568-> CYCLIST CALLS DRUG USE 'ERROR'
Alexi Grewal, the cyclist who has apparently lost his opportunity to compete in the Olympic Games, said today his positive drug test on Wednesday was the result of an innocent mistake. He said he would try to have his automatic 30-day suspension from international competition overturned. Mike Fraysse, the United States Olympic cycling manager, agreed that Grewal's transgression was unintentional, but added there was little chance that the International Cycling Federation would allow Grewal to compete in the Olympics. Fraysse, speaking by phone from Colorado Springs, said the apparently accidental nature of the violation would almost surely have no bearing. Won Trials in May The 23-year-old Grewal, from Aspen, Colo., won the series of trials in May to determine the United States road-racing team. He and the other Olympic road racers were competing this week in the nine-day Coors International Classic in Colorado, America's most important international road-racing competition for cyclists. Each day, the first two finishers, the series leader and two others chosen at random have undergone urinalysis to detect the presence of banned drugs. Grewal was tested in Denver by a Denver laboratory after he won Wednesday's 92-mile race. The United States Cycling Federation said ephedrine - one of the drugs on the long list of substances forbidden by the International Olympic Committee and the International Cycling Federation - was found in Grewal's sample. This stimulant is often present in over-the-counter remedies for colds and hay fever and in herbal teas. Grewal said that 15 minutes before Wednesday's race, Dia Lynn, a massage therapist who had been working with him, gave him an herbal capsule called Chi Power containing high- energy ingredients. ''She said it would help my energy level,'' said Grewal, speaking from his home in Aspen. ''The label said it contained three Chinese herbs, but it said nothing about ephedrine. She's pretty torn apart by all this. It was just fate, I guess, just a mistake.'' Because of the presence of a banned substance, the rules of the International Cycling Federation call for an automatic 30-day suspension. ''We feel is was accidental, absolutely,'' said Fraysse. ''He knew he was getting tested every day. He wasn't going to fool around with a local race when the Olympics were a week away and he had a good chance for a medal.'' Grewal said Eddy Borysewicz, the United States Olympic coach, would appeal to the United States Olympic Committee or the international federation. However, Fraysse said the international federation's rules make no provisions for an appeal. And even if the United States Olympic Committee certified Grewal to compete, the international federation could keep him out of the Olympics. The positive testing also eliminated Grewal from the Coors race, in which he was the overall leader. Traces of Ephedrine were also responsible for the disqualification of Rick DeMont at the 1972 Olympics in Munich. The 16-year-old swimmer had to return his gold medal in the 400-meter freestyle after taking medication, for an asthma condition, that he did not know was banned. Dedicated to Grewal BOULDER, Colo., July 20 (AP) - Chris Carmichael won the 92-mile eighth stage of the Coors classic today in 3 hours 39 minutes 42 seconds and afterward dedicated his victory to Grewal.

569-> NEW YORK DAY BY DAY; 9th Ave. Cornucopia
''My God, they're alive!'' exclamed one woman, bending over a crate of snails from Argentina at the Central Fish Market. The snails, along with other New York gastronomic curiousities, were being closely observed by a group of visiting amateur cooks from York, Pa. Students at the Bright Prospects Cooking School, the 39 women and 3 men were disgorged from a bus at 527 Ninth Avenue, their first stop. Later, they were to visit 14th Street, SoHo and Greenwich Village. In the bus were a dozen coolers for impromptu purchases. Jane Melton, one of the school's owners, bought olive oil and pasta and ''a special Greek honey that I've looked for for years.'' Her partner, Jean Yates, bought the same. The group, armed with shopping bags, next invaded the tiny International Grocery and Meat Market at 529 Ninth Avenue. The shop specializes in olives; pulses, or legume seeds, and herbs, and is run by a group of fatherly Greeks who measured out orders and commented volubly among themselves in their mother tongue. Meanwhile, several New York customers waited impatiently. ''Take it easy,'' Harry Pentaris, a salesman, advised in a pronounced accent. ''Be nice to foreigners.''

570-> California Ratings Are Seen in Peril
Bond ratings for California and 458 local governments in the state are threatened by a tax-limiting proposal known as Jarvis 4, according to analysts at Standard & Poor's. The initiative, which will be on the November ballot, would tighten the restrictions on state and local government taxes imposed by Proposition 13, which was approved in 1978. Major provisions of Jarvis 4, which analysts expect will be challenged in the courts if it is approved, would limit the ability of local governments to increase fees by more than the rise in the Consumer Price Index. It would further limit the ability of local governments to raise real estate taxes, and would require an estimated refund of $1.2 billion of some property taxes.

571-> COUNTRY-ROCK: BELLAMY BROTHERS
THE Bellamy Brothers, from Tampa, Fla., have established themselves in the last eight years as skillful practitioners of an easygoing country-rock that's very distinct in spirit from typical country music fare. Howard and David Bellamy's clean two-part vocal harmonies descend from the rustic fraternal tradition of the Louvins and the Everly Brothers. Not as twangy as their prototypes, the Bellamys project a more muscular rock-heavy sonority against the rolling ''bayou'' rock rhythms developed by Credence Clearwater Revival. At the Bottom Line on Wednesday, the duo, playing acoustic guitars and fronting a seven-man band, played a seamless set that included their signature song, ''Let Your Love Roll,'' among other hits. ''Reggae Cowboy,'' their country-reggae hybrid, smoothly incorporated Caribbean influences into their melodious down- home style, and ''If I Said You Had a Beautiful Body Would You Hold It Against Me'' sparkled with an earthy country wit. Along with tougher songs that showed the influence of Southern rock bands like the Allman Brothers, the set compiled a satisfying survey of homogenized Sunbelt musical styles.

572-> CURRENCY MARKETS ; Dollar Is Still Surging As Gold Prices Decline
The dollar resumed its record- breaking advance yesterday in foreign exchange trading in the United States, after hitting a new high in Europe against the French franc and a 10-year peak against the West German mark. Gold prices fell around the globe. The Republic National Bank in New York reported a late bid at $339.50 an ounce, down $7.50 from the previous day. Analysts attributed the dollar's rise to speculation that next week's report on United States economic growth will show continued robust expansion. Upward Pressure on Rates They said that would in turn suggest that upward pressure will continue on American interest rates, which would enhance the attractiveness of the dollar as an investment. ''The dollar was strong all day, largely due to expectations of higher interest rates,'' said Peter Rogers, assistant chief foreign exchange trader at the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation. The dollar began the trading day by falling to 243.40 yen in Tokyo, down from 243.60 yen on Thursday. But in later United States trading, the dollar rose to 245.40 yen from 243.225 yen. In Paris, the dollar hit a record high in Europe at 8.76625 French francs, compared with 8.7615 francs late Thursday. In Frankfurt, the dollar reached 2.8540 West German marks, up from 2.8480 marks Thursday, and its highest level in a decade. Some Gains by Pound In London, sterling gained against most currencies, bolstered by an agreement to end a 10-day longshoremen's strike. But the pound closed at $1.3240, unchanged from Thursday's rate. Later in the United States, the pound slipped to $1.3235 from $1.3268. Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with rates late Thursday, included: 2.41425 Swiss francs, up from 2.41225; 3.2220 Dutch guilders, up from 3.2200; 1,7540.00 Italian lire, down from a record 1,755.25, and 1.32805 Canadian dollars, down from 1.32895. Late dollar rates in the United States, compared with late rates Thursday, included: 2.8605 West German marks, up from 2.84875; 2.42475 Swiss francs, up from 2.4125; 8.7800 Franch francs, up from 8.7415, and 1.3268 Canadian dollars, down from 1.32875. Gold prices dropped in trading that dealers said was dominated by professional traders. Gold fell to $349.72 a troy ounce in Hong Kong, down from Thursday's $354.23. Nears Two-Year Lows In Europe, bullion approached the two-year lows of July 9, when it was quoted at a bid price of $339.50 a troy ounce in London and $338.50 in Zurich. In trading yesterday, it wound up $340.75 an ounce in London, compared with $351.25 late Thursday, and it fell to $342.50 an ounce in Zurich from Thursday's late bid of $350.50. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery fell $8 an ounce, to $339.30.

573-> DAILY NEWS CHOOSES EDITOR FROM PAPER IN PHILIDELPHIA
The editor of The Philadelphia Daily News, F. Gilman Spencer, yesterday was named editor of The Daily News in New York. He replaces James G. Wieghart, who will become a national political correspondent for the Scripps- Howard newspapers. The change, to take effect Sept. 1, was announced by the publisher of the New York paper, James F. Hoge. He had been interviewing possible sucessors to Mr. Wieghart since becoming publisher two months ago, but had consistently denied reports that Mr. Wieghart would be replaced. In Philadelphia, Mr. Spencer has directed a news staff of 165 at an afternoon tabloid with weekday sales of 300,000 copies and no substantial commercial competition. The Daily News and The Philadelphia Inquirer, a larger, morning paper, are both owned by the Knight-Ridder chain. In New York, Mr. Spencer will take over a morning tabloid with an editorial staff almost three times larger at a paper that has been losing economic ground in competition with city and suburban dailies. Two years ago, the Tribune Company tried to sell the New York paper and threatened to close it because of growing losses, but reconsidered after its unions agreed to economic concessions. Won Pulitzer in '74 Last year, the paper reported a $20 million profit, but new cost rises and circulation declines are threatening it with deficits this year, according to industry analysts. The News is the largest selling general-interest daily in the country, with a weekday average of 1,375,000 copies and Sunday sales of 1,814,000 for the six months that ended March 31. Both figures are down about 10 percent from a year earlier. Mr. Spencer, 58 years old, took the Philadelphia post in 1975, a year after winning a Pulitzer Prize for editorials he wrote for The Trentonian on New Jersey government scandals. ''Gil Spencer brings to The Daily News a thorough knowledge of metropolitan journalism and a courageous, compassionate concern for the interests of his readers,'' Mr. Hoge said in a statement. Washington Correspondent in 70's In a telephone interview, Mr. Spencer said he hoped to ''put out a very strong, hard-news oriented paper with enough fun in it to make it interesting both ways.'' Mr. Wieghart, 50, joined The Daily News in New York in 1969 as a Pentagon correspondent and became chief of the Washington bureau in 1975. Six years later, he came to New York as an assistant to Michael J. O'Neill, whom he replaced as editor in 1982. Mr. Wieghart's tenure was marked by editorial retrenchment mandated by the economic problems. Speaking from San Francisco, where he has been directing coverage of the Democratic National Convention for the Tribune newspapers, he said he was proud of efforts he began to provide more detailed neighborhood coverage and increased examination of city services.

574-> Chile Signs Loan Accord
Chile and its creditor banks signed a new $780 million credit facility for the Banco Central de Chile yesterday, the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company said as agent for the financing. The New York bank is also chairman of Chile's international bank advisory committee. The nine-year credit carries a five- year grace period and is priced at 1 1/2 percentage points over the United States prime rate or 1 3/4 points over the London interbank offered rate, at the lenders' option. Manufacturers Hanover said terms and tenor of the new loan represent a ''substantial improvement'' over a credit facility provided by Chile's international bank creditors in July 1983. That $1.3 billion, seven-year credit had a four-year grace period and carried terms of 2 1/4 points over the prime or 2 1/8 points over the London interbank rate.

575-> AROUND THE WORLD; Turkish 5-Year Plan Seeks Economic Growth
Parliament has approved a five- year economic plan designed to cut inflation, increase exports and prepare for full membership in the European Economic Community. The 1985-89 plan calls for growth in the gross national product of 5.3 percent in 1985, rising to 7.1 percent in 1989, as compared with a target of 4.7 percent this year. The plan, approved by a 203-to-153 vote in Parliament Friday night, also envisages transition to full convertibility of the Turkish lira by 1989. The plan, proposed by Prime Minister Turgut Ozal, is intended to prepare Turkey for full membership in the European Community but sets no date for an application. Turkey has been an associate member since 1963 and is entitled to apply for full membership.

577-> CHILDREN'S BOOKS
THE SELFISH GIANT By Oscar Wilde. Illustrated by Lisbeth Zwerger Alphabet Press. $11.95. (Ages 8 and up) WHEN Oscar Wilde was 'dying beyond his means,' he was received into the Roman Catholic church. Years before, his religious leanings surfaced in 'The Selfish Giant.' Lisbeth Zweger, an unusually gifted Viennese artist just turning 30, has chosen to illustrate Wilde's elusive short parable for her 10th published book. Like her other books, it is a rare accomplishement. And like the others, it is unlike the others. Marrying her own drawing to the style and spirit of 19th-century watercolorists, she approaches Wilde's tale from a series of angles. On an opening right-hand page, three barefoot children tread a diagonal toward the bright ground of the Giant's garden. Turn the page, and the Giant enters from a new direction. 'He had been to visit his friend the Cornish ogre... After the seven years were over he had said all that he had to say, for his conversation was limited, and he determined to return to his own castle. When he arrived he saw the children playing in the garden.' A tall, tight-lipped man wearing a muffler and pants that are too short, he comes down the barely indicated street carrying his luggage and one little package labeled 'Souvenir from Cornwall.' A mother hurries her two children off before him. Their costumes, byu Mary Cassatt, are bleached pale in the early spring light that suffuses all these pictures. By the way the players are dressed we know these are olden times, and because children always had trouble with giants in olden times, we are ready for the next step - a confrontation. The selfish Giant turns the children out of their Eden. 'My garden is my own garden' he says, 'I will allow nobody to play in it but myself.' As a result, Spring is annoyed and refuses to enter the Giant's garden until the children can sneak back, bringing birdss and flowers with them. It is then that a very small boy wins the Giant's heart, and it becomes evident that Wilde had something more in mind than a Giant-versus-the-children tale. Sentimentality has been the downfall of wit before. In this case the author suddenly reveals the very small boy to be th Christ Child. Although the other children continue to visit the garden, the Giant longs for his tiny friend, who has departed as mysteriously as he came. Time passes; the Child reappears to say to the now aged Giant, 'You let me play once in your garden, today you shall come with me to my garden, which is Paradise.' This is followed by the last two lines: 'And when the children ran in that afternoon, they found the Giant lying dead under the tree, all covered with white blossoms.' Such imagery might tempt a lesser illustrator than Miss Zwerger to stray from her gracefully oblique way into excessive sweetness or overattention to detail. Knowing what to leave out is as integral to art as knowing what to put in: 'For on the palms of the child's hands were the prints of two nails, and the prints of two nails were on the little feet.' But confronted with these wounds, the artist wisely leaves them to our imagination. Her Christ Child in his short pants and school smock is a boy like the others, while like the Giant slightly smiling in death, might simply be an old man asleep. Having set her course from the beginning, the artist has continued, through 11 lovely watercolors, to illuminate the spirit of this fable rather than hem herself in by a literal depiction of the action. The lightness of her sepia line and subtle palette bring an understated, almost oriental discipline to the pale pages. This does not prevent her form reflecting Wilde's touches of humor. She ahs a wonderful sense of what to illustrate. In a flowing and funny, light sketched painting the Snow covers 'up the grass with her great white cloak' as the North Wind 'blew the chimney pots down.' They swoop about their wintry work, two eccentric Victorians in voluminous white. Miss Zwerger's style in this tale is closest to her work for O. Henry's 'The Gift of the Magi' (1982). Set in the same period, it uses a similar penstroke, echoed and amended by a ghostly pencil line. This is a very different look from the darktoned theatricality of her earliest books. It is different, too, from the beautifully controlled, imagintive interpretations of Grimm and Andersen tales that she began to do around 1980. With each new project she shapes her talent ot serve the words rather than use them simply as a showcase. Speaking of a favorite English illustrator, she has commented on finding 'the perfect balance literature and art are capable of reacing.' That is a balance found by very few of the very best illustrative artists. Lisbeth Zwerger is already among them. The pleasure in seeing what she has achieved is heightened by anticipation of all she has yet to do.

578-> CANALSIDE HOSPITALITY
The Pulitzer is certainly not the grandest hotel in Amsterdam - the Amstel's claim to that title rests unchallenged - nor is it the most expensive. I would never recommend it to travelers who demand the ne plus ultra in luxury and the vicarious esteem that comes from knowing that Arab potentates and media-celebrated plutocrats are sleeping under the same roof. Among other insufficiencies, the hotel does not offer 24-hour room service and the staff lacks training in bowing and scraping. The bellhops welcome guests as long-lost relatives, the waiters treat them in an egalitarian manner. MARYLIN BENDER writes on business from New York. The Pulitzer is an acquired taste, its reputation based on word-of-mouth from international business people, artists and collectors seeking privacy with convenience, and from visitors like myself who appreciate a hotel that enunciates the spirit of its locale. In Amsterdam, this dictates a presence on a canal and immersion in the 17th century, Holland's Golden Age of mercantile and artistic authority. The Pulitzer is totally satisfying in both respects, as well as in providing 20th-century creature comforts such as state-of-the-art plumbing. The peal of the carillon of the Westerkerk, the neighboring church in which Rembrandt is buried, reaches the guest reclining on one of the hotel's spacious beds watching American films on closed-circuit television. The Pultizer endears itself by its location. It nestles unobstrusively between two of Amsterdam's four concentric canals, slightly removed from the commotion at the Dam Square, the city's hub. The main entrance on the Prinsengracht, Prince's Canal, would be easily ignored were it not for a discreet sign above the small dock. And even after 10 years of settling in at the Pulitzer on annual visits to Holland, I was astonished to learn that my charming little Dutch home away from home had 194 rooms. A prize example of faithful historic preservation for contemporary use, a strategy in which the Dutch excel, the Pulitzer is a complex of 19 buildings constructed from the early 1600's to the mid-1700's as merchants' dwellings, storehouses and shops. Part of the fun for this New Yorker is in fantasizing about which friendly ghost (perhaps one bearing a familiar name like van Rensselaer or van Roosevelt) inhabits the room to which I have been assigned. No two rooms are identical although the prevailing decor is sophisticated rustic with an abundance of wicker, printed cotton and exposed brick walls. Vital clues lie within the wooden ceiling beams. Natural beams indicate the space was originally a warehouse (another way of telling is from the wooden shutters outside the windows). Painted beams attest a former residence, a merchant's house or one of the garden houses built behind them for weekend entertaining. ''I might just as well be at a Holiday Inn. The beams in my room are painted,'' an American guest complained to Theo Inniger, the manager. ''Knock on one of them. I'll bet you they're all real,'' he rejoined. To comply with stringent requirements of the municipal landmark officials, bricks and beams had to be numbered before dismantling during the restoration project that produced the hotel. The length and width of beams governed the size of the new rooms. Some are cozy chambers presumed to have been servants' quarters. Others have ceilings lofty enough to accommodate sleeping balconies (former storerooms for cargo from the Dutch East Indies, no doubt). Two expansive rooms in a suite are connected by stairs because they were in different houses. Commuting between one's room and the public areas of the hotel is a journey up and down steps and winding hallways that begins after leaving one of the elevators that serve different wings. (Invariably it takes me a day or two to navigate without getting lost on the first approach.) Regretfully I have discouraged elderly and infirm friends from staying at the hotel. A ceramic plaque emblazoned with a marigold to the right of the entrance indicates that the lobby stands on the site of the Goudsbloem brewery and an adjoining house built in 1616. Subsequently, these were converted to a sugar refinery and then to a stable that supplied the livery for Prince William of Orange to enter the capital on Dec. 2, 1813, proclaiming the liberation of Holland from Napoleonic rule. The rear entrance of the hotel is at Keizersgracht 236, a former merchant's house built in 1620, the year the Pilgrims set sail from Holland for the New World. The address now heralds the Pulitzer Bar, one of Amsterdam's toniest. Jerry, the bartender, regulates the convivial atmosphere in four languages. The coffee shop and the restaurant occupy houses on Reestraat, a narrow street of shops that lies between the canals. The front of the restaurant was once a pharmacy, its Corinthian wood columns painted to look like marble. The courtyard between the shop and a garden house has been covered with glass to create a greenhouse dining area. Breakfast is served on the second floor, once the shopkeeper's living quarters. The windows list to starboard, another concession to authenticity. A serpentine, glass-enclosed corridor with gardens on either side connects the Keizersgracht and Prinsengracht buildings and also serves as a gallery for the works of young Dutch artists. Mr. Inniger is enthusiastic about contemporary visual art and classical music. Room 863 has a Bechstein grand piano, a courtesy for guests who need to practice before performing at the Concertgebouw. In July, the hotel sponsors a free open- air concert. The piano is hoisted down and placed on a stage formed by three barges linked to the dock in the Prince's Canal. The hoist-beam is characteristic of the 17th-century canal houses, which were constructed four and five stories high on such narrow plots of land (20 feet wide on the Prince's and Emperor's canals, several feet less on the Reestraat) that rope and pulley were the only feasible means of hauling in the goods and furniture delivered by boat. The beams extend from gables that conceal the slate roofs and lend majesty to the row houses of mellow, colored brick. The names of the gables derive from their shapes. Spout gables, which look like inverted funnels, rise above the twin warehouses on either side of the hotel entrance on the Prinsengracht. Bell gables, such as adorn the corner building that houses the coffee shop, and neck gables, like the one atop the merchant's house at Keizersgracht 230, the hotel's executive offices, tend to be elaborately decorated with plumes and shell motifs. No. 232, we are told, originally had a similar topping. Its gray sandstone facade with wrought-iron trimming was imposed in 1905, a fine example of Jugendstil, the Teutonic Art Nouveau. A reclining deer on one of the Reestraat houses testifies to the trade of a former owner, a leather craftsman. After World War II, the houses on the Prinsengracht were assembled into a warehouse for a light-bulb manufacturer. In 1968, Peter Pulitzer, a businessman from Palm Beach, Fla. arrived in Amsterdam looking for a canal site on which to build a flagship hotel for the Howard Johnson European franchise he had obtained. Advised by Bart van Kasteel, an architect with expertise in renovating historic properties that this one could be converted into a modern hotel, Mr. Pulitzer bought the warehouse, and the challenging process of restorative conversion began. The hotel opened in 1970 but the image of fast food by the roadside proved a handicap in attracting customers for a first-class inn. Two years later, after a reshuffling of interests in which Howard Johnson withdrew, the hotel was rechristened. Reluctantly, Mr. Pulitzer consented to the use of his family name, which his advisers thought had a fittingly European sound. Since only one-fourth of the clientele is American, not too many guests associate the hotel with his great- grandfather, the Hungarian-born American newspaper publisher, Joseph Pulitzer. Peter Pulitzer is the majority owner of the hotel. Joseph Dryer, a Palm Beach stockbroker, holds a 15 percent interest, and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines the remaining 25 percent share. The hotel is operated by Pulitzer Management Inc. and tied in to KLM's Golden Tulip Hotels worldwide reservation system. (To reach the reservation system call 212- 247-7950 or, outside New York City, call 800-344-1212. The hotel's local telephone number in Amsterdam is 020-228.333, its address, Prinsengracht 315-331.) Rates range from $88 for a double room to $215 for a two- room suite. (All rooms have private baths.) A hearty Dutch breakfast consisting of fruit juice, bread, cold meat and cheese and beverages is $5; an American breakfast that adds eggs, bacon, sausage, cereal and fruit compote to the Dutch menu is $6.25. In the Netherlands, service and taxes are included in hotel and restaurant prices but it is customary to leave small change for the waiter or a guilder (worth 33 cents) or two for commendable service. At the Goudsbloem restaurant, a three-course dinner along the lines of nouvelle cuisine costs from $23 to $33 without wine. The Golden Tulip coffee shop offers a limited menu consisting of well-prepared basics like poached salmon and entrec^ote, $10 each, and hearty Dutch staples such as pea soup, $2, and a trencherman's sandwich, $2.50. Within a short distance of the hotel are several ''brown cafes'' or kroegjes, the Amsterdam institution of a neighborhood bar, noted for lively ambience with a murky decor. On the Prinsengracht, De Eland at No. 296, De Pieper at No. 424, Le Maxim at Leidsekruisstraat 35 and Cab Kaye's Jazz at Beulingstraat 9 are kroegjes with live piano music. Also in the vicinity of the Pulitzer are restaurants with thoroughly Dutch atmosphere and cooking like De Admiraal in a former distillery at Herengracht 319, telephone 254.344 ($33 for a meal for two), Dorrius at Nieuwe Zijds Voorburgwal 338, telephone 325.675 ($25 for two) and Sama Sebo for Indonesian specialties at P. C. Hooftstraat 27, near the Rijksmuseum, telephone 728.146 ($30 for rijsttafel for two).

580-> AROUND THE WORLD; Members of Opposition Are Arrested in Seoul
Nine members of a new opposition political group were detained by the police Friday night as they tried to set up headquarters at a downtown office building, witnesses said today. Members of the group, the Council for Democratization, which opposes authoritarian rule here, found elevators stopped and stairways blocked when they tried to move into a rented office, witnesses said. The Government and the police declined to comment. The police took nine council members to a police station, then told all but one today that they could leave, the witnesses said. Because of the one detention, five council members refused to leave, the witnesses said. Members of the group, announcing its formation May 18, said it would ''continue a struggle for democratization.''

581-> BATTER GETS A BIRD, FIELDER GETS THE BALL
With one out in the fifth inning of the second game of a double- header victory by the Oakland A's over the Milwaukee Brewers Friday night, Rickey Henderson of the A's hit a routine fly ball to center field. Rick Manning positioned himself under the ball and was ready to make the catch, when the ball hit a bird. Although the ball changed course, Manning made the catch. The bird, later identified as a night hawk, landed 20 yards behind him. ''It's the strangest thing I've ever seen,'' Manning said. ''You can play baseball in a bird cage and never hit the bird.'' Manning, who found a feather lodged in the ball, said the bird was at fault. ''It was a dumb bird. He flew into the ball as it was coming down,'' Manning said. ''I was camped under the ball, and when the bird hit it I had to change direction. The bird looked to be O.K., but then it took a nosedive. I should have let the ball go and caught the bird.'' Winfield Incident Recalled The scene was reminiscent of an incident in Toronto last year, when Dave Winfield of the Yankees threw a practice ball toward the dugout, accidentally hit a sea gull and killed it, then was booked after the game for killing a protected species in Canada. ''Everyone in the dugout was reminding me of Winfield,'' Henderson said. ''Then when I went back out to the field the fans were flapping their arms and calling me a killer.'' Bill LaMacchia, the ballboy down the left-field line, wound up disposing of the bird. ''To show some respect for it, I put my cap over it. I put it behind the center- field fence near the bullpen, where someone from the grounds crew said he would take care of it.''

584-> City Blood Supply Dwindling To Perilous Low, Center Says
Blood supplies in New York City are reaching dangerously low levels as donations dwindle, a spokesman for the New York Blood Center said yesterday. Its blood program needs about 2,200 donors a day to meet the demands of city hospitals, but on Saturday there were only 24 donors, said a spokesman, Greg McGregor. He said the usual summer shortage was compounded last week by the holiday and the bad weather. As a result, he said, deliveries of most blood types have been reduced by half. Supplies of three blood types - O negative, B negative and A negative - are so depleted that they are being given only to patients whose lives are endangered. Mr. McGregor said the need for O negative was most acute. Anyone who wishes to donate blood may call the blood program at (212) 570-3158.

585-> ART; MONOTYPE SERIES IN KATONAH
A MONOTYPE is a unique image obtained by pressing paper to a flat smooth surface on which shapes have been inked or painted. A second ''pull'' is sometimes possible and additions to the prints by hand are common, but basically the process is a one-shot printing deal that does not require the expertise necessary for, say, lithography or etching. Just the same, the ministrations of a professional printer enhance monotypes immeasurably and, bearing witness to this, are 28 handsome specimens done by Helen Frankenthaler at San Francisco's Experimental Workshop and on view at the Katonah Gallery (28 Bedford Road, Katonah, through Aug. 19). Enjoying its share of attention in the general resurgence of printmaking, the monotype has a history that abounds in illustrious names, beginning with the 17th-century Genoese painter, Giovanni Castiglione, and coninuing with William Blake, Degas, Matisse, Picasso, Miro and others. Fewer automatists have been attracted to the medium than might be expected, given its impromptu character, but Robert Motherwell and Sam Francis are among those who have made substantial contributions and, currently, so is Miss Frankenthaler. Produced in 1982 during a four-day stay at the workshop, the prints, called ''The Bay Area Series,'' are very much of a piece with the artist's painting. But in their color and flair they seem closer to her earlier canvases - ''chromatic vapors,'' one art historian called those previous ones - than the more somber pieces she has produced in recent years. The images come in sets according to the day on which they were made, with the first consisting of washes in pigeon grays laid usually over cerulean and touched here and there with red. The second group explores yellows and orange, accented at times with blots of red, the third greens modified by red or ocher and the last is a climactic explosion of scarlet. Variously opaque, transparent, mottled and grainy but always liquid- looking, the colors are given structure by small indentations and protuberances distributed across the images' lower halves. These were effected by irregularly shaped bits of rubber laid above or below the paper and run with it through the press. Whether painted or left white, these ''interruptions'' (most are indentations) look like small islands in a sea and, in fact, the largest of them - measuring two or three inches across - somewhat resembles Australia in outline. Needless to say, the effect is stunning. All the expertise accumulated during about 30 years of devotion to large canvases has been compressed into these small spaces, with the result that the sensory impact is often greater than that normally delivered by the paintings. Even so, Mrs. Frankenthaler's ''currents'' of color remain as soigne as ever (which to this observer is sometimes too soigne), evoking the Color Field School of which she was a catalyst, though not a member. It is worth considering once again her painting, ''Mountains and Sea,'' which inspired the Color-Fielders-to- be Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland. A cluster of small shapes in muted colors made by pouring paint onto unprimed canvas, it was done four years before Jackson Pollock died, in 1956, and it continued the trail he blazed. Much has been made of this work because the forms impregnate the ground instead of reposing on it, but in retrospect it looks closer to Pollock's art than to anything produced by the movement it helped precipitate a few years later. Mainly this is because Miss Frankenthaler, then in her late 20's, was working in oils and the vehicle leaching into the unprimed canvas created aureoles around the colors, giving a very handmade look. It took the more mechanical washes of acrylic - which is more easily diluted, leaves no oily residue and imparts a decorator's quality to some hues - to establish the character of Color Field art. As soon as she herself changed to this medium, the artist acquired some of this character while retaining the gestural style of Abstract Expressionism, if none of its angst. Despite their implications of greater thoughtfulness and intensity, the monotypes bear out the conclusion reached by the critic Hilton Kramer in 1969 that Miss Frankenthaler was fundamentally a ''lyric landscapist.'' A note about the small exhibitions by two of the gallery's member artists, Helen Plowden and Beth Moffitt, both of which remain through Aug. 5. A painter of white clapboard houses, gardens, still lifes involving white dresses and, occasionally, of figures, Miss Plowden has been profoundly affected by Andrew Wyeth. But she is at the same time something of a na"if, hence scenes that in her mentor's hands would be celebrations of rural aristrocracy are in hers ruminations on loss and loneliness. Painted with great care, they are sad pictures that often have an unnerving stillness about them. An exception is ''Tea Time,'' where wind (or a ghost) is ruffling the cloth of a garden table set with a vase of flowers and accompanied by wicker chairs and, on the grass, a woman's hat. Beth Moffitt's chief motif is a disk composed of dots in prismatic colors. In this respect, she resembles Sally Hazelet Drummond, except that her marks are larger than Drummond's and not as tightly packed. The dots are well organized with respect to their tones, but Miss Moffitt seems to lack the obsessiveness that Pointillism demands. She is in any case more effective in some smaller works on tinted paper where tiny strokes, again in prismatic hues, wander across the page in irregular bands.

588-> SOUTHCOM GAME
President Reagan is eager, in this campaign season, to convince American voters that he has turned over a new, more moderate and conciliatory leaf in his policy toward Central America. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, the Administration's tactical maneuvering makes little difference, for our Central America policy has taken on a bureaucratic momentum of its own. Unless that momemtum is checked, it will make the debate over our policy in the region largely academic and may in the end lead to direct military involvement. Congressional skepticism about the Administration's policy was sharply reduced this summer by election re sults in El Salvador and Guatemala. Yet recent disclosures that the Pentagon is drawing up contingency plans for United States air strikes against Salvadoran guerrillas says more about our policy in Central America than any images of moderation. The hard truth is that the institutions most involved in implementing United States policy are the Pentagon and Central Intelligence Agency, while the role of the State Department has steadily shrunk as the Administration has turned away from serious diplomacy in the region. This is a dramatic turnaround from the Carter years, when military and economic aid to Central America was minuscule and the Pentagon was but a minor actor in the shaping of policy. Today, the State Department has been largely cut out of the conduct of policy toward Central America. Instead, the main players are the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, Fred C. Ikle, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Inter-American Affairs, Nestor D. Sanchez, the C.I.A., and Gen. Paul E. Gorman, chief of Southern Command, or Southcom, headquartered in Panama. How has this happened? One of the main causes is the skyrocketing increase in United States military aid to the region. In the past three years, the C.I.A. has spent at least $75 million in covert support for the contras, or counterrevolutionaries, seeking to oust the Sandinista regime. The Administration's request for $243 million in military aid for El Salvador for fiscal 1984 is a 4,000 percent increase over the $5.9 million granted to that country in fiscal 1980. Similarly, its request for military aid to Honduras for 1985 amounts to 1,000 percent more than that country received in all four years of the Carter Administration. Even in Costa Rica, which has only a police force and no army, military aid has jumped from $35,000 during the last year of the Carter Administration to the $10 million requested for fiscal 1985. Beyond these figures is the burgeoning United States military and paramilitary involvement in the region. Southcom, until recently viewed in the Pentagon as a sleepy backwater, has become the hub of the kind of controversial activity known in the Pentagon as ''low-intensity conflict'' - in effect, undeclared war. Military exercises in Honduras have meant a constant military presence in the region and allowed us to build some half dozen air bases, radar stations, storage bunkers and base camps. These facilities, which would provide a system of forward bases if the United States intervened directly, have already been used to fly reconnaissance for Salvadoran forces and provide support for the contras. The growing mission in Central America has also seen the expansion of elite special forces in each branch of the military. A number of the new special forces, such as the Army's Intelligence Support Activity, were formed to combat terrorism, but they have put to other uses and many now operate closely with the C.I.A. in its varied covert operations in Central America. As was the case in Vietnam, this incremental expansion of paramilitary involvement has its own dangerous momentum. In Central American, as in Vietnam, military aid and paramilitary operations can for a time help us avoid direct intervention. The danger, of course, is that such indirect involvement will eventually lead to the commitment of troops. Meanwhile, a military approach does nothing to address the root causes of the Central American crisis, and in the end it can only heighten the conflict. It promises to further polarize the region and lead eventually to the very radical victories Mr. Reagan seeks to prevent. It took a hopelessly deteriorating situation on the ground and widespread popular opposition to force the executive branch to end the war in Vietnam. Similiarly, in Central America, Congress cannot hope to limit our involvement by ''nickle and diming'' here and there in response to the Administration's requests for military aid. If we really want to alter course, we must do something to reverse the building military momentum.

589-> CAMPAIGN NOTES; Hooks Seeks a Meeting To Ease Racial Tension
The executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People says members of his organization will seek to meet with Jewish groups to ease tensions that he believes may threaten the Democratic Party's chances of defeating President Reagan. The director, Benjamin L. Hooks, said Thursday that black leaders would meet with ''Jewish organizations to soothe the strained relations that have erupted over the past several years in the black-Jewish fabric.'' No date has been set for the meeting. The rift between black and Jewish leaders has widened since statements by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, a Democratic Presidential candidate, and the Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, a Jackson supporter. Mr. Hooks urged all ethnic groups to unite behind the Democratic ticket. He praised Walter F. Mondale's selection of Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro as his running mate.

590-> OLYMPIC HIGHLIGHTS
Mark Breland and Carl Lewis, who will be able to turn gold into millions, paced impressive performances as the nearly all-American Games of the XXIII Olympiad neared their conclusion. BOXING With the powerful Cuban team among those who didn't attend, the United States figured to dominate the boxing as no team in history. The Americans won nine gold medals - breaking Cuba's record of six at the 1980 Games boycotted by the United States - and one silver and one bronze in the 12 divisions. Breland, the 147-pound amateur champion from Brooklyn who could earn $250,000 in his first pro fight later this year, had no trouble in winning a unanimous decision over the outclassed An Young Su of South Korea. Two of the victories were upsets of Canadians - Henry Tillman over Willie deWit in the 201-pound division and Frank Tate over Shawn O'Sullivan at 156. The first American gold went to Paul Gonzales of East Los Angeles when his 106-pound opponent, Salvatore Todisco of Italy, had to withdraw because of a broken thumb. Pernell Whitaker of Norfolk, Va., took the gold in the 132-pound class with a second-round stoppage of Luis Ortiz of Puerto Rico. Steve McCrory (112 pounds), Meldrick Taylor (125), Jerry Page (139) and Tyrell Biggs (superheavyweight) won on points. Virgil Hill of Williston, N.D., rallied late, but lost a 3-2 decision to Shin Joon Sup of South Korea in the 165-pound division. TRACK AND FIELDLewis, matching Jesse Owens's 1936 performance, gained his fourth gold medal by anchoring the United States 400-meter relay team to an easy victory in 37.83 seconds, the first world record set in track and field at these Games. Sam Graddy, Ron Brown and Calvin Smith preceded Lewis in the relay. Valerie Brisco-Hooks won her third gold medal as part of the American women's 1,600-meter relay team. Chandra Cheeseborough, who anchored that quartet to an Olympic record, won her second gold medal in an hour. Earlier, she was part of the winning 400-meter relay team on which Evelyn Ashford, the women's 100-meter champion, earned her second gold. With Alonzo Babers and Antonio McKay running strongly at the end of the men's 1,600-meter race, the United States swept the relays. Visitors did well in individual events. Sebastian Coe and Steve Cram gave Britain a 1,2 finish in the men's 1,500 meters; Dietmar M"ogenburg of West Germany won the men's high jump, Alessandro Andrei of Italy the shot put and Said Aouita of Morocco the 5,000-meter run. Ria Stalman of the Netherlands won the women's discus on her final throw, and Gabriella Dorio of Italy won the women's 1,500-meter run. FREESTYLE WRESTLING Proving that gold has a sibling lining, Mark Schultz and Lou Banach, whose brothers earlier won titles, brought the United States total of gold medals to seven. DIVING Greg Louganis of Mission Viejo, Calif., the winner of the springboard competition, scored a record 688.05 points in the six optional dives and took the lead from Bruce Kimball of Ann Arbor, Mich., in the 10-meter platform event. VOLLEYBALL The United States men's team, routed by Brazil in the preliminary round, defeated the South Americans in straight games to win the gold medal. ARCHERY Darrell Pace of Hamilton, Ohio, broke his Olympic record in leading a 1,2 American finish.

592-> Flag Owner Still Mystery
After Carl Lewis won the gold medal Saturday night in the Olympic 100-meter dash, he grabbed an American flag from a spectator, ran with it, then returned it. That much is known. The identity of the spectator remains a mystery. The Los Angeles Times identified the man as 50-year-old Paul Tucker of New Orleans. According to the newspaper, Tucker said he was waving the flag and Lewis, seeming to be looking into the crowd for one to borrow, went over and took it. The Associated Press reported that the flag had been given to Lewis by Clyde Duncan, his former sprint coach at the University of Houston. A source close to the United States Olympic Committee also said that Duncan had been involved. Lewis, who would know the answer, was unavailable for comment. As he has often done in the past, he is not appearing at news conferences until the meet is over. His postcompetition comments have been furnished by a press aide working for the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee.

594-> OILERS BEAT JETS, 36-17; WARD SPRAINS RIGHT ANKLE
Bad luck and bad play continued to plague the Jets tonight, as they lost their second consecutive exhibition game and the services, at least for a short time, of another key player. Chris Ward, the left tackle, sprained his right ankle on the Jets' second offensive play of a 36-17 loss to the Houston Oilers in the Astrodome and was unable to return. The ankle was wrapped in ice, and Ward was taken to the dressing room, where X-rays were taken. They did not reveal any broken bones, but it could not be immediately determined how much time Ward might miss. Frank Ramos, a team spokesman, said that Ward's availability would depend on how much the swelling subsides; the problem may be exacerbated by Ward's weight. He reported to camp in July weighing 298 pounds. He was down to 285 for tonight's game but last year he played at about 275. Giants Scheduled Next The Jets, who have 86 players on the roster, are next scheduled to play the Giants, Saturday night at Giants Stadium. The rosters of all National Football League teams must be reduced to 70 players by 4 P.M. Tuesday. Though Ward's injury was not so severe as the broken collarbone suffered by the wide receiver Johnny (Lam) Jones in the Jets' 22-15 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals last week, Ward was lucky in at least one other respect: He missed much of what was to follow. By the half, what was left of the Jets' starting offensive unit had clearly showed that it needed more work and polish before the start of the regular season, Sept. 2. Ken O'Brien, the rookie quarterback making his second start, looked shaky and uncertain, as the offense produced only 86 yards under his command. With the left guard Reggie McElroy taking Ward's position and Stan Waldemore in McElroy's, O'Brien completed only 8 of 16 passes for 62 yards. He was sacked six times. He suffered one interception. The Jets lost the ball on two fumbles. (They lost another fumble on a kickoff return). And the Oilers, a 2-14 team last season, led, 23-3, with two quarters to play. Too Many Turnovers ''You can't win when you turn the ball over with three fumbles and an interception,'' said Joe Walton, the Jets' coach. ''We have to get working harder on pass protection, but it's not always the line's fault. Sometimes the backs do not pick up the blitz, and sometimes the quarterback doesn't get rid of the ball.'' O'Brien said: ''It's quite obvious I still have a lot to learn. I made similar mistakes to the ones I made last week. I have to go back to work and continue to get a better grasp of our offense. From the first play on, everything seemed to go wrong.'' The Jets' starting defensive unit didn't look much better, although it was without the defensive end Joe Klecko, who has a pulled muscle in his abdomen. Warren Moon, the former Canadian Footall League quarterback, beginning his first N.F.L. season, played the first half and completed 9 of 18 passes for 146 yards and one touchdown, a 61-yard pass play to Eric Mullins. Liberal Substitution Both teams substituted liberally in the second half. Walton, who had said earlier in the week that O'Brien would play at least three quarters, replaced him at the start of the second half with Pat Ryan. But Ryan, the seven-year veteran, lasted only 11 plays. After driving the Jets 75 yards for a touchdown, a 1-yard run by the rookie fullback Tony Paige, on his first series, he suffered a pinched nerve in his neck - not a serious injury - as he was sacked by the linebacker Johnny Meads. Ryan had completed 3 of 4 passes for 45 yards. That brought O'Brien back, with 7 minutes 34 seconds to go in the third quarter, but the results were scarcely better. By the end of the game, he had completed 17 of 30 passes for 207 yards and one touchdown, a 40-yard pass to the rookie tight end Glenn Dennison late in the fourth quarter. Altogether, he was sacked eight times for a loss of 46 yards. Last week, in three quarters of play, he had completed 14 of 27 passes for 166 yards and no interceptions. Receivers Not Open Much of O'Brien's early problems emanated from his receivers' inability to get open and his line's inability to give him more time. With Jones injured, Wesley Walker's holdout now into a 23d day, and Harold Carmichael, the former Philadelphia Eagles receiver not due to report to the Jets until Sunday, Derrick Gaffney and Bobby Humphery started the game. But Gaffney only caught three balls, for 19 yards, and Humphery two, for 14.

595-> HANDBALL ; ; Denmark Defeats U.S.
Undefeated Denmark, led by Klaus Sletting Jensen's 6 goals, beat the United States team handball squad, 19-16, Saturday night in Olympic round-robin competition. The Americans do not have a victory. Denmark lifted its record to 3-0 and is tied with West Germany for first place in the 12-team Group B division. The United States team trailed Denmark by 8-7 at the intermission, then scored the first two goals of the second half for a 9-8 lead with 26 minutes left in the game. Denmark responded with 4 goals for a 12-9 lead with 19:37 left, and the United States never again drew within 2 goals. Peter Lash scored 4 times, and James Johann Buehning added 3 goals for the United States team, which has lost all three of its games. Earlier, Vasile Stinga scored 8 goals Saturday night to lead Rumania to a convincing 23-17 team handball victory over Switzerland. The victory gave the Rumanians (3-0) the lead in Group A. Rumania plays Yugoslavia (2-0-1) Wednesday. Stinga and Maricel Voinea combined for 9 goals in the first half as Rumania built a 13-9 lead.

596-> NO ABORTIONS ABROAD FINANCED BY U.S. AID
To the Editor: As a former Ambassador to Indonesia and chairman of the National Security Council's Task Force on World Population in the Ford Administration, I applaud your recent editorial ''Get Serious About Population.'' Abortion is in no sense part of U.S. population assistance programs. Ever since 1973, the Foreign Assistance Act has prohibited A.I.D. expenditures for abortion, and repeated audits have confirmed compliance with this restriction. Similar statutory restrictions against coercion have also been strictly upheld. Meanwhile, there continues to be a verifiable explosion of people in the developing world. This is contributing to poverty, malnutrition and human misery, as well as to rising levels of unemployment, landlessness and the forced migration of masses of people to already overcrowded cities whose slum areas are, in many cases, scenes of frustration that are exploitable by extremists. It is little wonder that leaders throughout the world are anxious to get on with the difficult task of dealing effectively and humanely with the population explosion. Opposing these efforts renders no service to humanity. MARSHALL GREEN Washington, April 18, 1984

597-> AROUND THE WORLD; Violence in Ulster Marks Anniversary of '81 Fast
Youths hurled stones, gasoline bombs and bottles at the police early today in several Northern Ireland cities on the third anniversary of the death of Robert Sands, an Irish Republican Army hunger striker. Four police officers and three youths were hurt and two were arrested in several hours of disturbances in Portadown, Newry in County Down, Londonderry and Belfast, the police reported. Mr. Sands, a convicted Irish Republican Army guerrilla who had been elected a member of the British Parliament, died May 5, 1981, in the 66th day of a hunger strike in the Maze prison near Belfast. He was one of 10 guerrillas to die from fasting in an unsuccessful bid for British recognition as political prisoners.

Self-Made Hero The Olympics had ended, but the call to glory still hung in the Los Angeles air last week. And one who heard it apparently contrived his own event in a bid for a bit of adulation. Police officer James W. Peterson , was first hailed by his superiors as a ''real hero'' after he claimed to have discovered and defused a bomb planted aboard a Turkish Olympic team bus. However, the higher-ups thought they detected inconsistencies in Mr. Peterson's account. Under questioning, he reportedly admitted making and planting the device to draw attention to himself. Mr. Peterson, who had been commended for bravery on several previous occasions, was charged with reckless possession of a destructive device. Conviction carries a mandatory prison sentence of up to six years.

601-> FERRARO SAYS REAGAN WOULD RAISES TAXES IN A SECOND TERM
Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro charged today that President Reagan's declaration that he had no plan to raise taxes amounted to a campaign promise he would break if re-elected. As Mrs. Ferraro spent a relaxed weekend at her vacation home here on the western end of Fire Island, she took time out to comment on politics. ''I just hope the American voter does not forget the promises that Ronald Reagan made in 1980,'' the Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate said before riding her bicycle home after morning mass at Our Lady Star of the Sea. She recalled: ''He said he was going to reduce Government spending, which he has not; that he was going to make this Government more secure, which it is not; going to give us a balanced budget by 1983, which he did not; and a surplus of $93 billion by 1984 which does not exist.'' Reply to Reagan Broadcast Mrs. Ferraro's impromptu remarks to reporters were in response to statements Mr. Reagan made in a paid, political radio address Saturday. The President said Saturday that he would veto any income tax rise and asserted that the Administration had no plan to raise taxes as the Democratic Presidential nominee, Walter F. Mondale, has contended. Mrs. Ferraro, reiterating a theme that Mr. Mondale first enunciated in his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention, said they were being ''honest and realistic with the American public.'' The two Democratic candidates have said that, if elected, a Mondale Administration would raise taxes to reduce the Federal deficit. The Vice-Presidential candidate, when asked what taxes the Democrats planned to increase, referred to ''closing loopholes and delaying indexing'' of tax rates. Challenges Reagan on Taxes She said the Reagan Administration had indicated over the past six months that it might propose a value-added tax and a national sales tax. Challenging Mr. Reagan to specify what taxes he would raise and whom they would effect, she said: ''The American taxpayer has been hit for the past four years, he's got to know where it's coming from in the next four years.'' ''Let us not forget,'' she said of Mr. Reagan, ''that in 1983 he signed a very, very large tax bill, almost $100 billion, and in the past year another $50 billion tax bill.'' She said state and local government had been forced to increase taxes to make up for reduced revenues resulting from ''shifting budget priorities by the Reagan Administration.'' Later in the day, the candidate, joined by her husband, John A. Zaccaro, her daughter Donna and two of Miss Zaccaro's friends, walked barefoot along the surfline in muggy, damp weather, greeting bathers and families. She set a pace so fast that Secret Service agents, their handcuffs peeking out under beach shirts, had trouble keeping up, and television crews had to run relays with their cameras. During the walk, Mrs. Ferraro declined to answer substantive questions, chatting instead with her husband and listening to stage directions from her 22-year-old daughter. Instructed at one point by her daughter to ''wave, left'' Mrs. Ferraro obliged and smiled. The candidate's weekend was relatively free of political business, but she said she had been listening to tapes made of briefings given to her on foreign policy over the last two weeks.

604-> Pace Gains Gold In Men's Archery
Darrell Pace of Hamilton, Ohio, shattered his own Olympic record today to win the gold medal in the men's archery competition. Another American, Rich McKinney of Glendale, Ariz., won the silver medal, finishing just a point ahead of Japan's Hiroshi Yamamato. In the women's event, South Koreans finished first and third as Seo Hyang Soon, a 17-year-old high school student, captured the gold medal and Kim Jin Ho, who had been favored, took the bronze. Li Lingjuan of China finished between them for second place and the silver medal. After 288 arrows, Pace finished with a score of 2,616, 45 points higher than his record total of 2,571 set in Montreal in 1976. McKinney followed with 2,564 and Yamamoto scored 2,563. Pace expressed bitterness that the gold was his second rather than his third. He said the 1980 United States Olympic boycott ''was disappointing before this, but now it is very disappointing. My chances for a gold were very good in 1980, particularly since Rich didn't make the team. The scores they shot in Moscow were not that good.'' He said, however, he would try again for a third medal - and a fourth and fifth. ''I'm ready for '88, '92 and '96,'' said the 27-year-old Pace. ''I'm going to shoot for as long as I can continue to shoot well.'' Pace entered the last round of competition with a commanding 47- point lead after 252 arrows, with Yamamoto second and McKinney third. He started the day with a 35- point lead after Friday's 90- and 70- meter phases. He built his lead with a strong performance on Friday when he scored 601 points with 72 arrows at 90 meters, an average of better than 8 points per arrow and a world record for an International Archery Federation event.

606-> FOR THE AMISH IN MINNESOTA, JUSTICE MOVES IN SLOW LANE
Normally, the Amish of southeastern Minnesota are a law-abiding people. They help strangers, wave to passers- by and make no trouble for their neighbors. But many of these farm people have become lawbreakers because they refuse to hang bright orange reflectors on the backs of their horse-drawn buggies. The orange triangle is required by Minnesota law for all vehicles that move slower than 25 miles an hour on public roads. It must measure 16 inches from tip to base and be visible from 600 feet, day or night. The Amish believe they are under scriptural injunction to avoid bright colors, and so they are routinely fined for driving their signless buggies in this hilly farming region near the Iowa border. 'Close Calls,' No Accidents No major accidents involving Amish buggies have been reported recently in the area, but Sheriff Don Gudmundson of Fillmore County said, ''No one who lives in those communities won't tell you there's been some close calls - particularly at night.'' Asked why his people would not display the orange triangles, Dennis Miller, a spokesman for the Amish, said simply, ''It's our religion.'' Mr. Miller, at 69 years of age the oldest member of an Amish community of about 50 families, said the Bible instructed the Amish to wear subdued colors, dark blues, grays and blacks. The Amish cling to the ways of their ancestors. Their farm homes are lit by kerosene, they use telephones only in emergencies and their buggies' wheels are rimmed with wood and steel rather than rubber. They Came From Ohio ''We just never change,'' said Mr. Miller, a gray-bearded man who wears a straw hat, a blue shirt and dark pants. Amish women wear long dresses and bonnets, also of a dark hue. These Amish moved from Ohio to southeastern Minnesota 10 years ago, lured by advertisements for uncrowded farmland. Mr. Miller estimated their number at 250 to 300. So far this year, the State Patrol has issued 18 tickets to Amish drivers on Federal or state highways in Fillmore County, according to Capt. Richard Wiberg, commander of the local district. While a few younger Amish display the orange reflectors in defiance of religious leaders, Mr. Miller said others talk about going to jail rather than paying the fines. Leader Considers Jail ''It would be a disgrace, but maybe we should,'' said Mr. Miller, who has been given a ticket. Neil Haugerud, an assistant commissioner of the State Department of Public Safety, said the law provided for no exceptions. The Amish have proposed outlining the backs of their buggies in gray reflective tape that could be seen at night but would not be visible by day, Mr. Haugerud said. Such a compromise has eased a similar controversy in Amish regions of New York State. ''It's a plain thing, and we feel very safe and secure,'' said Miller's neighbor, Dan D. Hershberger, referring to the gray strip. But Mr. Haugerud said the orange triangle was a national symbol, designed to be recognized in any part of the country. Mr. Hershberger said the Amish tried to cooperate with law officers. He said the buggies carried rear kerosene lamps with a dull-red glass that ccould n be seen by nighttime drivers. State officials are trying to work out a compromise, Mr. Haugerud said.

Infant to Receive Drug Over Mother's Protest NEWARK, Aug. 24 (UPI) - A 5-month-old boy who has a rare lung infection and whose mother wants no more medical treatment for him will be given an antibiotic, a Superior Court judge has ordered. The judge, Murray Simon, ruled Thursday that the mother was not acting in the best interest of the child by asking doctors to let God take over. The boy, Michael Brown, has Pneumocystis carinii, an infection that generally is seen in persons with a deficiency in their immune systems, said Dr. Kenneth Sprott of the United Hospitals Medical Center of Newark, where the boy is a patient. He said the infection, if untreated, has a 90 to 100 percent mortality rate.

609-> EDITORS' NOTE
Under this heading, The Times amplifies articles or rectifies what the editors consider significant lapses of fairness, balance or perspective. The article yesterday about Governor Cuomo's speech at the University of Notre Dame, on religion and public morality, was accompanied by excerpts from his remarks. Early editions of The Times specified that the excerpts were ''prepared for delivery'' Thursday night - meaning that the text was issued by the Governor's staff before he spoke, to help reporters meet early deadlines. The prepared text, listing religious and civic organizations that ''endorse legalized abortions,'' included the Southern Baptist Convention. In delivering the speech, Governor Cuomo omitted the reference to the Southern Baptist Convention. His office said research showed that its inclusion was erroneous. The Governor's office said the version referring to the Southern Baptist Convention had been sent to The Times inadvertently. In later editions, which went to press after the speech was delivered, The Times carried excerpts based on its own recording. This version did not include the reference to the Southern Baptist Convention.

610-> FUTURES/OPTIONS ; Corn and Soybeans Up; Wheat Prices Down
Corn and soybean futures prices were higher and wheat was lower yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade. Wheat prices fell to their lowest price since March, while corn and soybeans rebounded from weakness in the previous session. Susan Hackmann, a grain analyst in Chicago with Pershing Futures, noted that the Agriculture Department on Thursday increased its estimate for worldwide wheat production by 8 million tons, with most of the increase coming in Europe, a major competitor of the United States for exports. Corn prices were affected primarily by technical factors associated with the September contract. The contract expires Wednesday, and the number of open contracts is extraordinarily large, sources said. The exchange took steps Wednesday and Thursday to force traders to close out their contract positions, and those holding long positions, or agreements to take delivery, appeared to have the upper hand because supplies are tight. As a result, they can hold out for higher prices before selling. Corn rallied the daily limit of 10 cents at one point during the session. Livestock and meat prices were mixed in slow trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Activity was restrained as traders were waiting to see the Agriculture Department's report on cattle in the seven major beef producing states, which was released after the close of trading and disclosed a 1 percent increase in the number of cattle in feed lots. Phil Stanley, a livestock analyst in Chicago with Thomson McKinnon Securities, said the report was viewed as a negative factor by most analysts. But he noted that more animals were marketed than were put into feed lots and that eventually should be a supportive factor. Pork bellies were higher, and Mr. Stanley said most of the buying was coming from traders who had sold contracts earlier in the week and were closing out their positions. Anticipation of the Agriculture Department's report on hog inventories, to be released next Thursday, also curtailed trading, Mr. Stanley said.

611-> JUROR SAYS PROSECUTORS FOUGHT MURDER COUNTS
A grand juror charged yesterday that Manhattan prosecutors had tried to block a murder indictment against three transit police officers who were later indicted for the lesser crime of manslaughter. The juror, Ronald P. Fields, said in court papers that the Manhattan District Attorney's office ''acted in such a way as to obstruct the grand jury's investigation'' of the death of 25-year-old Michael Stewart of Brooklyn. Mr. Fields came forward after lawyers for the officers asked on Wednesday that the manslaughter indictments be dismissed because of his actions in the grand jury. The lawyers said Mr. Fields had ''tainted'' the jury by conducting his own investigation of the death and sharing his findings with others on the 23-member panel. Prosecutors have denied in court papers that the jury was tainted, and law professors interviewed yesterday a grand juror were wrong. Prosecutors have said in court papers that Mr. Stewart, who was black, was fatally beaten by transit officers while he was handcuffed and helpless. Black activists maintain that the beating was racially motivated. The District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, refused to comment on Mr. Fields's allegations because the case was pending. Ronald L. Kuby, a lawyer for Mr. Fields, said in an interview that his client believed that prosecutors had tried ''to deflect the grand jury away from a murder indictment'' against the officers. Another lawyer for Mr. Fields, William M. Kunstler, said his client could not be more specific about his complaints because state law prohibits a grand juror from discussing jury proceedings outside of court. In papers filed yesterday in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, Mr. Fields, a teacher, requested a hearing to discuss in detail his accusations. He also asked for permission to ''present these facts'' to Governor Cuomo. The officers were indicted on charges of second-degree manslaughter, which carries a maximum prison term of up to 15 years. A murder indictment, which lawyers for the Stewart family had sought, can result in a sentence of up to 25 years to life. Mr. Stewart, an artist and model, was arrested by the transit police last Sept. 15 on charges of scrawling graffiti on a subway wall. An hour after his arrest, he was admitted to Bellevue Hospital in a coma. He died 13 days later. Photographs Taken According to the lawyers for the indicted officers, grand-jury minutes show that Mr. Fields visited the scene of the purported beating and took photographs of the site and distributed them to other jurors. They said he also circulated newspaper accounts of the case and videotaped television reports about Mr. Stewart's death. The defense lawyers said, in effect, that grand jurors should be treated as if they were trial jurors, who are almost always prohibited from any outside investigation of a case. But some legal experts said the law puts comparatively few restrictions on the activities of a grand jury and its members. With prosecutors providing counsel in the law, grand juries are supposed to conduct a secret, independent investigation of a case to determine whether there is reasonable cause to believe that someone committed a felony and should be indicted. It is not clear, the professors said, that individuals on a grand jury can be stopped from conducting independent investigations. ''I think there is a strong argument that a juror does have that right,'' said Steven A. Reiss, an associate professor of law at New York University. Defense lawyers have also charged that Mr. Fields talked about the case with friends. It is a felony for a grand juror to discuss a case outside of court. Mr. Kunstler said he believed that Mr. Fields had been careful not to reveal information about the proceedings to outsiders.

612-> SPLIT FEARED IN SALVADOR ON CHURCH'S SOCIAL ROLE
The Vatican's criticism of liberation theology, expressed most recently in a major document made public last Monday in Rome, could have an especially sharp impact in El Salvador, according to Roman Catholic Church officials here. Some Salvadoran clerics fear that the Vatican's attempt to discourage priests from activist politics will force each side to more sharply define its position, leading to an open breach that has so far been avoided. ''The right will use this to say we are leftists who have been condemned by the Pope,'' said a cleric here who describes himself as a follower of liberation theology. ''And the leftists will tell the rightists that they don't understand reality. I don't think it will force priests out of the church, but it will polarize us.'' Critics Cite Stress on Marxism Critics say the theology of liberation stresses a form of Marxism, with its emphasis on class struggle, rather than the traditional Christian concern for the spiritual development of the individual. Like the society to which it ministers, the church in El Salvador has had to come to terms with the civil war here - a war that has sometimes pitted both the Government and more traditional clerics against those who believe that the church is impelled to seek immediate social changes because of what has been called liberation theology's ''preferential option for the poor.'' Religious convictions can have serious consequences in this small country, which is named for Christ ''the Saviour.'' A gunman assassinated Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero as he said mass in San Salvador in 1980 after he criticized human rights abuses by the army and the police. At least 18 other priests and lay workers have been killed here since 1977. 'Base Communities' Organized Over the last decade Roman Catholic clerics and other practitioners of liberation theology have organized many peasants and urban slum dwellers into largely self-sufficient ''Christian base communities.'' Thousands of members of such communities have been killed in recent years by rightist death squads who accuse them of seeking a Marxist revolution. Many others have become supporters of leftist guerrillas. Five priests are known to be openly working with the guerrillas and their followers in the countryside: Rogelio Ponseele, a Belgian, and Miguel Ventura, Rutilio Sanchez, David Rodriguez and Trinidad Neto, all Salvadorans. They joined the rebels in the hills in 1980 and 1981 at the height of the undeclared war in the capital between leftists and Government security forces. The rebels themselves often invoke Archbishop Romero as a martyr of the revolution and justify their struggle as a Christian response to grave social injustice. San Salvador's current Archbishop, Arturo Rivera y Damas, has sought to keep the church in a centrist position in the midst of ideological and military battles. He has also worked to avert the open conflict over the meaning of liberation theology that has split the church in neighboring Nicaragua, according to church offficials. Such concerns appear to have led the Archbishop to handle the Vatican's statement on liberation theology with caution. In a presentation this week, he said the document prohibited the use of Marxist analysis, class struggle and violence to interpret the Gospel. But he added that there were several currents within liberation theology and that a concern with social ills, the poor and human rights remained at the heart of the church's mission here. He also repeated the church's call for a ''dialogue'' to end the war. Lack of Discussion In a later meeting with more than 100 clerics and religious workers, the Archbishop read a summary of the Vatican statement without commentary, according to a priest who was present. The lack of discussion was seen as a further sign of his concern to avoid divisive arguments. The Archbishop was also careful in handling the issue of the five priests who support the guerrillas. Last week he called on the priests to quit their political affiliation with the rebels and return to the authority of the church hierarchy. This week he criticized the priests for having taken a ''political option'' but said that if they gave up their membership in guerrilla organizations they could continue to preach in rebel-controlled zones. According to church sources, some of the priests working with the guerrillas have already met secretly with the Archbishop to discuss their position. They are also thought to have kept in regular contact with him by letter.

613-> GAMES BEGIN FOR GLORY OF SOCIALISM
Less than a week after the formal closing of the Summer Games, Friendship '84, Moscow's answer to the Los Angeles Olympics, formally opened today with the lighting of a giant torch, an array of Politburo members and a sea of youthful gymnasts tumbling and marching under national colors. For the record, Nikolai Rusak, the chief referee of the games, insisted at a news conference that Friendship '84 could not be considered an alternative to the Los Angeles Games. But this explanation somewhat resembled the Soviet insistence that its refusal to attend the Olympics in Los Angeles was not a boycott, and everything from the symbols at the opening ceremony to comments by athletes and the press left litle doubt that the goal of these games was to challenge Los Angeles not only athletically but also ideologically and politically as well. Pravda, the Government newspaper, was blunt in declaring the goal: ''The Friendship '84 competitions in Moscow will yet again demonstrate not only sporting achievements but also that Socialist society provides more favorable facilities for the human beings' all-round physical and spiritual development.'' Tass Quotes Record-Holder A similar point, albeit on a different note, was made by Sergei Bubka, the world-record holder in the pole vault, when he was asked by Tass, the official press agency, for his sentiments on watching the torch that was built for the 1980 Moscow Olympics being reignited. ''What a moving moment!'' Bubka was quoted as saying. ''It is a pity that the Olympic flame in Los Angeles was darkened by the spirit of profit-making. The atmosphere of anti-Soviet and anti-Socialist hysteria in the U.S.A. prevented athletes from most Socialist countries from participating in the Olympic Games. We hope that 'friendship' competitions will show to the world at large anew the strength of athletes from Socialist countries and their loyalty to the Olympic ideals.'' The gala opening ceremony actually came a day after the men's track and field competition began in huge Lenin Stadium, and two days after several other events had begun in the other Soviet-bloc cities where the games are being held through Aug. 30 in nine sports. The initial results Friday in Moscow seemed heartening to the Soviet hope of upstaging Los Angeles. Soviet and East German athletes easily bettered Olympic achievements in the hammer throw, javelin throw, pole vault, shot-put and in the 50- and 20-kilometer walks. Downpour Slows the Action A downpour today slowed the action and dampened Soviet ambitions, and only in the triple-jump, won by Oleg Protsenko, did Soviet athletes better Los Angeles results. Perhaps, the day's brightest moment occurred when Alberto Juantorena of Cuba, the 1976 Olympic champion at 400 and 800 meters, tied for first place with Ryszard Ostrowski of Poland in the 800 with a time of 1 minute 45.68 seonds. Soviet television, after showing nothing at all of the Los Angeles Games, offered extensive coverage of the Friendship games. But the 103,000-seat stadium appeared more than half-empty on Friday, and today a large portion of the spectators left after the opening ceremony and before the track and field events began. Six members of the ruling Politburo, led by Defense Minister Dmitri F. Ustinov and Mikhail S. Gorbachev, sat in a v.i.p. box through 90 minutes of the ceremony capped by a melodramatic rendition of a specially composed song: ''To a sunny peace, yes, yes, yes. To a nuclear blast, no, no, no.'' In keeping with the posture that these were not alternative Olympics, the torch used in the 1980 Games was not called the Olympic torch. An announcer declared that the giant bowl built for the 1980 games would be lit from the eternal flame in the Kremlin in memory of the dead of World War II, and he ordered ''people, arise'' as a runner circled the stadium and ignited the flame. Soviet Woman Has Year's Best 1,500 Time PRAGUE, Aug. 18 (AP) - Nadezhda Ralldugina clocked the year's best time of 3 minutes, 56.63 seconds to lead a sweep by Soviet women in the 1,500 meters on the last day of Czechoslovakia's Spartakiad meet today, part of the Friendship '84 tournament. Her time was nearly 7 seconds faster than the 4:03.25 posted by Olympic gold medal winner Gabriela Dorio of Italy in Los Angeles, but was more than four seonds slower than the world record of 3:52.47 held by Tatiana Kazankina, also of the Soviet Union. The East German sprinters suffered an unexpected blow in the 400-meter relay in which their country holds the world record of 41.53. With the East Germans comfortably in the lead after three legs, the anchor runner, Marlies G"ohr, the former 100-meter world record holder, dropped the baton. The Bulgarian team went on to win in 42.62, nearly a second behind the Olympic winning time of 41.65 set by the United States.

614-> 3 Italian Minehunters Returning to Red Sea
Three Italian minehunters were returning to the Red Sea today after taking part in a search for mines in the Suez Canal sector known as the Bitter Lakes, shipping sources in Port Said said. The three vessels - Fressino, Loto and Castagno - were originally scheduled to leave Egyptian waters after sweeping the Bitter Lakes on their way north to the Mediterranean, but the sources said the vessels instead headed south through the canal Friday. The Italian ships arrived in August to join American, British and French minehunters, along with units from Egypt and other Red Sea nations, in searching for mines after at least 18 vessels were damaged in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Suez in July and August. The discovery by the British team of a mine-like object last Sunday and an underwater explosion reported by a Saudi vessel Thursday renewed concern that more mines, possibly equipped with timing devices, could be on the seabed.

615-> NEWARK SPEECH BEGINS JACKSON DRIVE IN JERSEY
The Rev. Jesse Jackson opened his campaign for New Jersey's June 5 primary today with a passionate call to the nation to remember its children. Attacking the Reagan Administration for cutting back school lunch and breakfast programs, the Democratic Presidential candidate said children went to school ''not so much to learn but to stay warm and have the company.'' Without proper nutrition and housing, he said, they fall asleep in class, then fall behind and drop out. ''Then in their frustration they put cocaine in their membrane'' and turn to sex ''for the only thrill they know - babies making babies.'' Speaking before an enthusiastic crowd of some 2,500 people in Military Park, Mr. Jackson said such children ''don't know the thrill of making an A,'' of graduating and going to college. ''We must give our youth a chance,'' he declared. ''Give them a chance.'' Concentration on California On June 5, New Jersey Democrats will determine 107 of the state's 122 delegates, but Mr. Jackson has scheduled little time in the state because he plans to concentrate on the California primary the same day, when voters will choose 306 of that state's 345 delegates. Today, Mayor Kenneth A. Gibson of Newark, a Jackson supporter, assured Mr. Jackson at a luncheon here, ''You 're going to win all the delegates.'' The New Jersey primary is generally regarded as a close race between Senator Gary Hart and Walter F. Mondale, with Mr. Jackson expected to do well in Newark and other major urban areas. Before arriving in Newark, Mr. Jackson said his allies intended to file lawsuits in a number of Southern states in an effort to eliminate runoff primaries, which he contends discriminate against minority candidates. Ten Southern states require runoff primaries between the two top finishers in the first primary if no one wins a majority of the vote. The Delegate Issue In San Francisco Thursday, Democratic state chairmen took no action on Mr. Jackson's requests to bar runoff primaries or to apportion him more delegates. Mr. Jackson continued to say he would press the delegate issue with the party leadership and, if that failed, take it to the floor of the Democratic National Convention. The civil rights leader maintains that party rules have denied him the share of delegates he has earned in primaries and caucuses, but he apparently has not persuaded the other Democratic Presidential candidates to side with him. Mr. Jackson said he hoped the Justice Department would take the initiative on the runoff primaries, noting that Victor McTeer, a Mississippi lawyer who challenged that state's runoff system in a lawsuit, met with Assistant Attorney General Bradford Reynolds on Thursday to seek information. Sermon-Style Speech In his speech in Newark, Mr. Jackson again urged a cutback in military spending and a redirection of dollars into domestic programs. ''Enough killing is enough,'' he declared. ''We can destroy them; they can destroy us. Let's move from threats to training.'' On a balmy spring day, Mr. Jackson delivered his sermon-style speech before a large sign that read ''Hispanos con Jesse; Bienvenido Newark.'' To glimpse him, a gaggle of schoolchildren strained against police barriers on which they had hung a banner saying, ''New Ark School Loves Jesse Jackson.'' Their hero touched off a bit of the same excitement here that he has in rural Southern hamlets. As Mr. Jackson left City Hall after meeting with Mayor Gibson, a man in the crowd waiting outside exclaimed joyfully, ''Thank you, Jesus!'' The candidate hailed his success and declared: ''The rainbow is growing. The dry and separate bones have begun to rattle and shake together. We must turn to each other, not on each other.'' He has carried a number of cities and more than 50 Congressional districts, he said, and won the popular vote in the South Carolina and Virginia caucuses as well as the primaries in the District of Columbia and Louisiana. ''The only reason we didn't win Georgia and Alabama is people didn't believe it could be done,'' he said. In New Jersey, ''Us and the coalition is enough to win the state,'' Mr. Jackson continued, urging the men involved in politics here to make room for New Jersey women. In seeking office, ''We may or may not win the race,'' he saidn, ''but we'll win our self-respect.''

616-> QUAKERS IN RARE DRIVE FOR MEMBERS
The nation's oldest body of Quakers is embarking uneasily on its first membership drive in more than 300 years, a concept foreign to a community built as a model of tolerance and consensus. But Richard Bansen, associate secretary of the 13,000-member Philadelphia Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends, says the shrinking Quaker community now realizes that ''maybe we've been hiding our light under a bushel.'' A five-year effort is being organized to reach more potential members through radio and print advertisements and the Yellow Pages. The drive is the first such effort here since 1682, when William Penn set up his experiment in religious toleration, pacifism and enlightened government. By 1700, Penn's community had swelled to 30,000. The Philadelphia Yearly Meeting, which includes eastern Pennsylvania and southern and central New Jersey, is still the largest Quaker body in the nation, but it has dwindled 25 percent in the last 25 years. Changes in Congregation An aging congregation, a modest birth rate and the falling away of younger adherents have been blamed for the continuing decline. A special effort will be made to attract blacks and members of other minority groups to Philadelphia's predominantly white, upper-middle-class Quaker community, said Samuel Caldwell, the general secretary. About 100 Philadelphia Quakers are from minority groups. Unlike some other American and foreign communities, the Philadelphia society has no black or Hispanic meetinghouses, Mr. Caldwell said. Some Quaker sects actively seek converts, but Philadelphia's more traditional meetinghouses have long felt that proselytizing was uncomfortably close to arm twisting and were content to let potential members come to them. ''Even in Philadelphia, it's remarkable,'' Mr. Caldwell said. ''Quakers are so low-profile.'' Mr. Caldwell, who says he dislikes the term ''membership drive'' because it sounds like an effort simply to increase ''the body count,'' says the program will be ''low key.'' ''We do not want to go out thumping our chests or that kind of thing,'' he said. He said he hoped that the ''democratic'' nature of Quaker society, which puts a premium on individual conscience and holds meetings for worship in which members sit in meditative silence, will appeal to others.

617-> IDEAS & TRENDS ; HoneybeesIn Danger
The honeybee, whose usefulness in honey production and crop pollination has been turned into a billion- dollar business, has fallen prey to a microscopic mite. The Federal Department of Agriculture reported that more than 150 million bees had been purposely destroyed and apiaries in five states had been quarantined by last week. But preventing the spread of infestation has been hampered for two reasons. One is the absence of a miticide that can destroy the pest without harming the bees or adding toxic substances to the honey. The other is the mobility of the bee industry. To provide crop pollinating services - something that many large farms, including virtually all major citrus growers, regularly require - many of the nation's 200,000 beekeepers move their colonies from state to state. The mite, believed to have come into the country from Mexico, lays its eggs in a bee's windpipe. The young feed on the bee's fluids, weakening its ability to adapt to climate changes as well as reducing its commercial potential. Agriculture Department representatives would not predict how far the infestation might spread. Dr. Roger A. Morse, a Cornell University entomologist who has studied honeybee mites in South America, said the mite invasion has made it necessary to begin developing a resistant honeybee strain.

618-> DIVERGING POLITICS OF SEXES SEEN IN POLL
The gender gap, though not a decisive factor in a so far lopsided Presidential campaign, is critically important in key Senate races where men prefer Republican candidates and women like Democrats better. But beyond this year's election, in which the trend is also key to many House races, the change in party preferences by sex, especially the emergence of an almost equal partisan split among men, are providing strategists in both parties with puzzling grounds for concern, and for hope. Since 1980, when the voting patterns of the sexes emerged as a significant political factor, the partisan choices of men and women have diverged dramatically. In 1980, registered voters of both sexes were significantly more likely to call themselves Democrats than Republicans. Women were even more likely to do so than men. But in 1984, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll, while women are as decidedly Democratic as they were then, men are almost as likely to call themselves Republican as Democratic. Men Shift Toward Republicans Thirty-three percent of men say they are Democrats, 30 percent say they are Republican, and 37 percent call themselves independents. Four years ago it was 26 percent Republican, 42 percent Democratic and 32 percent independent. Among women the division is now 46 percent Democratic, 25 percent Republican and 29 percent independent; in 1980 they were 24 percent Republican, 47 percent Democratic and 30 percent independent. In an age when fewer and fewer Americans identify with political parties, the ties that still bind do make a difference when it comes time to vote. In the September Times/CBS News Poll, 89 percent of Republicans said they would vote for President Reagan. In 1982, 87 percent of Democrats voted for Democratic candidates for the House, according to Election Day surveying by the Times/CBS News Poll. But the latest figures on men's and women's politics provoked contrary interpretations. Ann F. Lewis, political director of the Democratic National Committee, noted that the surge in Republicanism among men in 1981 fell back the following year over the recession. She offered this hopeful analysis: ''Women have made a long-term commitment. Men are making a series of short-term decisions that seems to be most influenced by current economic statistics.'' While Republicans worry about the possibility that women's identification with the Democrats may last, they are encouraged by shifts among men. William B. Lacy, director of political operations for the Republican National Committee, said the committee's surveys showed that both Mr. Reagan's style and the economic approach taken by him and the party had strong appeal for younger men. Breaking Ties to Party Lee Atwater, deputy manager of the campaign for Mr. Reagan and Vice President Bush, said the shift showed that Mr. Reagan had encouraged a decline in party affiliation, especially among Democratic men. Mr. Atwater argued that Mr. Reagan's exceptional appeal to men - in the Times/CBS News Poll, 81 percent of men called him ''tough enough'' for the Presidency, and 78 percent said he was a strong leader - served as a catalyst in this process. ''You'll see more and more men going over to the Republican Party,'' Mr. Atwater said. ''You won't see them going back to the Democratic Party.'' But whatever the future, for 1984 the premier political arena is the Presidential race. Women's political groups approached this campaign with the expectation that the Democratic candidate would lead among women, that the Republican incumbent would lead among men, and that if they worked hard enough, the Democrat would come out ahead. It has not been working out that way. Early in the year, the women were dividing more or less evenly, and the men were giving Mr. Reagan a big lead. Now both sexes have moved in his direction. In the latest Times/CBS News Poll, conducted Sept. 12-16, Mr. Reagan led, 60 percent to 30 percent among men and 48 to 35 percent among women. To affect the result, Mr. Mondale would have to pick up about a dozen percentage points with each sex, and Mr. Reagan would have to lose about that much. Issues Keep Sexes Apart But it is still a big difference between the sexes, of the sort that has been clear through most of Mr. Reagan's term. It is concentrated on differences of opinion, including those about his handling of the economy, which women are more likely to consider unfair. On foreign policy, where men more often see forcefulness, women see a President who they think too readily risks war. The difference over foreign policy seems most relevant to the youngest group, those 18 to 29 years old. Young men prefer the Reagan-Bush ticket over the Democrats, 62 percent to 35, while the young women are about evenly divided, 46 percent for Mr. Mondale and Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro and 45 percent for the Republicans. The trend might not concern Republicans if it appeared only in the Presidential race. But polls in many other elections also find differences in the voting intentions of men and women. Trends in Other Races In the North Carolina Senate contest between Jesse Helms, the Republican incumbent, and Gov. James B. Hunt Jr., the Democratic challenger, a Sept. 10-13 Gallup Poll showed Mr. Helms leading by 16 percentage points among men and trailing by seven points among women. That poll was taken before Mr. Hunt's decision Thursday not to block the execution of a convicted murderer, Margie Velma Barfield, scheduled four days before the election. That case had been watched closely for political implications for the Governor, an advocate of capital punishment who has been accused by his opponent of ''flip- flopping'' on other issues. A Teichner poll of Sept. 13 and 14 in the Illinois Senate race gave Senator Charles H. Percy, a Republican, a six- point lead among men, while his Democratic challenger, Representative Paul Simon, held a three-point edge among women. Those gaps vary, and Robert M. Teeter, president of Market Opinion Research, a Detroit company that polls for Republicans, says, ''It probably is a little less than it was in 1982.'' Linda Divall, who is in charge of polling at the National Republican Congressional Committee, said that in the surveys she sees for House races, the sexes are closer together than they were two years ago, largely as a result of better economic times. But Martin Franks, executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, disagrees. He said the private data he has seen indicates ''the gender gap is still working very much to the advantage of Democratic candidates.'' He speculated that while Mr. Reagan's personal qualities may be dominating the Presidential race, there are still major differences on issues between the sexes, and ''when people disagree with a party on issues, they vote against that party's House candidates.'' Charting Opinions by Sex Whatever the effect on the election, there is no shortage of issues on which men and women differ, as the Times/ CBS News Poll showed. Nineteen percent of men, but just 5 percent of women, said the budget deficit was the nation's most important problem. Forty-eight percent of men, but 36 percent of women, thought the United States' foreign policy position was stronger than it was in 1980. When asked if they were more worried about a war or about a Communist takeover in Central America, 57 percent of men said Communism, and 35 percent said war. Among women, 44 percent said war, and 40 percent said Communism. And 64 percent of men, but only 49 percent of women, said they approved of the way Mr. Reagan was handling the economy. On almost all of the issues sampled, more women than men were undecided. On the Presidential contest, for example, 17 percent of women and 10 percent of men said they had made no choice. But there was one topic that did not fit this common pattern: the candidacy of Representative Ferraro. On questions dealing with her - though not on those relating to Mr. Bush - the ''don't know'' column among women was the same size as it was among men. Women were somewhat more favorably inclined toward her than were men. Forty-two percent of women, for example, said the press would have been easier on her if she were a man; that view was held by 30 percent of men. There was no evidence that Mrs. Ferraro was bringing women's votes to the ticket in significant numbers. But as the comparatively low ''don't know'' figures showed, she was getting women's attention.

619-> FINAL RAILS LAID ON KEY LINE TO OPEN UP SIBERIAN RICHES
After 10 years of work, the last segment of track was laid today on a 2,000-mile Soviet rail project that may ultimately cost an estimated $10 billion and open up vast new Siberian resources. The railroad, known as the Baikal- Amur Mainline, is intended to help develop copper, asbestos and other mineral deposits as well as commercial timber lands in a 600,000 square-mile region of southeastern Siberia. Many of the resources may be destined for export through Pacific ports. Dubbed the ''construction project of the century,'' it has been mobilizing workers from all over the Soviet Union as well as army construction troops since work got under way in 1974. Today television showed the last rails being lowered into place on the roadbed and workers breaking into hugs and cheers. A bearded crew chief removed his yellow hard hat, put his head in his arms against the side of a construction machine, and wept. An official ceremony is planned for Monday. Dogged by Difficulties The track-laying, which was originally to be finished in 1982, has been dogged by difficulties and delays. Years of work still lie ahead in completing tunnels, which have been temporarily bypassed. Stations and settlements must be built and, most important, the potential resources along the route are yet to be developed. Although trains can now theoretically travel along the entire line, from Ust-Kut near Lake Baikal in the west to Komsomolsk on the Amur River in the east, only one-third of the BAM, as it is commonly called, is in regular operation. The rest is in provisional service or is being used only by work trains. According to the press agency Tass, the linkup came at a siding known as Balbukhta, which is at Mile 545, counting from the western end of the railroad. The siding is west of the Kodar Tunnel, which was supposed to be completed in time for the linkup. But a tunnel section collapsed in the summer, and a temporary bypass route was rigged across the mountains in time for the ceremony. 'Result of Heroic Labor' Tass quoted the BAM construction chief, Konstantin V. Mok hortov, who is a Deputy Minister of Transport Construction, as having said: ''What has been accomplished is the result of really heroic labor. The railroad line was carved through uninhabited forest, under harsh climatic and geological conditions. Completion of the project called for enthusiasm, courage and selflessness.'' The railroad passes through some of eastern Siberia's roughest terrain, subject to earthquakes, landslides and mudflows. It crosses 22 mountain ranges and 17 major rivers, not to speak of thousands of minor streams. Temperatures can fall to 80 degrees below zero Fahrenheit in winter and rise to 100 degrees in the humid summers, when much of the low-lying terrain turns into mosquito-infested swamp and bulldozers have been reported to disappear in the mire without a trace. Much of the terrain is underlain by permafrost, complicating track-laying and tunnel-building. A total of 20 miles of tunnels have to be built, including the nine-mile Muya tunnel, one of the world's longest. Capacity for Big Projects The railroad seems to demonstrate the capacity of the Soviet Union's Government-run economy when it is focused on grand projects. Despite problems of planning and organization endemic to the economic system, sheer force of resources and determination have pushed the project through. According to present plans, the railroad will serve mainly in opening up new mineral deposits and other resources along the way. The climate and environment along the route is too harsh for agriculture and is unlikely to result in intensive settlement. The rail line is also likely to serve a national-security purpose in that it runs some 100 to 300 miles farther north than the old Trans-Siberian Railroad, which runs close to the Chinese border. But its main purpose, acording to Abel G. Aganbegyan, a leading Siberian economist, is the development of Siberia's natural riches. Western economists say the resources that will be opened up may start having an effect on the world economy starting toward the end of the century. The area under development includes the Udokan copper reserves, the asbestos of Molodezhny, the iron ore of the Tokko-Chara watershed, and vast stands of commercial timber. South Yakutian steam coal is already being mined at Neryungri, on a northern spur, and coking coal will start moving soon to Japan for its steel industry. Long-Term Impact Is Likely But Western economists here said it would take many years before the other potential resources are exploited and the line pays for itself. ''A thing like this takes a long time to have an effect,'' one analyst said. ''In the short term, it will continue to take more investment. But in the long term, they really had no alternative in terms of national development.'' Some of the problems that remain to be resolved are the results of the crash nature of the project, in which secondary work was shortchanged in the rush to get the rail line finished. ''The slogan the railway first in effect turns into a cost, both social and economic,'' Mr. Aganbegyan, the economist, said in a recent article. ''It comes as no surprise that in the total estimate of construction costs, investment for housing and other social expenditures is considerably less than allotted to any other area of the country, including the whole rest of Siberia.'' A team of reporters from the Government newspaper Izvestia has been following progress and has reported on difficulties involving poor planning and allocation of resources that have slowed work and raised the cost.

620-> MEN'S STYLE; PATTERNED SWEATERS
ASIDE FROM their basic function warmth - sweaters inject a spark of color into the predominantly somber palette of the male wardrobe. This fall, the traditional solid colors and patterns have been supplemented by sweaters that actually seem to come from an artist's easel. Knitted in bold colors and intended primarily for casual wear, they offer an unusual combination of wit and sophistication. These are good choices for Saturday shopping, casual dinners in a neighborhood restaurant, or for weekend football games. They are classic in shape: turtlenecks, crew necks and cardigans. To be sure, there still are many customary motifs such as the Nordic snowflake and reindeer as well as Fair Isles and argyles. Just as there are the classic blues, reds, pinks and Kelly greens. But they tend to take a back seat to those that get their inspiration from such varied sources as abstract, Expressionist and minimal art, antique mosaics, even computer graphics. Perry Ellis's collection, for example, is a singular salute to Sonia Delaunay, a painter who worked in Paris in the 1920's and 30's. For Delaunay, color was primary, and her use of its intensity and hue was as essential to her as the balance of shape and form to a still-life painter. Alexander Julian, long an admirer of Kenneth Noland's work, interpreted the artist's graphic linear patterns into more than one of his sweaters. And venturing not that far afield from the work of some artists, many manufacturers have developed architectural themes - including Moroccan tiles, Greek mosaics and repetitional motifs from Islamic temples - in clear jewel tones.

621-> EVERYONE'S A SENIOR IN THIS PROGRAM
THEY have served in all walks of life: as accountants, businessmen, judges, housewives, bankers, clerical workers. And they come for a variety of reasons: for intellectual stimulation, for comradeship, for a sense of purpose or a fresh identity. They are the participants in My Turn, a program designed by the City University of New York's Kingsborough Community College for state residents over 65 years old. Set up two and a half years ago, the program enables the elderly to take courses for credit and gain degrees at this modern complex overlooking the sea at Manhattan Beach in Brooklyn. For no more expense than a $25 registration fee, the participants mingle with younger students both in classes and in extracurricular activities, such as the mini-marathon and the school newspaper. Like their younger classmates, the older students must complete the course work and take exams. But unlike them, only a small proportion of the older students aim to graduate with a degree - only two expect to this June. ''As far as we know, ours is the only college in the state of New York where there is an established program specifically for senior citizens which is educational, cultural and social,'' said Leon M. Goldstein, president of Kingsborough, a 10,000-student commuter college that offers two- year associate degrees in liberal arts and science. ''There is no attempt here to make a ghetto for the aged,'' Mr. Goldstein said. ''They are fully integrated into the college.'' Seldom do the older students need any particular assistance, according to school officials, but the program coordinator, Barbara R. Ginsberg, provides it from her office on the campus. My Turn has its own club, which meets weekly and sponsors cultural tours and outings, as well as regular ''rap sessions,'' counseling and bereavement groups to serve the older students' particular needs. These special facilities, school officials say, distinguish Kingsborough from City University's 17 other campuses, which, under legislation passed in 1977, must also offer free education on a space-available basis to New York state citizens over 65 years old. ''As a credit program with its own director, My Turn is structurally different from any of the university's other programs,'' said Augusta Kappner, acting dean for adult and continuing education at City University. Only about a third of the other campuses offer specialized programs for the elderly, she said, and not all offer credit. My Turn is one of more than 1,000 college programs nationwide that are tailored to the special requirements of older Americans, according to Henry Lipman, director of the Institute for Retired Professionals at The New School for Social Research in New York City, the first program for older persons in the country, founded in 1962. ''There are some 1,200 to 1,400 colleges across the country now offering special programs for older people,'' Mr. Lipman said, ''and the variation is enormous.'' IN a crowded life sciences class at Kingsborough one recent Monday, some half-dozen My Turn students who sat among the younger ones eagerly answered the professor's questions on vitamin E and iodine deficiencies. One elderly hand shot up in response to virtually every question. And later that morning in a class on parapsychology, where several My Turn students had planted themselves in the center front row, one reduced the class of 35 to laughter with an anecdote about a seance he had attended. ''They make a genuine contribution to the class,'' said Philip Stander, chairman of the Department of Behavioral Sciences. ''Some come with prior knowledge of the subject and the class becomes an intensive extension of their prior learning. Their level of interest is extraordinarily high.'' According to school officials, the program was founded because of the large number of elderly people in the area, many of them already taking courses at Kingsborough, paying their own way. In just over two years, the number of participants has jumped from 30 to 360. Some 200 additional students have applied for the summer session. ''It's a terrific program,'' said Maxwell Jacobs, 68 years old, as he rushed down a hallway, books in hand, to his computer sciences course. Mr. Jacobs holds an engineering degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and has run his own manufacturing business. His computer studies at Kingsborough, he said, had not only helped him secure a part- time teaching job at New York City Technical College, but have also enabled him to train youngsters on computers at a nearby school. The older students said they enjoyed mixing with younger people. ''They'll ask us questions that they'll refrain from asking their professors,'' said Mrs. Londin. In the sun-drenched cafeteria overlooking the beach, different generations could recently be seen mixing at the same dining tables. Perhaps more common at the school, however, is the comradeship that develops among the older students. Although some attend classes with their spouses or with friends, many of the My Turn students join the program with the express purpose of making new acquaintances. ''I lost a son recently,'' said Edna Saks, a braided gray bun perched elegantly on her head. ''The doctor told me it would be good therapy for me to take classes.'' Esta Liebeskind, a diminutive woman sporting a green visor, joined the program after her husband died. ''I can't wait to come to classes,'' she said. ''It gets me out of that self-centeredness and loneliness trap.''

622-> FILM: MEG TILLY IN 'IMPULSE'
There's a lot of ''Twilight Zone'' to the premise of ''Impulse,'' a small- town science fiction thriller that opened yesterday at the Criterion. Imagine a Middle Western town in which everyone, without warning, begins acting on his every whim. While the children play vicious practical jokes, old men on Sutcliffe's Main Street play games like kick-the-can; in the bank, people steal money simply because they see it lying around. Everyone, quite without inhibition, says anything that comes to mind. ''Impulse'' has a lot to work with as it chronicles the increasing craziness that envelops the town. The screenplay, by Bart Davis and Don Carlos Dunaway, gets the story off to an eerie start and develops it effectively for a while, as Jennifer Russell (Meg Tilly) and her boyfriend, Dr. Stuart Ames (Tim Matheson), return to Sutcliffe for a visit because Jennifer's mother has attempted suicide. The mother is being attended by Dr. Carr (Hume Cronyn), who is no more inhibited than anyone else. Dr. Carr has been periodically torturing Jennifer's mother by tinkering with her respirator. ''Impulse'' doesn't sustain its cleverness by bringing any moral dimension to the odd behavior of its characters; it simply deteriorates into an action movie after a while, as Jennifer flees for her life when she realizes that she's the only person in town not afflicted by a bizarre disease. Miss Tilly is well able to hold the audience's interest, though, and Mr. Matheson, while not very convincingly doctorish, makes a good action hero. Graham Baker, who also directed ''The Final Conflict,'' displays a more credible style touch this time but ends the film on a flat note. The story's possibilities for devilishness are never fully realized. The Cast IMPULSE, directed by Graham Baker; written by Bart Davis and Don Carlos Dunaway; director of photography, Thomas Del Ruth; edited by David Holden; music by Paul Chihara; produced by Tim Zinnemann; released by Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation. At Criterion, Broadway and 45th Street; Gotham, Third Avenue and 58th Street, and other theaters. Running time: 91 minutes. This film is rated R.

623-> VAN GOGH TREASURES ARRIVE AT MET
With the excitement of a christening and with security precautions elaborate enough to satisfy a bank, the Metropolitan Museum of Art yesterday began unpacking 146 paintings and drawings by Vincent van Gogh. The commotion - the opening of giant wooden crates, the anxious scrutiny of canvases worth many millions of dollars, the arrival of couriers bearing locked aluminum suitcases filled with drawings cradled in Styrofoam - was all part of the preparations for an exhibition of the artist's work, which will run from Oct. 18 through Dec. 30. The show will consist of many of the world's most valuable paintings, and is the museum's largest display ever of works by one of the most popular painters in history. Emotions Are High ''It will be a revelation to everyone,'' said Philippe de Montebello, the director of the museum. ''The exhibition will reveal a number of aspects about an artist whom everybody thinks they know. You will see that you don't just have a madman in a field splashing paint on a canvas, you have a highly cultivated, well- read, rational artist who really thought through and developed his ideas cerebrally.'' To bring these points home, the exhibition will consist almost exclusively of paintings and drawings that van Gogh produced during the most prolific and important period of his career: 444 days during which he lived at Arles, a town in the south of France. The period begins with the artist leaving Paris in February 1888, seeking ''the land of blue tones and gay colors,'' and it ends with his slide into madness, the self-mutilation of his left ear, and his self-imposed commitment to a mental institution in 1889. He committed suicide the next year at the age of 37. During his 18 months at Arles, van Gogh exploded with creativity, producing nearly 200 oil paintings, 100 watercolors and drawings, and writing 200 letters to his brother, Theo, and friends. The Metropolitan's exhibition will include many of the artist's best-known paintings: his luxuriously sunny haystacks and wheatfields, the still lifes of his rush-bottomed chair, his room, washerwomen, a drawbridge and his self-portrait with a bandage over his left ear. A few of the paintings and many of the drawings, which make up almost half the show, have never before been exhibited in the United States. The drawings that van Gogh made in Arles, many of them sepia ink on paper, will be among the highlights of the exhibition, according to Mr. de Montebello. ''They are not merely sketches,'' he said. ''They are complete works of art, rich and warm and sensational.'' Clues to Artist's Growth The drawings also offer important clues to van Gogh's development as a painter, according to Susan Alyson Stein, the coordinator of the show. During his time at Arles, Miss Stein said, van Gogh tried to break away from a strong pictorial tendency in his paintings. ''The drawings helped to make his line more spontaneous, exaggerated and expressive,'' she said. ''He wanted his lines not just to delineate an object, but to express a feeling. He spoke of paintings as poems of color. He was paving the way for modern art.'' Other important elements in van Gogh's paintings - his movement away from Impressionism, his vacillation between realistic and abstract subject matter, and the influence of other artistic styles on his work - can also be seen first in a simplified and graphic way in the drawings, and then in more complex and subtle ways in the paintings, Miss Stein added. The art of Japanese printmakers and the atmospheric climate they often portrayed, for example, strongly influenced van Gogh, who said after he left Arles that he had sought there ''a better idea of the Japanese way of feeling and drawing.'' And it is in his drawings of landscapes from around Arles that the Japanese influence can be vividly seen. The works in the exhibition were gathered from several dozen museums and private collectors around the world, with the largest single group coming from the Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh in Amsterdam. The show, sponsored in part by Manufacturers Hanover Corporation and the Robert Wood Johnson Jr. Charitable Trust, will run through Dec. 30, and will not travel to other cities. Admission will be by ticket only, which can be purchased from Ticketron and Teletron, and at the museum. Tickets cost $4, plus a service charge. The number for additional information is 570-3970.

624-> HOME FOR UNWED MOTHERS REBUFFS CUOMO OVER OFFER OF $1,500 GIFT
The board of directors of a Roman Catholic home for unwed mothers, headed by a Bishop of the New York Archdiocese, rejected a $1,500 gift from Governor Cuomo today. The board said it disagreed with the views on abortion that Mr. Cuomo expressed in a speech Thursday night at the University of Notre Dame. The $1,500 was the Governor's honorarium from the university. ''Our board decided unanimously that we could not accept this public gift because it would seem we were disagreeing with the church,'' said Sister Marita Paul, who helps run the home, the Nazareth Life Center in Garrison, N.Y., in Putnam County. ''We agree with the teaching of the church particularly as articulated by Archbishop O' Connor. I want to stand behind what he stands for.'' After rejecting the Governor's gift, the center accepted $3,000 offered in its place by an antiabortion group. Mr. Cuomo has skirmished repeatedly with the Archbishop, John J. O'Connor, over both abortion and the church's role in politics. When he was told today that Sister Marita had announced the rejection of his gift, Mr. Cuomo said: ''Ask her who her Archbishop is.'' Clergy and Lay Members Sister Marita said the center's 10- member board was composed of the clergy and lay people. The chairman is Auxiliary Bishop James P. Mahoney of the Archdiocese of New York and the vicar, or representative, of the Archbishop to northern Westchester County and Putnam County. Bishop Mahoney did not return messages left at his office today. The Archbishop declined through a spokesman, Joseph Zwilling, to comment on matters relating to the Governor's address. Mr. Cuomo said Sister Marita had misunderstood his position. ''Nobody who understood my position would have had a problem,'' he said. ''My position is the same as the sister's.'' He said that he agreed with church teaching on abortion and that the episode demonstrated the complexity of the issue of abortion. ''Such confusion and misunderstanding is one reason I accepted the Notre Dame invitation,'' Mr. Cuomo said. In that address Mr. Cuomo said he believed abortion was wrong. But he said he did not support demands by the Catholic bishops and others for a constitutional amendment or other legal changes that would overturn the current legal situation, in which women are, in most cases, free to choose whether to have an abortion. He said that outlawing abortion would not stop it and that there was nothing in church doctrine that required him to accept the ''political judgment'' of the bishops that the best way to combat abortion was to seek to outlaw it. The Governor said that he consulted with four theologians before delivering his address and that they assured him ''that there was no question about its theological probity.'' In the address, Mr. Cuomo urged Catholics to set an example for other Americans rather than seeking to impose laws on them. He also called for increased support for programs that provided women with an alternative to abortion. 'I Just Feel Abortion Is Murder' ''He believes abortion is not for his wife,'' said Sister Marita, ''but there are instances where he thinks there should be free choice. I do not believe abortion involves a free choice. I just feel abortion is murder. It's not simply a Catholic issue. There are no ifs, ands or buts about it.'' Sister Marita said she learned about the gift Thursday afternoon from a reporter. ''When I contacted each member of the board, they unanimously felt that we couldn't accept it, that giving us the donation was a political move,'' she said. The Nazareth Life Center was founded nearly four years ago by the Rev. Eugene Keane. ''It was always Father's impression that if girls knew there was a place they could come, they would choose life,'' said Sister Marita. The center is supported by grants from foundations and individual donors, she said. One of its financial supporters is the Human Life Foundation, a nonsectarian group that publishes The Human Life Review, an antiabortion quarterly. The president of the foundation, J. P. McFadden, said that when Father Keane told him he was turning down the Governor's gift he decided to give the center $3,000 to make up for it. Governor Cuomo said he was ''delighted'' that the center would be getting the $3,000. His honorarium from Notre Dame will go to some other group engaged in similar work, he said.

625-> CHINA HAILS ARAFAT ON ARRIVAL PEKING, May 5 (Reuters) - Yasir Arafat arrived in China today for three days of talks and was welcomed with a 19-gun salute and an endorsement of his leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang held two hours of talks this afternoon with Mr. Arafat, whose visit is to discuss China's military and diplomatic backing of the P.L.O. Mr. Arafat is scheduled to see China's leader, Deng Xiaoping, on Monday, Chinese officials said. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said after the meeting with Mr. Zhao, ''China will always firmly support the struggle of the Palestinian people and the P.L.O. as their sole representative as well as firmly supporting the revolutionary leadership by brother Arafat.'' Talks are scheduled to begin next week in Algiers on efforts to reunite the P.L.O. factions after a year of disputes over Mr. Arafat's leadership. Mr. Arafat and his supporters were driven out of Lebanon last December after a Syrian-backed mutiny of Palestinians who are opposed to his leadership. Mr. Arafat's China trip appears designed to enhance his prestige ahead of the Algiers meeting, Western diplomats said. The 19-gun salute, which is usually reserved for visiting heads of Government, appeared to signal China's backing of Mr. Arafat.

626-> A MANAGED ECONOMY CAN TURN UNRULY
Surveying the new economic strategies of East Europe's Communist states, a Roman Catholic history professor who is a close adviser to the Solidarity movement in Poland observed, ''One by one, they are confronting their fictions.'' Whether these governments are indeed conceding the existence of critical flaws in state-managed economies is debatable. But many are casting about for ways to stimulate productivity while leaving Communist control unthreatened. Once-taboo words such as ''incentives,'' ''motivation'' and even ''free market'' are regularly used in discussions about spurring productivity. In Poland, a program of private small businesses financed by Poles abroad is viewed as a pilot project for wider private initiatives. The Government has also offered bonuses and special shopping rights to lagging coal miners, who thereupon began digging at a record pace. Hungary is implementing ''new economic mechanisms'' that reward initiative and hard work. And Yugoslavia, with its idiosyncratic system of decentralized, worker- managed socialism, is actively debating the rationalizing of the economy by adopting features of a free market. ''Why is it,'' a Yugoslav official asked last week in Belgrade, ''that we Yugoslavs are in much demand in German factories where we work hard, and yet when we work in our own factories we are not so hard-working?'' The challenge to old economic myths has been intensified by recognition that while no federal authority was counting, Yugoslavia's decentralized components acquired $20 billion in foreign debts. Later, as Western governments and banks put together refinancing, the authorities found mountains of evidence of misdirected investment and waste. Yugoslavia has several competing steel mills with surplus capacity, more refineries than can be economically useful, a railroad system with eight competing segments that snarl transportation, and expensive new mines that produce unsalable low-grade ore. Self-examination and self-criticism have unveiled juicy scandals, the most recent concerning a decade of systematic pilfering of tons of silver by a ring of self-managing mine workers. A new Yugoslav law requires self-managed enterprises that are chronic losers to reduce wages to the legal minimum. Yugoslav economists are noting that in the absence of a workable bankruptcy procedure, there has been no way to get rid of losing concerns. ''This has led to undisciplined investment,'' said Oskar Kovacs, dean of the Belgrade University economics faculty. Hungarians, meanwhile, can bid on failing Government establishments, taking them over for set periods in exchange for a percentage of profits. Formerly unprofitable Government restaurants, workshops and stores have reportedly been moved into the black. In Hungary, Poland and Yugoslavia, steps are also being taken or considered to link pay scales to a factory's productivity. These initiatives are not universally applauded. Doctrinaire Communists say they negate socialist egalitarianism, arguing that it is unfair for people to be paid differently just because they happen to work for more, or less, productive plants. Often, the reformers reply, such critics are patronage-dispensing bosses with a vested interest in maintaining inefficient work units. Under Yugoslav self-management, a system developed under Tito to counter the concentration of centralized bureaucracy, small units such as workers in the motor pool of a construction company are supposed to make decisions about dividing resources and setting pay and work schedules. But as the foreign debt crisis forced more and better accounting, central authorities found instances of faulty planning, with three and four plants producing the same things, and great waste. When Activists Take OverNo one has questioned the commitment to self-management, one of Tito's hallowed doctrines that hold this diverse country together. But some officials are suggesting that too many key decisions have been taken by too many small units and that for the sake of efficiency, entire companies - that is, the entire construction company, rather than the motor pool - should make and implement decisions. They have also suggested strengthening institutions such as the central bank to tighten responsibility and discipline in decentralized decision-making. While self-management is undergoing reappraisal and refinement in Yugoslavia, where it is most deeply entrenched, it is proving something of an allure in Poland. Self-management teams have been installed in some factories in what appears to be a Government attempt to fill the vacuum left when the Solidarity unions were banned. The new Government-sponsored unions have generally failed to attract enthusiastic members or to stimulate a vigorous work ethic and self-management groups have been established alongside them. How the two institutions will divide duties and ambitions is still unclear. According to reports from factory workers, the Polish self-management teams most effective in defining roles and motivating workers are those that have been taken over by former Solidarity activists. They are making progress, notably at the Warsaw steel plant, worker sources say, in balancing productivity and compensation. Whether they can succeed is likely to depend on how much political opposition is mustered to what the Catholic professor called ''confronting their fictions.''

627-> POLISH VESSEL HITS A MINE IN RED SEA
A Polish cargo ship struck a mine at the southern entrance to the Red Sea today, causing a ''strong explosion'' that damaged the ship but caused no casualties, the official Polish press agency P.A.P. said. The explosion was the latest in a series of explosions involving commercial ships in the 1,450-mile-long waterway. More than a dozen other ships have been damaged. France, the United States and Britain have pledged to help Egypt in a minesweeping operation in the Red Sea expected to start in the middle of next week. Poland's Office of Maritime Economy reported that the Jozef Wybicki, a 5,713-ton Polish cargo ship, hit the mine at the mouth of the Red Sea, P.A.P. said. Damage in the Engine Room The agency said the explosion caused extensive damage to pipes in the engine room. The crew was trying to repair the piping, and another Polish ship, the Leopold Staff, was providing assistance, the agency said. The Jozef Wybicki was sailing from Malaysia to the Saudi Arabian port of Jidda, P.A.P. said. It did not give the ship's exact location. Officials say they do not know for certain who is responsible for the blasts. But President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt has said Iran and Libya may be responsible, and he added that Egypt would use the power given it in an 1888 agreement to close the Suez Canal to any country found responsible for planting the mines. Egypt Seeks Italian Aid CAIRO, Aug. 11, (Reuters) - Egypt has asked Italy to join international efforts to clear the Red Sea of mines. Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Maguid of Egypt met the Italian charge d'affaires in Cairo today and officially asked Italy to join the United States, France, Britain and Egypt in clearing mines from Egyptian waters. The United States has sent four mine- hunting helicopters, France sent two minesweepers and a support ship, and British minehunters are due to sail from Cyprus Monday. Explosion Is Confirmed MANAMA, Bahrain, Aug. 11 (AP) - Shipping sources in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, reached by telephone in Bahrain, confirmed the explosion aboard the Jozef Wybicki and said it took place about 150 miles north of the 17-mile- wide Bab el Mandeb, the strait that links the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea. Saudi officials said King Fahd met today with the President of Somalia, Mohamed Siad Barre, to discuss coordination of efforts over the Red Sea threat. Somalia overlooks the southern entrance of the Red Sea. Meanwhile, the far-left Kuwaiti newspaper Al Watan said the Soviet Union had advised Southern Yemen, Syria and other Soviet Arab allies that the United States was behind the minings. It said the object of the ''American ploy'' was to convince Arab nations of the need for a United States military presence in the region.

628-> Talks by Riegel On Acquisition The Riegel Textile Corporation said it is holding talks with
an investor group that is considering the acquisition of all of the company's stock. On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Riegel jumped $3.125, to $26.75, The company has 3.7 million shares outstanding. An agreement in principle for Riegel to be acquired by a group of investors for $35 a share was terminated in early June. At that time, it was believed that the company contemplated the transaction primarily because of a potential takeover threat. Robert E. Coleman, chairman and chief executive officer, said yesterday that the investor group would include members of Riegel's management, but he noted that no specific proposal is under consideration. Riegel is based in Greenville, S.C., Apparel fabrics make up the most important segment of its business, but consumer goods and interior furnishings have grown in importance. The company eliminated several unprofitable operations early this year.

629-> Watch the Ball, Not the Dome
The vague yearnings to build a domed stadium in New York City are to get their first serious analysis next week. Indoor football sounds romantic, but New Yorkers need to keep their feet on the ground. The first report of the state's Sportsplex Corporation, an offspring of the Urban Development Corporation, still has to answer some tough questions. Can a football stadium filled to capacity once a week for a maximum of 16 weeks a year come even close to breaking even? If yes, which two teams can be lured to play their eight home games in New York? If no, what other sports could be built into the complex without hurting Madison Square Garden and the adequate tracks at Belmont, Aqueduct and Yonkers? Where in the city is there enough highway capacity to handle the traffic? What precisely is the alleged multiplier effect? Perhaps a once-a-year championship game adds to hotel occupancy and restaurant business. But much more than a playoff across the river in New Jersey? And if subsidizing hotels is the object, why not just subsidize hotels? If there is no economic justification for a domed stadium, what is the civic need for one? Will any teams that have New York in their names suffice, or must they also be winning teams? Did the Jets of Joe Namath's day prevent the city's decline? Did the flight of the Giants and Jets to New Jersey arrest its recovery? These are a few of the questions the Sportsplex sponsors should answer before they are allowed to pledge New York's hard-won credit to subsidize owners and well-paid players.

630-> HARVARD JUST GETS BY CORNELL
Harvard scored in the first minute of play and took a two-touchdown lead into the final period, but its victory over Cornell today was hardly an easy one. The Crimson managed a 24-18 triumph at Harvard Stadium that brought its record to 2-2 over all and 2-0 in the Ivy League. However, Cornell stayed in the game until the final moments. A bad snap on a punt play led to a Cornell touchdown early in the fourth quarter, and a fumble moments later gave the Big Red a chance to win. But Cornell's final threat was stopped when the fullback Mark Miller was knocked out of bounds on the Harvard 20 with 1 minute 52 seconds remaining after picking up 4 yards on a fourth-and-sixth pass play. Cornell had begun that drive after Robert Santiago, who gained 168 yards, fumbled on the Big Red 24- yard-line. ''You get the first one in and then you have to fight for your life,'' the Crimson coach, Joe Restic, observed, referring to Harvard's early touchdown. ''It's probably the most frustrating game I've been in since I've been at Harvard.'' Harvard Strikes Quickly It looked as if things might be easy for the Crimson when Santiago, a fullback, ran 73 yards with a pitchout to score with the game only 50 seconds old. Rob Steinberg added the extra point. But Cornell, 0-4 for the season and 0-2 in Ivy play, came right back, driving to the Harvard 1. The Big Red was stymied, however, when Jeff Bassell, the fullback, fumbled the ball away on an off-tackle play. Cornell was not through, however. The Big Red scored on Tony Baker's 9-yard-run late in the first period, although it still trailed when Bill Goldy's extra-point attempt was wide to the right. Harvard moved to a 14-6 lead when Joel Seay ran 19 yards on a reverse late in the second period, and the Crimson added a 23-yard field goal by Steinberg early in the third quarter. Cornell stayed in the game, however, moving 80 yards in 12 plays, with Miller scoring on a 1-yard run. A 2-point conversion attempt failed. Harvard moved ahead by 24-12 on Brian White's 9-yard pass to Mark Vignali with 52 seconds left in the third quarter. But once again Cornell closed its deficit. A high snap on a Harvard punt play went awry, and Cornell's Jeff Palazzese recovered on the Crimson 3 with 9:21 remaining in the game. Baker hurdled into the end zone from the 1 and, after another bid for a 2-point conversion failed, Harvard led by only 6 points. Then came Santiago's fumble and Cornell's final, but futile drive.

631-> WALTON ASSAILS JETS' OFFENSE
It is Coach Joe Walton who runs the Jets' offense, who sends in all its plays. And today he said that offense ''stunk'' in the 23-17 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers on Thursday night. His description may have been charitable. The Jets, before a home-opener crowd of 70,564 at Giants Stadium, inched their way to a total of 176 yards, and everyone on the offensive unit seemed confused. Pat Ryan, trying desperately to avoid defenders who blitzed repeatedly, looked in vain for open receivers downfield. The line and the backs never knew which hole the blitzers were coming through. Reggie McElroy, the left tackle, up against the veteran Keith Gary, was flagged four times for holding, a weakness that had been a factor in the waiving of his predecessor, Chris Ward. Freeman McNeil rushed for only 30 yards and an average of only 2.5, and was ineffective in picking up the blitz. Asked today to pinpoint the problem, Walton said: ''It was the whole offense. They stunk.'' Perhaps this level of play should not have been surprising. Ryan, after all, was making only his second start as a pro, and so was McElroy. This was only McNeil's second extended appearance since he came down with a problem in a ''tired leg.'' And the No. 1 receiver, Wesley Walker, was playing only his second game of the summer - preseason or regular season - after his contract holdout. But, after the Jets' record had fallen to 1-1, this fact remained: Of the five touchdowns they had scored in their first two games, one had been tallied by a defender, Greg Buttle, on a fumble recovery, and another on a 97-yard kickoff return, by Bobby Humphery opening the second half against the Steelers. Further, all the offense's three touchdowns and two field goals have been positioned by turnovers forced by the defense or the special teams. In the game Thursday night, Ryan had completed only 8 of 22 passes until the Steelers gave him over-the- middle shots on the last drive, as time was running out. He wound up 11 for 27, and for the two games is averaging only 5.16 yards an attempt. In spreading the blame, Walton said: ''The Pittsburgh Steelers' defense intimidated our offense. It beat the heck out of them.'' Walton reiterated today what he had said after the game Thursday night: that he intended to start Ryan in the next game, at home against Cincinnati on Sept. 16. Said Ryan: ''There were two key mistakes on my part: the fumble, and when I underthrew Wesley and it was intercepted. They got a touchdown off the fumble, and we missed a chance for a touchdown on the underthrown ball.'' The fumble came in the third quarter with the Jets leading by 14-13. Ryan was backpedaling, and McNeil, cutting by, hit the ball out of his hands. The Steelers recovered on the Jets' 13 and scored three plays later, when David Woodley lofted a pass to Weegie Thompson, who leaped over the inexperienced Davlin Mullen in the end zone. Then, in the fourth quarter, with New York trailing by 23-17, Ryan threw deep down the middle, looking for Walker. The underthrow caused the pass to be intercepted by Sam Washington, the first of three interceptions of Ryan in the last quarter. McElroy's four holding penalties also nullified big plays, and each time his number, 68, was announced, there was booing, reminiscent of New York fans' reaction to Ward. The first penalty wiped out an 8-yard passing gain on the final drive of the first half, the second a 6-yard Ryan scramble, the third an 18-yard Ryan run to the 1, and the fourth, in the final quarter, a 21-yard completion to Walker. O'Brien Denies Brawling Ken O'Brien, the Jet quarterback, testified yesterday at his Manhattan assault trial that he did not engage in a late-night brawl at the Studio 54 midtown discoth eque last September. In fact, he said, he tried to break up the fight, which left three men injured, two with broken noses. O'Brien and a teammate, Mark Gastineau, are being tried together in Manhattan Criminal Court on misdemeanor charges of assaulting the three men. The trial is now three weeks old and is expected to go to the six-member jury by next Wednesday. Giants Expect Stars Back EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., Sept. 7 - The Giants expect both Harry Carson and Dave Jennings to play against the Dallas Cowboys here Sunday. Carson, the linebacker and defensive captain, suffered bruised ribs against the Philadelphia Eagles last weekend, as did Jennings.

632-> MANAGER OF FAULTED MISSILE PLANT IS REPLACED
The Hughes Aircraft Corporation, hoping to stave off a Government halt in payments for faulty missiles, announced late today that it would replace a key manager in the manufacturing division of its trouble-plagued plant in Tucson, Ariz. Hughes took the action as the Air Force was considering another effort by the company to avert a cutoff in funds. That effort was the submission of an emergency plan to correct workmanship and quality-control problems at the plant, where several major United States missiles are manufactured. A spokesman for the company said A. H. J. Mueller, 57 years old, manager of the Hughes missile systems manufacturing division in Tucson, would be transferred to the Hughes ground-system group in Fullerton, Calif., where he would be group vice president and director of administration. The spokesman, Hal Watkins, said Mr. Mueller would be replaced by Frank A. Kramer, 55, a 20-year veteran at Hughes who has spent the last 12 years at the company's space and communications group in El Segundo, Calif. Quality-Control Specialist Mr. Watkins said Mr. Kramer's previous job focused on ''quality assurance and product reliability in the production area.'' Mr. Watkins declined to say whether the management shake-up was a result of the recent quality control troubles at the Tucson plant. He said he could not speculate on what other management changes might take place. On Tuesday a military contracting officer at the Tucson plant notified company officials that a monthly payment of more than $30 million would be suspended on three major weapon projects for the Navy, Air Force and Army because of shoddy workmanship. The Air Force, which oversees the projects, is now studying a reply delivered by Hughes 24 hours later. Military officials assured Congress as recently as the end of May that missile production problems at the aircraft company in Tucson had been solved. Yet three major weapon projects worth billions of dollars have been halted at the plant this summer because of poor workmanship. Navy experts testified last March at closed hearings of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense that problems at Hughes on the AIM-54C Phoenix missile ''have been solved and a revised delivery schedule has been submitted by Hughes.'' Push to Solve Problems According to the testimony released earlier this month by the panel, the Navy reported that Hughes had been using special groups of managers and engineers to overcome manufacturing difficulties. But in June the Navy told Hughes it would stop accepting deliveries of the missiles because of shoddy construction. In closed testimony before the same House panel in May, Thomas E. Cooper, the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for research and development, said, ''There is no problem with the Maverick program,'' referring to the AGM-65D missile also built by Hughes in Tucson. Air Force officials reported to the subcommittee that although a review of the Hughes plant at the end of 1982 had disclosed ''weaknesses'' in production and scheduling, Hughes had made ''significant progress in resolving these problems.'' The officials added that ''incorrect'' quality control methods were ''no longer a problem'' at the plant. But this week the Air Force Contracting Management Division at Kirtland Air Force Base, N.M., announced that payments to Hughes on the Maverick missile might be suspended because of poor workmanship and management failures. The suspension would also apply to the Navy's Phoenix program and the Army's EGM-71 TOW missile, which is also built at the Tucson plant. A Hughes spokesman said today that all missile assembly work in Tucson had been halted voluntarily while the company tried to correct its problems. The Air Force has demanded that Hughes submit a plan by Sept. 1 to solve the production deficiencies. Warning About Conflicts In late June, Ompal S. Chauhan, chief of manufacturing assessment for the Air Force's management division, warned a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee of possible management conflicts at the Hughes plant. ''In one instance,'' he said, ''the Air Force plant representative office commander and three Maverick program managers are currently working for the contractor.'' These same people, he added, ''were responsible for overseeing and managing the Maverick program for the Government immediately prior to their employment by Hughes.'' The Phoenix, Maverick and TOW missile projects represent some of the highest priority areas of American weapons production. Each has been under development for many years, with new models being produced to meet advances in the enemy's ability to counter them. Status of 3 Missiles The Navy's AIM-54C Phoenix, an air- to-air missile, has not yet joined the active fleet, which still uses AIM-54A models about 10 years old. The Air Force has taken delivery of only 68 AGM-65D Mavericks, a heat-seeking air-to-ground missile designed to destroy tanks. The Army's EGM-71 TOW missile, known as TOW-2, which is also meant for use against tanks, is in wide service with some 19,000 deployed. In its report on the military budget authorization bill for the fiscal year 1985, the House Armed Services Committee said it was ''concerned about the apparent proliferation of anti- armor systems and the inability of the Department of Defense to develop and implement a comprehensive anti- armor plan.'' For example, the report said, the panel ''had been unable to obtain an adequate explanation of the major reasons'' why the Air Force selected a heat-seeking version of Maverick while the Marine Corps chose a laser-guided model for the same combat purposes. ''This is particularly disturbing,'' the report added, given that the Pentagon ''will request in excess of $20 billion for anti-armor weapons'' over the next five years.

633-> FOR ARMSTRONG, PAINS ARE LINGERING
DENVER EARLY last Wednesday morning, Otis Armstrong stood silent and motionless at a hearing in a Denver district court, listening to a judge explain the felony charges against him. Armstrong looked timid and scared, a far cry from the bold and powerful running back he was for the Denver Broncos through most of the 1970's. Just five days before, a Denver grand jury had returned an indictment, charging him with seven counts of illegally obtaining large quantities of Percodan, an addictive pain-killer that contains a controlled substance. The indictment said that by ''fraud, deceit, misrepresentation, subterfuge and concealment,'' Armstrong had obtained nearly 1,500 tablets of Percodan from nine doctors within a six- month period. Each count carries a maximum possible sentence of two years in jail. According to the Physician's Desk Reference, a standard pharmaceutical text, Percodan contains an opium alkaloid and can be habit-forming; the normal adult dosage is one every six hours. The day the indictment was made public, Armstrong admitted that he took, on average, 8 to 10 Percodan tablets a day to reduce the pain from a back injury that he says ended his football career in 1980. He also said that the pain could be so intense that he would ''go to the moon'' to get more of the drug if he had to. At Wednesday's hearing, Judge J. Stephen Phillips warned him that anything he said could be used against him in a trial. Armstrong said nothing in the courtroom, and later, outside the courtroom, he maintained the silence. His attorney insisted that his client was innocent and that at a hearing scheduled for Sept. 12, when Armstrong would be asked to enter his plea, they would move for the charges to be dropped. ''Our position will be that he committed no crime,'' James W. Robnett said. ''But we will be prepared to vigorously defend ourselves against the charges.'' The possibility that Armstrong might have to defend himself against such charges is just another episode in an arduous and painful process that the former player has dealt with for more than three years because of the questions about the origin of his back injury. These difficultes also reflect a dark side of professional football, a side barely known to anyone outside of those who play the game. And they illustrate what can happen when a player is unprepared for life beyond footall because of the sudden nature of his departure from the game. Since his final game, Armstrong's life has been strewn with doctors, lawyers, conflicting medical opinions, lawsuits, hearings, meetings, examinations, physical pain, emotional pain and now, the prospect of going to jail. Armstrong has contended in court documents, medical files and benefit- claim forms that he first injured his back and neck in training camp in 1979 and the conditions were aggravated in a game against the Houston Oilers Nov. 2, 1980, which was to be the final game of his career. The Broncos have contended that the condition team doctors later discovered was congenital and, therefore, not related to playing football. Armstrong has sought relief since 1981 in several ways: - He filed for workmen's compensation benefits through the N.F.L. Players Association and for additional benefits through the state of Colorado. - He sued seven Denver-area doctors, including the two Broncos' team physicians and two neurological groups, for $24 million, charging them all with ''fraudulent concealment'' of injuries suffered in the 1980 game against the Oilers. - He began taking large quantities of the powerful Percodan tablets to help ease the pain, which he contends is still with him. So far, none of those avenues has brought him complete satisfaction or permanent relief: The N.F.L. Retirement Board is still considering his case for additional benefits. The Colorado Division of Labor denied and dismissed his claims for disability and permanent benefits, although it ruled that he was entitled to a maximum of $20,000 for medical expenses. Armstrong has until tomorrow to appeal the ruling. The suit against the doctors was dismissed because he failed to attend a deposition hearing. And obtaining the Percodan has forced him to confront the possibility of spending 14 years in jail. On the advice of Robnett, Armstrong declined several opportunities to discuss any aspect of his predicament. Robnett did not make himself available to discuss the matter, either. But through interviews with doctors, lawyers, current and former Broncos executives and N.F.L. union officials, Armstrong's unfortunate and unresolved story emerges. Armstrong came to the Broncos as their first-round college draft choice from Purdue in 1973. After gaining 4,453 yards in more than seven seasons with the Broncos - he led the National Footall League in rushing in 1974 with 1,407 - he was forced to retire as a result of injuring his back in the 1980 game against the Oilers. After examining him, team doctors told him that he had a congenital problem in the vertebrae, and they advised him that to continue playing would be to risk paralysis. Fred Gehrke, who was the Broncos' general manager at the time and is now the executive director of football operations for the Denver Gold of the United States Football League, said that the Broncos' doctors stressed the severity of the injury to Armstrong and ''did everything they could to make sure he didn't play again.'' Armstrong, he added, ''wasn't happy with that.'' The Broncos, meanwhile, with no choice but to accept the recommendation of the doctors, urged Armstong to retire, which he did after he failed a physical examination given by the team before the start of training camp the following summer. As a result, Armstrong received $37,500, the maximum benefit to which he was entitled at the time for a career-ending injury. Armstrong thought he was entitled to more. According N.F.L.P.A. records, Armstrong filed a workmen's compensation claim with the union March 11, 1981, saying that he was entitled to additional benefits because his injury should be classified as ''total and permanent,'' a special category for players such as Darryl Stingley, the New England Patriots' wide receiver who was paralyzed after being injured in an exhibition game in 1977. Armstrong sought the maximum benefit allowable under the Bert Bell N.F.L. Retirement Plan for such an injury, assuming it is football-related - $1,000 a month for a maximum of 60 payments. With his claim, union records show, Armstrong submitted reports from five Denver-area doctors, including one from Dr. Louis M. Radetsky, all of which said that Armstrong's injury came as a result of playing football. The recent indictment names Dr. Radetsky as one of the doctors who prescribed Percodan for Armstrong. The indictment says that Dr. Radetsky wrote two presciptions, each for 35 tablets. Dr. Radetsky, who is a certified hospital inspector for the American Hospital Association and is no longer practicing medicine, confirmed that he though that Armstrong's injury was ''incurred on the football field.'' He also said that Armstrong ''is a sick man.'' He would not comment, however, on any aspect of the indictment. Under the terms of the collective- bargaining agreement between the players and the owners at the time he filed his claim, Armstrong was required to be examined by a ''neutral'' physician in his area. That doctor, union records show, was Robert Mack, a Denver-area orthopedic surgeon, who examined Armstrong several weeks after he filed his claim with the union. However, according to union records, Dr. Mack's report to the board did not indicate whether Armstrong's injury was congenital or football-related. ''I side-stepped the issue of what caused the injury,'' Dr. Mack said, referring to his initial report to the union. He added that his report only said that Armstrong had had a ''narrow cervical spinal canal'' and that for him to continue playing football would be ''hazardous and dangerous.'' No action on the matter was taken for six months. It was then discussed at a meeting in San Francisco of the N.F.L. Retirement Board, a panel of three union and three management representatives that determines medical benefits, if any, in cases of dispute. At that meeting, the management representatives asked for further clarification of the cause of the injury. The matter was not taken up again for another seven months. Then, meeting in New York, the board considered a letter from Dr. Mack, in which he said that it was his opinion Armstrong ''was born'' with the condition. The union repesentatives at the meeting made a motion to get another opinion by having Armstrong be examined by a neutral neurologist, not an uncommon procedure. That was put to a vote, and the result was 3-3. The union then moved that the matter be taken to arbitration, and again the vote was 3-3. No further action was taken. Before the matter was discussed again, the 1982 season started, then stopped two weeks later because of the players' strike. Armstrong's case was not taken up again until a retirement board meeting March 8, 1983, at which time the motion that he see a neurosurgeon passed unanimously. Union records show that on Nov. 14, 1983, Armstrong was examined by Dr. Jack Klapper, a Denver neurosurgeon, who said in a report that was read at a retirement board meeting on Key Biscayne, Fla., a month after Armstrong was examined, that the injury was football-related. According to the terms of the new collective-bargaining agreement, if either side still questions the medical evidence, it has the right to take a case to a medical advisory board, which is composed of three doctors - one selected by the players, one by management and one by the two doctors. That board's medical opinion becomes ''final and binding,'' according to Sargent Karch of the N.F.L. Management Council. In Armstrong's case, the players selected Dr. Carl MacCarte of Washington, the owners selected Dr. James Nicholas of New York, and, so far, they have not chosen a third doctor. Karch said that the Armstrong case has taken so long to resolve because ''a lot of doctors disagree with one another.'' Miki Yaras, the N.F.L.P.A.'s director of benefits, agreed. ''This case is highly unusual,'' she said. ''We see a lot of back conditions, but seldom one to this extreme. At least all the doctors agreed on one thing: if this man had ever stepped on a football field again, he could have ended up a paraplegic.'' Meanwhile, last November, Armstrong, without using an attorney, sued two team doctors, James P. McElhinney and Richard D. Talbott, five other doctors and two Denver- area neurological groups for concealing the true nature of the injury. Armstrong said in his complaint, filed with the district court in Denver, that the team physicians had diagnosed the injury as being congenital in nature and that he was ''not informed of any type of injury'' until Feb. 7, 1983. Armstrong also said in the complaint that subsequent tests made in a Chicago hospital revealed numerous fractures in his cervical spine, spinal column and thoracic spine; and that his spinal column had ''shifted.'' He contended that an initial neck injury in July 1979 was weakened by subsequent injuries while playing football. The case was dismissed this February after Armstrong failed to make a deposition in January, in which the attorney representing the doctors intended to ask him to produce the medical records that substantiated his claims. When he did not show up, Peter Pryor, the attorney, asked the court to subpoena the records and schedule a second deposition. Again, Armstrong failed to appear. At that point, the case was thrown out. ''Since then,'' Pryor said last week, ''We haven't heard a thing from him.'' According to the indictment, Armstrong's involvement with Percodan began on or about Oct. 17, 1983, when he received the first of 24 prescriptions he would obtain within the next six months. The prescriptions ranged in quantities of 6 to 150 pills and were written by eight Denver-area doctors and one from Chicago. The doctor who prescribed the largest number of Percodan tablets for Armstrong, according to the indictment, was Bernard R. Lerner of Chicago, who wrote seven prescriptions - 2 for 150 tablets, 4 for 120 and 1 for 100. Leonard Miller, an attorney representing Dr. Lerner, said that the number of tablets prescribed by Dr. Lerner, was, in the doctor's view, ''within the proper area of amounts for that period of time.'' Miller also said that Dr. Lerner had not been aware that other doctors had been prescribing Percodan for Armstrong at the same time. None of the doctors named in the indictment was charged with anything; however, Detective Ed Roy of the Denver Police Department told The Denver Post the day the indictment was handed down that the investigation of Armstrong grew out of an investigation of prescription practices of various Denver-area pharmacies. When contacted for further comment, Detective Roy said that he had been ''ordered'' not to discuss further the Armstrong case and referred all questions to William G. Meyer, the special deputy district attorney. He declined to comment on the case involving Armstrong or the one alluded to by Detective Roy. Armstrong, meanwhile, is still in pain, and with the possibility that he might have to stand trial, it could get worse before it gets better.

634-> FOLLOW-UP ON THE NEWS ; Sobering Up
They came in casual clothes, carrying spare clothing in overnight bags. They lined up, 150 strong, waiting to go to jail in Nashville. The mass incarceration in July was the second in the city in a month for people convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. It was intended to cut a backlog of 1,100 convicted offenders, many of whom had been waiting six months to serve mandatory terms. Under a Tennessee law passed in 1983, even first offenders get a minimum of 48 hours in jail and a $50 fine. After the drivers had served their terms in July, an official in charge of the program observed, ''Most of the people said they were not ever going to be arrested again.'' Maybe. Over the weekend, as the monthly jailings continued and 250 more drivers were scheduled to do time, Sheriff Lafayette Thomas was asked whether the backlog was being cut. ''We've already jailed 700,'' he said. ''And after this we'll still have a backlog of 1,100. We'll never get caught up - it's like balancing the budget.'' He doubted that the tough law was a deterrent. ''Since 1974,'' he said, ''we've averaged between 5,000 and 5,500 convictions a year, and we'll have that many this year.''

636-> TV NOTES; JESSE JACKSON TO BE A GUEST HOST
Dick Ebersol, the executive producer of ''Saturday Night Live,'' had just found out that his program had agreed to terms with the Rev. Jesse Jackson under which Mr. Jackson would host the program's Oct. 20 segment, and he was excited. Mr. Ebersol said the upcoming 10th season of the program was his chance ''to light things on fire for one last time,'' and this seemed like just the right way to start. ''I've been trying to arrange it for a month,'' Mr. Ebersol said. ''Not only is he one of the two or three most charismatic public figures in America, but his constituency is demographically the same as our audience, 20 to 40, and whether they love him or respond to him negatively, they still respond to him.'' Mr. Ebersol said he thought Mr. Jackson's main impetus to appear on the comedy show was to ''get people registered.'' However, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee said that the deadline for voter registration in most states was at least 30 days before the election, which will take place Nov. 6. Mr. Jackson's appearance will be only 18 days before the election. Nevertheless, Mr. Ebersol said that ''here he can get 25 million people in 90 minutes.'' ''On news,'' he went on, ''you get a minute or 45 seconds if you're lucky. Or you get relegated to a Sunday morning show where you get a 3 rating.'' Mr. Jackson is far from the first political guest to appear as a host on ''Saturday Night Live.'' Ron Nessen, President Ford's press secretary, appeared in 1976 in that role. Other hosts have included Julian Bond, Ralph Nader, Senator George S. McGovern, and Mayor Koch. All have been paid the same $5,000 fee, which none of them seem to have found the most valuable reward for appearing as host of the program. ''George McGovern called after his host week,'' Mr. Ebersol related, ''and said that nothing he had ever done on television had ever had the kind of impact that appearance had.'' Mr. Jackson, like the other political guests, will work on his own scripts with the ''Saturday Night Live'' staff, in the week preceding the broadcast. ''Every host that has ever done 'Saturday Night Live' has the final editorial say over every word that comes out of their mouths,'' Mr. Ebersol said. ''The other side of the coin is that they are bounded by normal rulings. It means a lot to Jackson to touch on, briefly and comedically, the importance that everyone vote. Can he ask people to vote for Mondale? No - then you're running into the equal-time law.'' Even though Mr. Jackson won't get to endorse a candidate, as a Democratic leader on television a short time before the election, he is expected to have some impact. A Democratic Party spokesman said he thought the television time would not be a waste for their cause. ''An hour and a half of network television time on a Saturday night?'' he asked. ''That's a good way to reach the Yuppie vote.'' Fluent 'Saturday' Co-Star One other announcement Mr. Ebersol had to make this week was the final addition to the cast of ''Saturday Night Live.'' The program was shy of women, and various rumors had run around about possible choices. It turns out that the producers - Mr. Ebersol and Robert Tischler - have selected the British comedienne Pamela Stephenson, known in England for her appearances on ''Not the Nine o'Clock News,'' and here for her role as a villainess in ''Superman III.'' ''The main thing we wanted to know,'' Mr. Ebersol said, ''was whether she could do American accents. She went to Los Angeles, watched television there for a week, and when she came back, she could do 40. We hired her.'' CBS Back on First There was a certain amount of discomfort at CBS News over the fact that ABC, in the wake of its Olympic summer, had overtaken the usually dominant ''CBS Evening News With Dan Rather'' in the ratings for the weeks during the games, and, in fact, had finished first during the Republican National Convention among viewers, according to the A. C. Nielsen Company's count. The CBS program has, however, returned to its longstanding No. 1 spot. Last week, CBS pulled in a 10.5 rating, ABC's ''World News Tonight'' got a 9.5, and the ''NBC Nightly News'' received an 8.4. Each rating point is equal to one percent of the 83.8 million television viewing households in the United States. Update on Union and NBC The dispute between NBC and the National Association of Broadcast Engineers and Technicians, which caused some anxiety for the network earlier in the summer, may be moving toward a resolution: The union leadership is presenting the network's latest proposal to its membership, making no recommendation. ''Mostly, we're talking about new technology and whose jurisdiction its use is,'' said Larry Dworkin, a union spokesman. ''We're trying to keep the changes in the technology from affecting our definition of work jurisdiction. We don't object to the new technology, but we don't want things like computers in the sports field being used by unrepresented people like production assistants. The network wants on-air talent to be able to operate technology.'' An NBC spokesman said the network thought the matter might be near settlement.

637-> DISCORD ON PLATFORM IN G.O.P. YIELDS TO EUPHORIA
There were cannon to the right of President Reagan and cannon to the left of him. Or perhaps, muted as the volleys were by the spreading Republican euphoria, they might better be characterized as popguns. While Walter F. Mondale, the Democratic Presidential nominee, criticized the Republican platform as ''almost kook-right,'' the Republican Party's most conservative leaders held a news conference today to complain. Richard A. Viguerie, chairman of Coalitions for America, Howard Phillips, chairman of the Conservative Caucus, and other leaders of the new right said the platform's conservative tilt pleased them, but they expressed fear that the President might go back on the platform's pledge not to raise taxes. Mr. Viguerie said, ''I would not advise you to bet the farm that they are going to keep the promises in this platform any better than they did the last platform.'' Warning for President They warned Mr. Reagan that, the second time around, he should not listen to such Republicans as James A. Baker, his chief of staff, and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas and that he should stop, as Mr. Phillips put it, ''accommodating the big bang, big business, corporatist, pro-detente wing of the party.'' Mr. Viguerie said that if Mr. Reagan listened to moderate pleas for a tax increase to balance the budget, there could well be a revolt among Republicans, resulting in the emergence of a conservative third party. Two hours later, the criticism came from the other direction. Still smarting over the pummeling they suffered on the platform, a group of mainstream Republicans, including Representative Jim Leach of Iowa, held a news conference to complain. ''It certainly doesn't surprise me that the platform is constructed as it is,'' said Mary Crisp, a former co- chairman of the Republican National Committee, who is now a business consultant in Washington. ''It's almost a repeat performance of 1980. They neglect to understand that the equal rights amendment is an economic and civil rights issue for women. The Administration has a pattern of indifference to women, not only in rhetoric but in fact.'' A 'Ronald Reagan Show' But as the delegates streamed into town, and as elephants and flags and Mr. Reagan's smiling face appeared everywhere, most Republicans here seemed ready today to put the platform divisions behind them and savor the formal nomination of their popular candidate. ''This is the Ronald Reagan show, that's all,'' said Ronna Romney, the incoming national committeewoman from Michigan, the daughter-in-law of one of the party's best-known moderates of another time, George Romney. ''These are not the Rockefeller years,'' said Colleen Engler, a Michigan representative. ''They're the Reagan years.'' The women, who described themselves as moderates, made their remarks at a breakfast party at the Hyatt Hotel pool celebrating Mrs. Romney's new post. Mrs. Engler, who pointed out that Michigan voted 2 to 1 for George Bush in its 1980 Republican primary, said she was not worried about the conservative platform. They Trust Bush ''After his election, Reagan surprised a lot of people by showing he was a person open to every point of view,'' she said. ''He appointed moderate advisers and Cabinet members. Now we trust him.'' Mrs. Engler was also philosophical about the platform, saying that the conservative trend was a reflection of society, not just the party. ''I went to a Neil Diamond concert in Detroit last night,'' she said, ''and he sang 'The Star Spangled Banner.' Can you imagine anyone doing that in the 60's? Then, people were wearing the flag on the seat of their pants.'' Ranny Reicker, the outgoing Michigan committeewoman, an advocate of a Federal equal rights amendment, was also sanguine. ''It worries me that the platform appears to send a message shutting too many people out,'' she said. ''But I think the platform is just sound and fury. Now we can go on and do the things that we know are important. I think the President has done a good job of seeking the center, especially compared with the far left positions of Mondale.'' Criticism of Rights Move Although she had criticized the platform's dismissal of the equal rights amendment, Mrs. Reicker said she did not consider it a dead issue. ''We'll continue to fight in state legislatures,'' she said. ''We'll try again.'' She said she did not believe that women at the convention were merely ''window dressing,'' as Miss Crisp and other moderate women have said. ''There is a real strong desire in the Administration to put women in prominent positions that they're well qualified for,'' she said. The buoyant mood of the delegates was heightened by their perception that the Democratic Party's momentum from their convention had been sapped by the controversy over the financial disclosures of Mr. Mondale's running mate, Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro of Queens. ''The financial thing has been handled abysmally,'' said Mrs. Romney. ''Within a week, they have problems.''

638-> HOME DESIGN; ROOM FOR SERIOUS CHILD'S PLAY
THE CLIENT ALWAYS HAS CERTAIN design priorities. For 7-year-old Tony, having enough space to play with his prized collection of model cars was more important than almost anything else. Fortunately, his and his parents' architects, Ben Benedict and Carl Pucci of BumpZoid, understood. Once upon a time, when they were little boys, they too enjoyed toy cars. Working from memory, the architects created a miniature city - a child's universe that fits inside a Manhattan apartment room that is only 13 feet by 13 feet. The scale of Tony's favorite car determined each piece of furniture. In fact, Benedict confesses that he borrowed a car - just to test it out for size. Nearly every piece of furniture can be played on: Bed tables, which open up for storage, are also roadways. Shelving on either side of the windows features a pair of skyscrapers capped with flashing beacons. ''The idea was that Tony could drive his fire truck up to these buildings and, with the aid of his miniature ladder, climb to the top,'' says Pucci. ''Young architects rarely have the chance to build skyscrapers,'' he adds. ''We have designed two and a half.'' The half skyscraper conceals the reading lamp over Tony's bed. It is meant to be the skeleton of a building. ''We started it; Tony can visually finish it,'' says Benedict. Both architects remember staring at the ceiling at night and trying to get to sleep, pretending the cracks in the paint overhead were horizons or buildings or race tracks. Thus, they designed a special ceiling light that has four skyscrapers pointing toward each other. When Tony lies in bed and stares at the ceiling, he can feel as though he's looking through a porthole into the city. What's here is much more than just kid's stuff, however. All the woodwork is extremely well designed and crafted out of cherry. The trundle bed, for example, works so the top bed cantilevers out for easy making; the bottom bed slides out by raising a flap on the side. The desk adjusts to grow as Tony does. And the chair, the cockpit of the room, is on rollers. ''The design is meant to be lasting,'' says Benedict, ''to have visual interest long after the model cars are packed away.''

639-> AROUND THE WORLD; Swazis Said to Hand Guerrillas to South Africa
The African National Congress said at its Lusaka headquarters today that Swaziland had handed over four members of the group to South Africa. The congress, the main guerrilla movement against white rule in South Africa, said the four, who had been held by the Swazi police at Bhunya, were taken from their cells April 14 and were now in custody in Pretoria. South Africa's Law and Order Minister, Louis LeGrange, said in Parliament this week that Swaziland had expelled a number of African National Congress members, but he made no reference to any being turned over to Pretoria. The Swazi Government says the guerrillas entered the country illegally after expulsion from Mozambique. Both Mozambique and Swaziland have signed security accords with South Africa, in which each pledged not to harbor insurgents fighting the other.

640-> Help for Would-Be Property Recyclers; Preservationists Aid in Navigating A Complex Route
SCATTERED around Connecticut are dozens of dilapidated theaters, hotels, rectories, schools and factory buildings that lie vacant because their owners, often nonprofit groups of municipalities, have not been able to devise a recycling formula for them that works. Preservationists have found that these entities often do not understand the complexities of finding a new use, financing the conversion and working with the community to make the project economically feasible. Even some of the properties most worth saving -- those listed on the National Register of Historic Places -- are in trouble. Fewer than half of the 14,000 Connecticut buildings on the register have been renovated or restored, according to John Herzan, National Register specialist with the Connecticut Historical Commission, a state agency. "One of the difficulties," said Richard Behr, professor of historic preservation at the Yale School of Architecture and a real-estate developer with Maitland Strauss Behr of Greenwich, "is that we are not talking about the most attractive buildings any more. What is left today are the problem' buildings, the lesser ones in the town." Further hampering recycling, according to Sandy Doig, an architect and developer with Monro, Jennings and Doig, a real-estate development company in Farmington, has been the ambivalence of many nonprofit owners about their property. "They are loathe to sell," he said, "because that house or estate was probably left to the parish or charity as a bequest. And nobody wants to be tagged as the trustee who sold a valuable asset." And if the organization or religious group keeps the building, he added, it usually has deep concern that any new use be compatible with the group's own charitable or cultural goals -- only to discover that these aims sometimes clash with the economic considerations of the banks and the private-sector professionals who can put up the money and take part of the developement risk. "A lot of us have had to walk away from projects because of this problem," Mr. Behr said. The result, he said, is that the building may decay further, never to regain a use. To overcome this gap in communications and demonstrate that owners, lenders, developers and community leaders can gain by working together, the Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation Recently held a workshop in Hartford called "The Basics of Real Estate Development -- a Primer for Nonprofit Groups." Three key factors need to be addressed before restoration and recycling can proceed, Mr. Behr told the 50 people attending the workshop. They are market needs, financing sources and the architectural suitability for the proposed use. An objective analysis of the marketplace is vital, he said. The new use must be able to generate sufficient return to make the project attractive to investors or bankers. He said the questions that must be asked were whether the neighborhood could support the rents needed to sustain the project and whether there would be a demand for the type of accommodations to be offered. Financing, he said, involves understanding not only the various source of capital but also why investors or bankers would agree to take on the project. A new source of funds Mr. Behr recommended to the group is the Federal 515 program of the Farmers' Home Administration. This program offers lowcost financing to communities of less than 25,000 population that can demonstrate a real housing need -- "and that must include most Connecticut towns," he said. Mr. Doig, who also spoke at the workshop, said it was important for owners of one or two buildings in a rundown neighborhood to understand that they were unlikely to generate interest from developers or lenders unless a "critical mass" of buildings was simultaneously recycled. "You cannot attract people to live or work in a neighborhood if they don't feel safe and comfortable," he said. He, too, emphasized that understanding a lender's profit motive was critical even though the property might be held by a nonprofit group. "Most lenders are mandated to make money for their investors," he said. Thus, while middle- or lower-income housing might be a worthy new use, he said, it might fail to satisfy the lender who foresees default a few years down the road. A more realistic use must then be found. And this increasingly requires creativity. Karen Gilvarg, a former development administrator with New Haven, spoke of a Romaneseque brownstone church downtown which fell into disuse late in the 70's. Everyone wanted the church saved, she recalled, but a city study found it could an economic return either as housing or as office. WHAT had been overlooked, she said, was the need for a medical complex to serve the physicians connected to nearby hospitals. Today the former church is a thriving center for cardiologists. "Nobody thought of medical use," she said, "because traditionally these centers are in a modern building or a converted house." In other cases, Mr. Behr said, creative change may involve several types of use rather than just one, as is being suggested for a million-square-foot mill on the waterfront in Branford. These were among the other tips offered by the experts: Municipalities should place their historic buildings in a special zoning category that would allow noncomforming use. Owners should approach the town early in the recyclng process to discuss public help, either through tax abatements or street improvements. Such cooperation may help tip lenders in favor of financing. Neighborhood groups should be included in the initial planning, since fear of the unknown sometimes creates opposition. Any nonprofit group reluctant to sell its property should consider offering a developer a long-term lease or 20 years or more. This would allow a developer to obtain the necessary financing for restoration and to make it profitable for the period of the lease. Both municipalities and nonprofit groups were advised not to overvalue their properties if their immediate goal was to have them used in a way that would serve and upgrade a neighborhood. Instead, Mr. Doig said, the sells might more easily strike a deal by asking for a participatory interest in subsequent profits.

641-> FOUR EXCURSIONS IN THE METROPLEX
Dallas is large, sprawling and eager - not so intense as its rival city in Texas, Houston, but significantly more established. Houston has the energy and passion of a place that has just come into money; Dallas wants you to know that it has been around for a while. Dallas is not only more conservative politically, it has traditionally been more conservative architecturally. Its skyline is not as exciting and fresh as Houston's, but the tradeoff is that it has rarely fallen prey to the kind of more extreme vulgarities that frequently plague Houston. PAUL GOLDBERGER is the architecture critic of The New York Times. Dallas long ago passed through being a frontier city; its problem is that it has never, physically at least, settled on what kind of a mature identity it wants to have. San Antonio is Texas's city for quaint charm, Austin its political and academic center, neighboring Fort Worth still keeps some feeling of the prairie, and Houston, at least until the recent downturn in oil prices, was the state's great boom town. What was left for Dallas? It is still the state's premier financial and commercial center, it has a large share of the oil business, and it is continuing to grow. It still lacks the coherent identity of Texas's other large cities - but as Dallas gets bigger, it has begun to acquire once again some of the swagger that has long been part of its image. If the latest additions to the skyline are any indication, the swagger quotient is on the rise. No one walks too much in Texas, and certainly not in August, when the leap from air-conditioned car to air-conditioned building is considered major exposure to the elements. So it makes little sense to think of Dallas architecture in terms of the pedestrian's view, although downtown Dallas is a relatively tightly woven urban fabric, and the hardy can certainly cover it on foot. But for the most part the four architectural tours that follow, three of Dallas and one of Fort Worth, 45 miles from Dallas and architecturally interesting in its own right, are intended to be conducted by automobile. The Freeway Landscape: Airport To Downtown 1The freeway, lined with office buildings, shopping centers and hotels, is the urban form of the late 20th century. Perhaps it exists in its purest form in Houston, but the route from Dallas-Fort Worth Airport into downtown Dallas is as good a stretch as you will find anywhere - and it contains some of Dallas's most characteristic, if not its finest, architecture. Start, of course, with the airport itself, 10 years old this year. Local people are fond of reminding you that the place is bigger than Manhattan island, and you do not doubt it - in fact, some of the parking lots feel bigger than Manhattan island. D/FW, as it is called, is a dreary labyrinth of concrete, built to be efficient but really far too confusing to succeed. Designed by the architects Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum with the engineers Tippets, Abbott, McCarthy & Stratton, the airport was intended to show the world Dallas's commitment to bigness and to modern technology. It does that - what it does not do is show the world any commitment to making people feel comfortable. For that, you have to move on down the freeway. The landscape into Dallas along Route 183 is quiet at first, just beginning to be taken over by the sprawl of attached condominium town houses. It is easy to see how empty this land was until a few years ago. But the tempo picks up rapidly just a few miles toward Dallas - first a few pieces of the standard commercial strip, then a real reminder of Texas: a large, bunker-like concrete structure under construction that turns out to be the Calvary Temple, a huge house of worship on the freeway. It even has a futuristic spire thrust high in the air, to help the building hold its own beside the signs of the motels, gas stations and fast-food outlets that pop up with increasing frequency. The next few miles are a landscape of automobile dealers and motels - it seems hard to believe there are enough buyers in all of Texas for the number of cars you see here. And there is every kind of motel, including something called the Non-Smokers Inn. But the great visual event here, just before 183 slides into Interstate 35E, is Texas Stadium, the immense concrete stadium with a white fabric roof. It is an ungainly building, not nearly as graceful as a fabric structure can be - but its scale overwhelms everything around it, and turns the rest of the landscape into trivia. From here on in, you know you are in a land of prosperity - 6- and 10- and 12-story office towers get more and more frequent, in every shape and style. Most are dull; one that is not is One Brookhollow Plaza, on the left, designed by Paul Rudolph. Mobil's celebrated flying horse symbol is on the top of this 1969 structure, which has a crisply geometric concrete frame with glass panels set in. Its strong and handsome profile is a welcome change from the glittery boxes that make up most of the architecture along here - the worst of which must surely be the gold glass box of the Zale Corporation headquarters, on the right at Exit 433A, a building with masonry piers that rise like vertical stripes in the midst of glaring reflective glass. The Zale building was built in 1970 and designed by Harwood K. Smith & Partners. Once onto 35E, you approach the Mart area, Dallas's great merchandising and showroom center, most of which is the work of the developer Trammell Crow, whose Dallas-based firm is the nation's largest commercial builder. The white-framed Stemmons Towers, on the left, is a spare and disciplined complex, designed by Harold Berry and erected between 1962 and 1967; across the road is Stemmons Plaza, a sleek, rounded-corner high-rise. Just beyond, also on the right as you pass, is the dazzlingly reflective abstract glass box by Pickle Architects that houses ADP, the computer company, so mirrored that one can see the cars passing on the freeway in its facade. And next door to ADP is the Grenada Royale Homotel - an ordinary building with a red-tile roof, but one that, in its place on the freeway, raises a special question. ADP is super-sleek, super-modern. The Grenada is mock-Spanish, all fancied up. It is a striking juxtaposition - but which is the real Dallas? Just beyond, also on the right, is the Anatole Hotel, by Beran & Shellmayer, and that is another thing altogether. The Anatole is an overwhelming presence on the freeway, and one of the strangest large commercial buildings erected anywhere in the last few years. If the A.T.& T. Building in New York is the prince of the so-called post-modern movement, this building is its devil - a tall tower of red brick and glass, with a gargantuan mansard roof and immense dormers. The imagery is supposed to be that of a house, but it is blown up to the scale of a skyscraper, and it looks spooky - as do the interiors, which are built around a series of cavernous and unwelcoming atriums. This vast hotel is a sealed-off world in itself. Across the freeway is Braden & Chapman's Wyndham Hotel, no less odd - an oval tube of brown granite, its top sliced off at a rakish angle. Around Dallas it's called the Mennen Speed-stick, and the name is as good as any, for this gimmicky architecture hardly looks like a conventional building. Beyond the Wyndham, still on the left, is Trammell Crow's remarkable series of merchandise marts - the black World Trade Center is the most prominent, but the most unusual, and the only one that looks promising as a work of architecture, is the Infomart, still under construction. This mock-Victorian version of the Crystal Palace by Martin Growald, which will be a mart for the computer industry, is far enough along to give a sense of itself - though it is a stage set, it is a lot more interesting than the other buildings around. Finally, at the edge of downtown, perhaps the freeway's most successful stage set, the complex that surely wins the Most Like the Emerald City in the Wizard of Oz Award. It is the Hyatt Regency Hotel and the Reunion Tower, by Welton Becket & Associates, a stepped-back shape in reflective glass beside which is a tower topped by a sphere. The tower is a world's fair symbol in search of a world's fair, but no matter - this complex is a monument to romantic modernism, and its glitter, seen from the freeway, pulls you into Dallas like a magnet. Downtown Dallas 2Downtown Dallas is the one part of town that you can explore on foot if the spirit moves you - and if the weather cooperates. But this tour can be managed by automobile, too; some buildings can be seen adequately from a car window, while others will require brief parking stops. Directions, however, are given for the pedestrian - so there may be occasional times when one-way streets will require small detours for the motorist. Begin at Dealey Plaza at the western edge of downtown - not much in itself as a work of urban design (it could be called Dreary Plaza) but it is a place most visitors want to see at least once, for it is while passing this green open space that John F. Kennedy was killed. The former Texas School Book Depository looms overhead, a chilling vista for anyone with a memory of 1963, and the ''Old Red'' courthouse frames the plaza on the east. Farther south, the opposite end from the book depository, is old Union Terminal (1916, Jarvis Hunt) one of Dallas's few pieces of elegant Beaux-Arts classicism, now a complex of restaurants as well as a train station. Walk down Commerce Street and around to the front of the old courthouse, facing away from Houston Street onto a plaza devoted to the memory of President Kennedy. Philip Johnson's 1970 memorial is ahead; it is a concrete box on legs, open to the sky at the top. It is intended to provide an outdoor ''room,'' cut off from all but the sky, for contemplation; unfortunately, it does not manage the diffi cult feat of transcendence, and feels only harsh and dull within. The courthouse itself (1893, Orlopp & Kusener) is the more pleasing thing here - a reddish stone Romanesque building of unusual amiability. It contrasts all too naturally with its successor building, the Dallas County Courthouse of 1966 across Commerce Street - the old building portrays government as an embracing and comforting presence, the new one as dull bureaucracy. Walk through the Kennedy Memorial to Main Street, and turn right. Ahead, under construction, is Interfirst Plaza by JBJ Architects, one of Dallas's largest, if least distinguished, new buildings, an anxious composition of zigzags in reflective glass. Continue west on Main Street, to One Main Place by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, a gridded concrete box from 1968 that seems intended to discourage any human contact. Across Field Street, on the left, is the Davis Building, one of Dallas's finest old office towers - a classicizing building in limestone that once housed the Republic Bank. Return back to Field Street and turn left one block to Commerce Street. On the left will be the Adolphus Hotel, a Dallas landmark (1912, Barnett, Hayes & Barnett) recently restored and expanded with exceptional style by the Jerde Partnership and the West Group. This is a wonderful piece of lush eclecticism, a building with a kind of energetic frontier elegance, the Dallas equivalent of New York's Ansonia Hotel. The Adolphus is the real thing that the Anatole Hotel tries to imitate, and this time, for a change, renovation enhances rather than detracts from the original quality. Be sure to go inside; it is a world of potted palms and floral carpets that manages not to look tacky. Next door to the Adolphus, across Akard Street, is the Magnolia Building, once the Mobil Building (1921, Alfred C. Bossom), another of the few distinguished relics of an older age in Dallas's downtown. On the roof is Mobil's famous flying red horse, the most whimsical thing downtown and one of the city's beloved icons. The view of both the Adolphus and the Magnolia is best from the small public square across Commerce Street, where Akard has been closed. This is a good point for drivers, or very hardy walkers, to take a brief detour to City Hall, which is on Young Street, three blocks south of Commerce. (Pedestrians can walk through on Akard Street.) City Hall, completed in 1978, is I. M. Pei's major work in Dallas, and among the most ambitious civic buildings erected anywhere since the Boston City Hall. This strongly sculptural concrete building, its glass and masonry facade looming outward in a sharp reverse slope; it is a kind of last gasp of neo-Brutalist sculptural monumentality, done with Pei's inevitable finesse. The building does several things well. It is recognizable as Dallas's own, for there is nothing like it. It is recognizable as a public building. And it is rather handsome as a kind of abstraction. Still, it is a building that stops far short of greatness. It has a power, but not an approachable sort; the government it symbolizes is distant and imposing. And the huge, unshaded plaza serves only to create a further sense of separation and distance. Across Young Street is the city's new library, also a Pei design, very much in the active, geometric mold of his East Building of the National Gallery in Washington. At this point, return to the center of downtown by heading north on Ervay Street - or, if City Hall has been skipped, cross back toward the Adolphus on Commerce Street, and head north one block on Akard to Main Street. At Main, turn right, past the Praetorian Building, the garish white and gold relic of the 1960's (actually a 1907 building resheathed) that singlehandedly destroys what is an otherwise pleasing urban street. Go left on Ervay past the Wilson Building (1902, Sanguinnet & Staats), an exceptionally handsome piece of turn-of-the- century eclecticism with a badly altered ground floor. The full scope of detail here is best viewed from across the street in the plaza of the First City Center, designed by the WZMH Group, itself one of Dallas's better new skyscrapers. The window pattern and complex ground floor layout help give this a texture that is unusual among the city's new towers. There is a good view, too, from this plaza of the Republic Bank (1954, Harrison & Abramovitz), a building with stamped-metal sheathing and an unexpectedly whimsical spire - 1950's romanticism. Continue ahead to Thanks-giving Square, a triangular park in the center of the business district; its centerpiece is Philip Johnson and John Burgee's oddly mute, Tower-of-Babel-like chapel. Beyond the square on Ervay Street is I. M. Pei and Henry Cobb's Arco Tower, a sleek but never glib structure in gray granite and glass, very much like the same architects' Dallas Center, visible off to the right down Bryan Street. Both complexes are marked by an unusually successful balance between texture and modernist smoothness. At this point walkers may want to pause; there is a final leap to two of Dallas's most significant buildings, but they are a few blocks away. Continue on Ervay Street until it merges into Akard, then turn right on Ross Street for one block. On the left will be the sculpture garden entrance to the new Dallas Museum of Art, completed earlier this year to the designs of Edward Larrabee Barnes; it is one of the nation's finest new museums, and unquestionably Dallas's finest new work of public architecture - a formal, solid building that nonetheless manages to provide visual variety and sympathetic settings for a wide range of works of art. The museum is the first finished element in Dallas's new arts district, a special area that will eventually include a Pei-designed concert hall. Overlooking the district, and nearing completion, is the new LTV Tower at Ross and Harwood, by the Houston office of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. It looks to be that firm's best new skyscraper, and Dallas's - a tower of granite and glass that is elegantly profiled, with well-proportioned setbacks and a graceful pyramidal top. It is too early to see how successful the building will be at ground level, but from a distance, it is already far and away the best thing on the skyline. Wilson Block 3There are all kinds of ways to preserve old architecture, but one of the strangest is to pickle it. That is the sense you have at the Wilson Block, a row of splendid turn- of-the-century houses that have been exquisitely - almost too exquisitely - restored to serve as the headquarters for a range of civic organizations. The houses are wonderful and they could not have been restored more lovingly, but the place feels oddly like Disneyland in the shadow of skyscrapers. Swiss Avenue was once one of Dallas's great addresses, and still is farther east; these houses, the 2900 block, are in an edge-of-downtown neighborhood that deteriorated long ago. That they remained at all was rather remarkable, given the surroundings; more notable still is that they all remained in the hands of the Wilson family, which built them in the last years of the 19th century. In 1977 Lawrence Wilson, the son of the builders, decided finally to sell his parents' house at No. 2922 and the rest of the street, which had been built as rental properties. They went first to a builder, who had hoped to restore them as residences, and then to the Meadows Foundation, which undertook to restore the block as the joint home of numerous nonprofit organizations. The work, under the architect Keith Downing, was finished in 1983, although now restoration work goes on in the Beilharz block, one block closer to downtown. For all that is wrong with it, it is one of Dallas's absolute treasures - the houses themselves, especially the original Queen Anne- style Wilson house with its lovely rounded tower, are gracious and lyrical compositions. (Other details of note are the nice central gable in No. 2906 and the porch with its low, double columns at No. 2902.) All the houses are lower than their East Coast Victorian counterparts, so their proportions appear odd to Eastern eyes, but they are every bit as rambling and grand as their taller contemporaries. The colors - yellowish ivory with dark green trim for the Wilson house, pale green with deep red trim for another, blue for another - enhance the sense of unreality the street has, though they are said to be the original shades. So, too, does the generally sensible decision to hide parking behind the houses make the place all seem a bit unreal. Swiss Avenue is, on balance, a wonderful thing - it is only unfortunate that it enforces the assumption that history is cute, or that making it cute is the only way to give it validity in modern cities. Fort Worth 4Fort Worth for years celebrated the very cowtown identity that Dallas sought to deny. Now, it is less sure - there is a more ambivalent mix of sleek glass towers and old, rambling brick commercial structures. Start a tour, best done with a mixture of automobile and foot power, at the Tarrant County Courthouse on Weatherford Street opposite Main Street. This is an unusual and handsome building of reddish granite, completed in 1894; it mixes Romanesque with a touch of the Second Empire and, at a cost of $400,000, it was considered such a piece of architectural overreaching when it was built that the citizens voted out the entire slate of county commissioners. The courthouse faces down Main Street, which has just been repaved in brick and given new brick sidewalks, new lamps and street signs. Turn down Main Street to face a vista that is very much Fort Worth's - all the way at the end, the bulbous form of the convention center's arena blocks the street, but up close the view is framed by Paul Rudolph's unusual and ambitious First City Tower at 201 Main Street, the sharply modern Americana Hotel, and the restored turn-of-the-century buildings called Sundance Square, named to honor Harry Longbaugh, the Sundance Kid, who spent much of his time in Fort Worth. This section of Main Street is a particularly striking mix of new and old - one of the few such cases in which the new is more unconventional than the old. The Rudolph tower is one of a pair of recent buildings commissioned by the Bass brothers, the wealthy Fort Worth investors, who also underwrote Sundance Square. The structures mix the architect's characteristic muscular, strongly expressionistic structure with glass sheathing, and the combination is not entirely successful - the underlying structure seems at war with the glass coating, which seems to want to smother it. But the buildings are quite handsome at ground level, and even where they fail, they do so in a way that is deeply serious. The Americana, which has some interior spaces decorated by the New York architect Roger Ferri, is a concrete building whose water-filled lobby seems intended to emulate the modernist elegance of Manhattan's Four Seasons restaurant. It does not fully succeed, but it is a noble try, far better than the average modern hotel. Sundance Square itself is a cheerful, if unexceptional, mix of small commercial buildings, the best of which is the old Knights of Pythias headquarters at 317 Main Street, with a lovely corner tower and fine brickwork. Downtown also contains John Portman's Texas American Bank tower of 1973 on the block bounded by West Fourth, West Fifth, Throckmorton and Taylor Streets - a glass building with sliced-off corners and a skirt which houses a banking floor that circles around and under the main lobby. Out front is Alexander Calder's sculpture ''Eagle.'' Across the street at 612 Throckmorton is the First Christian Church, a strong piece of Italian Renaissance classicism erected in 1914. Move now down Houston Street to the other side of downtown, to the block beyond the convention center. This is the Fort Worth Water Garden, the 1974 gift of the Amon Carter Foundation to the city and one of Philip Johnson and John Burgee's finest public works - a park containing waterfalls, reflecting pools and fountains in a splendidly varied arrangement. Now that the originally sparse plantings have grown in lushly, the water garden is an even more enticing escape. Now, even intrepid walkers will have to move by car to the triangle bounded by Camp Bowie Boulevard, University Avenue and Lancaster Avenue in the west end of town. Here are three fine museums - the Kimbell Art Museum, designed by Louis Kahn and completed in 1972; the Amon Carter Museum of Western Art, Philip Johnson's 1961 design, expanded in 1977, and the Fort Worth Art Museum, designed in 1954 by Herbert Beyer and expanded in 1974 by Ford, Powell & Carson. The Fort Worth Art Museum is a disappointing, if earnest, modern structure, and the Amon Carter is notable mainly for its strong siting as a kind of propylaeum overlooking the large open space in the center of this triangle. It is one of the better remnants from Philip Johnson's period of decorative classicism two decades ago, but it is not among the architect's best museums. The Kimbell, however, is not only Fort Worth's finest museum, it is among the nation's. Kahn's mix of exposed concrete, travertine and metal, combined into a series of long, vaulted structures, yields gallery spaces that are as profound, as challenging, and ultimately as comforting as the greatest of the works of art they contain. They are extraordinary spaces - they lift you up, but gently and powerfully; there is no instant sensation of being overwhelmed, but more the profoundly spiritual uplift of a cathedral. Light here, which flows in through slices in the top of the long concrete vaults, baffled by curving reflecting screens, is as much a part of the architecture as it is in any Gothic cathedral. But for all this building's powerful presence, it does manage to defer to the works of art within it. This summer there is a Matisse exhibition at the Kimbell, and Kahn's space and light, and Matisse's shapes and colors, enter into a sublime dialogue.

642-> PORTRAIT OF THE 'WEALTHIEST' ON MONDALE'S LIST OF TAX TARGETS
To the Editor: Walter Mondale has announced his plan for $85 billion in new taxes ''which would fall on the wealthiest Americans.'' This is the lion's share of the $177 billion cut in the Federal deficit he promises to make by the end of the decade (news story Sept. 11). Yet as pointed out by Jonathan Fuerbringer in a news analysis of the same day, Mr. Mondale is in fact reaching down ''into the middle class to come up with the final results'' he seeks. This is where Mr. Mondale's reasoning (and politicking) goes awry. The flashy pronouncement about soaking the rich does not withstand analysis. The Treasury Department has told Presidents of both parties time and again that the middle class is where the revenue is. According to Mr. Mondale's advisers, three-quarters of the additional taxes would be paid by American families who make more than $60,000 a year. This is pure campaign rhetoric. As a father of three children, two of whom are still in college, I must budget $15,000 per child per year, after taxes . In New York City, where I reside, anyone (blue-collar, white- collar or ''wealthy American'') can easily figure out that I need to earn at least $60,000 before taxes (Candidate Mondale's ''wealth threshold'') to pay for the education of one of the most precious things in life - my children - leaving me and my wife $11,000 for housing, food, clothing and the rest. I have no personal fortune; what I have is what I earn from my own labor, very much like the vast majority of my fellow citizens. Millions of Americans are in a similar situation, many of them already retired but still paying off loans for their children's education. Rich? Wealthy? The question begs its own answer. True, an American with $60,000 a year earns twice as much as his next- door neighbor who earns $30,000 (not after taxes, though). The big difference is that the former is not eligible for educational loans (nor are his children eligible for scholarships), while the latter and his children can enjoy both. This is a form of social justice which is peculiar to America, and with which most Americans will probably agree. But Mr. Mondale has not seen this - or has chosen to look the other way - in his campaign diatribe against the ''rich Americans.'' He is in dire need of being reminded of that contemporary American phenomenon known as the ''poor middle class.'' One cannot but wonder whether a candidate who is committing such a gross oversight is qualified to lead this nation of ''poor, blue-collars, white- collars, poor middle-class and a few truly wealthy Americans'' for the next four years. Mr. Mondale's gamble on the tax issue is not going to pay off because the facts are against him and his rhetoric. Americans of whatever income level are smart enough to know a candidate in need of issues when they see one. IVAN V. KERNO New York, Oct. 3, 1984

643-> DINING OUT; A WELCOME CHINESE ARRIVAL
OMEI, a recent addition to Oyster Bay, is a good example of the improvement in Chinese restaurants on the Island since the mid-1970's. Americanized interpretations like chow mein and chop suey, once standard fare, are being replaced by a host of regional Chinese dishes, including exotic specialties that, in the past, had to be ordered in advance. At Omei, for example, Peking duck is always available. Shark fin soup, frogs' legs, turnip cakes, Chinese broccoli and, in season, pheasant are also on the menu. The public is sampling these dishes along with a number of fairly authentic Hunan, Sichuan, Cantonese and Peking-style preparations that are now becoming commonplace. One regularly finds cold appetizers, pungent sha cha seasonings, dishes made with lamb and veal, an increasing number of vegetarian appetizers and main dishes and vibrant sauces that lightly gloss the ingredients rather than flooding them with cornstarch-thickened gravies. Although the cooking at Omei could be more consistent, for the most part the level of preparation is commendable. For example, the restaurant serves one of the best interpretations of chicken soong sampled recently. The minced chicken liberally mingled with ginger and mushrooms and presented in lettuce leaves is eaten by wrapping the leaf around the filling. Fun food for the connoisseur. Crispy shrimp balls were exactly as billed, the spheres of minced shrimp paste greaselessly deep-fried. Fried dumplings are made with a well-flavored pork forcemeat but could have been better seared and less doughy. On the other hand, the vegetable rolls filled with bean sprouts and mushrooms were slightly charred, giving them a somewhat acrid flavor. These are just one of a number of vegetarian appetizers served at Omei that are part of the vast Chinese repertory. Another is mock duck, a dish made with bean curd sheets rolled around mushrooms to simulate pieces of boneless duck. It was very good. Aromatic beef, like slices of subtly pungenttasting pot roast, served cold, is another fine appetizer, and the spring rolls are satisfactory. Hot and sour soup needed little added seasoning at the table. Peking duck, the squares of crisp, lacquered skin, rich duck meat and scallions folded into pancakes that had been spread with sweetly intense hoisin sauce, is elaborately presented and served at tableside. Here it is decent, not outstanding. In restaurants such as this one that do not prepare the dish to special order, the duck meat sometimes comes a trifle dry from reheating. Crisp Sichuan duck, assertively seasoned with salt and pepper, was drier still and a disappointment that tasted like straw. Among the best main dishes were the crisp, suitably spicy General Tso's chicken, made with nuggets of fried boneless chicken in a brown sauce fueled with chili peppers. Slivered Sichuan pork royale with verdant broccoli in a vibrantly peppery garlicky sauce, Hunan beef with diced scallions and assertively spiced and, on a milder note, Cantonese pan-fried flounder with a delicate wine sauce enhanced with lavish shavings of fresh ginger were some other good choices. Both sweet and sharp flavors mingled nicely in the quick-sauteed jumbo shrimp, also seasoned with fresh ginger. The crisp-tender spears of leafy Chinese broccoli come bathed with oyster sauce for a delicious Cantonese classic that rarely appears on local menus. But the chiangchung chicken, consisting of the boneless breast floured, fried and anointed with wine sauce, lacked flavor and was served on a bed of shredded lettuce that unfortunately absorbed most of the sauce. Beef with broccoli was also bland. Desserts include ice cream and the standard Oriental fruit assortment. Chinese Tsing Tao beer is served, and the wine list offers several drinkable white Italian and French wines for about $10. Service is attentive and professional. The restaurant is large and airy. A cozier balcony area runs along one wall and along the other is a series of lattice-work alcoves for intimate dining. The decoration is Chinese but not overbearing. Dinner at Omei is likely to average $25 a person, including drinks or wine, tax and tip.

Dining and Dancing BY ROBERT E. TOMASSON Tickets to the following may be obtained from the beneficiaries unless otherwise indicated. Aiding Hospitals Oct. 1 - When it was established 106 years ago, the United Hospital Fund of New York functioned as fund-raiser for the city's nonprofit hospitals. The group, which says it is the oldest federated charity in the nation, now disburses about $6 million a year, providing programs that help reduce management costs, for example, and aid patients in caring for themselves. One constant factor has been the need for volunteers to function in myriad capacities in the city hospitals. Last year some 32,200 New Yorkers volunteered 4.5 million hours, and the fund says it's time to say thanks and to seek more funds. A black-tie dinner-dance gets under way at the Plaza starting with cocktails at 7 P.M. Tickets, $150, from 212-754- 1080. At the Seaport Oct. 1 - One of the more noteworthy structures at the South Street Seaport is the Fulton Market building, with the Coho restaurant on the building's top floor affording one of the best panoramas of the tall ships and harbor. From 7:30 P.M. to 12:30 A.M. a dinner-dance will be held at the restaurant by the Friends of Thirteen junior committee, people mostly in their 20's and 30's who have a good time while raising funds for Channel 13. Black tie optional. Tickets $100, from 212- 560-2800. Dancing Pictures Oct. 2 - The motion and form of ballet have long held a special attraction for photographers. An exhibition, ''Photography and A.B.T.: a 44-year Retrospective,'' will be held at the Dyansen 57 gallery at 11 East 57th Street from Wednesday through Oct. 13. More than 150 photographs of the American Ballet Theater taken by Alfred Eisenstaedt, Cecil Beaton, Andre Kertesz and 26 others will be for sale. On Tuesday from 6 to 9:30 P.M., a reception preview will be held at the gallery (tickets $25), followed by a dinner at Cafe Seiyoken ($125). Tickets from 212-477-3030. In Westchester Oct. 4 - St. Vincent's Hospital has been a Greenwich Village landmark since its founding in 1849. Now a major medical center with 11 buildings, its major branch outside the city is its psychiatric division in Harrison, N.Y. Established in 1879, it was one of the first hospitals in the New York area devoted to psychiatric problems. Its programs include adolescent services, help for alcoholics and inpatient and outpatient care. A luncheon and fashion show to benefit the Harrison branch will start at 11:30 A.M. at the Rye Town Hilton, followed by an afternoon of entertainment that will include Henny Youngman. Tickets, $30, from 914-967-6500. For Black Colleges Oct. 7 - Last year the first Ebony Fashion Fair was held as a benefit for the United Negro College Fund. The response was a large standing- room crowd at the New York Hilton. This year, two shows have been scheduled, for 2 and 8 P.M. at the Hilton. Some 200 garments by top designers will be modeled prior to a national tour in Canada and several Caribbean countries. The money goes to the 42 private, traditionally black colleges and universities that the fund serves. Tickets, $15 and $40, from 212-644-2299. Victoria's Legacy Oct. 13 - The Victorian Society in America was founded in Philadelphia in 1965, 64 years after the death of Queen Victoria of England, to promote an appreciation of the period named for her, especially in the decorative arts and architecture. Of the 36 chapters it has nationwide, one of the largest, with some 600 members, is in New York. It will hold a benefit preview of an exhibition of arts and crafts design in America in ceramics, metalwork, book designs and furniture of the period. The benefit reception is from 5:30 to 7:30 P.M. at the Jordan-Volpe Gallery, 457 West Broadway. The exhibition is open to the public Oct. 16 through Nov. 4. Benefit tickets, $25, from 212-505-5240.

645-> ALONG RAIL LINES, A BONANZA IN LAND
ABOUT 3,800 acres of industrial land along Connecticut's railroad lines is vacant, according to a recent survey conducted by the State Department of Transportation. The land is in 123 parcels in 39 towns, the report, entitled ''Prospects for Rail-Oriented Industrial Development,'' says. ''We have plenty of vacant land to accommodate any industry which might want to move into the state, and which wants to use the railroad,'' said Richard Hollis of the Transportation Department's Bureau of Planning and Research, which compiled the report. But Mr. Hollis said that despite the availability of land for industry along rail lines, it is unlikely that enough companies will move into the state to keep all the lines open. The type of industry that typically uses rail lines is not moving to Connecticut because it is not welcome in many towns, Mr. Hollis said. The purpose of the rail report is twofold, he said. First, it serves as an inventory of the available land, which the State Department of Economic Development can use to attract new industry. Second, the report addresses the profitability of some lines, and warns companies that the lines that are losing money might be abandoned by the railroads, he said. There are 607 miles of rail line in Connecticut, including 283 miles owned by Conrail, 129 miles owned by the Providence and Worcester Railroad, 120 miles owned by the Boston and Maine Railroad and 60 miles owned by the Central Vermont Railroad. The rest of the track is owned by two small companies: the Branford Steam Railroad owns 9 miles, and the Valley Railroad in Essex owns 6 miles. Most of the towns in eastern, central and southwest Connecticut are served by rail lines. Only several towns in northwest Connecticut have no lines. According to the Transportation Department study, there are 3,801 acres of land zoned for industrial use along the existing lines. Mr. Hollis said the study identified only vacant industrial land. It did not take into account land that was developed but was for sale or lease, because the resources available for compiling the report were limited. ''There are quite a few existing structures available, if anybody wants them,'' Mr. Hollis said. In 18 of Connecticut's 169 towns, there are more than 100 acres of industrial land alongside rail lines, the survey shows. In five - Lebanon, Beacon Falls, Berlin, Enfield and Wallingford - there are 200 or more acres. Seven towns have five or more parcels of vacant industrial land along rail lines, the report shows. Enfield, with 11 parcels totaling 233 acres, tops the list, followed by Windsor Locks, with 90 acres in 9 parcels. Six vacant industrial parcels covering 117 acres are available in Franklin, and six parcels covering 71 acres are available in Meriden. Cheshire, Farmington and Westbrook each has five parcels of varying size. But not all the lines are generating a profit. A 1979 Conrail study of 547 miles of Connecticut track showed 86 miles were losing 20 percent or more, 77 miles ranged from a 20 percent loss to a 10 percent profit, and the rest earned a profit of 10 percent or more. ''Any firm considering locating on a rail line should take into consideration the profitability of the line,'' the report states. ''There is a possibility that service could be discontinued.'' Mr. Hollis added, however, that a single large rail user can make the difference between profit and loss. In Killingly, for instance, the Worcester to Willimantic rail line was unprofitable until Frito-Lay, the food company, built a plant that uses dozens of railroad cars a month. ''That turned that line right around,'' he said. ''If a large-enough industry moved on to any one of those unprofitable lines, it would probably become instantly profitable.'' But, Mr. Hollis predicted, the rail industry in Connecticut would probably shrink over the next few years, because few heavy rail users are coming into the state. Chemical companies that use tank cars and metal-fabricating industries that use flatcars are rarely welcomed by the towns, Mr. Hollis said. ''Very few towns are willing to accept that kind of industry,'' he said. ''They want clean, light industries in their industrial parks, and that's what they get.'' ''I don't know if we can turn it around,'' Mr. Hollis said of the loss of rail lines. ''And a shrinking of the system is not necessarily a bad thing.'' If a railroad keeps an unprofitable line open, the higher costs will be passed on to the consumer in some way, Mr. Hollis said. If there is a more profitable way of shipping something, industry should probably use it, he said.

646-> IN SHORT
Julie Cobb's mother commits suicide when Julie is 13. Soon afterward, her brother runs away from home. When she is 22, her father, nicknamed Hob, dies suddenly, leaving among his papers a letter urging her to find her brother. She does not act on her father's request, nor does she come to terms with the memories of her childhood, until she is 30; then her life is disrupted by another disaster. This last twist of fate occurs when she is living in Burlington, Vt. - it is appropriate that this somber novel be set in that cold, quiet northern town - and is the novel's central event. It compels Julie to try to understand and rise above the pain of loss that threatens to paralyze both her and her lover, Michael Gardener. Slowly, as Julie looks back on the events of her childhood, then forward to her relationship with Michael, a lifetime's tangle of emotions is unraveled. But it not until the novel's nightmarish conclusion that Julie learns how to overcome her grief and thereby save herself. T. Alan Broughton, the author of three previous novels and five books of poetry, has invested his fourth novel with a poet's sensibility. ''Hob's Daughter'' is skillfully and affectingly written; it is ''about safety, about the known fragments bobbing on the surface of a dark sea, but above all about that grace we hope pervades in all: love.''- FICTIONHOB'S DAUGHTER. Thaddeus Rutkowski * THE LOST FLYING BOAT. In the 1950's, with the publication of ''Saturday Night and Sunday Morning'' and ''The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner,'' Alan Sillitoe was declared one of England's angry young men. With prose as gritty as factory smoke, he gave voice to the lower classes that had just enough education to feel inferior and to be suspicious of postwar optimism. In ''The Lost Flying Boat,'' Mr. Sillitoe returns to the post-World War II era and focuses on eight emotionally and financially impoverished Englishmen who fly to Antarctica to dig up a ton of gold buried by Germans at the end of the war. Although advertised as an adventure story, ''The Lost Flying Boat'' is more a meditation on delusion, failure and mortality. Seven of the men are veterans of a wartime bomber crew led by the unstable Captain Bennett. The eighth, the radio operator Adcock, narrates the tale and all too quickly establishes a portentous tone. While Bennett maintains that to ''become rich is the only defence against being without hope,'' the others appear less interested in gold than in escaping the confusions of civilian life and recapturing the fierce certainties of battle. For a narrator, Adcock has a near- fatal flaw. Although inclined toward metaphysical interior monologues, he speaks in cliches and undermines even dramatic incidents with banal exposition. Confronted by a crisis of conscience, he muses, ''If I obeyed, I would be up the creek, in a leaking canoe, and without a paddle.'' Too frequently his fellow crew members echo Adcock's hackneyed example. ''If we get into a jolly-roger scrap, we'll blow 'em out of sea or sky. . . . Anybody tries to stop us, and they'll walk the plank.'' It is undoubtedly part of Mr. Sillitoe's intention to suggest that the greatest poverty is to be unable to express the full range of one's experience. But as he showed in earlier novels, an author need not let his characters' limitations become his own.- Michael Mewshaw * THE RED MENACE. A memoir in the form of a novel, this recollection of growing up in Nebraska re-creates a wide range of authentic sounds. Michael Anania evokes the voices of his Midwest childhood in a spare, seductive style. The chapters do not form a linear narrative but move as in a poem, with the narrator-hero's feelings conveyed through various images. Mr. Anania's scene is a housing project in Omaha in the 1950's; his central characters are teen-agers testing their inexperience against that era's demands. The overriding image is the specter of Communism as filtered through the oratory of Sen. Joseph McCarthy to an inner-city complex of residents eager for warnings of suspicion. Mr. Anania pokes fun at the era's paranoia without falling into simplistic satire. Some of his cast are bewildered (the hero's mother is warned not to make jokes about the Red menace), others mouth awesome slogans in an often howlingly funny manner. A dishwasher in the hotel where Mr. Anania's hero is holding down a kitchen job is the only character secure in his values. He makes do with his sink, his booze and his whores. He is also an avowed anti-Communist, but his idea of Communism is anything he does not like and for which he has no other name. Along with the Red menace, the ghost of America's love affair with long, sleek chrome automobiles animates the teen-agers in this novel. Mr. Anania is perceptive in his comments on American mannerisms. His use of clothes to establish a characterization is masterly and suggests that clothes represented the consciousness of collective fantasy in the 1950's as much as the automobile did. Ultimately, Mr. Anania's material is the familiar landscape of growing up in which particulars take on resonant meaning after years of looking back. ''The Red Menace'' succeeds in capturing universal gestures through emphasizing the unique customs of one historical era. - Martin Tucker * FETCHING THE DEAD. Scott R. Sanders' stories are earnest, moral, well-intentioned and sometimes moving, but they rarely risk new patterns of style, theme or characterization. In the first story, for example, a young man, blinded temporarily, must learn to depend on his girl friend, must learn that dependence is a necessity with its own pleasures - it allows one to see the world through another's eyes. By learning this lesson - the possibility of sharing his life - he enables himself to marry. The future wife who leads him to this insight is optimistic, good-natured, fey. Leaping away from her blinded fiance, she says, ''Can't catch me, I'm the gingerbread woman!'' She is also, alas, as are other women in these stories, deeply knowing about the balance, nature and meaning of life. The tale telegraphs its intention - however worthy - very early on, and the reader is apt to have learned the lesson before the character does. Mr. Sanders' next three stories form a triptych, adumbrating the aspects of a central tragedy - a farm family's loss of a son who, in escaping from a strong-willed father and the difficult repetitions of rural life, is mangled while hopping a freight to the city. The stories track the family's difficult transitions - the cost for the older son of a new start in life; the tug of family love and loyalties. These three stories are set in the 1930's and 40's as if their nostalgic themes and style would in this way gain greater verisimilitude. They are the least predictable, the most evocative work in the collection. But they, too, often have the feeling of lovingly manufactured antiques. In the later stories - about farmer prophets, implacable wives and husbands who must be won back to a sense of life's balance of Eros and death - one finds oneself wondering if such elemental feelings and characters, such clearly didactic moral situations, exist outside of a perhaps worn literary tradition. Mr. Sanders' characters often have the gift to be simple; that is their appeal and their limit. But often one feels that this isn't the simplicity of life, but of an art that requires this reduction so that the characters may discover as revelation the story's lesson. - Jay Cantor * THE SEA CAVE. A body washes up on the beach in the first line of this thriller-romance, setting the stage for a book that is unsatisfactory as either thriller or romance. The suspense is undermined by ponderous plotting and timing that allow the reader to guess almost everything that will happen 20 pages before it does. The romance is undermined by thin characterization and the grimness of the heroine. Yet it is her very grimness that saves the novel. Kate is the thin, humorless and downtrodden daughter of an alcoholic father and whiny mother, both working-class Scots from Edinburgh. After her older brother returns from World War I with a leg wound and takes to drink, Kate becomes the sole supporter of her family. Unappreciated, she works herself to the bone. In an attempt to save them all from dank, sordid poverty, she forces an emigration to Cape Town, South Africa. En route she begins an affair, and later goes off to work as a secretary on one of the old ostrich-feather estates. Here the book livens up, as the author chronicles the rise and fall of the feather industry and describes the claustrophobic world of European expatriates living in faded South African grandeur. Kate aggressively works her way up to manager of the estate, never quite learning to negotiate the strained relations between the whites and the colored servants on the farm - the one uneasy note in the novel. She also gets embroiled in an atmosphere of sexuality, violence and corruption that leads to a murder, a trial, an accident and the renunciation of her one true love. But it is the depiction of Kate's self-denial and grueling work on the farm that lifts the story above the ordinary. Alan Scholefield, a South African living in England who has published 12 popular novels, has written better tales. In ''The Sea Cave,'' he seems to have used a murder mystery as an excuse to tell what might have been a much more interesting story about South African society of the 1920's and 30's. - Helen Benedict NONFICTIONMINORITY VOTE DILUTION. Edited by Chandler Davidson. (Howard University, $24.95.) The instructive essays in ''Minority Vote Dilution'' decry election laws that undermine, or dilute, minority voting power as today's main barriers to the political equality of black and Hispanic Americans. A prime example of minority vote dilution is the at-large election. In a city whose minority population is clustered in discrete districts, an at- large, citywide instead of districtwide, election can make it impossible for minorities to elect their own representatives to city government because minority candidates can almost always be defeated by the bloc voting of the larger white community. This and other electoral practices - gerrymandering, runoff primaries - are lucidly explained here, and there are many examples of how these practices work in cities throughout the South and Southwest. Minority vote dilution is widespread, the sociologist Chandler Davidson notes, and it is a particularly insidious form of discrimination because it is covert. Instead of openly denying minorities access to the polls, it ensures their votes won't matter. Without resorting to legal or sociological jargon, the authors - civil rights lawyers, sociologists and political scientists - explain the history of minority vote dilution, discuss remedies for it and review the conflict between the one person, one vote principle and proportional minority representation. ''Minority Vote Dilution'' provides an education in fundamental voting rights and the distribution of political power in America today. - Wendy Kaminer * IDA TARBELL: Portrait of a Muckraker. Ida Tarbell (1857- 1944) is chiefly remembered, quite unfairly, for two of her many articles for McClure's Magazine - her expose of the Standard Oil Company and her portrait of John D. Rockefeller. They were published between 1902 and 1906, and some may recall Tarbell as one of the objects of President Theodore Roosevelt's wrathful outburst in 1905 against ''muckrakers.'' But there was a great deal more to Tarbell than her superb investigative journalism, as Kathleen Brady recognizes in this biography. By the time S. S. McClure invited Tarbell to join his magazine in 1896, she was a well-formed writer. Fame came with her first pieces, a serialized life of Napoleon. Her articles put McClure's on the map and helped attract to its staff Ray Stannard Baker and Lincoln Steffens. The heart of ''Ida Tarbell'' is a careful recounting of the journalist's investigations of Rockefeller and Standard Oil, but Miss Brady does not neglect Tarbell's break with McClure over editorial policy, her stint with The American Magazine or her pieces on the Teapot Dome scandal. Miss Brady, who is on the staff of Time magazine, presents Tarbell as a crusader with two holy obligations - to be a faithful witness to her times and to light the way for social change. And this portrait triumphs over some bad writing. ''The Paris of modern imagination had debuted'' is only one example of the author's tin-eared style. - Alden Whitman * AND NIGHT FELL: Memoirs of a Political Prisoner in South Africa. Enough information has emerged recently about the treatment of detainees in South African jails for there to be no doubt about the essential accuracy of ''And Night Fell.'' Molefe Pheto is a South African black music teacher who spoke out against apartheid and promoted black culture. In 1975 he was imprisoned without trial for 281 days; he spent 271 of them in solitary confinement. When charges were finally brought against him, he was acquitted and released; he now lives in Britain. Anyone flirting with a a policy of ''constructive engagement'' with South Africa would do well to read this memoir. It is dispiriting and inspiring in almost equal degrees. Anyone who has visited South Africa can only sympathize with Mr. Pheto's anger at the country's dehumanizing racial laws. And the story of his survival is impressive. During his imprisonment, his only contact was with his interrogators (who beat him up) and the black police (for whom he reserves his greatest scorn). Mr. Pheto poetically tells how he survived solitary confinement by concentrating on details, by feigning madness to test whether, in fact, insanity was overtaking him, by giving derisive nicknames to his captors and tormentors. There is no comfortable resolution here, just an impassioned shout of defiance from exile. Mr. Pheto writes in the grave and mannered cadences of Africanized English. The tones of Soweto are here, the very voice of unbowed Africa. - Mary Hope * SOCIALISM IN HISTORY: Political Essays of Henry Pachter. Edited by Stephen Eric Bronner. (Columbia University, $25.) Henry Pachter (1907-1980), who taught at Rutgers and other universities and was a founding editor of Dissent magazine, was a wide-ranging and first-rate essayist and political thinker. This collection of his essays ably demonstrates both his keen historical sense and his firm commitment to the original principles of socialism. ''Socialism in History'' spans more than 40 years and covers such topics as the origins of fascist propaganda, the Spanish Civil War, the rights of Palestinians and the mixed blessings technology affords workers. Overall, Pachter's view of socialism is remarkably free of cant and compromises: it is distinguished by his belief that ultimately socialism is a process and a movement that must emphasize free choice, lest it harden into a rigid system. In several essays, he argues convincingly that socialism requires a system of countervailing powers to preserve free choice and maximize participation in decision making at all levels of society. Pachter's prose is often lively, and some essays display an anarchistic note in his thinking and an appreciation of the importance of play and leisure, which our society and many socialist countries often subordinate to productivity and efficiency. Stephen Eric Bronner deserves credit for a lucid introduction to this timely volume, which in many ways restores meaning to socialist ideals while pointing out new directions for their realization. - Peter H. Stone * CHINESE IN THE POST-CIVIL WAR SOUTH: A People Without a History. After the Civil War, the Southern economy withered. The refusal of newly freed black women to continue working in the fields, for example, was largely responsible for the disastrous cotton crop of 1867-68. By the 1870's, increasing numbers of blacks were abandoning the South. The labor shortage prompted a scheme on the part of some Southerners, notably planters in Louisiana, to replace blacks with Chinese workers. Asians had been successfully brought in to work in the Caribbean and Central America, and the planters hoped they would be a cheaper and more compliant source of labor. The experiment failed. Resistance from Federal authorities, who feared that the South was trying to impose a new form of slavery, was one reason. But mostly the plan was just too costly. As Lucy M. Cohen, a professor of anthropology at Catholic University in Washington, points out in ''Chinese in the Post-Civil War South,'' the Chinese workers who came south were neither cheap nor compliant. They not only demanded fair terms but their fulfillment to the letter. If abused, the Chinese were known to go on strike. After their contracts expired, many workers either left the region or intermarried with black, Creole or white women. It would have been illuminating if Miss Cohen had compared whites' attitudes toward the Chinese with those toward blacks and newly arriving white immigrants. It also would have been instructive if she had compared the labor demands of the Chinese with those of other groups, notably blacks, who by 1869 had organized the National Colored Labor Union. By not placing the Chinese experience in a broad context, she has diminished her study's significance. - Paula Giddings * THE IMPACT OF INTERVENTION: The Dominican Republic During the U.S. Occupation of 1916-1924. In the controversial saga of United States involvement in the Caribbean, the occupation of the Dominican Republic from 1916 to 1924 has until now lacked an in-depth treatment. ''The Impact of Intervention'' is a comprehensive and tolerant study, devoid of jargon. The occupation, carried out in response to the breakdown of the Dominican Republic's Government, was motivated by strategic and security objectives, including the preservation of United States hegemony in the region. The occupation officials launched broad programs and reforms in such areas as public works, education, health, finance, agriculture and the military. Bruce J. Calder, a historian at the University of Illinois at Chicago, fairly describes the mixed results of the occupation. The American officials generally had good intentions, and at times those good intentions brought them into conflict with American business interests. Mr. Calder relates the occupation's failures in part to a lack of American understanding of Dominican society and culture. Hastening an end to the occupation were Dominican liberal intellectuals and nationalists, who mounted effective local and international anti-occupation campaigns, and guerrillas, who plagued the Marines in the country's eastern sugar provinces. Some readers may disagree with Mr. Calder's assessment of the occupation's long- term costs - Dominican hostility to the United States and, less directly, the Trujillo regime that began in 1930 - but this is nevertheless an excellent study. - Robert D. Crassweller

647-> A REPUBLIC OF FEAR
John Vinocur, chief of The Times's Paris bureau, visited Paraguay last month. By John Vinocur PARAGUAY WORKS like this: A man parks his car, and to keep it from being stolen, he attaches it to a rope tied around his waist. The man is arrested walking through the streets, and charged with public ridiculousness. He has insulted national dignity, which, officially, has been restored and exalted over the last 30 years by El Excelentisimo, the President of the Republic, Don Alfredo Stroessner, General of the Army, First Magistrate of the land. Beaten, robbed, demeaned, the man eventually bribes his way out of jail. He finds his automobile on a used car lot, and informs the dealer. ''That's a break for you,'' the dealer says. ''You know the real mileage.'' Paraguay lives with its legends of total villainy and near-complete resignation, and it tells about them in stories and dreams and truths. Sometimes they are visions of General Stroessner going into retirement at a ranch, sitting in a rocker beside Dr. Josef Mengele down by Lake Itaipu and offering newts and baby chicks to the piranhas. Sometimes they are accounts like the one given by a businessman to a visitor about a client's housekeeper who had her fingernails yanked out recently by the police. ''Some kind of petty theft,'' he says. The tone of voice is a shrug, parlor revulsion. Things could be worse, it suggests. There are worse places than Paraguay. Thirty years of General Stroessner: a continual state of siege over the entire period that literally places the President above the law; people with occasionally uncontrollable urges to fall into rivers or jump from planes with their arms and legs bound; serenades in front of the presidential palace featuring the ever-popular ''Forward, My General'' and ''Congratulations, My Great Friend''; foreign thieves, brutes and madmen hidden at a price; an economy administered so corruptly it is officially explained away as the ''cost of peace''; a United Nations voting record on so-called key issues more favorable to the United States than any other ''ally''; a party newspaper that prints six front-page color pictures of the general every day. The Paraguay of President Stroessner is tragic, in the sense that most of Paraguay's people have learned to respond to rule-by-whim with the consistent reasonableness of silence. It is comic in its frequent disorganization and incoherence, its loony juxtapositions and its operetta gold braid. The radio station of the Colorado Party, the general's own, raves about another local broadcaster, calling him a ''subversive Jewish Castro,'' but seven Israeli technicians provide maintenance in Asuncion for the Boeing 707's of the state airline. American banks rushed to open operations in Asuncion in the mid- 1970's, sensing the easy money of a Wild West hydroelectric boom, but suddenly found they couldn't collect their debts in a country that is to while-you-wait bankruptcy proceedings what Delaware is to instant incorporation papers. Justice is a two- foot-high statue of a naked woman holding a scale, dwarfed by a new, Mussolini-modern Supreme Court building funded by the Republic of South Africa. A play is announced, then canceled; the costumes and sets have disappeared. A European country donates three trucks to Paraguay's forest service. They arrive in port but don't leave the docks. Finally, after a year, the embassy understands: Customs officials must be bribed to get the gifts into the country. But Paraguay is not a buffoon state, and President Stroessner is no Papa Doc or Idi Amin, men ruling in a flood of the irrational. Those few Paraguayans who openly oppose the President call him extraordinarily shrewd, a master at raising and lowering the level of violence and corruption in the country like the heat on a gas stove. No one holds power anywhere for 30 years without acquiring a sense of relative measure. The bodies don't float down the Paraguay River the way they did 20 years ago; torture is real but no longer systematic; the number of political prisoners has diminished, and Dr. Mengele, the ''Angel of Death'' of Auschwitz, is believed to have disappeared within the last four or five years - either after plastic surgery or, as a former American Ambassador, Robert E. White, put it, ''paid back, finally, in his own coin.'' While democratic change is coming to Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, Paraguay remains frightening because its regime proves that evil is not always needed in job lots to cow a people or appropriate a state. Compared with General Stroessner, President Somoza of Nicaragua was an apprentice, says Aldo Zucolillo, the publisher of a newspaper, ABC Color, put out of business this year by the general. Mr. Zucolillo and a few other Paraguayans are rare men and women: They talk on the record in a place where almost nothing is verifiable and the only certainty is the efficiency of the police. Another man, no less admirable but not at ease about his name appearing in print, observes that in a historical perspective, General Stroessner's Paraguay probably will be more interesting in its perverse nuances than in the mass of its outrages. ''Add up the horrors,'' he says, ''and you get a substantial piece of ugly business. But what is interesting, really - original, you could say - is how after 30 years a place can be run through a perfect distillation of fear. By now, it's only a touch, a nod. One man disappears, one woman is tortured. It is enough, and the Stroessner people know it. It's a horrible truth, but some of us wait nervously to hear such stories. And too many of us are relieved to hear them, because then we touch the bars of the cage, and we know where we stand.'' These are wary days in Paraguay, with many people reaching to feel the contours of a situation they think might be changing. When the army goose-stepped through the streets of Asuncion on Aug. 15, the 30th anniversary of General Stroessner's rise to the presidency, the question for those watching was, ''How much longer?'' After the Trujillos and Somozas, General Stroessner, at 71, is almost the last of a breed of Latin American dictators who, unlike Fidel Castro or Gen. Augusto Pinochet of Chile, admitted to running their country as if it were a theme park in their own image. For longevity, the general has few rivals; only Enver Hoxha of Albania and Kim Il Sung of North Korea are his seniors. For personalization of power, Nicolae Ceausescu of Rumania has some of the same reflexes, but he has yet to name an airport after himself, or a city (Puerto Presidente Stroessner), or to put a neon sign atop a building like the one at the Plaza of Heroes in Asuncion that blinks orange through the night: ''Stroessner - Peace, Work, Well-being . . . Stroessner - Peace, Work, Well-being . . . .'' In a strange way, President Stroessner has claimed an area of absurdity that none of his peers thought to expropriate. For the general, a man who can arrest, imprison or banish anyone he pleases without trial or explanation under the capital's permanent state of siege, Paraguay has achieved perfect peace and democracy. It is, by self-acclamation, the United States' best friend. The word ''democracy'' soils every official sheet of paper, every state proclamation, hundreds of pages daily in the official press. Even General Pinochet talks about an eventual return to parliamentary rule; even Mr. Castro says his ''Socialism'' aspires to achieving a more faultless Communist existence. But in Paraguay, General Stroessner has elevated himself to the level of democracy apotheosized. For the people who reach out to touch the bars of the cage, all signals count. They look at the general and see his passive stare, his stiffened movements, his hands swollen to lobster claws, as signs of time passing, of an end to come. In a country with only a vague year or two of rule by law in its entire history, the signs of change inspire as much fear as hope. HE GENERAL GETS up at 5 A.M. Since Somoza's assassination in Paraguay in 1980, after his ouster from his own country the year before, no one is sure where the general spends the night, but his official residence, part of a compound with a police hospital on the grounds (torture victims are said to be taken to a fifth-floor ward for attempts at reanimation), sits in awkward proximity to the United States Embassy, directly across the street. The general's day begins with telephone calls, and it is said that, between 6 A.M. and 7 A.M., a ring on one of the 82,000 phones in a country of just over 3 million people is automatically answered, ''Si, Senor Presidente.'' Visitors parade through the office starting at 7 A.M. By 8 P.M. it is clear who came, because the visits lead the newscasts on the two television channels. It may be the Chilean Ambassador or the South African military attache, but more often the parade is an exercise in trying to look respectable, scooping up whoever is passing through town. In mid-August, the nightly news led off with President Stroessner extending his hand to a visiting veterinarian, described as the chief of the department of artificial insemination at a cow college in West Germany. Then the general visits things. He opens banks, he hands out diplomas, he inaugurates telephone booths. He is conscious of his image. As an aide pointed out, he never cuts ribbons of Paraguayan red, white and blue, he unknots them - a man who cares. The rest of the day, from noon on, is more opaque. No one can remember the general ever holding a press conference, and interviews are rare. (A request for an interview for this article never received an official response.) Some of those whose jobs involve watching the general, and who feel he is declining, while the country operates on anautomatic pilot, believe he sleeps much of the day. For a group convinced of his mental acuity, the general's afternoon is the stuff of novels: plotting, and counting money. For the Paraguayan people, who mostly work hard and shut up, the nontelevised doings at the presidential palace represent pure intrigue. A foreign diplomat's young son was told by the family cook that afternoon is the time when ''the old German doctor comes and gives the general injections of fresh blood.'' In a sense, General Stroessner is no historical accident. After independence in 1811, Paraguay's first ruler was a dictator ''for life'' - Jose Gaspar Rodriguez de Francia, known as El Supremo, who banned all travel, foreign trade, entry or exit, meetings and mail. Despots of varying compulsions succeeded him. Paraguay became the first country in South America to have a railroad, but it also found itself with a ruler in Francisco Solano Lopez who in 1864 devised a way to start a war against Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay at the same time. When the war was over, the Paraguayan population of 550,000 was 60 percent dead. Both El Supremo and Marshal Lopez are national heroes, perhaps understandably, if you count the 22 presidents, several civil wars and endless coups from 1904 to 1936. In the 1930's, a lunatic war with Bolivia over the Chaco desert - land with none or little of the oil the two parties hoped was there - ended with 100,000 more deaths. By 1947, another civil war was on, and by late 1949 six presidents had come and gone over a period of 16 months. In 1954, it was the turn of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner, son of a German immigrant from Bavaria and a Paraguayan mother, to stage a military coup. The general's staying power has been based on controlling the military and turning the Colorado Party, traditionally an amalgam of peasants and shopkeepers, into an unusually effective grass- roots organization. Each little town has its Colorado ''section,'' a dispenser of jobs and favors and a collector of local intelligence; neither the block committees of the Sandinistas nor the factory councils of East Germany ever worked more effectively. Party membership is usually a precondition for becoming a grade-school teacher or being appointed as a soldier or officer in the Presidential Escort Battalion. The military's loyalty is assured by cutting generals and colonels into the so-called illegal economy - contraband, kickbacks, pure theft - that even newspapers allied to the Government say represents about half the gross national product. Generals whose nominal salary is about $550 a month can live in a kind of ostentation that goes beyond caricature. Their houses, built on half-paved roads, look like the White House, or the Chateau de Chambord, or Viking lodges. The relative prosperity of the last few years has produced a small middle class more interested in possessions than in politics. General Stroessner's enormous good luck, in a sense, was to come to power in a country so devastated, so miserable that the capital had no running water in 1954, and the country had only minimal electrification. Over the years, he has had the astuteness to turn every light bulb into an enterprise that sounds like the Gen. Don Alfredo Stroessner Citizens Illumination Project, every drain pipe into the splendor of a National Hygiene Consortium, Don Alfredo Stroessner, President. The small-town politician's sociological skills - ''Stroes sner looks like a Bavarian but thinks like a Guarani Indian,'' says a European ambassador - were accompanied by a fabulous windfall. The construction by Paraguay and Brazil of the Itaipu Dam on the Brazilian border - in Paraguay's case, almost entirely with other people's money - brought Paraguay a clear $1.8 billion in revenue from 1975 to 1983. The hydroelectric project, described as the world's biggest, gave Paraguay, for a while, the fastest growth in the hemisphere. The money, and its dribble-down effects on the population, modulated the need to brutalize. After decades of terror sent about a million Paraguayans out of the country, the rush of cash purchased a kind of national docility, and allowed an occasional slackening of the whip hand. Last year, when the Government broke up the Paraguayan Data Bank, a group trying to furnish statistics to contrast with the regime's own on national wealth and its pathetic distribution, only two of the 30 people arrested complained of being tortured. ''By local historical standards, an enlightened percentage,'' a diplomat said. This summer, a businessman told of two Paraguayans being arrested when they bumbled into a police shake-down scheme. Naked, they were made to kneel and stare at a white- painted wall for nine hours. If they tried to move or close their eyes, they were beaten. ''Not the real hard stuff,'' according to the businessman. The Minister of the Interior, Sabino Montanaro, who has been excommunicated by the Roman Catholic Church for intolerable abuses over the years (and who, more recently, has been restored to the faith), mumbles something about subversives when the torture question comes up. In an interview, he says, ''We are against all harassment.'' Don Alfredo does not enjoy such unpleasant subjects. The foreigners who see him regularly are of two schools. One of them reports that he is incapable of answering precise questions, and that his conversation runs to reminiscences from the Chaco War and ramblings about communism, subversives, do-gooders and being unappreciated. These visitors regard him as in clear decline; he is old, they say, sometimes clear enough in the head to cancel someone's permit to import a Volkswagen or a salami slicer, but gradually fossilizing, the last of the South American dinosaurs turning slowly to stone. The other school insists that the general is all there when he needs to be. One frequent visitor, a bit of an archivist, has compiled a small folio of Stroessnerisms delivered before dawn: ''Even Carter thought I was doing a good job. He was a fool, he destroyed people's faith in America. I am one of America's best friends, but the United States treats their enemies better than their friends.'' ''Pinochet is a failure. He never created an organization, a type of democracy that would give people a sense of participation.'' ''Somoza was arrogant. A boozer.'' ''I can understand why Reagan would not want to see me. It wouldn't be good for him politically.'' ''No one starves here.'' ''Some countries - the real people - are not politically mature enough to sustain a United States type of democracy. Paraguay is one.'' ''I am no dictator.'' ASUNCION IS A poky place that actually smells of orange blossoms. By South American standards, it is short on the dismal and the desperate: A couple of kids sleep on the sidewalk; a barefoot boy sells papers in the nasty rain of the austral winter. In truth, Asuncion largely escapes the assault of endless, gagging misery. On Saturday nights, what there is of the new middle class stakes out parrilladas (grill restaurants) in Miami- bought leisure suits to eat and stare. If you listen hard, you can still hear men playing the harp and guitar duets that are Paraguay's sweet, sad folk music. The appearances are inuring. A representative of a faraway little country with a passionate, even manic democratic system, said he rather liked living here: He can drink the water, he can eat the lettuce, and he says his daughter can walk the streets at 11 P.M. That is not entirely certain - after attempted attacks on women staff members, the United States Embassy instituted a nightly security patrol for its families this year. In any case, Paraguayans are often appalled by some foreigners' readiness to take quiet for calm, stillness for an absence of violence, in a city where soldiers point guns at children when they approach a general's house. The West German Embassy, which spends a lot of its time trying to extradite German thugs and deadbeats who regard Paraguay as a kind of enormous safe house, got the mood understatedly right in a sheet of travel tips made available to those passing through: ''All restaurants close at 1 A.M. It is advisable at that point to leave the streets. The police has far- reaching powers and, as a rule, does not hesitate to employ them extensively. It is urgently emphasized not to become involved in discussions with the police or other authorities. Foreigners should avoid commenting on Paraguayan politics. Subsequent difficulties are easily encountered as a result of the efficient information police system . . . . Visitors who are arrested should request that the Embassy be informed.'' Since everything has its price - $200 for a permanent residency permit, $200 for citizenship, maybe $700 for a passport - no one need tarry in jail too long. Unless, of course, the military feels crossed in some deal, and, like a poor German named Gandermann this summer, you wind up in a brig in the Chaco beyond even the shrugging impotency of the courts. Laws are written down, but mbarete , a Guarani word meaning clout, runs everything. Two confused tax collectors who inexplicably ventured into a business run by Gen. Andres Rodriguez, commander of the Asuncion military region and one of the country's richest generals - besides having a son married to one of the President's daughters - got a summary definition of mbarate : They were beaten, had their heads shaved and were thrown into the street, an American said. Attempts at moving in wide arcs around the violence-corruption-military complex do little good; in Paraguay, there are more police per capita than in Bulgaria, East Germany or South Africa. Paul H. Lewis, professor of political science at Tulane University, who compiled the statistics, gives General Stroessner his due, though. According to his figures, the proportion of police to Paraguay's population falls behind the comparable ratio in Qaddafi's Libya and Hoxha's Albania. Corruption, like brutality, is discussed with a flip, next- case matter-of-factness. A diplomat tells of a Cabinet minister asking for a $2 million slice of a $12 million contract. A banker explains that he must kick back 100 guaranis per dollar to employees in the Central Bank in order to export dollars at a rate of about 240 to one, roughly half that of the unofficial parallel market. A foreigner tells of the construction of a cement plant with a yearly production capacity of 650,000 tons, when the country uses only 200,000 tons; the size of the deal, he explains, increases the amount of cream at the top for the bosses. A private Panamanian barge company wins a contract in dollars to transport oil from Buenos Aires in competition with a Government-owned Paraguayan firm which accepts payment in guaranis. According to banking sources, a small group of friends and officials knew of a planned devaluation two weeks before it took place, and got richer on the foreign exchange market. The Colorado Party talks about land reform and providing farming plots to 300,000 peasants, but the best land goes into the estancias of the generals and colonels, or into the agribusiness. By American reckoning, almost three-fourths of the usable farming and ranch land is occupied by 3 percent of the country's farms and ranches. On a standard scale used by one embassy to measure land distribution - placing egalitarian perfection at 0 and total injustice at 1 - Paraguay scores a .93. ''Paraguay is a brothel,'' a businessman said. ''The magnitude, intensity and openness of its corruption is unique. There are days when just about every buck here stinks.'' Humberto Rubin, the radio- station owner and broadcaster whose station was shut down for discussing corruption in the courts and in land reform, talks of ''stealing and lying, shameless beyond belief.'' ''Can you understand,'' he asks, ''what this has done to the dignity, to the self-respect of a people?'' Mr. Rubin, a man of unusual courage, stops there. General Stroessner and his friends have left Paraguay with the fears and passivity of a battered child. IN GRAHAM GREENE'S ''Travels With My Aunt,'' Aunt Augusta, on a visit to Paraguay, meets a wretch named Mr. Visconti who has lost all his money trying to buy a new passport and bribing the police. She finds him sad. ''God knows how Dr. Mengele manages,'' Aunt Augusta says, ''but I expect he has a numbered account in Switzerland.'' Dr. Mengele was here indeed, paying off his Paraguayan citizenship papers for 20 or 25 years. The papers, according to a published document, were witnessed by Col. Alejandro von Eckstein, a Paraguayan in his 70's, with a European accent, who, diplomats say, was given an ''honorary'' officer's commission by General Stroessner and is often seen in the presidential antechambers. The Israelis, who have an embassy in Asuncion, and a sufficiently equivocal relationship with Paraguay to try to sell the army mobile desalinization equipment, think that Mengele is dead or gone; the Americans are of the same view. The best indication of Dr. Mengele's departure is a story, told by a foreigner, of how three Paraguayan colonels reacted when Klaus Barbie, the Gestapo chief of Lyons, was extradited by Bolivia to France in 1983 - in exchange, it has been said, for shipping French weapons to the Bolivian police. ''Maybe we could pass von Eckstein off as Mengele,'' one of the colonels is supposed to have said. ''What do you think he is worth - $200,000?'' Paraguay reacts with operatic outrage when Mengele's name is mentioned. Last month, the official party newspaper, La Patria, produced an editorial, printed on specially tinted yellow paper, denouncing what it called ''Mengele-Wiezhental and Co., Inc.'' The argument, complete with its derogatory misspelling of Simon Wiesenthal's name, was that the redoubtable Nazi hunter was interested solely in making money and defaming Paraguay. This is just another turn in the Paraguayan tragicomedy, since the country has always been a haven for right-wing extremists, or just embezzlers, swindlers and con men on the run. The acknowledged list now includes Georges Watin, who once tried to kill Charles de Gaulle; Gaetano Orlando, an Italian neo-Fascist whose extradition on criminal charges was rejected, and Auguste Ricord, the French-born international drug dealer who returned to Paraguay after being released from an American prison last year. The general expectation of people like these - many of them Germans attracted by the fact that about a tenth of Paraguay's population has some German background - is that compassion is available at a price. Some find it. Some do not: German sources tell of a German dental-supply salesman who arrived recently with suitcases containing 110 kilograms of gold, which he had accumulated by faking orders from his clients. First the suitcases disappeared, then the salesman. Among those alighting in Asuncion during the last few years was Hans Hermann Weyer, a West German who had specialized at home in selling phony titles to used- car dealers hungry for respectability. In Paraguay, which ignored three extradition requests for him on fraud charges, Mr. Weyer concentrated on real-estate deeds and drivers' licenses - both reputedly of his own design. Then he moved on. Like movie listings, the newspapers save space for extradition news. One day it's a couple of embezzling Argentine bankers; another day it's a phony Spanish priest. The local rule is that when you can't pay, you go. Two Americans, Richard Cochran and Janet Krebs, wanted for robbing a Nevada bank, found this out in August. Their arrest was announced, and a newspaper story followed, saying that about $900,000 had been seized at the same time. Then another report appeared, saying the take was really more than $1 million, plus jewelry. A third story, published a few days later, said a lawyer had been arrested and the sum involved was, in fact, $2.7 million. What happened, a foreign source explained, was that there had been some competitive bidding among police factions on protection fees, and that the deal had tottered out of control. Paraguay made the best of it: The money, with great and rare ceremony, was entrusted to the care of the Central Bank, and an extradition request from the United States Embassy for Mr. Cochran and Mrs. Krebs was granted. G ENERAL STROESSner always makes the best of things, following the rule he has created for himself - buying out or beating up; one generally works as well as the other. His refinement, his special totalitarian discovery, is that if you destroy a people's honor long enough, many will think of themselves as beyond repair. In a green-walled classroom of Asuncion's Catholic University, I talked to a group of students. They spoke of themselves in an odd, jarring language for young people, one of enormous self-contempt. Again and again the comments were despairing, self-lacerating: ''I'm not hopeful. If he dies, it can get worse. He keeps a balance.'' ''There is no political option. The young people are rotten. There are no moral values. When he goes, it's more of the same.'' ''You don't change anything. Maybe through violence, maybe through a revolution, but the people are passive.'' ''We hate him.'' ''Our desire is to become a real democracy, but this is so hard. We must be cautious.'' Carmen Lara Castro, president of the Paraguayan Human Rights Commission and a woman whose entire family has been jailed, tortured or exiled, describes the essential characteristics of Paraguayan life as indifference and fear. The opposition parties, she says, are largely to blame for their feebleness. ''They have been irresponsible and petty, wasting themselves in their own endless in- fighting.'' The truth is, the opposition, allowed to function within the parameters of rigged elections to a sham parliament and the Colorado Party's system of surveillance and patronage, does not come to much, and when it cannot be bought, it is beaten. ABC Color, the newspaper that edged closest to questioning the President's authority and methods, was shut down this spring. Mr. Rubin, the radio broadcaster, says he has been in and out of jail 10 times. P40 Perhaps to control them better, a group of Colorado Party dissidents known as Mopocos were allowed to return from exile - and were led into a trap of severe restraints and total surveillance. Communism is forbidden, but so is the Christian Democratic Party, its leader banished. Anyone can found a new political organization: All that is needed are 10,000 signatures, a notion as inconceivable as the Supreme Court abridging General Stroessner's state-of- siege powers. The most effective counterforce in Paraguay is the Roman Catholic Church, whose newspaper, Sendero (Path), is essentially the only self-respecting reading material in the country now. The Archbishop of Asuncion, Ismael Rolon, has sent letters to the semiofficial press complaining of the scarcity of truth in their columns, but the letters are not published. Perhaps the most courageous of the churchmen is Bishop Melanio Medina of the town of Benjamin Aceval, a couple of stores and a sugar refinery about an hour's drive away from the capital and into the Chaco region. For La Patria, the Colorado Party newspaper, Monsignor Medina is the ''Red Bishop.'' The monsignor replies to the taunt with a smile of middling contempt, but he talks about Paraguay with the same sadness as the young people: ''The dictatorship has succeeded in domesticating us. Fear is pervasive. Youth has no ambition for political life. If you think, you come under pressure. If you don't think, you have no problems. No real dissident could survive. The country has been impoverished in the worst, most essential sense - in its humanity.'' Monsignor Medina says the ''Red Bishop'' jibe is the Government's pathetic response to his sermons on human rights and injustice. ''The anti-Communism of the regime is ridiculous, a facade to protect their own interests. The disrespect for the individual; the informers; the police - in these ways we are like the Communists, not very far from them at all.'' It may be a unique case in Latin America, but, within the opposition, the United States is not the focus of blame. Brazil, the essential source of Paraguayan money and arms, is often described as Paraguay's colonial warder. Argentina, once again a democracy, gets criticized for not matching its promises as a critic of oppression, and for sending, instead, its Cabinet ministers to pose with General Stroessner's friends for the signature of a hydroelectric project. Compared to Argentines and Brazilians, who have the alleged arrogance of big brothers - and money invested in Paraguayan agriculture, light industry and utilities - Americans seem somehow vague. A century ago, President Rutherford B. Hayes decided in Paraguay's favor in an international arbitration, and since then, America's errors or disinterest or negligence vis- a-vis Paraguay are treated with eerie semi-indulgence. The opposition says the United States could do more to exert pressure: withdraw its ambassador, block internationally funded loans to the general's regime, howl in public about 30 years of Stroessnerism. American assistance to Paraguay, which totaled $187 million in technical and economic aid from 1942 to 1984, comes to about $190,000 this year. With an average annual income of more than $1,000, Paraguay, like Brazil, Colombia or Mexico, is regarded as being out of the league of desperate poverty, and assistance from the United States Agency for International Development is being terminated. Washington still maintains an Office of Defense Cooperation in Asuncion, with a $50,000 annual budget for sending a handful of officers to United States Army training schools; others occasionally join in American-led command exercises. These days, the United States does not offer General Stroessner either guns or much money, or even photo opportunities. On the other hand, with the exception of a complaint when ABC Color was closed, and the absence of an American honor guard from this year's big parades in Asuncion, the Administration does little to oppose General Stroessner, even symbolically. None of the difficulties thrown up for General Pinochet's Chile are carried over to Paraguay; the United States turns its head when money for the country is discussed at the Inter-American Development Bank or the International Monetary Fund. The current Ambassador is Arthur H. Davis Jr., a Colorado shopping-center developer described as a friend of the brewer Joseph Coors, one of the major backers of President Reagan's campaign. Coming after Robert White, the Ambassador for two years of the Carter Administration, who nagged and nudged Paraguay into releasing hundreds of political prisoners, Mr. Davis was greeted like a long-lost friend. He turned out to be rather more interested in human-rights violations than the general or his friends would have liked. Although it was not the Ambassador's fault, a gaffe by the State Department was probably the most significant American action in relation to Paraguay this year. Somehow, a departmental document included a reference to the Mopocos - a breakaway faction of the Colorado Party - as having possible terrorist links. The information was wrong, the United States Embassy acknowledged in an open letter. But the Paraguayan Government, insisting on the well-known infallibility of the American security services, has used the gaffe to turn the Mopocos into pariahs. The State Department is more certain of the accuracy of another piece of information, which Paraguayan officials also frequently wave in the air for visitors as the final, transcendental proof of the goodness of the general's life work. On 10 so-called key issues in the United Nations last year, Paraguay voted with the United States more faithfully than any other country in the world. ''What I keep telling the Americans is that Paraguay is not a case of the regime or the Communists,'' says Mr. Zucolillo, the ABC Color publisher. ''But there must be some political growth here - something. We're stunted. Otherwise, the alternatives when the old man goes are not all good ones.'' Although Mr. Zucolillo does not name them, the alternatives are obvious enough. One is a war among the Colorado Party clans and the military factions; a new dictatorship, weaker, more brutal, more unstable; revenge, trouble, bloodshed. The stuff of revolution. In Paraguay, Mr. Rubin says, ''power has never been handed over peacefully.'' Rather more sanguine is the reasoning that Brazil and Argentina, with their large investments in the country, would act to prevent any upheaval. Pushed further, the argument contends that since Argentina has already returned to democracy, and Brazil is expected to move away from military rule when an electoral college chooses a new president next January, General Stroessner must take heed of the trend. Foreigners often talk that way. Paraguayans think that the years ahead may bring a civilian president, perhaps Luis Maria Argana, the chief of the Supreme Court, but that someone in the military is certain to be behind him - perhaps the powerful General Rodriguez, once described by United States narcotics agents as a drug-running ally of Auguste Ricord; perhaps Gen. Gerardo Johannsen, a rather more self-effacing officer, who heads the country's military training institutes. General Stroessner, according to a diplomat, has given General Johannsen the following bit of advice for the years to come: ''In this country, don't tell anyone your family is from Denmark. The Danes are bakers, bacon makers. From now on, Johannsen, you're German. They're soldiers.'' Paraguayans who look closely at the general for signs of slippage; who watch hopefully for an end, and fear an end; who yearn for a new life while dreading the future of a country stripped of political structure and robbed of so much of its pride, say the prognosis is depressing: After Stroessner, more Stroessner. TO WATCH THE COUNtry watch him, I flew into the Paraguayan outback, to a place called Capitan Bado, where the general went to unknot inaugural ribbons at a post office, a dispensary and, it seemed, anything else that had been built there in the last 10 years. The town's main street, a wide dirt road that looked like a river bed, is the border with Brazil; no customs men, just some soldiers wearing forage caps with chin straps, and a tent show, the ''Fantastico Circo Koslov,'' that could have come straight from ''La Strada.'' I had been told the general was popular in the countryside, and red banners nailed up at a little stand fit right in: ''Stroessner, Stroessner is the jubilant cry emerging from our Paraguayan soul,'' and ''Welcome, noble and illustrious chief, governor of the heart of America.'' I was given a red Colorado Party bandana, which I was graciously dispensed from wearing, and a seat in the reviewing stand about three rows behind the general, which made me uncomfortable, thinking of the violent, reviewing-stand end of Anwar el-Sadat. There were some speeches, and then we walked, following the general, through the dirt streets. There were school kids in white smocks, and little bunches of townspeople. We walked and walked, and there was silence. Past the old men in white shirts, the guys in cowboy hats, the kids with their shoes shined - walking in total silence. Thirty years, and it had come to this! Oh, the stillness! Finally someone cheered, ''Viva Stroessner.'' It was thin but audible. The general broke ranks, went over, and shook the man's hand.

648-> CAMPAIGN NOTES; New Matching Funds To Mondale and Jackson
The Federal Election Commission has approved more than a half-million dollars in matching funds for Walter F. Mondale and the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson to help pay off debts from their battle for the Democratic nomination. Mr. Mondale will get $352,271, raising his share of matching funds to nearly $8.2 million. Mr. Jackson, who finished behind Mr. Mondale and Senator Gary Hart, will get $167,539, for a total of $2.7 million. On Thursday the agency also approved $27,902 for another also-ran, Senator John Glenn of Ohio. All told, the action raises to $33,672,037 the amount that 11 Presidential candidates have received this year from the Treasury. President Reagan previously received the maximum, $10.1 million.

653-> SCOUTING; Foster Achieves A Career First
After 15 years of playing experiences, most professional athletes have seen just about everything their particular sports have to offer. But as 35-year-old George Foster of the Mets discovered Tuesday night in a game against the San Francisco Giants, a career always has room for another milestone. In the second inning of the game, which the Mets eventually lost by 5-4, Foster was involved in a series of events that ended with his stealing home for the first time in his career. ''Yeah, it was kind of unusual,'' said Foster. ''I'm not known as a fleet base runner; really, all the credit goes to Mookie Wilson.'' After singling to get on base, then moving to second on Wilson's hit, Foster tagged up and went to third on Hubie Brooks's sacrifice fly. With two strikes on Mike Fitzgerald, Manager Dave Johnson called for Wilson to steal. At the same time the Giants called for a pitchout. Instead of running into the tag, Wilson stopped between first and second base and reversed his direction, drawing the second baseman and the first basemen in a rundown. Foster was waiting for the right time to break, preferably when the first baseman, who would have to stop turn and throw, had the ball. ''As it turned out, they made the wrong play,'' Foster said of the infielders. ''Why pay attention to me? Mookie has the speed, they should have stayed after him.'' Just as the first baseman threw to the shortstop, Foster made his move. He broke down the third-base line, then slid in under the tag. Afterward, Foster, shrugged and said the key to the play was simple: ''I fooled 'em,'' he said. ''I fooled them with my speed.''

655-> THE CITY; 3 Hurt in Pileup In Lincoln Tunnel
A seven-vehicle pileup that began when a dump truck struck the rear of an auto injured three drivers and tied up traffic in the Lincoln Tunnel for four hours yesterday morning. A spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Mildred Schneider, said the truck driver, Milton Weston of Queens, was cited for unsafe tires, no brake lights and the improper display of license plates. Two motorists - Bernard Elstein, 73 years old, of Manhattan, and Howard Garfield, 56, of Queens - were treated and released at St. Mary Hospital in Hoboken, N.J. A third motorist, who was not identified, was treated for cuts at the hospital later and released. The accident occurred at 8:05 A.M. in the westbound lanes of the tunnel's north tube. Miss Schneider said that when the truck hit the car it started a chain reaction of vehicles hitting others. Normal traffic did not resume until afternoon.

658-> 'BRITISH FILM' AT MODERN
The young man was working in a London film studio doing odd jobs and helping to design title cards, but the studio head, a producer, believed in promoting up through the ranks. And so, after serving an apprenticeship, he was given the opportunity to direct a picture himself. The film, which was called ''The Pleasure Garden,'' told the story of two young women working in the chorus line of a London dance hall. Its plot twists took one of the heroines all the way to Africa, where the seemingly gallant man she had married turned out to be a bigamist with a native wife. After drowning that wife, he tried to kill the young woman from London, attacking her with a sword. Although the film was made in 1926, its suspense, its sly humor, its unexpected developments, the plight of its endangered heroine all foreshadowed the later work of the young odd-job- man-turned-director. His name was Alfred Hitchcock. ''The Pleasure Garden'' is the first film to be shown in the Museum of Modern Art's wide-ranging exhibition ''British Film,'' a retrospective that will encompass more than 300 films from nine decades of English film history. The exhibition, which opens today, is the largest ever mounted by the museum and the most comprehensive survey of British film ever conducted. Organized in cooperation with the National Film Archive of the British Film Institute, which provided most of the prints, the exhibition will continue into early 1986. Hitchcock's First Feature ''The Pleasure Garden,'' which will be shown this afternoon at 2:30 and again on Sunday at 5 P.M., was Hitchcock's first feature-length film. The producer who gave him his start, Michael Balcon, is the subject of the first part of the retrospective, a survey of Balcon's work that will run until February. Over the course of four decades, Balcon produced more than 260 feature films, from the earliest works by Hitchcock to the comedies starring Sir Alec Guinness that were made at the Ealing Studio. One of the most famous Ealing comedies, ''Kind Hearts and Coronets,'' will provide the official opening of the retrospective tonight, and the 70-year-old Sir Alec is scheduled to speak before the 6 P.M. showing of the 1949 film. A satire on Edwardian manners and morals, ''Kind Hearts'' stars Sir Alec as eight different members of a ducal clan that includes a young man bent on killing off his kinfolk so he can succeed to the family coronet. Sir Alec not only plays an aged vicar, an admiral, a banker and a general who falls victim to dynamite inserted in his caviar, he even plays Lady Agatha, a suffragette. ''Kind Hearts'' will be shown again on Sunday at 2 P.M. ''With the Hitchcock film, we wanted to demonstrate something Balcon did during the course of his career, which was to promote new talent up from the floor to become directors,'' explains Lawrence Kardish, the co-director of ''British Film'' and curator of the museum's department of film exhibitions. ''We chose 'Kind Hearts' because it is one of the best- known of the Balcon films, and Guinness was the star of a number of them. Balcon thought that one of the main differences between British and American films was the use of the English language, and nowhere in the Balcon canon is English used as exquisitely as in 'Kind Hearts.' '' 'Good Companions' Tomorrow The weekend's offerings also include ''The Good Companions,'' a 1933 film version of J. B. Priestley's popular novel about a group of itinerant players. Starring Sir John Gielgud and Jessie Matthews, ''The Good Companions'' was the first talking film to be viewed by the King and Queen of England in public. It will be shown tomorrow at 2 P.M. Tomorrow at 5 P.M., the program will feature ''Hindle Wakes,'' a 1931 film by Victor Saville. Based on a play by Stanley Houghton, ''Hindle Wakes'' focuses on a young woman in a Lancashire mill town and her misadventures in dealing with class, property, marriage and sex. The Balcon survey will be followed by the second part of the British film exhibition, a critical 90-year survey organized thematically around such concepts as melodrama, realism and the British character. The films are being shown at the Roy and Niuta Titus Theater 1 at the museum, 11 West 53d Street. Tickets are free with museum entry, $4.50 for adults, $3 for students, $2 over-65's. Information: 708-9500; for recorded daily announcement of film schedule, 708-9490.

659-> MEMBERS OF PANEL SPAN RANGE OF EXPERIENCE
The panel members who wrote the Pastoral Letter on Catholic Social Teaching and the United States Economy have no formal background in economics. But they have served in parishes and dioceses that spanned a wide range of economic conditions, from the rural Middle West to the urban East. Before writing their report, the panel members listened to 125 experts in the fields of labor, business, and economics in dozens of meetings and hearings held over the last two years, officials said. Archbishop Rembert G. Weakland of Milwaukee, the panel chairman, appointed the four other clerics who sat on the panel. They range in age from 47 to 72. The two younger panel members, Auxiliary Bishop Peter A. Rosazza, 49 years old, of Hartford, and Bishop William K. Weigand, 47, of Salt Lake City, were among the bishops who first proposed and pushed for a Catholic study of American capitalism. Archbishop Thomas A. Donnellan, 70, of Atlanta has a doctorate in canon law from Catholic University in Washington. He began his clerical career in New York where he was ordained in 1939. He served in a number of positions in the New York Archdiocese, including judge on the marriage tribunal that made decisions about annulment requests. Later, he was named rector of a seminary in Yonkers. He was named Bishop of Ogdensburg, N.Y., in 1964, and in 1968 he was appointed Archbishop of Atlanta. Auxiliary Bishop Rosazza of Hartford attended Dartmouth College for a year before entering the seminary and completed his theological studies in France, where he was ordained in Paris in 1961. Bishop Rosazza has a master of arts degree in language studies from Middlebury College in Vermont. He served on the faculty of a seminary in Bloomfield, Conn., from 1963 to 1972. In 1972 he was named co- pastor of Sacred Heart Church in Hartford. He was named Auxilary Bishop in 1978. Bishop George H. Speltz of St. Cloud, Minn., is, at 72, the oldest panel member. He holds a doctorate in philosophy from Catholic University. He was ordained as a priest in 1940, and his first parish was in Winona, Minn., where he remained for years, teaching philosophy at a local college and serving as rector of a seminary. He was named Auxiliary Bishop of Winona, and in 1968 he was appointed Bishop of St. Cloud. In the 1970's, Bishop Speltz was president of a Catholic conference that dealt with the problems of rural and farm families. Bishop Weigand of Salt Lake City holds a master of divinity degree from St. Thomas Seminary in Kenmore, Wash. He was ordained in 1963 as a priest in Boise, Idaho. He served in a number of Boise parishes, was chancellor of the Boise diocese, and worked as a Catholic high school religion teacher and as a part-time prison chaplain at Idaho State Prison. For nine years, until 1977, he was pastor of a missionary parish in Cali, Colombia. When he returned to Idaho, he was appointed pastor of a bilingual Hispanic church in Homedale. He served there until his appointment as Bishop in 1980.

660-> CAUSE OF HEPATITIS TRANSMITTED THROUGH BLOOD IS REPORTED FOUND
Margaret M. Heckler, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, said today that Federal scientists had succeeded in identifying the virus that causes the major form of hepatitis transmitted through blood transfusions. She called the discovery ''a major medical breakthrough'' that could lead to a test to detect contaminated blood supplies and said it might also ''open the door to possible development of a vaccine'' to prevent the disease caused by transfusions. The finding was published by researchers from the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health in the latest issue of The Lancet, a British scientific publication. 120,000 Afflicted Yearly The scientists reported that they had identified and characterized that agent, or family of agents, that cause a form of hepatitis known as non-A non-B hepatitis. This form of hepatitis afflicts 120,000 Americans each year, about 90,000 of whom contract the disease through blood transfusions, according to F.D.A. officials. More than 1,000 of the victims die each year. Dr. Robert J. Gerety of the F.D.A. said in a telephone interview that about 90 percent of the hepatitis transmitted in blood transfusions is non-A non-B. He said there was no way to identify individuals who transmit the disease through blood transfusions because they generally had no symptoms or other charactertistics that suggested they harbored the virus. He said about 10 percent of all individuals who received five or more units of transfused blood become infected with the non-A non-B virus, although many show no clinical symptoms and are unaware they have the disease. The scientific achievement being reported, he said, was in identifying ''the major agent responsible'' for non-A non-B disease as a retrovirus, or closely related retroviruses. A retrovirus is a class of virus so named because it reverses the normal molecular processes by which a virus reproduces itself in the body; it does this with an enzyme called reverse transcriptase. The scientists analyzed blood samples from 18 patients who had non-A non-B hepatitis and found that all 18 had reverse transcriptase. The scientists also identified the retroviruses through their density in an ultracentrifuge and by viewing them under an electron microscope. 'Could Be Family of Retroviruses' ''We feel confident that a retrovirus is responsible, although it could be a family of retorviruses,'' Dr. Gerety said. The significance of the discovery, he said, is that scientists can proceed to purify and study the virus more closely, possibly leading to a treatment for the disease, which has thus far been untreatable. By studying the virus and the proteins it produces, he added, scientists could develop a screening test for these products and perhaps even a vaccine to prevent the disease. ''It opens a lot of doors,'' he said. Dr. Gerety said he and his colleagues had already developed a ''prototype test'' that appeared useful in diagnosing the disease in patients who already had relatively high levels of the virus, but he said it was not yet clear how well the test would work in screening large numbers of individuals who might have very low levels of the virus in their blood. He added that the paper had been reviewed for accuracy and significance by 10 scientists at the National Institutes of Health, four scientists at the Food and Drug Administration and the editors of The Lancet. The co-authors of the paper were Belinda Seto, of the Federal drug agency, William G. Coleman Jr., of the health institutes, and Sten Iwarson of the University of Goteborg in Sweden, a visiting researcher at the F.D.A.

661-> Topics; Shaping the Future
City Builder Edward J. Logue has written, in stone and social change, a tale of three cities -- New Haven, Boston and New York -- where he has spent his years as city dreamer, city planner, city accomplisher. Given the strong support of New Haven's daring Mayor of the 1850's, Dick Lee, Ed Logue turned that city's cluttered industrial downtown into a sparkling showcase of architectural innovation. He understood that New Haven could survive only as a cultural and service center, dispatching its surviving factories to suburbs that could handle expansion. On to Boston, where he helped create a magnificent municipal government center and stimulated private builders to redesign the city and reuse its older architectural elements. Then to New York, where he first ran the URban Development Corporation. He believed in permanent Federal support for programs to help the poor, and accordingly built apartments for thousands of families of modest income throughout the city, stretching the credit and resources of his agency to the breaking point in order to battle poverty and prejudice. When Washington's faith withered, Mr. Logue nurtured the discouraged sections of the Bronx with new housing, even suburban houses, on Charlotte Street near Crotora Park. When Federal funding was cut back sharply he had to abandon the original plan, but replaced it with experiments and by inspiring economic development in conjunction with other agencies, including the Port Authority. Now Ed Logue is headed back to Boston, where his wife directs a school for dyslexic children. He leaves monuments behind, but the reviving hope in the Bronx may be a tribute to him more lasting than concrete.

662-> Body Discovered in California Is Believed to be Brautigan's
A body discovered yesterday by the police in a house in Bolinas, Calif., was believed to be the remains of Richard Brautigan, a quixotic counterculture poet and writer, his publisher said. The police who entered the house in the seaside town 16 miles north of San Francisco discovered the body of a man who appeared to have been dead for several weeks, the Marin County Sherrif's office said. But the police said they were not yet releasing the identity of the deceased. According to Seymour Lawrence, Mr. Brautigan's publisher at Delacorte Press in New York, the body was Mr. Brautigan's. Among his books were ''Trout Fishing in America,'' ''The Pill Versus the Springhill Mine Disaster'' and ''In Watermelon Sugar.''

663-> ; BRINGING THE YOUNG INTO THE LABOR FORCE
To the Editor: Thank you for your Nov. 5 editorial on the New City Workers Project for out-of-school, hard-to-employ young people. We are delighted with this program and the support it has received, not only from Ed Sadowsky and the members of the City Council, but also from Mayor Koch and the Board of Estimate. Cost is enormously important in carrying out this kind of initiative, and I want to clarify that the $4.75 million will serve almost 3,000 of those who would normally find the door to the job market firmly closed. In addition to the parts of the program mentioned in your editorial, there will be a component to find jobs and provide counseling, and another combining work experience and housing rehabilitation. While the 3,000 slots will still leave many in need, it is a real effort to help others and to help ourselves by tapping the potential of these energetic and often overlooked youths. The program is critical because it deals with a portion of the population normally excluded from employment and training programs. Under the new Job Training Partnership Act, CETA'S replacement, a series of regulations has made it difficult to serve those who are most in need - those with low educational levels and minimal work histories, which disqualify them from training programs. ''City Works'' will be used as a model to help bring these young people into the labor force. Finally, the program is extraordinary because it is truly cooperative. Besides the support of the City Council, Board of Estimate and the Mayor, others have played important roles. Examples include a $30,000 contribution from the Rockefeller Group for necessary research, and city agencies will provide work sites. While such a program can never make up for the massive problems caused by Federal reductions, it shows what can be accomplished when segments of our community join to work on issues of mutual concern.

665-> BOARD ACTION ON JOBS TO AID HOMOSEXUALS
The Board of Estimate yesterday approved an addition to city contracts that provides job protection for homosexuals - much the same protection that was found unconstitutional when it was in the form of a mayoral order. The measure, a two-paragraph amendment to city contracts, was approved unanimously at 9:30 P.M. The board's vote applied to 61 city contracts, but the administration of Mayor Koch intends to extend its applications to any company or agency that provides goods or services to New York City. Last month, a State Supreme Court justice declared unconstitutional a mayoral order extending to city contractors job protection for homosexuals. The judge, Alvin F. Klein, found that the Mayor ''had impermissibly invaded the legislative domain'' by issuing the order. John P. Hale, a lawyer for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, which was among the parties to the lawsuit that led to Judge Klein's ruling, had contended earlier in the day that the board did not have any more authority than the Mayor to implement such an anti-bias measure. He said that if the board were to approve the measure, the archdiocese would sue the city again and seek to recover its legal expenses. The proposed addition to city contracts states: ''In addition to and not in substitution for any other requirement of this agreement, the contractor agrees that it will not refuse to hire or employ, nor bar or discharge from employment, nor discriminate against any persons in compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment, because of age, race, creed, color, national origin, sex, marital status, handicap, sexual orientation and affectional preference. ''The City recognizes that agreement by the contractor not to discriminate on the grounds of sexual orientation and affectional preference does not constitute an endorsement by the contractor of any particular sexual orientation or affectional preference. The city further recognizes that such agreement shall not in any way prevent the contractor from making employment decisions based on job-related conduct.'' Hadley W. Gold, the first assistant corporation counsel, said that of the contracts on the board's calendar yesterday, 17 were with contractors who were likely to object to the anti-bias measure, 16 of them with the archdiocese and one with the Salvation Army. The Salvation Army and Agudath Israel of America had joined with the archdiocese in the lawsuit against the city challenging the constitutionality of the mayoral anti-bias provision. The city is challenging Judge Klein's ruling.

667-> SANITATION URGED FOR FIELD HANDS
Medical authorities testified today that thousands of American farm workers, lacking access to toilets or clean water at their work sites, suffer levels of parasitic illness rarely encountered in developed societies. "In effect, migrant farm workers represent subpopulations of the third world within our country," said Dr. Eugene J. Gangarosa of the Emory University School of Medicine, Dr. Gangarosa was one of five expert witnesses invited by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for a hearing on proposed Federal rules requiring field sanitation. The experts added that the lack of toilets and hand-washing facilities on farms creates health hazards for nearby communities and possibly for consumers of fresh produce. 11 Years of Litigation Acting under a court order and following 11 years of litigation, OSHA has proposed to require toilets, fresh drinking water and cleanup facilities wherever more than 10 workers are employed in the field. It is the first time the issue has advanced to the hearing stage. A similar proposal in 1976 was withdrawn after protests from farm employers and ridiucle from from conservative politicians. The proposed rules would apply to an estimated 529,000 workers, according to a consultant retained by the agency. More than 90 percent of farm laborers would be unaffected because they work in crews of 10 or fewer. Despite laws in 12 states requiring varying degrees of field sanitation, the OSHA consultant, Centaur Associates of Washington, estimated that more than a third of the farm workers in the nation have no toilets available, one in five has no hand-washing facilities and more than half are not provided with drinking water. Lack of Evidence Asserted Southern tobacco farms, upper Middle West vegetable farms an apple orchards along the north Atlantic coast were least likely to provide sanitary facilities, the consultants found. Patrick H. Quinn, who is scheduled to testify Thursday for an industry group, the National Council of Agricultural Employers, said poor fleld sanitation may cause sickness but there is not enough evidence to prove it. OSHA officials have expressed open doubt whether such a link can be proved. The authorities who testified today admitted statistical evidence is scarce because farm work is seasonal and many workers are migrants, making research difficult. Moreover, they said, many public health officials do not check patients for parastic infections, which are rare where modern hygiene is available. But witnesses called as experts by OSHA said they had no doubt about the prevelance of parasites and other illnesses among farm workers, and no question that sanitation facilities would greatly relieve the problem. Parasites and Intestinal Ailments Dr. Jesse Ortiz of the University of Massachusetts, who has studied Puerto Rican farm workers in Western Massachusetts, said he found hookworm, whipworm and other parasites were more than twice as prevalant as they were among poor Puerto Ricans living in American cities. Dr. Gangarosa cited evidence that hepatitis, dysentery, diarrhea and other intestinal disorders spread by exposure to feces are widespread among farm workers. He said the proposed sanitation rules "would virtually eliminate the fecal-oral diseases" among farm workers. Charles L. Stout, director of the state migrant Health Program in Colorado, said in a prepared statement that ill ness related to inadequate sanitation accounted for one out of seven problems diagnosed by his agency last year. Colorado does not require field sanitation unless workers are housed in temporary labor camps. Mr. Stout said, "We have in Colorado and in other states a get of conditions that sets the stage for major disease outbreaks." Heat Stroke and Infections Other witnesses said farm workers are also subject to heat stroke and urinary infections when fresh water is not available. Outside the Labor Department hearing room, some witnesses expressed astonishment that the issue would be a matter for debate. "I'm surprised that we are here at all," said Dr. Ortiz. "In this modern age, we should not have to be discussing toilet facilities and hand-washing facilities for anybody." Dr. Charles Levenstein, a Harvard economist scheduled to testify Friday for the American Public Health Association, said: "It's a disgrace to be having this hearing in 1984. Dr. Levenstein said that in attempting to compute the economic losses attributable to farm workers to nearby residents of consumer when feces contaminate water supplies or fresh produce. Dr. Ortiz said bacteria and other parasites can survive on fresh-picked fruit or leafy vegetables for days, creating "an obvious threat to the general public." After taking testimony in Washington, the agency will conduct hearings next month in Texas, Florida, Ohio and California before deciding whether to make its proposals final.

669-> GREENS DON'T WANT TO PLAY GAMES
To the Editor: In ''Sleaze in Bonn,'' her column for Oct. 26, Flora Lewis says that the Greens ''haven't made up their minds whether they would deign to accept the responsibility of joining the Government if they got the chance, and no one can foresee how they would use authority if they had it.'' In fact, the position of the Greens is quite clear. We are not interested in joining governments as a figleaf. So far, no other party has shown any readiness to join us in implementing those drastic policy changes that are necessary if we are to avoid an ecological collapse or nuclear war and create a just and sustainable society. We need a disarmament race instead of the present arms race, and we have ample scope for unilateral initiatives in this world of massive overkill capabilities. We need to work toward a steady-state economy, not a return to the fool's paradise of continued economic growth at the expense of further generations, the ''politics of the last hurrah.'' So far, the other West German parties are only interested in gaining back our voters by making ''green'' noises. Under such circumstances, Green ministers would be a bad joke, blocked by their ''partners,'' by the bureaucracy and by shortsighted industrialists. We are prepared to join in taking responsibility for clearing up the dangerous mess that the old right and left parties have caused. But we have no interest in playing political games simply to help them continue business as usual.

670-> SUIT SEEKING TO PAY INTERNED JAPANESE DISMISSED BY JUDGE
A Federal district judge today dismissed a suit brought on behalf of the 120,000 Japanese-Americans removed from their homes and detained in camps in World War II. Judge Louis F. Oberdorfer ruled that the six-year statute of limitations precluded the filing of such a suit. The ruling, if upheld on appeal, would foreclose the possibility of the Japanese-Americans' winning compensation in court for the losses they suffered. It focuses renewed attention on bills before Congress that would provide some compensation for the surviving Japanese-Americans who were interned. Both the suit, which asked for $24 billion in compensation, and the Congressional action came after a Federal commission began studying the relocation program. The commission found that the internment was a ''grave injustice'' motivated by ''race prejudice, war hysteria and a failure of political leadership.'' It recommended payments of $20,000 to each of the 60,000 surviving citizens and resident aliens interned in the war. The legislation is pending before committees in the House and Senate, with hearings expected this summer. ''What this means is we've got to redouble all of our efforts as it relates to a legislative solution of this injustice,'' said Representative Norman Y. Mineta, Democrat of California, who introduced the House bill. Mr. Mineta was interned for several years as a child with his family in a detention camp in Wyoming. Although the forcible relocation took place more than 40 years ago, lawyers for the Japanese-Americans had argued that the six-year limit did not block their suit. They contended that the clock on the statute of limitations did not begin running until last year, when the Federal commission that studied the relocation issued a report that the survivors said brought to light new evidence of Government duplicity essential to mounting a suit. The commission, the plaintiffs said, found documents that proved the Federal Government did not believe its own claims that the wide-scale relocation of Japanese-Americans was needed to protect the West Coast from security threats. Judge Oberdorfer found, however, that key documents disclosing those Government doubts had been published decades ago. ''It may be that timely claims on their behalf would have prevailed,'' he wrote, referring to those interned. ''But it is now close to 40 years after the camps were closed, and almost that long after facts essential to those claims were published. Much time has passed, and memories have dimmed, and many of the actors have died.'' Judge Oberdorfer said the statutes of limitation were enacted by Congress to take account of those concerns ''and it is those statutes which present an ultimate bar to plaintiffs' claims.'' The judge, in his 59-page opinion, said reports casting doubt on the Government's statement that the internment program was a ''military necessity'' were published as early as 1946. A report to President Roosevelt that found ''there is no Japanese 'problem' on the Coast,'' the judge wrote, was disclosed in 1946 before a joint Congressional committee. Also, a 1949 book by Martin Grodzins disclosed questions raised by J. Edgar Hoover, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, about whether there had been unauthorized radio transmission emanating from the West Coast. Such evidence had been used to suggest that Japanese spies were operating in California. Scholarly Research Cited Judge Oberdorfer concluded that the relocation of the Japanese-Americans had produced extensive scholarly research which ''lays out almost all of the facts alleged'' in the lawsuit. The judge conceded that the 1983 Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians had discovered several previously unpublished documents. These included Department of Justice memorandums in which officials wrote of deciding to delete from submissions to the Supreme Court doubts about evidence supporting the internment. Judge Oberdorfer wrote, however, that ''there has long been sufficient circumstantial evidence'' that documents were concealed by the Government. Benjamin L. Zelenko, one of the attorneys who argued the case for those who had been interned, said: ''We're disappointed and we want to study the opinion and consult with our clients. I would expect we will appeal but I cannot speak for our clients.'' Ronald Wakabayashi, a spokesman for the Japanese-American Citizens League, said he believed the court had ruled on a ''technicality.'' ''The elements of this case, beyond technicalities like the statute of limitations, remain apparent. This was a clear injustice and Congress does not have to contend with the issue'' of the statutes of limitations. The bills before Congress incorporate the major recommendations of the commission. They call for a $1.2 billion trust fund to make payments to those interned who are still living and an additional $300 million to create a special foundation that would encourage research and education on the subject. The legislation would also provide for a formal national apology, relief for several thousand Japanese-Americans who were given dishonorable discharges from the military and pardons for those convicted on charges of resisting the evacuation. The bills would also pay $5,000 to each surviving Aleut Islander who was similarly relocated. More than 900 Aleut islanders were involved.

672-> BRANIFF'S GAMBLE: SHRINK TO SURVIVE
As Braniff Inc. tells it, the troubled airline has resorted to a new form of hibernation, an act of shriveling to stay alive through the winter. ''We'll shrink the airline through the winter to preserve our cash,'' Patrick Foley, Braniff's new president, said in an interview today, ''and then expand again in the springtime.'' By most accounts, however, that notion is more of the excess optimism that has characterized Braniff since it came out of bankruptcy reorganization last March with hopes of winning a new niche in the competitive Dallas market. More likely, outsiders say, Braniff has chosen a retrenchment that may only postpone its demise. Abandoning 10 Cities The carrier announced late Wednesday that it would abandon service to 10 cities, surrender 9 of its 12 gates at the Dallas-Fort Worth Regional Airport, chop its fleet to only 10 of its 30 Boeing 727-200's, and seek to lease the rest to other airlines. Braniff also announced the resignation of its president, William D. Slattery, who was brought in about a year ago by Braniff's owners, the Pritzkers of Chicago, to head the revived airline. He had been an executive in Europe for Trans World Airlines. The retrenchment will cost hundreds of jobs and reduce Braniff to a semblance of its former self. The old Braniff International had more than 60 planes and employed 7,000 people when it filed for protection from creditors in May 1982. Jay A. Pritzker, who put together a $70 million package to revive the airline and bring 2,500 people back to work, said yesterday that he had not given up on the carrier, however. Dedicated to Building Braniff ''We remain dedicated to building Braniff into a viable airline,'' Mr. Pritzker, the chairman of the Hyatt Corporation, said in a statement. Mr. Pritzker and Mr. Foley, who had been vice chairman of Braniff, outlined the cuts at a meeting attended by hundreds of employees at Dallas Love Field Wednesday night. Mr. Foley said yesterday that Braniff had already agreed to allow 10 planes to be used by Northeastern International Airways Inc., a new carrier based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Braniff was negotiating with other carriers and charter services for the remaining 10 aircraft, he said. Leasing Agreements In the Northeastern deal, Braniff would get more money leasing each plane than the $90,000 a month it must pay its own creditors for each plane, he said. By reaching six-month agreements with other airlines for the planes, he said, Braniff would keep its crews employed and be able to expand next year if traffic warranted. Mr. Foley said that, effective Nov. 5, the airline would suspend service to San Antonio, Houston and Austin, Tex.; Kansas City, Mo.; Detroit; Miami; Newark; New Orleans; Oklahoma City, and Philadelphia. He characterized flights to these cities as short hauls ''that we never made money on and have been a drain.'' Instead, Braniff will concentrate on long hauls. It will continue to serve nine cities from Dallas-Fort Worth: Boston, Chicago, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Phoenix, New York, San Francisco and Washington. Analysts were skeptical that Braniff's holding action would work and said they saw little chance for the airline to escape liquidation. ''Whenever a company gets smaller, it rarely works to make a company stronger,'' said David P. Campbell, an airline analyst for Wheat, First Securities Inc. ''It usually continues to lose money - maybe less, but it continues to lose money.'' ''It is not a strategy that will make any difference,'' he added. Moreover, some creditors also said yesterday that Braniff might be violating agreements with them by letting other airlines operate the fleet. Still, Mr. Pritzker and Mr. Foley expressed determination. In Mr. Foley's words, ''Somehow, someway, we will find a way to make this airline stay in business.'' Mr. Foley said drastic steps had to be taken because, on average, the airline's flights were only half filled in September and October. He added that Braniff needed to fill slightly more than 60 percent of its seats to break even. The airline, which has lost more than $80 million since it began flying again, was losing an additional $4 million to $7 million a month. Under its original revival plan, approved by the bankruptcy court last year, it projected the projection was that the carrier would have losses of about $14 million in its first year of operation. With the reduction of operations, Mr. Foley said it no longer needed some of its gates at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport. These, he said, would be assigned to American, which would pay $20.5 million. The airline has struck a similar deal with United Airlines for gates at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago and Stapleton Airport in Denver, under which it would be paid $16 million. The transfers must be approved by the airport boards and Federal authorities. Separately, two major rivals, American and Delta, have agreed to let those who bought tickets by Wednesday for the discontinued Braniff flights travel without paying additional charges. In addition, Muse Air, a regional carrier, will accept those passengers on flights to eight destinations. Also, Mr. Foley said that Mr. Slattery, his predecessor as president, had accepted the presidency of a new California airline, Air Via, which is based in San Jose.

675-> Coast Suspect Is Held In Threat to Ferraro
An employee of Apple Computer Inc. was arrested today and charged with threatening to shoot Geraldine A. Ferraro, the Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate, when she visited the company's headquarters in Cupertino this morning. Larry Charon, 36 years old, was arrainged before United States Magistrate F. J. Woelflen in San Francisco and ordered to appear in San Jose next Thursday for bail setting. According to Joseph P. Russoniello, the United States Attorney for California's northern district, Mr. Charon was arrested after a fellow employee reported that he had made verbal threats against Mrs. Ferraro on Wednesday. Law-enforcement officials arrested Mr. Charon this morning just before Mrs. Ferraro's scheduled speech. They said they found a pistol, two bows and a number of razor-tipped arrows in the trunk of his car, which was parked at the Apple plant in Cupertino, about 50 miles south of here.

677-> SCOUTING; Giant Potential
Should Bill Roberts become a starter as a rookie, achieve all-pro status in time and be elected to pro football's Hall of Fame, he would only begin to atone for the misjudgments and mistakes by the Giants with regard to his predecessors. The latter can be categorized as offensive linemen who were either first- round draft choices of the Giants, or the team's first selection in a year in which it had no first-round choice. Roberts is an offensive tackle from Ohio State drafted 27th on the first round three weeks ago. After choosing Carl Banks, the Michigan State linebacker, with the third overall selection in the draft, the Giants traded their second- and fifth- round choices to the Washington Redskins for the opportunity that George Young, the general manager, sought desperately so he could take Roberts. Young said afterward that he and his personnel experts regarded Roberts as the best offensive lineman in this year's pool of college talent. In other years other people had made statements like that on behalf of the Giants regarding other players. Beginning with the National Football League's first draft of 1936, the Giants have had 12 offensive linemen as first choices and only 2 justified the selection. One was Ed Widseth, an all-American from Minnesota in 1937 who played for the Giants before World War II, and the other Gordon King, the first choice from Stanford in 1978, whom Roberts may beat out for a starting job. The best player Roberts opposed in college, he said, was Bill Maas, the defensive tackle from Pitt who was the fifth player chosen in the draft, by the Kansas City Chiefs. His performance against Maas was what convinced Young of Roberts's potential value. Roberts has not yet signed a contract and Richard Bennett, a Washington agent, is doing his negotiating. ''We should sign pretty soon,'' said Roberts.

678-> TAMING OF THE NEWS CONFERENCE
It was a couple minutes before the start of President Reagan's news conference Tuesday night and the White House spokesman, Larry M. Speakes, had just finished his usual run-through of the ground rules. Raise your hand, don't speak until you're sure it's you who's been recognized, no more than one follow-up related either to the initial question or to its answer. ''Any problems?'' he inquired, stepping down from the podium. Hearing none, he added, ''Good, go get 'im.'' This may have been a bit of offhand bravado, since it would be surprising only if the President's handlers were not confident that their man could easily handle his periodic duel with the press corps elite. The fact that Mr. Reagan is a polished public performer, and a pretty quick study, is an obvious advantage. But he and his aides also maintain tight control of the news conference format and have, in fact, refined that control to a new peak of predictability that borders on ritual. They Sit Patiently No longer, for example, do correspondents leap from their seats, hands waving and clamoring for recognition, which had become a regular feature of the postwar news conference. Now they sit patiently, in seats assigned by the White House staff, and wait for the Presidential nod and pointed finger that means they may put their question. ''We try to make it as orderly a process as possible,'' said Peter Roussel, a White House deputy press secretary. Indeed, so orderly is it that some frequent participants regard the system as virtually impossible for an ''outsider,'' an accredited but nonregular White House reporter, to break through this well-planned exercise in spontaneity. The seats are assigned by the purported status of the organization, with the ''heavyweight'' broadcast and print reporters given places in the choice center section where one most easily catches the Presidential eye. The network television correspondents find themselves right down front just where a Hollywood director would place them for best visibility by the cameras. Questions by Tradition Following tradition that predates the Reagan era, the question-and-answer period always starts with the President's recognizing the White House correspondent of The Associated Press or United Press International, who take turns asking the first question. Mr. Reagan, well-briefed by his staff, took pains Tuesday night to point out that Maureen Santini of The Associated Press would have a ''double first'': her first question as the news agency's chief White House correspondent. Then, after these two questions and the requisite follow-ups - most correspondents seem to think they dare not forgo the second question for fear of seeming unaggressive - the action turns to the three major networks. Each one has decided who will ask its first-round question and the President, who knows them all, has no trouble picking the men and women for CBS, NBC and ABC. Lesley Stahl and Bill Plante, for example, rotate the assignment for CBS, but Sam Donaldson, Mr. Roussel notes, ''always asks the ABC question.'' Highly Predictable What follows may seem unplanned to the casual observer, but in reality it is highly predictable. Familiar faces, usually of major publications, dominate the questioning. And Mr. Reagan, often declaring that he wants to give the other side of the room a chance, will generally find one in the most distant rows of the center section. Then a black reporter, one usually assigned to one of the two wing sections, is often recognized. Then the President calls upon one of the more colorful regulars, probably a well- known veteran such as Sarah McClendon, who represents a group of Texas newspapers, or Lester Kinsolving, who can be counted upon in any Administration to express a right-of- center opinion as he propounds his question. One correspondent said Mr. Reagan appeared to have made a special effort to call upon women at this week's session, perhaps because of the gender-gap issue. Mr. Roussel, however, said today that this was news to him. The Seating Chart Mr. Reagan, who when he took office tried unsuccessfully to impose a lottery system for the questioning, is thought to be the first President to consult the seating chart. His staff says he sometimes jots down, in advance, the names of people he wants to call upon. This allows him to address the occasional stranger by his first name, a piece of flattery that feeds the ego of the obscure correspondent as well as making the President seem all-knowing. Finally, a few minutes past the prescribed half-hour, Helen Thomas, U.P.I.'s chief correspondent and the ranking news-service reporter, looks at her watch and seeks an opportunity to bring the prime-time proceedings to an end. ''There are certain constants at White House press conferences,'' Mr. Roussel said, ''and she's one of them.'' Half rising from her seat, usually with the President giving the cue, she utters the final authorized words: ''Thank you, Mr. President.''

680-> THE CITY;
A Staten Island high school student injured Wednesday in a woodshop accident died early yesterday and an inquiry ordered by Mayor Koch found that a city ambulance had taken 18 minutes to reach him, about 9 minutes longer than average. The student, Matthew Golterman, had been struck in the head by a wood chip tossed by a lathe in the shop at Tottenville High School. Mayor Koch ordered an investigation, which was conducted by the director of the Emergency Medical Service, James T. Kerr. Mr. Kerr said the average response time for such calls last month was 8.8 minutes. According to Mr. Kerr, the accident was reported at 12:32 P.M., and the caller was put on hold. This occurred, Mr. Kerr said, because all ambulances were busy. When the call was processed, it was given to an ambulance farther away than would ordinarily be the case. An ambulance arrived at 12:50.

681-> Kings Weigh Shift to Coast
The franchise began as the Rochester Royals. It was also the Cincinnati Royals, the Kansas City-Omaha Kings and now just the Kansas City Kings. By next season, the team could be on the move again, this time to Sacramento, Calif. Gregg Luckenbill, the majority owner with real-estate interest in Sacarmento, has said that fan support in Kansas City this season will determine whether the Kings remain or move. Joe Axelson, the team president, and Jack McKinney, the new coach, gave this rationale: ''People don't come to see a losing ball club.'' After the 113-100 loss to the Knicks Saturday night at Madison Square Garden, the Kings fell to 1-6. Four losses have been at home, where they have averaged 9,700 fans. Axelson said that no average attendance goal had been set yet to determine whether the team would stay in Kansas City. Temporary Arena Due Meanwhile, the Kings have allowed a Nov. 1 deadline to lapse for discussions with the city for extending their Kemper Arena lease. In Sacramento, Luckenbill is constructing a three- story office building that Axelson said could be turned into a temporary arena seating 10,000. Axelson, former vice president of operations for the league, emphasized, ''If we decide to move, we will ask permission.'' The Clippers moved from San Diego to Los Angeles this season without league permission, and a suit filed by the league is pending. The Kings' patterned offense, designed to slow rival teams, was the right tonic for the injury-riddled Knicks to snap a six-game losing streak. In his pre-game talk, Coach Hubie Brown told the players he did not care how many fouls they committed as long as they did not allow drives down the middle. Pressure Defense The Knicks, without the ailing veterans Bill Cartwright, Marvin Webster and Len (Truck) Robinson, as well as the rookie Eddie Wilkins, did more than carry out the order. They pressured the Kings into 23 turnovers and 42 percent shooting, and blocked seven shots, with James Bailey making three of the blocks. And the Knicks shot a creditable 50 percent. ''We made them set up their offense further from the basket to stop their penetration,'' said Rory Sparrow, the playmaker. The Knicks' second victory came without dependence on the scoring of Bernard King, who finished with only 18 points. His previous season low was 24 against Utah. ''We had contributions from 10 players,'' King said, ''and that had to be a morale booster.'' Orr the Driver Louis Orr, who started at power forward for the first time this season, had 16 points, 10 from the free-throw line. He constantly drove the basket, something the Knicks had not been doing. The competition stiffens for the Knicks this week, with games against the Washington Bullets and the Boston Celtics. How do you play such rugged teams when you lack size. ''Cut down on mistakes, turnovers and fight for every rebound,'' said Rick Pitino, an assistant coach. ''Until we get Cartwright back, the strategy will be different in every game. Hubie will be shifting the personnel around offensively and defensively. It will be toughest on the players. ''What we're going to do is win ugly. We're not going to look good.''

The dividend is payable Jan. 2 to stockholders of record Dec. 14. Earlier, Kaneb reported a loss for the third quarter of $51.4 million, after the write-off and various other nonoperating items, compared with a profit of $13.9 million, or 37 cents a share, in the comparable quarter of 1983. The company said it had concluded that the carrying values of some of its operating assets, mostly contract drilling equipment, were ''significantly in excess of the values considered to be realizable.''

684-> KITCHEN EQUIPMENT; SODA FOUNTAIN AT HOME
EVERY adult can remember childhood visits to the diner or ice cream parlor and those extraordinarily frothy milkshakes that were served in tall ribbed glass. It never seemed possible to duplicate the bubbly texture at home, either with an electric blender, with an eggbeater or with frantic, elbow- breaking shaking of the drink's ingredients in a tightly capped jar. The froth came from that peculiar- looking stainless-steel obelisk behind the counter, the one with a long steel beak and a nickel-size disk at the end. The counterman would fill a container with milk, ice cream and flavorings, hook it up to the machine and flip on the switch. The high- pitched screech sounded like a dentist's drill, but the results were far more pleasant. Only fanatical drinkers of milkshakes would find it practical to buy one of those expensive commercial machines. But now the Waring Company is producing a relatively inexpensive combination of electric hand mixer and drink frother that makes it possible to create soda-fountain concoctions at home. Called the Waring Multi-Mixer, it looks like a normal electric hand mixer when detached from its storage base. The mixer has three speeds and two removable beaters that are easy to clean. To turn the machine into a drink mixer, it is placed on its plastic stand and the top end of the mixing stem is inserted into the back end of the hand unit. The Multi-Mixer comes with a plastic cup that attaches to the base of the stand. When the mixer is working, the small disk at the end of the stem rotates and froths liquids in the cup. While the unit could have been made of sturdier material such as stainless steel or aluminum, this plastic model does a more-than-adequate job of making milk shakes, malted milks and other ice cream combinations with great success. The Waring Multi-Mixer is available at Bloomingdale's, Lexington Avenue and 59th Street, where it costs $40.

688-> GRINNING, FIST CLENCHED, MONDALE ENDS CAMPAIGN
Walter F. Mondale ended his long campaign for the Presidency today with his fist held high, his face showing a grin and his voice rising. ''Tomorrow we can make history,'' he told a crowd in downtown Los Angeles. ''We can make history by giving them the biggest upset in history.'' Clenching his fist, the Democratic Presidential candidate cried out: ''We can prove that a President can't isolate himself in a question-free zone and get away with it. We can prove that when a President hides his plans, ducks the issues, and insults the intelligence of the American people, he must pay the price on Election Day.'' ''Let's make history, let's build the future, let's win this election,'' he shouted as the crowd in Pershing Square roared approval. Homecoming in MinnesotaLate tonight Mr. Mondale, grinning and waving to friends, was warmly welcomed by a hometown crowd of several thousand in a hangar at Minneapolis/St. Paul International Airport. It was his last stop of the campaign. In a quiet voice tinged with melancholy, Mr. Mondale said: ''Tonight I end my campaign where I started, with you my fellow Minnesotans. All that I am and all that I believe flows from what I've learned from you and from this state. ''You have trusted me all of these years, and you have given me, a small- town boy from Elmore, a chance to shape our country and to shape our time. And you have given me a life that's very very rare and marvelous.'' ''My Presidency will reflect you,'' Mr. Mondale said. ''Your heart, your mind, your conscience, your love of country, your faith, your belief in peace and your decency.'' ''And decency above all has been at the center of my campaign because, above all, Minnesotans are decent,'' Mr. Mondale went on solemly. 'Thousands of Miles'Tonight I end what may be the longest campaign in American history. For thousands and thousands of miles, through long days and long weeks and long months and now long years, through all the debates, through all the campaigns and speeches, through all the joys and heartaches I can hear you, and I can also hear Hubert pushing me on.'' As the audience cheered the reference to Hubert Humphrey, Mr. Mondale swallowed hard and said, ''And I kept pressing forward. And when I got tired I could hear you say, 'Give it another whack,' and I did.'' ''And l'll tell you this,'' Mr. Mondale said. ''Whatever the result tomorrow, I've given this campaign everything I've got.'' Several people in the crowd cried as Mr. Mondale and his wife, Joan, and three children, William. Theodore and Eleanor, left the hangar and climbed into cars for the trip to their home in suburban North Oaks. 'Don't Let Them Do It!' Mr. Mondale's appearances today were marked by an undercurrent of anger and bluntness. In Los Angeles, he told the crowd:: ''The choice is clear. If you let them make history, they'll turn your vote into a future you never wanted. Don't let them do it!'' ''The country belongs to you, and tomorrow you can take it back into your hands.The truth is, polls don't vote, people vote.'' After saying the nation could ''make history by electing Geraldine Ferraro Vice President,'' he went on: ''Just look at the choice. Gerry Ferraro or George Bush. It's a choice between someone who's grown during the campaign and someone who's shrunk. It's a choice between a leader for her Administration and a cheerleader for his. It's a choice between a candidate with courage and character, or a character who's been called the Cliff Barnes of American politics.'' The reference was to an unsympathetic character in the television series ''Dallas.'' The speech encapsulated the Mondale campaign themes. He spoke of cleaning up the environment, launching ''a renaissance in education, science and learning'' and of reforming the tax system. ''My fellow Americans,'' Mr. Mondale said toward the close of his speech. ''There's no escaping it. Tomorrow someone is going to make history. Let it be us. ''If it is, as long as you live, you'll never forget it. You'll tell your children and grandchildren that you came to this rally on this day. You'll tell them it was the eve of a historic upset.'' Meanwhile, Mr. Mondale's campaign began a 24-hour national television drive to appeal to wavering Democrats and middle-income voters. In one commercial, Mr. Mondale said he ''will leave medium- and moderate-income Americans alone'' in any tax increase. Other commercials centered on arms control and ''decency'' in American life.

689-> Dixville Notch Votes For Reagan, 29 to 1
Thirty voters in this isolated White Mountain hamlet cast the nation's first ballots early today and voted almost unanimously to re-elect President Reagan. ''It's not a cliff-hanger,'' said Rick Tillotson, 38 years old, whose father owns the Balsams Hotel where the town's registered voters cast their ballots. The voters favored Mr. Reagan by a margin of 29 to 1. The 21 Republicans, five Democrats and four independents, each in their own voting booth, cast their ballots right at midnight according to town tradition. The town has cast the country's first primary and general election votes since 1960, when it incorporated for voting purposes. The Dixville vote has been a bellwether in only two of five Presidential elections. Voters picked President Nixon in 1972 and Mr. Reagan in 1980. Mr. Reagan won 17 of 23 ballots, or 73.9 percent, four years ago.

691-> FINANCE/NEW ISSUES ; Big Oglethorpe Power Bond Issue
The Oglethorpe Power Corporation, the nation's largest electric cooperative, is selling $435 million of bonds through authorities in Appling and Burke Counties in Georgia. The cooperative generates and transmits electricity to member cooperative systems in 150 of Georgia's 159 counties. Underwriters led by Smith Barney, Harris Upham tentatively offered the bonds with yields ranging from 6.50 percent for those due in 1986 to 10.30 percent in 1999. The bonds are rated Aa-3 by Moody's Investors Service and AA- by the Standard & Poor's Corporation. Long-term bonds included a 10 1/2 percent issue due in 2001 at a price of 100, 10 5/8 percent bonds due in 2005 at 99 1/2 to yield 10.69 percent, 10 percent bonds due in 2010 at 94 3/8 to yield 10.65 percent and 7 percent bonds due in 2013 at a price of 68 1/4 to yield 10.54 percent. A $65 million issue of 10 3/8 percent bonds due in 2014 was tentatively offered at 99 1/4 to yield 10.46 percent, and was rated AAA by S.&P. because of an insurance policy from the Ambac Indemnity Corporation. Proceeds of the financing will be used to pay Oglethorpe's 30 percent share of pollution control facilities at the Hatch Plant in Appling County and the Vogtle Plant in Burke County. Both are nuclear plants being constructed by the Georgia Power Company, the primary owner. Although Oglethorpe expects to spend almost $1.7 billion on construction between 1985 and 1989, analysts at Moody's said the cooperative's financial condition was strong enough to sustain cost overruns at the plants.

692-> ORWELL ON HITLER: AN EFFORT TO UNDERSTAND EVIL
To the Editor: In his June 22 letter, August Franza says that George Orwell was ''quite fond of Hitler.'' Mr. Franza cites as the basis for this peculiar claim Orwell's 1940 review of ''Mein Kampf.'' Franza promises that the essay contains ''even more surprising'' remarks. They are worth looking at. Hitler's ''joyless mind,'' says Orwell of his putative friend, ''envisages, a hundred years hence . . . a continuous state of 250 million Germans with plenty of 'living room' (i.e. stretching to Afghanistan or thereabouts), a horrible brainless empire in which, essentially, nothing ever happens except the training of young men for war and the endless breeding of fresh cannon fodder. How was it that he was able to put this monstrous vision across?'' Because he appealed to the people. And in his review Orwell examines the source of that appeal. Partly, he says, it lies in the dictator's ''pathetic, dog-like face, the face of a man suffering under intolerable wrongs. . . . He is the martyr, the victim . . . the self-sacrificing hero who fights single-handed against impossible odds. . . . The attraction of such a pose is enormous; half the films that one sees turn upon such a theme.'' This is not the voice of someone who has been seduced by the pose. At the time Orwell wrote the review, he had already nearly died taking a bullet in the throat in Spain fighting men backed by the Nazis. He is not revealing an affection for Hitler; he is attempting to understand evil by seeking the wellsprings of its attraction. Franza has misunderstood Orwell's tone; and his tin ear for the somber irony of this one review may explain why, having studied Orwell's work ''thoroughly,'' he is still able to find in it an ''ambivalence toward power.'' RICHARD F. SNOW New York, June 22, 1984 The writer is managing editor of the American Heritage Publishing Company.

694-> DECEMBER SHUTTLE FLIGHT POSTPONED
The shuttle program suffered a major setback today when space agency officials grounded the Discovery's sister ship Challenger because of insulation problems. Challenger was scheduled to ferry a top-secret military satellite into orbit Dec. 8. A space agency spokesman, Charles Redmond, said Challenger was not expected to be ready to fly until ''three to six weeks'' after the original December date. 2,800 Tiles to Be Replaced Engineers will have to remove as many as 2,800 heat-shielding tiles from Challenger's underbelly because the bonding layer softened after six trips into space and repeated use of special waterproofing agents. Mr. Redmond said the officials had considered using Discovery for the military mission, but engineers expected to be able to repair Challenger faster than Discovery could be processed for another launching. The tile system, made up of more than 30,000 units, protects the shuttle from the blazing heat of re-entry into Earth's atmosphere. Challenger's tiles have been injected with a waterproofing agent called ''Silane'' and tests are under way to determine what can be done to correct the softening problem. Different Waterproofing Used The shuttle Columbia also has flown six times without any degradation of the bonding layer under the tiles. But unlike Challenger and Discovery, Columbia was waterproofed with Scotch-Guard. Space agency officials said Discovery was thoroughly inspected and there was no evidence of the softening problem. A few days after Challenger returned from its last mission, in which it carried a record crew of seven astronauts on an eight-day flight, engineers said it had come back in the best mechanical shape of any returning shuttle. An object, probably a buzzard, had struck the ship as it landed here but the damage to the ship was considered minor. Delays Becoming Critical Heat tile problems have been responsible for many of the delays in the shuttle program, especially in the early missions. But the delays are becoming more critical because the space agency is trying to meet an ambitious new schedule of one launching a month. Because there is only one launching site operating now, the delay in Challenger's next mission will push back subsequent flights. Another site here is under modification, and late next year a pad is expected to open at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The shuttle program is also under mounting pressure from military and commercial groups that want a reliable means of transporting satellites and other equipment into space.

695-> Financing Needed In Riegel Buyout
The Riegel Textile Corporation said an investor group, including its chairman, R.E. Coleman, and other management members, had been unable so far to secure commitments for all the financing required in its proposed acquisition of Riegel. The company said the group continues to seek financing. Riegel said the group had hoped to present to the board at a meeting held Friday a proposal to acquire the company for $30 a share. The company, which has nearly 3.8 million shares outstanding, dropped $1.75, to $26.25, on the New York Stock Exchange today. Riegel said in May that it had an agreement in principle to be purchased for $35 a share, but it terminated the agreement in June. The company said in September that it was holding talks with members of its management who were considering buying all of Riegel's stock.

696-> ART: FOR JEAN COCTEAU, WORD WAS MULTIFARIOUS
JEAN COCTEAU is a subject to make a curator's mouth water. A member of the avant-garde hall of fame, Cocteau collaborated or fought with many of the major avant-garde figures of the first half of the century. A respected novelist, playwright, film maker and, above all, poet, Cocteau was also a gifted draftsman, who needed the jet-propeled wings of lines on paper as much as the solid but more methodical wings of words. And what a life Cocteau led! Born into a well-to-do middle-class family in a Paris suburb in 1889, this lifelong aficionado of youth and fantasy, who liked to lie in bed and dress up in girl's clothes when he was a child, did volunteer work with ambulance units in World War I, like Ernest Hemingway. Cocteau spent months in the red- light casbah of Marseilles and preferred the nomadic existence of hotels to the settled life of apartments. He liked cabarets and music halls, became skilled as a drummer and spent years giving himself to and then trying to tear himself away from the siren of opium. Cocteau was what the French call a ''fabulateur.'' His imagination might be triggered by something in the world around him, but there was no telling where it would wind up. His need and gift for fantasy probably precludes moral conviction. During the World War II occupation of Paris, he was excited by the Nazi arrival and sponsored an exhibition by Hitler's official sculptor, Arno Breker. In the decade before his death in 1963, Cocteau was elected to the French Academy and given an honorary doctorate by Oxford University. Clearly, Cocteau is a big subject. Unfortunately, ''Cocteau Generations: Spirit of the French Avant- Garde,'' which is at the Grey Art Gallery and Study Center, 33 Washington Place, through June 23, is not up to it. Based on ''Jean Cocteau et les Arts Plastiques,'' a larger and less discriminating exhibition this year in Paris, the show asks no questions, builds no mood and is not accompanied by a catalogue. A book-length catalogue called ''Jean Cocteau and the French Scene'' has been prepared, but it will not be ready until the show travels to the Center for the Fine Arts in Miami and the Archer M. Huntington Art Gallery at the University of Texas at Austin. Without the catalogue, and particularly without Francis Steegmuller's biographical text, there is no way of gaining a sense of the complexity of Cocteau from the exhibition and almost no way of understanding what many of the objects, including paintings by Pierre Bonnard, Raoul Dufy, Juan Gris, Chaim Soutine and Giorgio di Chirico are doing there. The exhibition is part of a commemoration of the 20th anniversary of Cocteau's death, organized by the French-American Foundation and made possible by sponsorship from Remy Martin and with grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. The event also includes ''Parade,'' a show at the Brooklyn Museum through July 15, based on the curtain and costumes by Picasso for the celebrated 1917 ballet, which was conceived by Cocteau. What the exhibition at the Grey Gallery does provide is a documentation of Cocteau's multifarious creative activities. There is evidence of his contacts with Picasso; with Diaghilev, the choreographer of ''Parade''; with Nijinsky; with the costume designer and painter Leon Bakst; with the composer Poulenc and the actor Jean Marais. The exhibition includes many Cocteau drawings, the artist's Redonlike series of pastels called ''Astrologer'' and his portraits of Picasso, Charles Chaplin, Arthur Rubinstein, the Spanish bullfighter El Cordobes and the writer Colette, whom he adored. Of the paintings, sculptures and photographs of Cocteau, two stand out. One is a portrait by Modigliani, which paints the picture of a whimsical, somewhat haughty aristocrat. The other is Berenice Abbott's remarkable photograph of Cocteau's elongated Gothic hands, which could only belong to someone who inhabited a world of revelry far more than a world of earth and stone. The strength of the show is its beginning. After a comment on the young Cocteau by Edith Wharton and Jacques-Emile Blanche's portrait of the artist as a young man, there are drawings, photographs, paintings and collages that capture something of the excitement of what it was like at the beginning of the century to be around people like Diaghilev, Picasso, Erik Satie and Etienne de Beaumont. After this, the exhibition becomes prosaic. If the organizers had thought about Cocteau's craving for fantasy, and considered that this craving might have something to do with the limits, as well as with the magic of his work, the exhibition might have had something important to say. Also of interest this week: ''Artists Choose Artists,'' III (C.D.S., 13 East 75th Street): For the third year, the C.D.S. Gallery has asked an art critic to organize an exhibition in which younger artists choose older artists to be exhibited alongside them. The curators of ''Artists Choose Artists'' I and II were Dore Ashton and Jack D. Flam. This year's curator is Donald B. Kuspit, who selected seven artists: Sandro Chia, Stephen de Staebler, Jedd Garet, Bryan Hunt, Robert Moskowitz, Susan Rothenberg and David Salle. They chose, respectively, Cy Twombly, Peter Voulkos, Lucas Samaras, James Lee Byars, John Storrs, Albert York and Bruce Nauman. The partnerships can be revealing both about the artist and in helping us to understand how influences are absorbed. For example, Chia's selection of Twombly, who lived in Italy, rings a bell immediately. Twombly's gestural scribbles left a clear mark on the large painting by Chia in the ''International Survey of Recent Painting and Sculpture'' at the Museum of Modern Art. Twombly's influence can also be felt in the particular buzz of paint that animates some of Chia's canvases, including ''Mosquito Hunter With Flowers'' in this show. Another intriguing and, at first glance, far less probable partnership is Susan Rothenberg, one of the most respected and best known younger artists, with Albert York, a largely unknown painter with a strong underground reputation. York works on an intimate scale and paints traditional subjects, such as landscapes, in an almost self-effacing manner. In Rothenberg's larger and brasher paintings, thickly outlined, disembodied forms float, squeeze and clang together in white or black fields. Yet the connection between the artists is there. In ''Summer Trees,'' York works to retain the difference in texture between sky, grass, treetrunk and foliage and yet weaves the differences into an image with a single mood and impact. Susan Rothenberg, in her painting ''Endless,'' uses color to create a much starker distinction between forms. Then, directed by the logic of figure and ground, she tries to build her forms into a concentrated image. The impact is dramatic. (Through June 30.) Joan Witek (Rosa Esman, 121 Spring Street): Joan Witek's paintings consist of row upon row of vertical and horizontal black bars, rounded at both ends, spread across barely visible white grounds. The vertical and horizontal bars in a work tend to be the same length. The bars may become darker toward the top of a painting, creating a sense of flowering or emergence. In ''Split,'' a staircase of horizontal bars, surrounded on both sides by rows of vertical bars, climbs the middle of a canvas. The paintings suggest calligraphy, graphic design, Agnes Martin, Mondrian and, of course, Frank Stella, whom Witek admires. Of the many differences between Witek's and Stella's work, the two most important involve Witek's approach to space and her attempts to bring expressive content into a severe black and white format. Although Stella did not eliminate space in his black paintings, he concealed it to such a degree that many critics thought it was absent. By allowing the white behind the black to become an active force, Witek opens up many possibilities. The bars can seem to mask or to block out the light like the bars of a prison. When the bars seem elastic - squeezing, turning, balancing one another - their interaction can be experienced in terms of the light behind it trying to break through. The play of darkness and light also has a theological dimension, which gives some of these works a feeling not unlike that communicated by Romanesque and early Christian art. (Through June 23.) Marcel Broodthaers (Mary Boone, 417 West Broadway): The late Marcel Broodthaers was a Belgian artist, whose work came out of the 1960's, when some artists believed that observations linking esthetics, linguistics, Marxism and the contradictions of the art world were enough to produce art that mattered. In this exhibition, palm trees share one gallery with photographs, tracts and drawings, all of which are concerned with problems of art and language. ''Salle Blanche,'' in a back gallery, is a large installation in which the visitor faces a large unfurnished room whose walls are covered with words. There is no visual intelligence in these works, the ironies are as flat as the walls, and the intellectual and philosophical issues have been dealt with far more convincingly by dozens of writers and other artists. (Through June 30.)

697-> AROUND THE NATION; Reactor Unit Shut Down By Problem in a Test
A malfunctioning generator caused a reactor to shut down automatically as the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant continued operational tests, officials said today. The shutdown of Unit 1 Saturday came after an unidentified problem in the electronic control system for the turbine generator, not the reactor itself, said Ron Weinberg, a spokesman for Pacific Gas & Electric. The problem was listed as an ''unusual event,'' the least serious of four categories set by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ''We're looking for these kinds of things so we can fix them at this time,'' Mr. Weinberg said. ''Everything responded as it should have under the circumstances.'' Testing at the $5.3 billion plant began after the commission issued a full- power operation license for Unit 1 on Nov. 2. A legal challenge to the operation of Unit 1 is pending. The Unit 2 reactor, now in the final stages of construction, is undergoing preliminary tests.

698-> Whitman Upsets Sachem for Title
Kirk Murphy hauled in his second touchdown pass of the game with only 26 seconds remaining yesterday as Whitman (8-1-1) captured the Division I championship with a surprising 17-14 victory over Sachem (8-2). Bay Shore won the Division II title, defeating Comsewogue, 28-6, and Glenn earned the crown in Division III with a 22-0 triumph over Hampton Bays. Murphy's touchdown, a 20-yard pass from Matt Walsh, the Wildcat quarterback, came just moments after Mike Passantino had scored to give Sachem a 14-10 lead with 2:48 left. Mike Johnson, the Sachem quarterback, found Passantino in the end zone from 14 yards out for Sachem's first lead of the game. But Whitman, which rebounded strongly from last year's 1-7 finish, moved the length of the field and scored on Murphy's touchdown to grab the division title. County Trophy At Stake Bay Shore (8-1), last year's Rutgers Trophy winner, put itself in the running to recapture the cup - symbolic of Suffolk County's best team - by ruining Comsewogue's perfect season. Bay Shore was aided by the Warriors' own mistakes: Six fumbles and two interceptions figured significantly into their first loss. Bob Reif ran for a 23-yard score to stake Comsewogue to a 6-0 first-quarter lead. In the second quarter, on the first play following a Comsewogue punt, Bay Shore's Leroy Poindexter sprinted for 46 yards to tie the game at 6-6. Mike Phillips' 2-point conversion gave Bay Shore an 8-6 edge. On the next series, Charlie Vogt returned an interception 24 yards to extend Bay Shore's lead to 14-6. Two long Comsewogue drives late in the second quarter were halted by a fumble at the end of the half. ''We went in losing at halftime, even though we had dominated the game,'' said Tom Cassese, the Comsewogue coach. ''We out-gained them, out-played them, but we just couldn't punch it in.'' Poindexter added a touchdown run of 42 yards in the third quarter, and Phillips contributed another two- point conversion and Bay Shore's last touchdown. Glenn Holds Off Hampton Bays Defense was the difference for Glenn (8-2), as the Knights forced six turnovers and permitted Hampton Bays (6-3) into Glenn territory only twice. Bill Gould scored two rushing touchdowns for Glenn, and Billy Gallant added a third, as the Knights compiled 273 of their 275 total yards on the ground. Greg Perkins rushed for 115 yards on 20 carries, and Gould added 76, 72 of them in the first half.

699-> DAWN DWEIR, LAWYER WEDS MORRIS L. EFFRON
At the Midway Jewish Center in Syosset, L.I., yesterday Dawn Allison Dweir, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Irv Dweir of Woodbury, L.I., was married to Morris L. Effron, the son of Carole R. Wallace and Howard P. Effron, both of New York. Rabbi Ezra Finkelstein performed the ceremony. The bride, an associate with the New York law firm of Kramer, Dillof, Tessel, Duffy & Moore, graduated from the University of Pennsylvania and the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law of Yeshiva University. Her father is an independent producer of radio and television jingles and educational filmstrips. The bridegroom, editor in chief of two computer publications of the Ziff- Davis Publishing Company in New York, graduated from the New Lincoln School in New York and Yale College. His father is a business consultant.

700-> BRIEFING; Got a Match?
If a persistent politician digs deep enough in the rubble of a disastrous election, he can always find a spark in the ashes. Representative Tony Coelho of California, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, says in a memorandum to his House colleagues that the number of Republican Representatives elected in the Reagan landslide, 184, was the smallest pulled in by any successful Presidential candidate since Benjamin Harrison brought 173 Republican Congressmen with him in 1888 - a time, incidentally, when the House had only 330 members and such numbers were much harder to achieve.

701-> BRIEFING; Next, Majority Leader
The focal question in political Washington has rapidly narrowed in the past two weeks from who will be the next President of the United States to who will be the next majority leader of the Senate. But, in a suspense-hungry city, the intensity of interest seems almost as high and the maneuvering nearly as involved. Republican Senators will meet Nov. 28 to elect their 1985-86 leader. Bob Dole of Kansas, a leading candidate, discovered that he had a serious problem because his term expires in 1986 and potential supporters have expressed concern that he might soon have to spend too much time on his own campaign and shortchange his leadership responsibilities. When Gov. John Carlin, a Democrat, announced recently that he would not challenge Mr. Dole for his Senate seat, this handicap diminished, or so Mr. Dole believes. Supporters of Richard G. Lugar of Indiana for majority leader saw some indirect advantage last week when Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina repeated his campaign pledge not to claim the chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee. A few moderate Republicans, the theory goes, will now support Mr. Lugar for majority leader because the leader cannot also serve as a committee chairman and the Foreign Relations post would then go to Charles McC. Mathias Jr. of Maryland, a moderate. But, so another theory goes, this might cause Mr. Helms, a strong conservative, to change his mind and take the Foreign Relations slot. Paul Laxalt of Nevada, regarded as President Reagan's closest personal associate in the Senate, has been careful not to take sides in the leadership contest and thus appear to be revealing any White House preference. So careful, in fact, that when his Nevada colleague, Senator Chic Hecht, promised his support to James A. McClure of Idaho, Mr. Laxalt asked him to withdraw the pledge, lest it be interpreted geographically as evidence of Laxalt sentiment. Mr. Hecht complied. Other leadership contestants, no less active than those mentioned above, are Ted Stevens of Alaska and Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico.

704-> A MAN AND HIS CIGAR
To the Editor: In a May 17 editorial, you rued the transformation of postprandial pleasures, citing the proliferation of ''uncoffee,'' ''uncream,'' ''unsugar,'' ''uncigarettes.'' I'm worried about the loss of after-dinner enjoyments altogether. As a cigar smoker, I like to linger after a meal, relaxing and enjoying a fine cigar, appreciating my smoke as I would a special glass of wine. Unfortunately, increasing numbers of cigar smokers, fearful of confrontations with nonsmokers, think twice before lighting up. Or they passively retreat to relax with their cigars alone. This is regrettable. Thackeray thought of the cigar as ''one of the greatest creature comforts . . . a great stimulant - a cementer of friendships.'' To Tom Margittai, co-owner of the Four Seasons and himself a cigar fancier, ''. . . it's barbarous not to let people enjoy that which has become part of the dining experience.'' In reality, fewer people object to cigar smoking than a vocal minority would have us think. I always ask diners at adjacent tables if they would mind my lighting up and rarely encounter answers in the affirmative. JONATHAN M. WEISBERG New York, May 23, 1984

705-> SPORTS OF THE TIMES; The Redskins: Still Shining
The Washington Redskins needed Calvin Muhammad for catching passes. They did not need the massive object, bigger than a breadbox, more glittery than Al Davis's persona, that was twinkling on Calvin Muhammad's ring finger to remind them of last season's Super Bowl. ''You hate to use the word 'humiliated,' but that's pretty close to what it was,'' says Mark Murphy, the Redskins' eight-year safety who played in the 38-9 thrashing by the Los Angeles Raiders last Jan. 22. Calvin Muhammad, now a Redskin wide receiver, also played in that Super Bowl, for the other team in the most one-sided game in the 18 Super Bowls. The crushing loss was just the first obstacle the Redskins had to counter in this calendar year. More recently there has been the rash of injuries, the worst in the four- year Joe Gibbs regime. The decimation has put 27 players, including Mark Murphy, their Pro Bowl perennial, on the injured-reserve list since camp opened. It has made the Redskins use 65 players, including Calvin Muhammad, who came in a trade Oct. 3 from Washington's Super Bowl tormentors. Despite having six Pro Bowl players - Murphy, Charlie Brown, Jeff Bostic, Tony Peters, Dave Butz and John Riggins - on the injured list at one time or another, the Redskins have somehow managed to stagger into the last week of the season in first place in the Eastern Division. It is one of the few verities in a season of flux on the Eastern seaboard in which the Baltimore Colts were taken away by their owner in the dark of night, the Philadelphia Eagles are under threat of being displaced to solve their owner's financial embarrassments and the New York Giants, of all people, are still in contention. If the Redskins can beat the St. Louis Cardinals in R.F.K. Stadium Sunday, they will clinch the division title and also insure themselves of one of their Wagnerian home settings in the Dec. 29 or 30 playoff game with the Chicago Bears. It's a far better scenario than the way they opened their season, with consecutive losses to Miami and San Francisco. ''We knew both of them were good,'' Murphy said, ''but in retrospect we didn't realize how great they were this year.'' All the Redskins knew was that they were the Super Bowl champions of 1983, the trounced defenders of 1984, and an 0-2 team after two weeks. What was worse, the injury list began with 13 players before the season, including their 2 top draft choices, and expanded after every game. Murphy, a Colgate graduate who is vice president of the players' association, went down in the second game with sprained ligaments in his knee. He led the league in interceptions with 9 last season, giving him 27 for his first 7 seasons. He says he was healthy ''seven games ago,'' but the Redskins didn't activate him until four weeks ago, and he still has not reclaimed his job from Curtis Jordan. ''It's a really strange situation,'' Murphy said. ''I lost my job because I got hurt. Everybody else who was activated got his job back. But at the moment I'm glad we're winning and I'm glad to help any way I can.'' Even in his Pro Bowl seasons, Murphy rode shotgun on the punting team, calling the signals and placing himself as the last barrier to protect the punter. Now he also plays on the other specialty teams, which are mostly filled by young players eager to turn themselves into human projectiles to last a few weeks on a pro football roster. ''It's gone full cycle,'' Murphy said. ''That's the way I made the team when I first came along. It's like playing a brand-new position, running 50 yards downfield into a wedge, but the adrenaline takes care of that. I don't care what position you play on a football team, unless you give 100 percent, the risk is high that you'll hurt yourself. Part of it is pride, part of it is the team, but you always give your best.'' The Redskins must have wondered what their best would be this year. Twenty-two players have missed games, and the Redskins' public-relations staff has even issued an ''all-injured reserve team'' in their weekly medical reports, to underline the depth of their problems. Among the 65 players in uniform was Jeff Moore, a wide receiver who had been dropped by the 49ers and has now caught 17 passes for 150 yards and two touchdowns. Then on Oct. 3, the Redskins sent a middle- round draft choice to the Raiders for Muhammad, a three-year receiver from Texas Southern who had played on the Raiders' specialty squads in the Super Bowl. The Redskins did not need reminders of that loss. Murphy said, ''All off- season we had to live with it. There were only 100 million people watching. In training camp we talked about it and decided we wanted to be the only National Football Conference team to go to three straight Super Bowls. We wanted to win two out of three.'' What the Redskins had missed was represented by the hunk of hardware on Muhammad's ring finger. ''Like Liberace's most expensive ring,'' Murphy said. Al Davis had presented the tasteful little trinkets - about the size and subtlety of the spaceship that almost landed during the closing ceremonies of the Summer Olympic Games - to all the members of his Star Wars operation. ''Calvin's a great guy, very humble, just the type of person you want to have on your team,'' Murphy said. ''Some of the guys make jokes about the ring, but he only wears it once in a while. He wore it to the Dallas game. I think everybody noticed it.'' The Redskins didn't need the Raiders' ring to work themselves up for Dallas. They beat the Cowboys, 30-28, last Sunday to take over first place, as Muhammad caught 3 passes for 43 yards and a touchdown. He now has 31 receptions, 510 yards and 4 touchdowns, and has helped put the Redskins in a position to reach the playoffs on their own steam Sunday. ''We're coming off a good game,'' Murphy said. ''And it helps that the Cardinals beat us last time. You might worry about overconfidence, but I don't think we'll have that problem this week.'' After the drubbing last January and the injuries of this season, the Redskins have learned not to be overconfident. In a year when franchises move around like sidewalk hot-dog vans, it is good not to take anything for granted.

706-> New Antitrust Rules Would Allow for Imports
The Justice Department will announce new antitrust guidelines next week under which the market share of imports will be considered when mergers are being reviewed for possible challenge, the head of the antitrust division said today. Assistant Attorney General J. Paul McGrath, in an interview, said the department in the past had largely excluded foreign market share in evaluating competition, but was shifting because of the increasing share of imports in the American economy. The department ''will generally figure'' foreign market shares the same way as it figures domestic competition, Mr. McGrath said. But it will also consider the impact of trade restraints and the efficiency of the industry abroad. Foreign Competition 'Critical' ''Competitive imports will be considered in total even where they come from countries with limited trade from the United States,'' he said. ''The standards will be a recognition that foreign competition is critical in evaluating many markets.'' Mr. McGrath took over as antitrust chief in December. He almost immediately became embroiled in a squabble over merger guidelines when, in February, he let it be known that he opposed a proposed merger of the Republic Steel Corporation and LTV Corporation. Critics said his stance did not take into consideration the share of the American market held by imported steel. The merger was later approved with conditions. Mr. McGrath said today that revision of the guidelines to factor imports into market-share calculations began in January and did not arise from the LTV controversy. Awaiting F.T.C. Input Mr. McGrath said that the new guidelines are expected to be announced June 14, after the Justice Department receives final recommendations from the Federal Trade Commission. He said the present standards, issued in 1982 by his predecessor, William F. Baxter, do not detail how the Justice Department should evaluate data about foreign market shares. Calling the Baxter guidelines ''a massive improvement of updating and fine-tuning of old rules,'' he also said they are ambiguous and have presented difficulties for lawyers and investors trying to determine whether the department will challenge a merger. ''The '82 guidelines didn't communicate things as well as we'd like them to,'' he said. Mr. McGrath said he could not predict how his guidelines would affect mergers, but said they would be less ambiguous than the present rules. ''I don't think the present guidelines communicate what we're really looking at, which is the supply and demand in the future,'' he said.

707-> MARKET PLACE; ANALYSTS DIFFER ON COAL ISSUES
REVIEWING the performance of 110 stock groups, the Merrill Lynch Market Letter noted this week that the coal sector, on a relative strength basis, climbed to 18th place from 51st only a month ago. So what's cooking with coal, a stock group that, despite its recent showing, has headed generally downward since 1976? ''Demand is strong, reflecting the economic expansion and hedge buying in anticipation of a possible miners' strike in the fourth quarter,'' Merrill Lynch said. ''Spot market prices for steam coal are 20 percent higher than a year ago. June-quarter profits for most coal companies should be well ahead of year-earlier levels. ''We favor Eastern Gas and Fuel Associates, the Pittston Company and Mapco Inc.'' All three stocks are rated ''O.K. to buy'' over the next 12 months by the firm's research department. For possible long-term appreciation, Pittston and Eastern Gas and Fuel carry an outright ''buy'' opinion. Elsewhere, the Westmoreland Coal Company is rated ''neutral'' for the intermediate term and a buy for the long term. However, not everyone in Wall Street is enthusiastic over prospects for coal equities. ''There's no reason to rush out now and buy coal stocks,'' said Marc D. Cohen, who follows the industry for Kidder, Peabody & Company. Although improvements clearly exist on the domestic front, he said, coal exports make up ''a negative factor'' and are not expected to turn up until 1985. Increased demand from electric utilities in the first half of this year has helped domestic coal producers. Mr. Cohen ranks both Pittston and Westmoreland as neutral in terms of stock market expectations. However, for the long pull, he favors Eastern Gas and Fuel, along with Kaneb Services. Meanwhile, Mr. Cohen expects industrywide profits for 1984 to run 10 to 15 percent ahead of last year. But higher earnings for this year will basically reflect the fact that ''1983 was such a poor year for the industry,'' according to John F. Kawa, coal analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ''Inventories were high going into 1983, export demand fell off, production was cut back and prices came under pressure,'' Mr. Kawa added. ''While 1984 will be better just from a tonnage standpoint, it is hard to get enthusiastic about these equities without price increases. And recent price concessions in Japan and Europe are a definite negative.'' Mr. Kawa ranks all coal stocks, with one exception, as no better than a ''hold.'' He carries a ''buy/hold'' opinion on the North American Coal Company. ''With practically all of North American's coal sold under cost-plus arrangements, we think the stock can outperform the market and the group,'' he said. The industry's contract with the United Mine Workers union expires Oct. 1. That raises the question of whether a strike will occur this year. ''That's a tough one to call,'' Mr. Kawa said, ''but my guess is that there exists a 60 to 70 percent probability of some sort of strike or work stoppage.'' Mr. Cohen of Kidder, Peabody rates the odds of a strike considerably higher. ''I think there is a 95 percent likelihood of a strike,'' he said, ''and that it could last between four and six weeks.'' Lucien Virgile, coal analyst for the Value Line Investment Survey, sidesteps predictions on whether a strike will take place but he has definite thoughts on which stocks appear most attractive: ''Our two top-ranked choices for year-ahead market performance - North American Coal and the Pyro Energy Corporation - have bright futures even if coal prices don't improve.'' Hope for higher coal prices, in his opinion, is not the way to pick the stocks. ''Coal spot market prices have strengthened in the past few months and may rise still more,'' Mr. Virgile said. ''In both 1978 and 1981, this same pattern was present, only for the gains to be surrendered once the United Mine Workers agreed on a new contract with the coal industry.'' ''More than any other coal company,'' he said, ''North American had the foresight to expand its operations west of the Mississippi, almost guaranteeing tonnage increases despite a generally flat or even weakening market for Eastern coal over the long pull.'' As for Pyro, it has a ''clear path to higher profits without any prop'' from increased coal prices. ''Although we project modest long- term growth in demand for coal,'' Mr. Virgile added, ''the industry has more than enough capacity to satisfy such demand through 1986 to 1988 and beyond.''

708-> A SHIELD NOT MEANT TO PROTECT PORNOGRAPHY
To the Editor: In a May 27 editorial, you object to anti-pornography ordinances on the ground that they threaten First Amendment liberties. Were we in a situation in which the Bill of Rights was administered as an absolute, such rhetoric would estop both the Indianapolis and the Minneapolis legislation. Our reality sees the First Amendment differently. It admits situations, approximating the paradigmatic scream of ''Fire!'' in a crowded theater, that we as a society consider too dangerous to tolerate. What I read in your editorial is not that the First Amendment is inviolable but that the seduction, harassment and exploitation our male- dominated society perpetrates on women is tolerable. If men were raped as frequently as women are, you might just weigh those dangers differently. RALPH LANE New York, May 29, 1984

709-> ORWELLIAN AMBIVALENCE TOWARD ADOLF HITLER
To the Editor: Your June 12 article on the Orwell manuscript discoveries quotes William West as presuming that a yet- to-be-found five-minute birthday tribute to Adolf Hitler is satirical. This may not be the case, since Orwell was quite fond of Hitler. He wrote the following in the New English Weekly of March 21, 1940: ''I should like to put it on record that I have never been able to dislike Hitler. Ever since he came to power . . . I have reflected that I would certainly kill him if I could get within reach of him, but that I could feel no personal animosity. The fact is that there is something deeply appealing about him. . . .'' These remarks - and others even more surprising - appear in Orwell's review of ''Mein Kampf'' (''Collected Essays, Journalism, and Letters,'' volume 2, pp. 12-14). Those who know Orwell's work thoroughly will recognize his ambivalence toward power. I hope, for the sake of Orwell's reputation, that this ''tribute'' is never found. It is one ''treasure'' we - and Orwell's reputation - can do without. AUGUST FRANZA East Setauket, L.I., June 12, 1984

711-> ISRAEL AND SYRIA IN FIRST PRISONER EXCHANGE IN 10 YEARS
Israel and Syria exchanged prisoners of war today for the first time in 10 years. In an emotional five-hour ceremony in the Golan Heights town of Kuneitra, Israel handed over 291 soldiers captured in the Lebanon War in 1982, along with 20 Golan residents who had been arrested for resisting the Israeli occupation. Most of the residents chose to return to their Golan villages. The Syrians delivered three Israeli soldiers captured in the Lebanon War and three diplomats stationed in Beirut who were seized May 1 after they drove their car into Syrian-controlled territory. Israel said they had got lost; Syria said they were spying. Syria also handed back the bodies of what are believed to be five Israeli soldiers, including a pilot, while Israel returned the bodies of 72 Syrian soldiers. 25 Days Before the Elections The timing of the exchange, 25 days before Israel's elections, may help the governing Likud bloc, which trails the Labor Party by 16 percentage points. Israeli officials said the exchange had been in the process of negotiation for months and was not related to the election. Except for Defense Minister Moshe Arens, who oversaw the ceremony, no senior Israeli took part. ''This has nothing to do with the elections,'' said Shmuel Tamir, a Defense Ministry official who negotiated for Israel. ''This was simply the first day on which it could have taken place. Representatives of all Israeli parties were in the picture. On this issue there is a national consensus.'' The exchange also coincides with the Moslem feast at the close of the holy month of Ramadan and President Hafez el-Assad of Syria may have wanted to have the Syrian prisoners home for the celebration. Overseen by the Red Cross As reporters waited for the ceremony to begin, Brig. Gen. Yaacov Even, an Israeli spokesman, said wounded Syrian prisoners had thrown away their artificial limbs. ''When they saw the TV coming,'' he said, ''they insisted that we give them crutches. This is a democracy. So we agreed.'' Members of the International Committee of the Red Cross, who, along with the United Nations and Austria served as intermediaries, supervised the exchange. It began at 11:15 A.M. on a white line painted halfway across the 400-yard- long no man's land separating Israeli and Syrian forces around Kuneitra. The coffins were the first to be exchanged. It took 14 Israeli trucks piled high with the standard-issue plain wooden boxes to carry the 72 Syrian bodies, some of whom were identified by names and others only by numbers painted on the coffins. The Israelis received five coffins and, behind a curtain at the Israeli reception center in Camp Ziwan, pathologists confirmed the identity of two of the bodies. A Sergeant Walks to Freedom After much counting of heads by the Red Cross officials, the first Israeli, Reserve Sgt. Ariel Lieberman, walked briskly to freedom across the neutral zone. The 28-year-old soldier was a member of a tank crew captured in Lebanon on June 11, 1982. As he neared a sign reading ''Welcome to Israel,'' hundreds of waiting soldiers clapped and cheered. An army rabbi planted a yarmulke on his head and chanted a prayer. On the Syrian side, the first group of 50 soldiers to be released were welcomed with hugs and kisses from their comrades. A few of the Syrians, who were clad in T-shirts and jeans, knelt down and kissed the ground, before climbing aboard buses plastered with posters of President Assad. The exchanges went on in this manner throughout the morning - one Israeli for a large group of Syrians. At no time did Syrian or Israeli soldiers use the opportunity to chat. The only signs of friendliness came when an Israeli guard slapped a Syrian prisoner on the shoulder as he said goodbye and a Syrian soldier vigorously shook Sergeant Lieberman's hand before he departed. Last Exchange in May 1974 The Israeli-Syrian exchanged occurred May 31, 1974, in the framework of an agreement on the separation of forces. Last Nov. 24 Israel released 4,600 Lebanese and Palestinians it was holding in Ansar prison in southern Lebanon and in Israeli jails, in exchange for six Israelis held by Al Fatah, the main Palestinian guerrilla organization. Mr. Tamir, the Israeli Defense Ministry official, said that in the latest negotiations, Syria had first insisted there could be no prisoner exchange as long as Israeli forces stayed in southern Lebanon. But six months ago, he said, the Syrian position changed inexplicably, and the agreement was finally hammered out. To go through with the exchange, Israel reportedly had to give up a demand that four prisoners still held by two Syrian-backed Palestinian groups be freed at the same time, as well as a demand that the remains of Eli Cohen, an executed Israeli agent, be returned. The freed Israelis were taken for a debriefing and then the three military men were flown by helicopter to the Sde Dov military airfield in northern Tel Aviv to meet their families and be received by Defense Minister Arens and Gen. Moshe Levy, the Chief of Staff. The diplomats were escorted away by Foreign Ministry officials. At the Sde Dov airfield, the three soldiers were greeted with popping champagne and roses and were mobbed by family members and reporters. Sergeant Lieberman, holding his wife of eight months in his arm, was asked about his time as a prisoner. ''I can't tell you about two years in two minutes,'' he said. ''I can't tell you about all of my experiences in two years. They treated us much better than expected. We feel great. Everything is great.'' Israel Reports on Island Raid TEL AVIV, June 28 - The Israeli military command said today that a ''terrorist boat'' had been destroyed and three Israeli sailors had been injured in a naval engagement this morning off Tripoli, Lebanon. The report said the encounter took place at 6:30 A.M. near Nakhl Island, which the Israelis bombed Wednesday. According to the communique, an Israel vessel in the area came under attack from the boat, which it said had opened fire, wounding the sailors.

712-> HEBREW BOOKS' STORAGE DISCLOSED BY SOTHEBY'S
An unidentified individual smuggled 59 rare Hebrew books and manuscripts from Germany into the United States in 1939 and they remained in a safe-deposit box until most of them were sold at an auction at Sotheby's last Tuesday night, according to statements made by a Sotheby's lawyer. In an affidavit submitted to a State Supreme Court judge on the day of the auction, the Sotheby's lawyer, Marjorie Stone, said the individual smuggled the books ''after receiving them from the chairman of the board'' of a Berlin seminary, called the College for the Scientific Study of Jewish Culture. The seminary was closed by the Nazis in 1942. The items remained in the safe-deposit box until the consignor ''decided to consign them to Sotheby for sale at auction,'' the affidavit said. The statement did not make clear whether the consignor was the person who smuggled the books from Germany. The books were previously thought to have been destroyed in World War II. After Sotheby's announced in April that they would be publicly auctioned, a number of Jewish groups questioned whether the books were legally owned by those who wished to sell them. Ownership Files Sought The New York State Attorney General is now suing Sotheby's for its records concerning the materials' ownership, although New York City's Commissioner of Consumer Affairs, Angelo J. Aponte, has seen those records and has said he is convinced that the books were legally owned. The number of books that belonged to the seminary has previously been reported as 33. That figure is based on the auction catalogue, which specifies the seminary as a previous owner in some cases, and in others, says the books were previously owned by Abraham Geiger, a prominent Jewish historian who willed his belongings to the seminary after his death in 1874. Sixty manuscripts were auctioned Tuesday; 58 were sold. The sale raised $1.45 million. In a step that Sotheby's hoped would satisfy those protesting the sale, the collection's two most valuable manuscripts - a 15th-century Bible from Prague, estimated to be worth $500,000, and a 14th-century prayer book from Spain, estimated at $200,000 - were purchased by the Jewish Theological Seminary last Friday.

713-> HIGH COURT PUTS LIMITS ON BANKS
In a significant victory for the securities industry, the Supreme Court today struck down a 1980 Federal Reserve Board decision that had permitted banks to underwrite commercial paper, the short-term debt of major corporations. In a separate but related ruling, the Court unanimously upheld the BankAmerica Corporation's acquisition last year of the country's biggest discount securities broker, Charles Schwab & Company. The securities industry had challenged the acquisition as a violation of the legal separation of the banking and securities industries. The two rulings, based on interpretations of two cornerstone banking statutes, come at a time of ferment in Congress over the pace and direction of deregulation in the banking industry. In the last few days, the House and Senate Banking Committees have approved bills that take considerably different views of how far banks should be allowed to push into nontraditional areas. Complicating the Debate Today's Court rulings may well complicate that debate. They also are likely to lead to a new move in Congress to make it legal for banks to deal in commercial paper. In the Schwab opinion, Associate Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. noted that Schwab, as a discount broker, merely executes orders for the purchase or sale of securities and does not engage in underwriting, research or investment for its own account. By upholding the acquisition on those grounds, the Court seemed to strongly imply that it would consider a bank's acquisition of a traditional, full-service brokerage firm to violate either the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 or the Glass-Steagall Act. The Bank Holding Company Act prohibits bank holding companies from engaging in nonbanking activities that are not ''closely related'' to banking. In permitting the Schwab acquisition last year, the Federal Reserve Board ruled that the discount brokerage offered services that are virtually identical to the type of service offered for many years by the trust departments of commercial banks. Challenged by Trade Group That decision, which was challenged by the Securities Industries Association, was upheld last year by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New York. That court's ruling was affirmed by the High Court today. The Glass-Steagall Act prohibits banks from underwriting or dealing in securities. Since its enactment in 1933, it has served as the fundamental legal boundary between the banking and securities industries. While ruling today that Glass-Steagall did not explicitly bar the Schwab acquisition, the Court said in the second case that it does prohibit banks from underwriting commercial paper. Commercial paper, the short-term debt of major corporations, typically is issued with maturities of several months and in denominations of at least $100,000. Its purchasers are almost exclusively institutions such as money market funds, pension funds and bank trust departments. As of last year, there was more than $166 billion in commercial paper outstanding. Dealers charge a fee for their services, and the market is an attractive one. In a 6-to-3 opinion written by Associate Justice Harry A. Blackmun, the Court said today that commercial paper is a ''security'' within the meaning of the Glass-Steagall Act. Therefore, the Court said, the Fed acted without legal authority when it authorized the Bankers Trust Company to underwrite commercial paper on behalf of its corporate clients. The decision overturned a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals here. Bankers Trust's entry into the market in 1978 was challenged by A. G. Becker Inc., a major dealer in commercial paper, and by the Securities Industry Association, which represents most of the industry. The two petitioned the Fed for a ruling that Bankers Trust's activities were illegal under the Glass-Steagall Act. The Fed ruled, however, that because commercial paper more closely resembled a commercial bank loan than it did a security, Glass-Steagall did not apply. Strict Definition Upheld In the decision today, the Court said ''we cannot endorse the board's departure from the literal meaning of the act'' in its interpretation of the term ''security.'' Writing for the majority, Justice Blackmun noted that Glass-Steagall Act was an effort by the Depression- era Congress to restore soundness to the banking industry by insulating banks from the risks of the investment business. ''The act's design,'' Justice Blackmun said, ''reflects the perception that certain investment-banking activities are fundamentally incompatible with commercial banking.'' Justice Blackmun's majority opinion was joined by Justices Powell, Byron R. White, Thurgood Marshall, William H. Rehnquist and Chief Justice Warren E. Burger. In the dissenting opinion, Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Conner wrote that the Glass-Steagall Act does not define the term ''securities'' and that the Fed's interpretation was ''reasonable.'' Mrs. O'Conner was joined by Justices William J. Brennan Jr. and John Paul Stevens. Both decisions today had the same title, Securities Industry Assoc. v. Board of Governors. The commercial paper case was docketed as No. 82- 1766. The Charles Schwab case was No. 83-614. Reaction Is DividedYesterday's Supreme Court rulings were seen as a victory for those banks that deal primarily with consumers and a setback for banks that concentrate on doing business with big corporations. The reaction of the investment banking community was similarly split. ''We're pleased by the commercial paper decision and we're disappointed with the discount brokerage decision,'' said Edward I. O'Brien, president of the Securities Industry Association, which had challenged both. ''Of course we're delighted,'' said John G. Heimann, chairman of Becker Paribas Inc., one of the leading underwriters of commercial paper. But, he noted, he had not seen the decision. Charles S. Sanford, president of the Bankers Trust Company, said the company would continue its commercial-paper service, despite the ruling. Mr. Sanford noted that the court did not decide whether Bankers Trust was ''underwriting'' the paper, and that the question had been remanded to a lower court.

714-> EXXON OFFICER ELECTED PHILHARMONIC PRESIDENT
Stephen Stamas, a vice president of the Exxon Corporation, has been named president of the New York Philharmonic. Mr. Stamas was elected to the job at a meeting of the board of directors of the New York Philharmonic on Wednesday and the announcement was made yesterday by the board's chairman, Carlos Moseley. Mr. Stamas replaces the late Constance Hoguet, who died in July at the age of 65. Mrs. Hoguet had been president since 1981 and was the first woman elected to the position. Mr. Stamas, 53 years old, has a Ph.D. from Harvard University and was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford. Mr. Stamas was chosen for his interest in the arts and his fund-raising experience for the arts, Mr. Moseley said. At Exxon, Mr. Stamas has worked on with the Great Performers series on public television and helped initiate television's ''Live from Lincoln Center.'' He is also active in the Exxon/Arts Endowment Conductor's Program, the Meet the Composer Orchestra Residency Project and the American Symphony Orchestra League Management Fellowship Program. The president of the Philharmonic supervises the operations of the orchestra subject to the direction of the board. Zubin Mehta, as music director, makes the artistic decisions. Albert K. Webster, managing director, runs the orchestra day to day and is responsible for long-range planning. Mr. Stamas will oversee both jobs in general matters of policy and will participate in the activities of the board. Mr. Stamas is president of the Board of Overseers at Harvard University and serves on the boards of the American Council for the Arts, the Council on Foreign Relations, the New York Public Library, Rockefeller University and other institutions. Like Mrs. Hoguet before him, Mr. Stamas will serve without pay. He will continue as a vice president at Exxon. Mr. Webster said of Mr. Stamas: ''I have known him for years and look forward to working with him. We have some hard-working committees on our board of directors and Mr. Stamas will have a lot to do with them as well.''

715-> A NUANCE IN FIELDING QUESTIONS
President Reagan dominated his news conference tonight with a tone of moderation and a concern for nuance in discussing possible changes in relations with the Soviet Union. At times, he sounded nonpartisan, but not so much that he could resist some humorous political jabs at his critics. In short, it was a self-confident, middle-of-the-road performance for an experienced President well into his re- election campaign. At the outset of his 25th televised news session, there was an expectation that Mr. Reagan would have something new to say about the seemingly renewed possibility of a summit meeting with Konstantin U. Chernenko, the Soviet leader. As a result, most of the questions at the news conference related to the theme of easing tensions with Moscow, which political experts say is likely to be at the center of the campaign this year. The questioning seemed to give an unusual thematic coherence to the question-and-answer show. Hint of Stage-Managing There was evidence also tonight of tinkering by White House stage managers. The President made his usual dramatic entrance down a long red- carpeted corridor to the podium, but tonight he was not flanked by Marine Corps guards in dress uniform. Nor did any marines ceremoniously shut the door behind him as he left, which has been a much-observed and somewhat ridiculed feature of the last few news conferences. Also, by contrast to previous news sessions, he avoided major misstatements of fact and the sort of confusing and long responses that his own aides have termed ''filibusters.'' For example, earlier this year, every time Mr. Reagan was asked about the presence of American marines in Lebanon, he answered by giving a long history of his decision to introduce them there. His answers had struck many listeners as betraying Mr. Reagan's uncertainty and defensiveness. White House officials say they have noticed lately that Mr. Reagan has shown greater self-confidence in public. A Familiar Punch Line Mr. Reagan seemed clearly prepared for one question relating to politics. Asked about former President Jimmy Carter's comment that he would try to ''hide'' from a debate with his opponent this year, Mr. Reagan smiled and used one of his old punch lines from his 1980 debate with his onetime foe. ''President Carter said that I would hide?'' he asked in mock incredulity. ''There he goes again.'' Yet Mr. Reagan replied with no less assurance to another question he was obviously not prepared for. Asked whether he would complete a second term in office, or step down at the age of 75 or 76, Mr. Reagan said: ''What the devil would a young fellow like me do if I quit the job?'' As for the Russians, Mr. Reagan was less directly combative in his phrasing than he has been in the past. Instead he employed sarcasm to express his irritation with Soviet behavior. Looking wounded, Mr. Reagan denied that his own language against the Russians had been worse than their criticism directed at him. ''I don't think that I've said anything that was as fiery as them referring to the funeral service for the unknown soldier as a militaristic orgy,'' Mr. Reagan said. ''If we're going to talk about comparisons in rhetoric, they've topped me in spades.''

717-> LATIN CHIEFS ASK SUMMIT DEBT STEPS
Seven Latin American heads of government sent a plea today to participants at the economic summit meeting that begins here Thursday evening, urging them to initiate steps to ease Latin America's debt burden. The plea, coming on top of renewed criticism of American economic policy by West German and French officials, threatens to strain the relaxed and optimistic atmosphere that the United States and British Governments are encouraging. They have presented the meeting as an occasion for the seven major industrial powers to congratulate themselves on the success of their economic policies and to declare that major new initiatives are unnecessary. The Latin plea, in the form of a letter to the British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, who is chairman of the three-day meeting, is signed by the Presidents of Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela. Collectively these countries owe Western and Japanese banks and governments about $350 billion. Debtors' Declaration The letter follows a declaration made on May 19 by the Presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico protesting the financial burden caused by the recent rise in interest rates in the United States and calling for a special meeting of Latin American debtors. Some who follow these developments fear that such a meeting could lead to the formation of a ''debtors' cartel'' that would confront industrial governments if interest rates do not fall. In today's letter, the seven Latin American Presidents call in diplomatic language for the meeting to initiate a ''constructive dialogue between debtor and creditor countries,'' officials said. They also say that the seven summit countries - the United States, Britain, Japan, West Germany, France, Italy and Canada - should play a bigger role in solving the developing world's debt problems, instead of leaving the task to private bankers and the International Monetary Fund. Meanwhile, several heavily indebted Latin countries appear to be working toward compromise agreements with their creditors. Argentina plans to sign a letter of intent with the I.M.F. by Sunday on an austerity program to help the economy at home, Adolfo Canitrot, the Under Secretary of Planning, said in Buenos Aires. The agreement will help Argentina get fresh financing for its $47 billion debt. Also, the major international banks said this week that they would begin talks with Mexico soon in an attempt to defuse the crisis atmosphere surrounding Latin debt. Similar talks are expected with Brazil. Both nations are likely to get substantially lower interest rates. The Latin plea could further dull the highly optimistic gloss that some participants are putting on the meeting here, an optimism clearly not shared by the German and French Governments French and German Criticism In Bonn, Chancellor Helmut Kohl attacked United States economic policy on the eve of his departure for the meeting, telling the German Parliament that America must make strenuous efforts to cut its budget deficit and help bring down world interest rates. And on Tuesday night Karl Otto P"ohl, president of the German central bank, criticized the United States budget deficit, contending that it is causing high interest rates that ''could lead to a recession in the U.S. which would have a ripple effect on the rest of the world.'' The French Finance Minister, Jacques Delors, also attacked American economic policy on the eve of the summit gathering. In a published interview, he said the recent rise in United States interest rates ''carries us to the edge of the precipice.'' The summit meeting, he said, must reassure financial markets by taking measures to control the debt crisis. But the British and American sides do not see things that way. Mrs. Thatcher told reporters today that the summit participants are aiming for a ''softly softly'' conference that will reassure financial markets by stressing the economic progress the industrial nations have made and the improved prospects for steady growth and low inflation in the years ahead. Tuesday night, British spokesmen said that Mrs. Thatcher took back criticism she had made of the Reagan Administration's budget deficits and the high United States interest rates. During private talks and dinner at Downing Street on Tuesday, the spokesman said, Mrs. Thatcher told President Reagan that she accepted his explanation that he wants to cut the deficit but is being frustrated by Congress. President Reagan also told Mrs. Thatcher that the budget plans of his predecessor, President Jimmy Carter, would have led to an annual deficit some $90 billion greater than the present one of about $200 billion.

720-> Israel Court Drops Ban On 2 Political Parties
The Supreme Court in Jerusalem overruled the Central Elections Committee today and cleared an Arab-Jewish peace party and a rightist party to run in parliamentary elections July 23. The parties are the Progressive List for Peace and the Kach movement, led by Meir Kahane, founder of the Jewish Defense League. The court's action raises to 26 the number of slates competing for the 120 seats in Parliament. The panel of five justices all agreed there were no grounds to disqualify the parties. They did not explain their decision further. The Progressive List for Peace is made up of Jews and Palestinian Arabs in Israel in alternated slots. In disqualifying the group, the Elections Committee said that it held subversive intentions and that its key candidates identified with Israel's enemies. The party platform calls the Palestine Liberation Organization the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, but party leaders said this applied only to Palestinians living outside Israel. They rejected claims they were subversive and said they wanted a Palestinian state alongside Israel in its 1967 borders. The Kach movement was said by the committee to advocate racist and antidemocratic principles and to openly support acts of terror. The party has proposed evicting Arabs from Israel and imprisoning Arabs who have sexual relations with Jews.

721-> DUARTE OFFERS A CHRISTMAS CEASE-FIRE
President Jose Napoleon Duarte of El Salvador said today that he is prepared to suspend military operations at Christmas if guerrilla forces agree. Mr. Duarte, who met here with Secretary of State George P. Shultz, said at a news conference that he sent a letter Tuesday to Archbishop Arturo Rivera y Damas of San Salvador committing the Government to a Christmas truce if the guerrilla opposition also stops fighting. He said he had received no response from the guerrillas. Mr. Duarte, while expressing frustration over the lack of progress in peace talks in El Salvador, said that he had ''not lost hope'' that the negotiations could eventually produce a political settlement to the five-year civil war. ''I still have faith,'' Mr. Duarte said. The peace talks, which began in October in the town of La Palma in an atmosphere of high expectations, have bogged down. At a second meeting in November, the guerrillas outlined a set of conditions that Mr. Duarte had called unacceptable. Rejects Rebel Demands Mr. Duarte repeated today that his position was that the Government is legitimate, the Salvadoran Constitution is not subject to revision and the army cannot be broken up to make way for a new military establishment that would include guerrilla forces. The guerrillas, in effect, demanded a new constitution, a new army and a new government. Mr. Duarte attributed the guerrilla position to ''infighting'' among the rebels and said that their demands at the November meeting represented a ''defeat'' for political leaders in the opposition. During a visit to the United States last month, one of the political leaders, Guillermo Ungo, said in interviews and public speeches that the guerrillas might be willing to modify some of the positions that they later presented at the second meeting with the Goverment. A State Department official who has followed the negotiations closely said that both Salvadoran and American officials viewed the guerrilla position as the product of internal disagreements. ''It's the lowest common denominator that they could agree on,'' he said. Mr. Duarte said he would not meet with the guerrillas again - he did not attend the second meeting - unless they accepted the Government's basic position that they could not gain power without taking part in elections. 'Tactical Dialogue' ''I'm all for a sincere dialogue but I won't accept a tactical dialogue,'' Mr. Duarte said. He defined a tactical dialogue as one in which one side or the other tries to use negotiations to gain international favor but does not engage in serious discussions. ''Up to this point, the guerrillas have been interested only in tactical dialogue,'' he added. American officials said Mr. Duarte and Mr. Shultz discusssed the status of the peace talks, developments in the effort by four Latin nations to find a peace formula for Central America and the economic situation in El Salvador. Both men were here to address a gathering of Caribbean leaders and American businessmen attending a conference on trade, investment and development in the Caribbean basin. The conference was sponsored by an organization called Caribbean/Central American Action, an affiliate of the Americas Society, which is headed by David Rockefeller. Mr. Shultz, saying that ''the old dictators failed'' and the ''new totalitarians in Cuba and Nicaragua have done even worse,'' urged the participants in the conference to work together to achieve economic growth in the Caribbean region. Caribbean Exports Rise He said the Caribbean Basin Initiative, a program of increased economic aid and tariff relief approved by Congress last year, had contributed to several ''promising'' trends, including a 34 percent increase in nonoil exports to the United States by Caribbean nations during the first eight months of 1984. Mr. Shultz also announced that President Reagan directed Cabinet members recently to give their personal attention and support to the Caribbean Basin Initiative to insure its success. He quoted Mr. Reagan as saying, ''the Caribbean Basin Initiative remains personally important to me and important to the future of our nation.'' Mr. Reagan, according to Mr. Shultz, signed papers on Wednesday that put into effect a simplification of customs regulations covering some exports to the United States from the Caribbean area. In a speech that stressed the theme of democracy and free enterprise as the keys to economic growth. Mr. Shultz said the Caribbean nations could no longer rely on external private bank financing to support their economies. Noting that foreign lending to developing nations in Latin America grew from about $75 billion in 1974 to an estimated $336 billion in 1983, Mr. Shultz said: ''Today it is clear that external borrowing can no longer play the primary role. The Inter-American Development Bank estimates that net capital inflows of some $47 billion per year would be required to sustain five percent average annual growth under the most realistic set of circumstances.'' He added, ''There simply aren't enough funds in the financial system to support lending of this magnitude.'' In place of the foreign loans, Mr. Shultz urged the Caribbean leaders and businessmen to adopt a development strategy that ''works through an open economy, one that rewards initiative, investment and thrift.'' Mr. Shultz reported that Nicaraguan exports to the United States had dropped 47 percent this year compared with 1983.

722-> MONDALE ASSERTS NOMINATION IS HIS; HART NOT GIVING IN
Walter F. Mondale claimed victory yesterday in the race for the Democratic Presidential nomination, and a number of party leaders united behind the former Vice President to urge his main competitor, Senator Gary Hart, to fold his campaign. Mr. Mondale declared that his victories in New Jersey and West Virginia and a flurry of endorsements from uncommitted delegates had pushed him past the total of 1,967 delegates required for the nomination. Of the 210 delegates he won Tuesday, 104 were in New Jersey. However, Mr. Hart, who won the California primary Tuesday, garnering 207 delegates, refused to concede. He and his top advisers said they would continue to urge Mondale delegates to take advantage of party rules that allowed them to switch candidates if they chose. Hart to Rely on Polls Mr. Hart, brushing aside independent delegate tabulations that also showed Mr. Mondale with a nominating majority, predicted that major public opinion polls to be published later this month would show him a stronger candidate against President Reagan and would cause delegates to abandon Mr. Mondale. Mr. Hart finished the day with 239 new delegates, but he still trailed Mr. Mondale by about 700 delegates in the overall count. By his own count, Mr. Mondale had more than 2,000 delegates by midday yesterday. A tabulation by The New York Times showed him just above the required total. He benefited from a steady flow of delegates in his direction after the voting in five states Tuesday that marked the end of the 1984 primary season. In a news conference at St. Paul, Mr. Mondale declined to call directly for the withdrawal of Mr. Hart or of his other major opponent, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, but his plea for party unity was tantamount to such a request. 'The Race Is Over' ''As of 11:59 this morning, central daylight time, over 2,008 delegates had pledged their support to me,'' Mr. Mondale said. ''The race for the majority is over. The time has now come to plan a unified convention. Our Democratic Party is a family, and as families sometimes do, we squabble. But our bonds are stronger than our battles. When we meet in San Francisco, our family must stand together.'' Mr. Hart, declaring that his candidacy ''must go forward and we will,'' indicated that he would use the convention in San Francisco next month to continue his four-month battle with Mr. Mondale. Advisers said Mr. Hart's statement reflected a private inclination to keep running despite warnings from party leaders that refusal to accept Mr. Mondale's victory could harm Mr. Hart's future as a party leader and also spur resistance to helping him retire a campaign debt estimated at $4 million to $5 million. ''The one thing that can be said about this nomination contest is that it is not over,'' Mr. Hart said yesterday in Los Angeles. He added that he would attempt to ''recruit uncommitted, unpledged delegates on the grounds that to win this election this fall, the Democratic Party must put forward new leadership and a new vision for this country.'' The Coloradan carried California, South Dakota and New Mexico on Tuesday and cited Mr. Mondale's weak showing in the Western states as a disqualifying fault. But many prominent Democrats bluntly called on Mr. Hart to abandon his candidacy for the sake of party unity. They included Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., the Speaker of the House; Gillis W. Long of Louisiana, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus; Andrew Young, the Mayor of Atlanta, and Robert S. Strauss, the former party chairman. Mr. Long and Mr. Young had formally been neutral until yesterday, although Mr. Young had been thought to favor Mr. Mondale until Mr. Jackson entered the race.Mr. Young, in announcing that he would attend the convention as a Mondale delegate, called for a Mondale-Hart ticket. Mr. Strauss and Mr. O'Neill have been longtime Mondale supporters, and Mr. O'Neill was direct in his statement. 'People Hate a Spoiler' ''People love a fighter, but they hate a spoiler,'' Mr. O'Neill said yesterday at the Capitol. Mr. O'Neill said that when he meets Mr. Hart today ''that's the message that I'll give to him, straight.'' Mr. O'Neill added that he would tell Mr. Hart that former Senator Eugene J. McCarthy permanently damaged his career in 1968 by refusing to close ranks behind Hubert H. Humphrey, the Democratic nominee. ''I would hate to see that happen to Hart - he's young and he's got a great career ahead of him,'' said Mr. O'Neill, who also warned that Mr. Hart should avoid any ''attempt to raid the Mondale delegates.'' Charles T. Manatt, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said yesterday that he did not want to join a ''rush to judgment'' in urging Mr. Hart to drop out. But he issued a statement that other party officials interpreted as a plea for both Mr. Hart and Mr. Jackson to assure a placid convention. Jackson Looks to Convention Mr. Jackson, after running third in all five primaries Tuesday, suggested in Los Angeles yesterday that he still regarded the convention, which opens July 16, as a forum for his complaints about the party's delegate selection rules. ''I'm convinced that the rules committee and the credentials committee will be busy,'' Mr. Jackson said. ''Likewise, there will be much activity on the convention floor.'' Mr. Jackson has complained that the party's delegate rules have fattened Mr. Mondale's count while awarding Mr. Jackson only 9 percent of the delegates while he was garnering 21 percent of the popular vote. Mr. Hart cited the vote totals from the primaries as a ground for continuing his candidacy. He noted that he had won 12 state primaries to Mr. Mondale's 11. Mr. Jackson won in Louisiana and the District of Columbia. Mondale Outpolled Hart Mr. Mondale led in the total popular vote in the primaries, winning about 5.8 million votes to about 5.2 million for Mr. Hart. Those figures do not include California, where there was no statewide popular vote. California's delegates were elected at the Congressional district level. Mr. Hart won 32 of the 45 districts and captured 207 delegates, to 91 for Mr. Mondale and 30 for Mr. Jackson. Despite Mr. Hart's strong showing in California, Mondale strategists and most independent Democratic analysts agreed before the voting on Tuesday that the Senator also needed to carry New Jersey to halt Mr. Mondale's drive toward the nomination. The former Vice President poured his best organizers into New Jersey to secure the state and stationed his national campaign manager, Robert G. Beckel, in the state to direct them. He was also helped by a wisecrack that Mr. Hart made about the state that swiftly came to be regarded as one of those small political mistakes that sometimes play outsized roles in close campaigns. 2 Views of Hart's Options In the hours after Mr. Mondale claimed a delegate majority, opinion among party leaders as to whether Mr. Hart would continue the struggle divided into two main streams. Mr. Strauss and Representative Morris K. Udall of Arizona, who is personally close to Mr. Hart, were among those suggesting that a few days of rest might defuse the situation. Mr. Udall, who is to meet with Mr. Hart today, spoke of the need for ''giving people time to lick their wounds and think.'' ''It's important for the party to get together fairly soon, and I think it can be done,'' he said. ''It would be all the better if we could get this thing resolved before the convention.'' Mr. Strauss said Mr. Hart and Mr. Jackson should have the chance to present their grievances to the convention. ''That and continuing the fight over delegates when we have a nominee are different things,'' he added. Referring to Mr. Hart, he said: ''He may want to go on. If he does it will be a shame. He will not gain by it and the party will not gain by it.'' Udall's Example Cited As a compromise, Mr. Strauss suggested that Mr. Hart could follow the example of Mr. Udall, who folded his candidacy in 1976 but allowed his name to be put in nomination in a peaceful, symbolic gesture. However, Representative Patricia Schroeder, the co-chairman of the Hart campaign and among a group of House members to meet with him today, predicted yesterday that Mr. Hart would be in no mood to make a deal. ''I don't really know what Gary's going to decide to do,'' she said. ''But my guess is he's not going to fold up the tent and go home. If he doesn't go on, it will be like you never heard from him again. My guess is he will proceed on.'' Oliver C. Henkel, the Hart campaign chairman, followed the same line of reasoning, saying that Mr. Hart's next step may be to try to find a way to ''unlock some of those Mondale delegates.''

723-> FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; Cantor Forms A London Link
The Cantor, Fitzgerald Securities Corporation, a New York-based broker of Treasury securities, announced an agreement with Charles Fulton Ltd., a London broker of money market instruments, to begin brokering Treasury securities in London next Feb. 1. The service will be offered over the Telrate System. Most trades in the domestic Treasury market are arranged through brokers, who act as a middleman for buyers and sellers. After expanding the American-style brokering of Treasury securities to London, Cantor and Charles Fulton said they expect to extend the service to other financial centers outside the United States. Charles Fulton and Cantor also intend to act as brokers in the London gilt-edged market in 1986. Charles Fulton owns Prebon Money Brokers, a major New York-based broker of Federal funds and money market securities.

724-> NEW YORK DAY BY DAY
Books on Wheels Braving fierce competition from a noisy steam shovel next door, a group of women gathered on the sidewalk outside 9 East 69th Street yesterday and gazed proudly at a shiny blue van. On its side was lettered ''Book- Go-Round.'' It was wrapped in a white satin ribbon with a fluffy bow. For its 15th consecutive summer, the van will make the rounds of neighborhood playgrounds, dispensing stories, books and playlets to youngsters under 7. A community project of the National Council of Jewish Women, the van has a permanent staff of four, plus five volunteers. ''There's nothing haphazard about this program,'' siad Libby Rosen, who coordinates it. ''We pick sites where a large number of day-care centers with small children gather.'' Nine children from the Council day- care center of the council came out to inspected the van, gathering around Carolyn Green, who was wearing a purple turban and an African-inspired dress. She is a professional storyteller. ''I try to get children interested in seeing the beauty of books,'' she said. ''To show them how books can take them to different surroundings and inspire their imagination.'' Operating daily from 9:30 A.M. to 12:30 P.M. from next Monday through Aug. 17, the van travels to Sakura Park, Riverisde Drive at 122d Street; Stephen Wise Towers Plaza, 91st Street between Columbus and Amsterdam Avenues; the Union Leggett Child-Care Center, 237 East 104th Street; Frederick Douglass Houses, 103d Street and Columbus Avenue, and the Metro-North Riverview Courtyard, First Avenue and 101st Street.

725-> IN THE NATION; A LIBERAL TAX PLAN
The snowstorm outside my window is blowing no more gustily than the storm of criticism that greeted the Treasury Department's ''modified flat tax'' proposal. But liberals and Democrats, in particular, ought to grab and run with a plan that's in fact a child of the Bradley- Gephardt reform developed by two of their own. The Treasury proposal, in its most basic elements, would shift tax burdens from lower- and middle-income persons to business and the wealthy. It would virtually eliminate income taxes for those below the poverty level. Most of the preferential provisions that have allowed huge corporations to pay little or no taxes would be thrown out or curtailed, as would the three-martini lunch deduction and other business privileges that enrage wage workers. And it would simplify a frustrating tax code to the point that more than half of all taxpayers, within a few years, would not even have to fill out a return form. It may seem strange that a proposal like that could emerge from a conservative Republican Administration. It will be far stranger still if the Democrats - longtime champions of the poor and disadvantaged against the wealthy and the privileged - should allow the Republicans to sponsor and take credit for a tax reform that could do for them politically what the New Deal did for the successors of Franklin Roosevelt. The predictable criticism is of two broad varieties, both shortsighted. One is from those who argue that this ''revenue-neutral'' proposal should be put aside until Congress enacts spending cuts and tax increases to cope with the impending $200 billion budget deficits. The other is from those who would suffer, or think they would, from the elimination of particular deductions and preferences in the present tax code. Among the latter are New York State and city officials - and the editors of The New York Times - who fear that eliminating deductions for state and local taxes would increase the tax burden on many New Yorkers, drive businesses and individuals out of the state, and restrict its ability to provide for the poor, the elderly and the homeless. This complaint has merit for New York and some other states; but it ignores or underestimates the added tax revenues these states would receive, encouraging state tax reduction, the possibility of adjustments that might, say, limit rather than end the deductibility of state and local taxes, and the general economic growth that the tax reform should stimulate. Nor should the elimination of most taxes on the poor be overlooked. These critics themselves point, moreover, to the proper remedy for their concern - not that the present system should be continued, but that the Federal Government should assume all or more of the welfare and Medicaid costs that now drive up state and local taxes in New York, California and other states that make generous provision for these responsibilities. Business critics, too, may be seeing the trees rather than the forest. Not only will the top corporate tax rate be reduced and half of dividends paid to shareholders be deductible; but economic efficiency and growth should be enhanced by a simpler, fairer tax system, shorn of loopholes, shelters, preferences and differentials, that need no longer play a significant role in business decisions. Over time, that alone might more than compensate for the loss of current deductions and advantages. In the shorter run, the political consequences are likely to be powerful - and powerfully favorable to those who can claim credit for a reform that reduces taxes for 24 percent of families earning less than $10,000, 53 percent of those earning $10,000 to $15,000, 60 percent in the $15,000 to $20,000 bracket, and 64 percent of the $20,000 to $30,000 and $30,000 to $50,000 categories - while setting the top tax rate at 35 percent for everyone. Are the Democrats looking for the road back into the affections of the middle class? There it is, and they'd better not let the Republicans take it first. Simplification alone - given typical American frustration in the days leading to April 15 - should please everyone but H & R Block. Under the proposed system and owing to computer techniques, about 53 percent of all taxpayers soon would not even have to fill out a return. They'd just get either a refund check or a tax bill in the mail, no doubt with a printed message that claimed political credit. But is it true that reducing the deficit must come first? More about that in another article.

726-> LAW FOR RELIGIOUS MEETINGS IN SCHOOLS STALLED BY O'NEILL
After a rare clash with a senior Democrat, the Speaker of the House, Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., today sidetracked a measure that would enable students to hold religious meetings in public high schools before or after regular school hours. Mr. O'Neill ruled that the measure was was not germane to an education bill to which it had been attached as an amendment. He referred the entire bill to both the Judiciary Committee and the Education and Labor Committee for at least several weeks. The action represented a procedural victory for opponents of the measure and was expected to touch off an intensive lobbying effort by both the Reagan Administration and Republican leaders in the Senate, where the measure has been approved. The measure, which is strongly supported by President Reagan and in both chambers of Congress, was intended to overcome Federal court decisions barring religious meetings in public schools as a violation of the constitutional principle of separation of church and state. Fears About the Bill Supporters of the measure argue that it would enable public high school students to exercise their right of freedom of religion under the First Amendment. The measure's backers said this right had been denied under court rulings that prohibited student religious groups from meeting in public schools. The measure's opponents contend that it represents an effort to remove the constitutional barriers between church and state and that it would impose new and unfair pressures on teen- agers. They also expressed the fear that the bill would make the public high schools centers for cult groups and suggest Government approval of their meetings in the public high schools. Speaker O'Neill strenuously opposes the measure as ''open to abuse.'' ''This is a dangerous route to go,'' Mr. O'Neill told reporters before House consideration of the bill. He said that he foresaw a situation in which there would be ''masses in the public school lunchrooms.'' Speedy approval of the measure was expected after the Senate voted the proposal Wednesday by 88 to 11 because the House last month voted 270 to 151 in favor of similar legislation. The bill would have then gone to a House- Senate conference. The 270 votes for the measure were 11 short of the two-thirds needed for passage under a rule that limited debate, and the measure was expected to come up again under normal procedures that require merely a majority vote. A 'Routine' Request The Senate, however, attached the measure to a bill to provide nearly $1 billion to improve instruction in mathematics, science and foreign languages. That legislation had been previously approved by the House. Representative Carl D. Perkins, the Kentucky Democrat who is chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, walked to the well of the House this morning and made what he considered a routine request for unanimous consent to allow the House to go to conference with the Senate on the math-science bill. Speaker O'Neill then ruled that the Senate amendment on student religious meetings was not germane and referred the bill to the two House committees, at least until Aug. 6. At that time, the Judiciary Committee is expected to seek an extension in its effort to block the measure. Mr. Perkins, redfaced with anger, told the Speaker, ''I've been around too long to let this happen.'' He then stalked back to his seat in the chamber. Charlotte C. Reiley, an aide to Mr. Perkins, said later, ''The Speaker did him in.'' Referral Was Demanded The House majority leader, Jim Wright of Texas, said the Speaker had acted at the behest of members of the Judiciary Committee who opposed the bill. ''They came to the Speaker and demanded sequential referral,'' Mr. Wright said. ''The amendment is nong ermane to the math-science bill, and is in the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee.'' In the Judiciary Committee, the bill will be under the jurisdiction of Representative Don Edwards. The California Democrat, chairman of the Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights, is the leading House opponent of the religion amendment. ''We're going to give it very thorough and careful study,'' Mr. Edwards said. ''I understand the Senate bill is an improvement over the one we had the other day.'' ''The minute you get into religious services in the public schools, you violate the Constitution,'' he added. Under the House rules, Mr. Perkins could nevertheless bring the bill to the House floor under an expedited procedure, but opponents vowed that if he did, they would filibuster.

727-> Gold Futures Linkup
The New York Commodity Exchange and the Sydney Futures Exchange are still ''some way off'' from agreeing on a 24-hour linkup for trading gold futures, Comex's president, Alan Brody, said today. Mr. Brody, in Australia for negotiations with the Sydney exchange, said that ''too many variables'' were involved to predict a start-up date for the link that would allow traders to offset gold futures positions interchangeably on either exhange.

728-> A SERIOUS TOUCH OF THE SENIOR JITTERS PRECEDES A PROM NIGHT TO REMEMBER
For some reason, prom night always seems to have such a jittery start. ''There are just such high hopes for everything,'' said Gail Boorstein, the prom committee secretary. But if high hopes get too high, they can bring their own misery, and in the early going of last week's Great Neck South High School senior prom, many seniors looked stiff and cranky. ''We were supposed to have a pink- champagne-colored limo,'' Peter Farman said. ''This one's just blue. It makes you mad.'' Adam Chasnow's limousine didn't come with a television, as promised, so he was steamed, too. Still worse, at about 10 P.M., Jane Bai - who worked harder on the prom, teachers said, than any other senior - ran into the girls' room crying, because one couple complained about not sitting with their friends. Gail forgot her tape of ''A Night to Remember,'' the official prom theme song, and the band didn't know how to play it. By then, even Gail, who had been on the prom committee for three years, felt her high hopes sagging. ''This is a big thing and I like having a say about the big things in school,'' she said. ''But now I feel a little bit like it wasn't as big as I thought.'' Yet at the age of 18, a feeling like that can pass in a dazzle. And a little later, standing on the penthouse deck at Terrace on the Park in Queens, looking out over the soft, hazy lights of New York City, Gail summed up the feelings of many of the girls when she said: ''It's beautiful, it's really beautiful. The only thing that upsets me now, three girls have my same dress.'' By then, seniors had stopped trying to act like grown-ups. Boys had stopped trying to be as mature as their rented clothes. Everyone had got down to their real selves, and they were having a ball. Words of Consolation Jane stopped crying and came out of the girls' room after several people told her what a great prom it was, that you can't please every idiot and how beautiful she looked in pink. Boys told girls that the baby's breath in their hair looked like bird nests. Since squab was the main course, there were plenty of pigeon jokes. A few people walked to a far corner of the penthouse deck at the huge, modern catering establishment and made out, as if it was a normal Saturday night. Several said it was the best night of their entire lives. For Kirk Brett - who went to his girlfriend Robyn Peck's Bayside High School prom and then the Great Neck South prom on back-to-back nights at a cost of $700 - they were the two best nights of his life. What older people used to spend a few dollars on and call a prom - going to the gym or a rented hall and eating and dancing - has been squeezed down to about three hours. What seniors at Great Neck South call prom night has been stretched into a string of events starting with several pre-prom cocktail parties, followed by a fancy catered dinner- dance at Terrace on the Park, a trip to a New York City disco, a sunrise, a breakfast party - capped finally by falling asleep under a blanket on Jones Beach. To accomplish all this it is usually necessary to skip two days of school. Somewhere between $350 and $1,300 is spent per couple. Two-thirds of this year's 213 seniors attended and most rented a limousine or a Rolls-Royce and stocked it with liquor. One chauffeur, Johanna Cary, made an early stop for two of her female passengers so they could raid their mothers' liquor cabinets. But what always strikes John Blewitt, a veteran limousine driver on the prom circuit, is how well-behaved everyone is. 'A Lot of Dancing' ''They're good kids,'' he said. ''They want to go into the Big Apple and do a lot of dancing. I've never had a kid pass out. I've never had any serious problems as far as fights or getting rowdy drunk. I've seen adults act lots worse.'' Prom is a night when girls try to look like art and boys try to look half- decent. The afternoon of the prom, Gail went to Jacquie's Place for her nails, and then to 3d Dimension Hair Creations to get her hair laced with baby's breath. Two days before the prom, she had gone to Bermaine's for her final pre-prom makeup consultation. ''I didn't want it to come down to the last minute,'' she said. Prom is a night for old chums. Tom Feaster, Mike Toback and George Katramados, best friends since seventh grade, shared a limousine. In May, they had gone to Tuxedo Junction together and rented white tails. Then they all changed their minds and switched to regular dinner jackets. ''Tails are gross,'' Tom said. ''We looked like Good Humor men.'' On prom night, they all took their dates for drinks at the Plaza and rode carriages together in Central Park. Prom is a night for true love. ''We've been going out for a year and four months as of yesterday,'' Lisa Maiorelli said. In September, she and Harry Adamo knew they would be going to the prom together. Buying the Dress Harry shopped with Lisa's family for her prom dress. Lisa's father picked it out. ''My father, he was very into this prom,'' Lisa said. ''I'm his oldest daughter. I think it was the first time he experienced anything like this.'' Harry thought the prom was much better than he had expected, and Lisa called it ''a close night.'' It was an occasion for daring splurges. Maryann Avellino was shopping around for a dress in May and saw something smashing in pink for $250. She put down $50, and two days before the prom, when her check for waitressing at the Sizzler Steak House came, she made the last installment. ''I didn't even think of asking my father,'' she said. ''My mother said, 'When your father finds out the cost, he'll kill you.' '' At 11:10 P.M., after five hours in her dress, Maryann and her best friend, Karen Reilly, left the prom to change into their disco clothes. While they waited for the elevator, Maryann whispered, ''Look, there's my dress again, in white.'' At midnight, the limousines began arriving at the disco, the Cat Club in Greenwich Village. Like No Tomorrow A man at the door in black T-shirt and chains welcomed the more than 200 revelers, almost everyone who attended the prom. The disco is where prom night really gets smoking. Though the seniors were under age, there was no problem buying liquor. People danced like there was no tomorrow. Mike Toback danced with his date, Felice Rothenberg, and when she wore out, he danced with Jackie Micari and then Chris Febles. Maryann and Karen, in their disco clothes, danced to their table, they danced to the bar, they danced to the bathroom and they danced back again. At 1:40 A.M., the club's punk-rock dancers dressed in graduation robes and performed two classics for the seniors, ''Another Brick in the Wall, Part II'' by Pink Floyd, (''We don't need no education . . . . ''); and Alice Cooper's ''School's Out'' (''School's out forever, school's been blown to pieces . . . .''). After that, the seniors jumped on stage themselves and danced harder. At 2 A.M. Ed Neumann wondered if his date, Jenny Seskin, would ever get out of the bathroom, but once she did, there was no controlling her feet, and they danced right to the last song at 4:30 - ''New York, New York'' of all things. After the disco closed, Adam Harrison and Elisa Carlson had their driver take them to Jones Beach for the sunrise, but they ''kind of fell asleep by mistake'' in the limousine, Adam said, and missed it. Kirk Brett got home at 5:15 and planned to lie down for half an hour before the post-prom breakfast at Vicki Barnett's home. But like Adam, he fell asleep by mistake, and no one heard from him again. By 7 A.M., about 75 seniors were stretched out on the Barnett's living room and dining room floors, eating bagels and quietly comparing notes. Adam Chasnow explained how he was getting $30 knocked off his limousine rental because there was no television. Ed Neumann fell asleep beside 180 bagels. Vicki Barnett, who had gone to the prom last year as a junior, said it was more fun as a senior. ''Last year I had to cling to my date,'' she said. ''The senior girls weren't my friends. They looked at you like an outsider. You were at their prom.'' This was her prom, she said. Several commented that the prom had broken down the usual cliques. ''I think it should be called, 'A final evening of friendship,' '' Elena Deutsch said. ''I kissed everyone.'' After waking up beside the bagels, Ed Neumann drove to Jones Beach, where he tried to sleep under a blanket. But the radios were too loud and the sun too hot for sleeping.

729-> ARMS TALK SHIFT?
By opening up the possibility of a summit meeting in his remarks tonight, President Reagan may well have succeeded in transforming the domestic political debate about his arms control policies into a debate on summitry, where he has now seized the high ground. For a time at least, the debate is now bound to center on whether he or the Soviet leaders are more willing to talk peace, rather than centering on the substantive positions of the two sides. The Soviets, who continued even today to set conditions for a summit, will be on the defensive, as will the President's critics. Domestic and foreign critics are likely to continue questioning the seriousness of the President's arms control proposals. But these thrusts are bound to lose their sting now that the White House can respond that Mr. Reagan has set aside his tough anti-Soviet rhetoric and his conditions for a summit and is willing to meet and talk ''any time,'' as he said this evening. Charges and Countercharges Mr. Reagan's surprise shift on a summit meeting came against the backdrop of almost daily charges and countercharges between Washington and Moscow over which side is to blame for the current deadlock on arms control negotiations. Under pressure from leaders in his own party and leaders of allied nations to demonstrate a serious effort to end the stalemate, he declined tonight to repeat his standing position that such a meeting ''would have to be carefully prepared'' and have the ''prospect of meaningful results.'' This new move also comes as the diplomatic traps that the Soviet Union and the Reagan Administration have been setting for each other on arms control have been sprung and as each side begins to feel criticism. As a range of diplomats and officials here see it, Moscow has been hurting more than President Reagan. On antisatellite weapons, it is Moscow that is pressing for negotiations to ban these weapons while the Administration has been willing only to study the matter and hold informal talks. On nuclear arms control, it is Washington that wants to negotiate and the Soviet Union that is cast as the reluctant party. Konstantin U. Chernenko, the Soviet leader, probably reinforced this image by charging on Wednesday that the call by leaders of the industrial democracies for new talks was not ''backed up by anything tangible.'' Demand Couldn't Be Accepted In part, the Russians were responsible for their own discomfort because they made a demand they knew Mr. Reagan had to refuse. They insisted that before they would return to the Geneva talks on intercontinental-range and medium-range nuclear forces, the Administration had to withdraw the medium-range missiles recently installed in Europe to counter the increase in Soviet weapons. Predictably, Mr. Reagan refused to remove the missiles and countered with a proposal to reopen talks without preconditions and with promises of flexibility. If the Russians now return to the Geneva talks, they would give Mr. Reagan a real political lift and appear to vindicate his hard-line policies. If they continue to boycott the talks, they would look like the spoilers and run the risk of losing the battle for European and American public opinion. With no easy way out, Moscow has been laying some traps of its own. This week, Mr. Chernenko called again for negotiations to ban antisatellite weapons, knowing that the Administration has asserted that any such agreement would be unverifiable and calculating that the offer would thus be rejected. The Soviet leader appeared to break new ground on the verification issue by saying that if existing intelligence systems such as spy satellites were not able to to monitor a ban, ''other forms could be found as well.'' He also called attention to the fact that ''many prominent American experts'' believe a ban can be verified. Since August 1983 Moscow has suspended testing its antisatellite missile system on condition that Washington did not start testing its newer system. Experts here regard the Soviet system as rudimentary and unreliable and the American system as superior. Administration officials acknowledged that they are on the defensive on the antisatellite system. A senior State Department official said today that Mr. Reagan might surprise Moscow soon and agree to formal negotiations. The talks might be limited to negotiations on banning the testing of certain systems rather than the comprehensive ban proposed by Moscow. Earlier this year, Moscow attempted another trap or diversion at the conference in Stockholm on European security. Soviet diplomats put out the word that Western agreement to a pledge against the use of force would open other locked negotiating doors. Reagan Responds to Soviet Idea In Ireland two weeks ago, Mr. Reagan responded with the idea of discussing the nonuse of force if Moscow would discuss confidence-building measures proposed by the West. The Russians rejected this, calling it a propaganda ploy. Privately and without providing any details, some senior Administration officials continue to contend that Mr. Reagan has approved new concessions to the Soviets for the talks on strategic nuclear missiles and bombers. Moscow left these talks, as well as those on medium-range nuclear forces in Europe, last fall when the first American Pershing 2 and cruise missiles were installed in Europe. One of these officials said that in a meeting in Stockholm in January with the Soviet Foreign Minister, Andrei A. Gromyko, Secretary of State George P. Shultz tried to provide some details. But, the official said, Mr. Gromyko would not even discuss the subject. Soviet Leaders Seen as Weak The prevalent theory in the upper reaches of the Administration, as distinguished from many experts in the bureaucracy, is that the present Soviet leadership is too weak to reverse course and agree to negotiate. Mr. Reagan is quoted as saying the Soviet leaders are in ''hibernation.'' This view is said to lie behind Mr. Reagan's reported remark to Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau of Canada last week at the economic summit conference in London. ''Damn it, what do you want me to do?'' he was quoted as saying. A White House official maintained today that the Soviet leaders are not unalterably opposed to dealing with Mr. Reagan, but are ''going through a crisis where they're just concerned about keeping their own power.'' The official said the Russians understand that Mr. Reagan is likely to be re-elected and that at some point they must come back to the bargaining tables. A senior State Department official said, ''We will see some changes before our elections because the Soviets are coming to recognize that their current position is untenable.'' He added that the Russians are the ones who appear intransigent. Leadership Crisis Doubted Dimitri Simes of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, reflecting the view of a number of Government experts, stated that he has ''yet to hear information to substantiate a leadership crisis'' in Moscow. ''The leadership understands things went sour and are in a holding pattern,'' Mr. Simes said. As for Soviet officials, they are not prepared to put aside two and a half years of anti-Soviet rhetoric by Mr. Reagan. They see that his rhetoric has softened in recent months, but regard it simply as an election ploy. By all accounts, the lines of communication are open, but nothing of substance is being transmitted. While Mr. Reagan indicated a willingness tonight to open up new lines of communications for a summit conference, a Kremlin spokesman today seemed to reiterate a Soviet position that sounded much like the old Reagan position. ''There are a lot of demands which would have to be considered before they can be presented at a summit meeting,'' the spokesman said.

730-> RAINS AND MUDSLIDES HIT ETHIOPIA FAMINE CAMPS
Violent rains and mudslides have caused increased hardship and damage in Alamata and Korem, the sites of a major concentration of refugees from Ethiopia's famine, aid officials say. ''For six hours Monday evening it just poured and poured, a solid wall of rain,'' said Robert Latta, an official of the international relief organization World Vision, who returned Wednesday morning from Alamata. ''Then it just rained on and off all night.'' Mr. Latta said a thick mud flow down a hillside next to the health and feeding center operated by the Missionaries of Charity, the order founded by Mother Teresa, had damaged their chapel and wiped out their kitchen. ''It was pretty bad,'' he said. ''There was nothing that could be reconstituted. And the sisters' own food supply was wiped out.'' Number of Refugees Growing Mr. Latta said that World Vision workers, who share a compound with the Missionaries of Charity, had provided supplies from their own stocks. The two groups now distribute food to more than 15,000 people at Alamata, and Mr. Latta said the number was increasing rapidly. There is no camp for displaced people in Alamata, however, and many refugees sleep without shelter and little clothing in the hills where the mudslides began. It was not known if there had been any deaths or injuries from the slides. But four small children died Monday night in the Missionaries of Charity clinic, of illnesses compounded by the cold, wet weather, according to an American Congressman, Frank R. Wolf, Republican of Virginia. Mr. Wolf, who arrived in Alamata on Monday, was prevented from returning by plane to Addis Ababa as scheduled Tuesday because of the rain. Before leaving Ethiopia on Wednesday morning he said that the storms had caused ''a devastating loss.'' Little Shelter at Korem Conditions were also reported to be difficult at Korem, the camp holding more than 40,000 refugees in the high mountains near Alamata. Because of the altitude, nighttime temperatures there drop close to freezing, and thousands of people in the camp have little or no shelter. ''There were problems even for those staying in tents,'' said Brigitte Vassey of the French organization Doctors Without Borders. ''The rain got into some of the tents and filled them with water.'' Under such conditions, she said, the death rate is likely to rise. Mr. Latta said much of the town of Alamata was now covered with 8 to 10 inches of a muck composed of mud and fecal matter from the hillside where the refugees had been staying. Water also seeped into the tank at Alamata's only gas station, causing a gasoline shortage in the area, he said. 8 Million Reported in Need Close to eight million Ethiopians are said to be in need of assistance because of widespread famine following several years of drought and environmental deterioration. Ethiopia normally has two rainy seasons: the so-called short rains, which fall during a two-month period sometime between January and June, and the long rains, which fall over a three- month period between July and December. Because thousands of farmers have abandoned their farms and there is little seed in the ground, the current rains are not expected to result in any significant increase in the country's food production this year. In addition, sudden, heavy rains tend to wash away valuable topsoil from the famine-afflicted areas, where there is no longer much forest cover or other protective vegetation.

731-> SPACE WEAPONS PROJECT FACES FIGHT IN CONGRESS
President Reagan's campaign to develop a space- based defense against ballistic missiles faces serious trouble next year as Congress tries to cut the military budget, according to the chairman of the House subcommittee that handles military appropriations. The subcommittee chairman, Representative Joseph P. Addabbo of Queens, predicted in an interview Wednesday that Congress would freeze and possibly cut funds for continued development of new weapons in space, one of the Reagan Administration's top military priorities. The space project, dubbed ''Star Wars,'' has already aroused opposition because of questions about whether technology exists to accomplish its purpose of destroying high-speed enemy missiles in space. But it will face even greater resistance this year, Mr. Addabbo said, because escalating cost estimates will make it one of the largest single items in the military budget. The Administration has not disclosed its budget request for the next fiscal year. However, Lieut. Gen. James A. Abramson Jr., director of the Strategic Defense Initiative, told Mr. Addabbo's subcommittee last May that the Pentagon planned to request $3.8 billion for the space project in its budget for the fiscal year 1986. Extra Funds May Be Sought The Administration may also seek extra money to make up for cuts by Congress this year, the first year of the space initiative. Congress cut the request from $1.8 billion to $1.4 billion General Abramson estimated the Strategic Defense Initiative would cost $25.5 billion over five years. That money is for developing, but not producing, satellite tracking systems and a variety of weapons to detect and intercept Soviet missiles. Mr. Addabbo noted that Soviet officials had shown an interest in discussing limits on weapons in space and that the President had not precluded limiting space weapons under an ''umbrella'' arms agreement. ''Rather than start signing multibillion-dollar contracts, which cost you almost as much to cancel, you should freeze it until you see where the arms talks go,'' the Congressman said. Critic of Pentagon Spending Mr. Addabbo, a 12-term Democrat who heads the Defense Subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee and is a longtime critic of Pentagon spending, applauded Mr. Reagan for scrutinizing the Pentagon budget in his search for spending cuts, but said the cuts proposed by the Office of Management and Budget were ''just a sop.'' The budget office has proposed cuts of $8 billion in military spending for the next fiscal year. Because much of the Pentagon budget goes into contracts spread over several years, it would take a larger cut in the budget to achieve such a saving immediately. Mr. Addabbo said he did not have a specific figure in mind, but added that freezing the budget at its current level, with an adjustment for inflation, would be ''more than sufficient.'' The Queens Congressman, echoing the forecast of other Congressional leaders in both parties, predicted increased trouble for the MX missile. A Vital Bargaining Chip The next test of support for the missile is likely to come in March or April, when Congress is to vote on a bill that would allow the production of 21 MX missiles, using $1.5 billion already appropriated this year. The Administration has been expected to request funds for 48 more MX missiles next year. The President maintains that the MX program is a vital bargaining chip in arms control negotiations scheduled to resume next year with the Soviet Union. Robert Sims, a White House spokesman, said Wednesday that Mr. Reagan vowed to fight for the MX program when he met with Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona, the prospective chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Mr. Goldwater advised the President in a letter Dec. 3 that ''we do not have the votes'' in Congress to pass the MX next spring. Mr. Addabbo said Congress should, but almost certainly would not, make selective savings in military pay and pensions to cut the Pentagon budget. Pay and retirement benefits account for $98.9 billion of the $284.5 billion Defense Department budget this year. Unlike weapons systems, any cut in pay brings an immediate saving. Curbs in Military Pensions Mr. Addabbo said he would favor adjusting pay categories to give raises where the armed forces compete with private industry for special skills, and to trim pay for specialties that are not in great demand. He said he would also rein in the military pension system, which was designed as an inducement for members of the armed forces to enlist and remain in the service. Mr. Addabbo said improved pay, bonuses and other perquisites provided adequate incentives now. While he endorsed pension cuts only for future recruits, he said he could not imagine Congress agreeing to it. ''I know the Congress, and every time you talk about touching the pension system, it's like you want to destroy the entire military,'' he said, adding, ''Saying this will probably get me 1,001 hate letters.''

732-> ; POOR U.S. INVESTMENT IN 'PROMOTING DEMOCRACY'
To the Editor: In a June 18 Op-Ed article, ''Endowing Democracy,'' Joshua Muravchik takes the House of Representatives to task for refusing to give $31.3 million to a group with the high- sounding name, National Endowment for Democracy. N.E.D. gives millions of dollars in public funds to big business, big labor and the two political parties to travel abroad and ''promote democracy.'' The idea of promoting democracy sounds so good to Mr. Muravchik that he doesn't bother to ask whether N.E.D. is likely to be effective - or more likely to be a boondoggle for its beneficiaries and an embarrassment to U.S. foreign policy. He blames the defeat of N.E.D. by a bipartisan majority on ''a mischievous coalition of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans.'' The assumption, I suppose, is that anything those two groups agree on must be wrong. The conservatives, according to Mr. Muravchik, ''are motivated by their aversion to spending Federal dollars'' - an attitude he seems to regard as overly protective of the American taxpayer. The liberals, he says, are motivated by an ''aversion to American interference in the affairs of other nations'' - an attitude he seems to find equally distasteful. It is true that conservatives - and prudent liberals - believe that, in a time of severe budget constraints, Congress should be funding programs that are effective instead of those that are not. While N.E.D. will certainly promote travel, it is questionable how much democracy it will promote. This week, for example, leaders of one N.E.D.-funded group are promoting democracy in Stockholm, Brussels, Geneva and Paris. In April, they promoted democracy in Jamaica. Perhaps they learned on these trips that all these countries already have democratic governments. To give millions of dollars to private groups - and, worse, to the two political parties - invites waste and abuse. Since N.E.D. is a privately owned foundation that channels funds to other private groups, it is not subject to the same oversight, auditing and ''open records'' provisions that apply to government agencies. Since the U.S. Information Agency and the Agency for International Development already have cultural exchange programs and information efforts abroad, it is hard to justify the duplication that N.E.D. involves. It is also true that liberals - and prudent conservatives - believe that it is a contradiction to try to promote free elections by interfering in them. But this is exactly what N.E.D. has done. According to a May 28 news story, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. recently funneled N.E.D. money to the supporters of Nicolas Ardito Barletta, the military- supported candidate in Panama's fraud-ridden presidential election. Learning of this potentially embarrassing interference in Panama's internal affairs, the U.S. Ambassador fired off a wire to the State Department demanding an end to ''this hare- brained project before it hits the fan.'' Perhaps this is Mr. Muravchik's idea of promoting democracy, but imagine how Americans would feel about a foreign power secretly funding one side in our elections. The head of the labor group that provided the conduit for N.E.D. funds has defended meddling in Panama's elections as ''one private group relating to another private group'' - at the taxpayers' expense. This reply points up the fatal flaw at the heart of N.E.D: It entrusts public funds to private groups to travel abroad, to run their own foreign policies, to meddle in other countries' politics - without coordination, without proper oversight, accounting and openness - and the U.S. Government gets blamed for the mistakes. I hope the Senate will join the bipartisan majority in the House in putting an end to this $31-million international slush fund. HANK BROWN Member of Congress, 4th Dist., Colo. Washington, June 21, 1984

733-> ANIMAL RIGHTS: A GROWING MOVEMENT IN U.S.
Out of the darkness, five figures moved quietly down a University of Pennsylvania walk, entered a building, descended to a subbasement and broke into a laboratory. What the band of intruders found on Memorial Day was an audiovisual record on 32 magnetic tapes of several years of brain-damaging experiments on monkeys and baboons. The discovery has stirred protests here, embroiled university officials in long hours of explanations in defense of their research and focused attention on new currents rippling through a resurgent, centuries-old movement to defend animals against mistreatment. Since the 18th century, organized efforts have been under way to make more people sensitive to animals' sufferings. Groups such as the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the National Anti-Vivisection Society have grown with differing emphases, ranging from concerns over the treatment of pets to protests over scientific experiments with any animal. But now, rapidly growing segments within the movement have adopted a new philosophy that began to spread in the late 1970's: that animals have inherent rights to a full life in a natural society and that it is immoral to exploit them, whatever benefits might accrue to humans. ''In the last five years we have seen a real change,'' said Douglas Moss, publisher of Agenda, a magazine published in Westport, Conn., that describes itself as ''the news magazine of the animal rights movement.'' ''And in the last couple of years,'' he continued, ''more and more people have focused on that term, 'animal rights,' rather than 'animal welfare.' They've gone beyond, 'Gee, let's be nice to animals,' to address the whole relationship between people and animals.'' ''It's a movement that is growing rapidly,'' said George Trapp, the managing director of the National Anti-Vivisection Society. ''The time is ripe. It's a logical outgrowth of the push for rights for all classes of the human animal.'' Older groups devoted to animal welfare have tended to work for legislative goals. But as the new organizations have grown more vocal, many have grown more militant. Such groups as the Animal Liberation Front, which carried out the Penn break-in, the Band of Mercy and the Urban Gorillas have taken the law into their own hands. Other groups, such as the rapidly growing People for Ethical Treatment of Animals, take public positions supporting the militants' goals, although they also seek legislative gains. Professional groups supporting animals' rights have also sprung up, ranging from Attorneys for Animal Rights to Psychologists for Ethical Treatment of Animals. No one has determined how large the movement is, according to Mr. Moss, and even members of the Animal Liberation Front, which operates internationally but in secrecy, generally do not know other members beyond their immediate vicinity. ''In the last five years we have seen a real change,'' Mr. Moss said, reflected in smaller, localized groups that, in addition to national organizations, are springing up across the country. Debate Over Ethics The clash of ideas was defined the other day by Barry Cooperman, Penn's vice provost for research. ''The first question,'' he said, ''is whether it is ethical to experiment on animals for the benefit of humans. As scientists, we say that it is. Our opponents say it is not. With them, there is simply no middle ground. ''The second question is, do you take every precaution to minimize suffering, and how far do you go down that road? That is where guidelines are needed.'' A scientist working on strengthening such guidelines is Dr. Charles McCarthy, director of the Office for Protection From Research Risks at the National Institutes of Health. His office has proposed revised guidelines seeking greater assurance of humane treatment of animal subjects of research supported by Federal grants, but he expressed concern the other day over the increasing incidence of extralegal actions against such projects. ''I don't know if you could call it a crime wave,'' he said, ''but the increasing numbers do worry me. I have been in this office for six years, and reports on break-ins in the first five years were zero. In the last year there were 10.'' Comparison to Abolitionists ''We may seem like radicals to you,'' said one of the participants in the Penn break-in the other day, a woman who identified herself only as Lauren. ''But we are like the Abolitionists, who were regarded as radicals, too. And we hope that 100 years from now people will look back on the way animals are treated now with the same horror as we do when we look back on the slave trade.'' She pointed to disclosures on the videotapes that her band seized as justification for the break-in. One sequence showed a monkey strapped to a table and pulling against its bonds. The animal's head was encased in a steel cylinder attached to a pneumatic machine called an accelerator. Suddenly, a piston drove the cylinder upward, thrusting the animal's head sharply through an arc of about 60 degrees. In another sequence, as an animal lay in a coma, a researcher's recorded voice was heard saying: ''You'd better have some axonal damage there, monkey,'' and calling him ''sucker.'' Axons link brain cells to one another and link the cells to other parts of the nervous system. Letters Criticize Penn Excerpts from one of the tapes, shown on the news program of KYW, a local television station, and other reports generated dozens of calls and letters to the station, to local newspapers and to the university, most of them critical of the experiments. Lauren and other militants contend that the animals' movements in the first instance show a failure to use anesthetics and that the researcher's remark in the second instance indicates callousness toward animals. They also contend that any discoveries possible from such operations can be obtained by other means, such as autopsies on accident victims. In any event, they say, experimenters have no right to sacrifice animals for the possible benefit of people. About 80 primates have been used in head-injury experiments at the university, according to one researcher, who said computer simulations had helped to limit the numbers sacrificed for the work. Researcher Defends Tests Dr. Thomas Langfitt, chairman of the University of Pennsylvania Hospital's department of neurosurgery and principal investigator of head injury programs, defended the research project. He said discovery of what happened to the brain at the moment of injury was a vital step toward finding better treatment for head injuries, which are a major cause of death in the United States. Primates, he said, are the only useful subjects. As a result of the experiments, Dr. Langfitt said, he believes his researchers are on the threshold of major improvements in treatment. Alhough the animals may have shown movement before the tests, he said, they had been anesthetized to a point where they could not feel pain. The current conflict here is one of many that have marked a surge over the last few years in an animal welfare movement regarded as beginning in 1776 with a British cleric, Humphrey Primatt, who observed, ''Pain is pain, whether it is inflicted on man or beast.'' Shift Began in 1976 Experts in the field say the new growth and a change of direction began two centuries later with the publication in 1976 of the book ''Animal Liberation'' by Peter Singer, a professor of philosophy at Australian National University, who equated exploitation of animals with slavery. Now ''animal rights'' is heard almost as often as animal welfare, and it is heard even among members of moderate old-line organizations, such as the Humane Society of the United States. Even longtime leaders of the animal welfare cause say they have no idea how many people are involved in their movement, but Mr. Trapp of the National Anti-Vivisection Society, which has nearly 50,000 members, said, ''It's got to be many millions.'' Both he and Patricia Forkan, a vice president of the Humane Society, whose membership she estimated at 200,000, said their organizations had doubled in the last five years. Illegal Actions Disapproved Mr. Trapp and Miss Forkan look askance at actions of groups such as the Animal Liberation Front, the Band of Mercy and the Urban Gorillas, although she said, ''We can certainly understand how people can grow frustrated enough'' to resort to illegal actions. Among other actions, the Animal Liberation Front took 12 dogs last year from a medical center research project in Los Angeles, the Band of Mercy ''liberated'' about 40 rabbits from the University of Maryland, and the Urban Gorillas took cats from the University of California at Berkley. Meanwhile, other groups have sabotaged seal hunts, zoos and commercial fur farms, harassed whalers and interfered with sport hunters. Among the new groups, one of the fastest growing is People for Ethical Treatment of Animals, which began with 18 members four years ago and now has 23,000 supporters, according to its director, Ingrid Newkirk. ''Things have changed since 1976,'' Mrs. Newkirk said. ''It's not just 'don't beat dogs' anymore. For the first time in the United States, people are realizing that animals are creatures, too, and they have rights.''

735-> Bridge: 2 Top-Ranked Entries Fall In Spingold Championship
Third- round play in the Spingold knockout team championship continued here this afternoon at the American Contract Bridge League's Summer Nationals. Two more top-seeded teams were on the sidelines as a result of second-round play Thursday. The fourth-seeded team - led by Ed Manfield of Arlington, Va., and including Kit Woolsey, also of Arlington, John Solodar of New York, Bob Lipsitz of Annandale, Va., and Ralph Katz and Milt Rosenberg, both of Chicago - lost by 20 international match points to Ron Sukoneck and Judi Cody, both of Annandale, Va.; Russ Ekeblad of Providence, R.I.; Bernie Miller of Malden, Mass., and Leslie Popper of Peabody, Mass. David Funk of Norman, Okla., with a star-studded group that included Mike Passell of Dallas, Lou Bluhm of Atlanta, Grant Baze of Los Angeles, Mark Lair of Canyon, Tex., and Fred Hamilton of Hollywood, Fla., was soundly defeated. His eighth-seeded squad lost by 60 points to Walt Walbick of McLean, Va.; Steve Lapides of Baltimore; Ken Cohen of Philadelphia, and Larry Kozelove of Louisville, Ky. Playing Without Captain A sense of shock prevailed at the tournament after the kidnapping Thursday night of Edith Rosenkranz, one of the game's most popular players. Her husband, Dr. George Rosenkranz, is captain of the third- seeded Spingold team. Playing without him, his team led by 34 points today at the halfway point in its match against a one headed by Randy Joyce of Raleigh, N.C. In other matches, the scores by captain were: Malcolm Brachman of Dallas trailed Ted Horning of Thornhill, Ontario, by 32 points; George Ateljevich of Las Vegas, Nev., trailed Jim Chew of Tulsa, Okla., by 50; Sukoneck trailed Jim Looby of Burbank, Calif., by 74; Warren Rosner of Nanuet, N.Y., trailed Alan Sontag of New York by 17; Brenda Harris of Fair Lawn, N.J., trailed Tom Mahaffey of St. Petersburg, Fla., by 13; Cliff Russell of Miami trailed Brian Glubok of New York by 17; Walbick trailed Kathie Wei of New York by 43. Two New York experts fell just short with a stretch drive. Michael Rosmarin and Ira Herman, teamed with Alan Schwartz and Ken Bercuson of Washington, trailed by 43 points into the final 16 deals against Joyce and his teammates, Nick Nickell, Bill Wisdom and Henry Rich. As it turned out, the match hinged on one hand, shown in the diagram. Rich reached the borderline contract of three no-trump as shown. He won the heart lead with the queen and led a low spade. East ducked, and South established diamonds to make his contract. With the actual distribution there was no defense. If West had taken his spade ace and shifted to a low club, South would have ducked in dummy. East could win and return the suit, removing the ace, but South would be able to use his spade suit, thanks to the fall of the nine, and eventually finesse in diamonds to make nine tricks. If the spade nine had been in the East hand, then best defense would beat the contract. The Rosmarin team, which rested in a safe part- score in the replay, would have gained 6 points instead of losing 10 and would have won the match by 3. As it was, Joyce won by 13.

737-> ARCHITECTURE VIEW; ROMANTIC MODERNISM IS NOW AT THE CUTTING EDGE OF DESIGN
Is there, right now, a body of architecture being produced that could be said to sum up the values and intentions of this moment - that the history books will cite as expressing the impulses of the 1980's as surely as the rich, enveloping Richardsonian Romanesque represented the 1880's, as precisely as the sleek, swooping forms of decorative Modernism call to mind the 1950's? As neat as that, no. But there is clearly emerging a common impulse right now, and it is a lot easier to see than it was even two or three years ago. It is not quite a style - it is, after all, the prerogative of history, not criticism, to declare styles; it takes hindsight to tie things up into the tidy packages that styles are, and this decade may never jell into something that deserves a name anyway. So a style is not what we are talking about - indeed, the physical appearance of buildings is not the essence of it, either. It is more an attitude, a shift in professional preoccupations, and a willingness to let certain things about the nature of architectural practice that seemed not long ago to be completely contradictory begin to coexist. A word about that, before any talk at all about what things look like. Just three or four years ago, architecture seemed divided between what we might, at the risk of oversimplification, call the thinkers and the doers - those whose concern was primarily theoretical and who, either by choice or by necessity, built almost nothing, and those who were all too wrapped up in the real world, and seemed to build almost everything. It almost goes without saying that esthetics were primarily the concern of the theoreticians; the builders had no patience for issues of art. And the result, those few years ago, was that we were seeing lots of ideas manifested in drawings and papers and in small buildings, and almost nothing at all of any real architectural interest in the large buildings that give shape and identity to our cities. Where a concern for issues of esthetics did go hand in hand with the making of large-scale buildings tended to be in the offices of certain architects whose work was fairly conservative - architects like I. M. Pei and Edward Larrabee Barnes, to name but two. These architects, and others like them, could produce work of impressive quality - but it was rarely at the cutting edge. Not only did it not probe new directions itself, it rarely seemed in touch with the issues that more theoretical architects were concerning themselves with. Now, that has begun to change. The esthetic currents of the last few years have now moved with a vengeance into large-scale building, and there is, thus, a substantial middle ground in architecture now, a meeting point of esthetic concerns and large-scale building that is too conspicuous to deny. Architects like Cesar Pelli, Helmut Jahn, Kevin Roche, Michael Graves and the firms of Kohn Pederson Fox and Philip Johnson and John Burgee are producing skyscrapers and other types of large buildings that owe a major debt to the so-called Post-Modern movement, breaking definitively with the austere boxes of orthodox modern architecture in favor of buildings that are more varied, even picturesque, in their physical form and highly reminiscent of the sculptured silhouettes of older skyscrapers. Not that the work of all of these architects is similar in either intent or result; far from it. A Kevin Roche skyscraper and a Helmut Jahn skyscraper could not be more different. But with each passing year there seems to be a greater and greater role played by historical form in all kinds of buildings, a greater and greater willingness to be evocative of the past, either literally or figuratively. All of these architects were doing buildings that were much more conventionally ''modern'' a few years ago, and the transition away from that has been different in al most every case. Mr. Graves underwent an almost religious conversion from a style heavily influenced by the early work of Le Corbusier to a more personal, idiosyncratic kind of decorative classicism that a few years ago was thought to be completely out of the mainstream. With the completion of his Portland Building in Portland, Ore., and the construction of his Humana skyscraper in Louisville, Ky., it has become impossible for anyone, supporters and critics alike, to think of Mr. Graves as a peripheral or primarily theoretical figure. Mr. Johnson and his partner, Mr. Burgee, were as much at the cutting edge a few years ago, and their decision in the late 1970's to begin integrating historical form into modern skyscrapers, as shown most notably in the A.T.& T. building in New York, might be called the first sign of a trend that has now reached full steam - the growth of Post-Modernism into a large-scale, commercial style. No one else has designed anything quite like the A.T.& T. building since, which is just as well, but the building has been deeply influential in a more subtle way. It has made the use of historical form altogether acceptable in large-scale building, and has encouraged such confirmed Modernists as Mr. Roche, Mr. Pelli and Mr. Jahn to move in similar directions. And so they have. In buildings such as Kohn Pederson Fox's mart building proposed for 42d Street in Manhattan and its towers for New York and Boston, Mr. Roche's tower proposed for 60 Wall Street in Manhattan, Mr. Pelli's proposed tower for Minneapolis, and Mr. Jahn's three new towers planned for New York, we see a strong tendency to use historical form. The mart building is almost castle-like in its massing, a monumental sculptured mass. The skyscrapers have shaped tops and active profiles based largely on setbacks, and they are clearly intended to create the kind of romantic skyline we recall from the great towers of the 1920's and 30's. Yet they are also, in another sense, ''modern,'' and this is the most important thing of all, for here is the real coming together, the real place in which different strains have been joined to create a new type. For some years, these architects, along with many others, have done work that fell into the category the critic Charles Jencks has labeled ''late modernism,'' the tendency to use sleek, modern materials, but to use them to create more actively sculptured forms than the stark boxes of earlier Modernism. With the coming of historical influences into their work, these architects have not given up their fondness for modern materials and for a certain degree of Modernist imagery; they have kept it and continued to celebrate it, even as they evoke historical forms in their buildings' shapes and presences on the skyline. So what we have is a kind of merging of late Modernism and Post-Modernism, a new meeting point in which the sleekness of modern buildings is used to evoke the romance of the past. It is far too early to know whether this will really coalesce into a style, and I have no desire to step into the historians' role and give this phenomenon a name. But if it has to be called something it might well be thought of as romantic Modernism, for it is romantic in its recall of history, Modernist in its celebration of modern imagery and technology. And it is this that is coming, more and more, to be the attitude of the moment. We are seeing relatively little of the literal movement toward historical form and traditional materials that A.T.& T. seemed, a few years ago, as if it might presage, but we are seeing not much more of the sort of late Modernism that was prevalent just a year or two ago. The strains are coming together. To talk of this year and that, of what we saw last year and what we saw two years ago, sounds perilously like fashion and not art - the story of how what was chic last season turns into something else this season. But I think what is significant in all of this is that we are seeing something more than mere fashion. Romantic Modernism has taken a few years to evolve, and that in itself is encouraging; we are not talking about instant style here. More important, it comes out of a union of two attitudes, each of which is, in its way, a kind of response to the dead end that so many architects have felt Modernism had become. So there is something inherently compatible about late Modernism and Post-Modernism, and each seems to have within it a kind of correcting or tempering influence on the other. The sleekness and modernity of late-Modernism tempers the sense of reversal of direction that makes Post-Modernism, for some, so hard to take; conversely, the sense of continuity, of connection with larger currents, of movement away from abstraction and toward something more figurative that Post-Modernism represents, is an important corrective to Modernism. Of course, all of this optimism about the potential of romantic Modernism is based on a few finished buildings - most notable among them is probably Johnson and Burgee's Transco Tower in Houston - and a lot of drawings and models. It will be later in this decade before we see enough finished work to make any real conclusions possible. But what is certain, even now, is that the profession of architecture is moving, at least tentatively, toward some sort of center - toward a center that seems to pay attention to design as well as to practicalities, toward a center that seems neither trapped in the past nor fixated on the future.

739-> COUNTY'S FIRST SKYSCRAPER IN RENOVATION
-story, 57-year-old Con Edison Building in Mount Vernon, has undergone a $3 million renovation as part of that city's effort to upgrade its commercial neighborhoods. Across town, the 500-block of Gramatan Avenue has just had a face lifting, with the last two stores receiving new facades, joining about 175 other stores that have been given new signs, new fronts and new window treatments in the last four years under a city loan and grant program. The projects are the latest in a series of city-improvement programs in Mount Vernon that won a planning achievement award in June from the Westchester Municipal Planning Federation. The award was given for the city's efforts in aiding 250 small businesses, creating 750 new jobs, and retaining 2,000 other jobs that might otherwise have disappeared. The programs include a series of low-interest loans and grants to enable industries and businesses to improve their buildings and provide technical assistance to companies in working out the financial arrangements. The city has arranged loans of $23 million to 15 businesses and attracted another $30 million in private investment since 1979, according to V. J. Ferrandino, the Planning Commissioner. The freshly painted exterior of the Con Edison building is probably the most noticeable of the city's improvements because of the building's height and prominent location. The building sits on a hill on East First Street, and when it was completed in 1927 it was unique in Westchester - the tallest and most modern building in the county. During World War II, it was used as a lookout against an enemy attack from the Atlantic. Even today, despite the number of tall new buildings in Westchester, a visitor to the top floor can look out in four directions and see the Long Island Sound, the Empire State Building, the Yonkers Raceway and the tops of buildings in White Plains. The building looms above the railroad cut, a 100-foot-wide valley running north and south through the middle of the city, with wide stretches of parking along the west side and many low buildings around it, giving the old skyscraper additional prominence. The building even dominates a modern 22-story apartment building across the cut that is built on lower land. Renamed Westchester Tower, its huge lobby, which had become grimy over the years, has been repainted and the marble ballusters that were almost black have been scrubbed back to their original warm beige color. One section of the lobby has been carved off for offices of the city's Department of Social Services, but the pillars, some marble and some masonry with Corinthian tops, have been retained. The elaborate bronze railings on the mezzanine are golden again after years of blackness. The 10th floor was used for many years by the New York State Court of Claims and still has its restored, elegant wooden floors. The heating, air-conditioning, plumbing and electrical systems have been modernized, walls and ceilings have been rebuilt and new floors installed on all floors but the 10th. The building has been only partly functional for several years but the occupied sections have been heavily used, with several public agencies as tenants - the county's Department of Social Services, the Community Mental Health Association, and the Mount Vernon Community Services Center. They continued to occupy it during the two years of renovation, moving from one office to another as the work proceeded. The new owners, a group of investors known as Westchester Power Associates, are trying to attract private corporations as tenants. They have installed a separate lobby to include two of the four elevators, and these will be used exclusively by corporate tenants and their visitors, while the other two will be used for the public agencies. The elevators will continue to have operators, an unusual feature in the county today, and they still have the original ornate brass doors. The major new private tenant is Irwin Weiner Sports Enterprises, which handles publicity and contracts for many prominent sports figures. One of its clients, Lou Piniella, a former Yankees' outfielder and now a Yankee coach, participated in the re- dedication ceremonies. Con Edison also occupies offices there, as it has since 1952. Earlier, the building had been named for Con Ed's predecessor, the Westchester Lighting Company, which built it. Joseph A. Cosenza, superintendent of the building and an employee there for 20 years, recalled that when the tower was built gas furnaces were a novelty and the owners were fearful of explosion or leakage. So the furnace was installed, and remains, across the street, in a two-story triangular brick building, which has been improved as part of the project. The cost of the renovtion was paid for partly by a $500,000 Urban Development Action Grant given to the city by the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development; a $1 million loan from Mount Vernon's Industrial Development Agency, which floats tax-exempt industrial revenue bonds for projects that are expected to benefit the city; and a $1.6 million loan from Chemical Bank. The facade program most recently involved Alfonso shoes and Ristorante Venezia at 540 and 546 Gramatan Avenue in the Fleetwood section. The program offers loans from the city at two points less than the prime rate and an incentive bonus of $1,000 if the facade work costs more than $4,000. The shoe store had been in business in Mount Vernon since 1935 and its old facade was ruined last year by torrential winds and rain. The restaurant is new, replacing a bakery. Various signs are designed to conform with their neighbors' under a city program that limits the number of exterior colors to four and the lettering to two, with similar or complementary design and materials. The facade program has affected groups of stores in several parts of the city. The City Planning Department publicizes the program and urges store owners to accept its improvement grants ''because if a business has been set up for years it may not be inclined to spend several thousand dollars to fix it up,'' said Colleen Duffy, a spokesman for the Planning Department.

740-> POLAND SAID TO AGREE TO A CHURCH FARM FUND
The Government has agreed to a proposal by the Roman Catholic Church that only the Primate of Poland and church-appointed officials supervise an independent, Western-supported fund to assist private farmers, church sources said today. A Catholic official involved in the project said the withdrawal of the Government's insistence that it have a voice in the fund removed the last major hurdle after two years of negotiation. The fund will get its money from church donations and public contributions, largely from the United States and West Germany, to stimulate output and earnings for the 3.5 million private farmers in Poland. Church officials said that some details remained to be worked out with the Government, notably tax exemption. But they stressed that there is a real prospect that pilot projects could be started by January with the $28 million already raised. Warsaw Sees End of Sanctions The disclosure of the emerging agreement came as Warsaw officials expressed hope in private that the amnesty for political prisoners, announced last weekend, would earn Poland political benefits at home and abroad. Government spokesmen predict only a token initial response by the United States, involving relaxation of some economic sanctions. But they look forward to slowly improving relations. The first steps by the United States are expected to include lifting of the ban on Polish airline flights to the United States. More significant action later would involve expanded trade and financial benefits. The agricultural aid plan is a favored project of Jozef Cardinal Glemp, the Primate of Poland. It relies heavily on funds raised in the West to support the only large group of private farmers in the Soviet bloc. The private farmers, who own small farms but altogether till more than 75 percent of the country's cropland, make up one of the most well-to-do sectors in Polish society. They work hard - usually with horses rather than tractors - but are well paid for their crops and animals. But they lack adequate money for modern machinery and other equipment to make farming more efficient. Collective System Abandoned Poland's farms were forcibly collectivized under the postwar Communist rule but in 1956, after wide disorders over food shortages, farmers were allowed to withdraw from the collectives. Most did. The idea of having the Roman Catholic Church direct Western currencies to the private farmers, without involvement or supervision of the Communist Party or the Government, is unusual in a Communist-ruled nation. Collectivized farming is the model in the Soviet Union. The bloc nations, with the exception of Poland, largely follow that model. Another unusual element of the projected fund rests on the almost certain heavy involvement of former activist members of Rural Solidarity. This union of farmers was crushed by the Government two and a half years ago when the industrial Solidarity labor movement was suppressed by martial law. In Poland, the cyclical social upheavals of the last 30 years, such as the one in 1980 that saw the emergence and flourishing of Solidarity, have all been associated with food shortages and increases in food prices. Procedural Details' Remain ''The legislation for the fund has already been approved by Parliament, three directors for the fund have been chosen by the church and only some procedural details still have to be determined before we are legally registered,'' said the church official close to the negotiations. Of the initial $28 million contribution, he said, $4 million is being provided by the church in the United States and $10 million more in funds from the United States, with the rest from Western Europe.

742-> Records Released In Dynamics Case
A panel of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress today released General Dynamics Corporation documents that it said supported charges that the company submitted intentionally undervalued bids to the Navy to build nuclear submarines and then deceived the Government into paying hundreds of millions of dollars for cost overruns. The company documents also ''indicate that Navy officials collaborated with the contractor to jointly contrive an explanation for the settlement that would be approved by Congress,'' according to a report prepared by the committee staff. The report was written by Richard F. Kaufman, general counsel of the Joint Economic Committee, who presented it today to the Subcommittee on International Trade, Finance and Security Economics. Senator William Proxmire, Democrat of Wisconsin, called the hearings to examine recent allegations of false claims in Navy shipbuilding. In reply, General Dynamics said, ''Through selective use of documents at the Proxmire hearings today, superficial conclusions were drawn which are totally at odds with the judgment of two Federal grand juries.'' The company said that the new charges originated from allegations made by P. Takis Veliotis, ''a former employee and an indicted felon now a fugitive from justice in Greece.'' Mr. Veliotis, a former member of the board of General Dynamics, was indicted in September by a Federal grand jury in Manhattan on charges of accepting kickbacks in an embezzlement scheme involving General Dynamics and the now-defunct Frigitemp Corporation. He retired from the company in 1982 after holding a number of high posts, including general manager of its Electric Boat shipyard in Groton, Conn. Mr. Veliotis fled to Greece before the indictment and has since offered to provide Federal investigators with information he contends proves that General Dynamics defrauded the Navy. The documents released today were memorandums and records of meetings during the 1970's in which General Dynamics officials discussed poor conditions at Electric Boat and efforts to obtain more than $500 million from the Government to cover excess costs. As an example, the report cited a ''handwritten note,'' not released with the material made public today, between two General Dynamics officials involved with the submarine program in 1973. According to the report, the note included this sentence: ''We'll never be able to make a claim hold up if we are reporting inadequate manning.'' Manpower reports to the Navy were then discontinued, the Kaufman study said. Eugene Paulisch, associate chief trial attorney in the Navy's litigation office, testified to the panel today. Asked about the policy of suspending contractors suspected of fraud, Mr. Paulisch said: ''General Dynamics has not been suspended because the Navy has no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of the company,'' other than the reported wrongdoing of Mr. Veliotis.

743-> CALIFORNIA SAYS MEXICAN FRUIT FLY IS CURBED
Agriculture officials here declared Thursday that they had stamped out the Mexican fruit fly, but officials in Santa Barbara County are worried that a Mediterranean fruit fly trapped there could be just ''the tip of the iceberg.'' At a news conference in Los Angeles, Paul Engler, Agriculture Commissioner of Los Angeles County, and Clare Berryhill, director of the State Food and Agriculture Department, announced that the 10-month battle against the Mexican fly had been won. ''The successful eradication of the Mexican fruit fly in Los Angeles came at a cost of $2.7 million, but there hasn't been a fruit fly trapped in the area in four months,'' Mr. Berryhill said. Four months of setting baited traps without capturing a fruit fly are required before an eradication can be declared, Mr. Berryhill said. Sterile Flies May Be Used Mr. Engler said the pesticide malathion might not have to be used in future infestations because of programs to breed sterile flies. Residents in the target area had protested helicopter spraying of the pesticide. The quarantine on trafficking in fruit in the target area of more than 50 square miles in Los Angeles will be lifted, while the number of traps left in the area will be increased from one per square mile to five, Mr. Engler said. Meanwhile, officials in Santa Barbara County to the north were poised to begin a ''reaction program'' if another Mediterranean fruit fly is trapped in the area, where an infestation could threaten the region's $36 million annual fruit crop. Agriculture Commissioner Ron Gilman of Santa Barbara County said more than 1,400 traps would be set in a nine-square-mile area around a lemon tree in Goleta where a Mediterranean fruit fly believed to have come in on fruit brought from Hawaii was trapped Tuesday. Infestation Is Feared ''If we don't find any more, we'll just surmise that this one got in and there wasn't anything else,'' Mr. Gilman said. ''But what we're afraid of is that this is just the tip of the iceberg and there's an infestation out there.'' The fly found in Goleta was identified by a state laboratory in Sacramento. California spent two years and $96 million eradicating the Medfly from 1980 through 1982. Mr. Gilman said he was ''confident'' the Medfly came from Hawaii, which is fighting its own infestation of the pest. Although the county has a contingency plan for setting quarantines and spraying malathion and diazinon, Mr. Gilman said no spraying was planned yet. The Medfly infests 256 varieties of fruits and vegetables, including crops that generate more than a third of California's annual farm income of $14 billion. In the previous battle, the state quarantined 623 square miles, hired 4,000 people and sprayed malathion on 1,495 square miles from the air.

744-> 3 KILLED AS TRAIN FALLS INTO RAVINE IN VERMONT HILLS
An Amtrak passenger train with 278 people aboard derailed while crossing a washed-out culvert this morning, killing at least three people, injuring more than a hundred and trapping passengers in a crushed sleeping car. The train was bound from Washington to Montreal. Officials said tonight that two people were believed to be still inside the sleeping car, which overturned in a shallow pool of water. Rescue workers using blowtorches and a crane continued searching for survivors late into the night. Eighty-eight people were taken to the Medical Center Hospital in Burlington; 57 others were taken to the Fanny Allen Hospital in Winooski. About 140 people who were unhurt or suffered only slight injuries were taken by bus to the Williston Armory. Most of the injured were treated and released. 'Screaming for Help' ''Bodies were just falling every which way,'' said one passenger on the northbound Montrealer, Frank Coles of New York City. ''People were screaming for help.'' (The crushed car at the bottom of the gully was a sleeper with 10 to 20 compartments, rescue workers told United Press International. ''The compartments are crushed and pancaked on one another,'' said one worker, Charles Logsdon.) Amtrak reported that 3 of the train's 13 cars were reserved by a private tour company and carried about 160 passengers, most of whom boarded in New York, Newark, Philadelphia and Washington. According to officials, two people were dead on arrival at the Medical Center. A third victim, identified as Vernon Church, a conductor aboard the train, died on an operating table at the Hospital. The derailment occurred on a muddy, hilly site along the Winooski River a few miles east of Burlington and three miles south of Essex Junction. Governor on the Scene ''This is the most serious accident I can recall in 30 years here, said Gov. Richard A. Snelling of Vermont, who was here to coordinate rescue efforts. ''It's pretty gruesome.'' The derailment was the first Amtrak accident this year in which people aboard a train died. The train was operated by the Central Vermont Railway over its tracks. Uncertainty over the death toll stemmed from rescue workers' inability to get to passengers trapped in the crushed car. Crane Is Brought In One worker who was able to crawl close to the car said he had seen several bodies. The crane was brought in by late afternoon to try to free the crushed car and allow rescue workers to get inside. By 10 P.M., crane operators had removed four cars that obstructed access to the crushed car. Rescuers were doing a last-minute check on the other cars for injured people who might not have been sighted earlier. ''They've accounted for most of the people,'' said Lieut. Truman Way of the state police. Witnesses said they had seen at least two bodies taken to a baggage car, which was being used as a temporary morgue. An Amtrak spokesman, Clifford Black, said that among those killed was an Amtrak worker, Charles Crawford, 35 years old, of Tacoma Park, Md. The Medical Center identified the other two victims as Mr. Church, a Central Vermont Railway conductor from St. Albans, Vt., and C. Evans Carr from the New York City area. The spokesman, Pat Cooper, said she did not know if Mr. Carr was a passenger. Most of the 262 passengers were asleep when the train buckled before 7 A.M., possibly because of track damage caused by overnight flooding. Rescue efforts were hampered by mud and the isolation of the location. Hundreds of rescue workers, including 150 National Guardsmen and employees from a nearby International Business Machines plant, struggled to remove the injured. People were removed from the train on stretchers, some wearing oxygen masks. William Gearhart, 37, a passenger from Westfield, N.J., said the derailment occurred at 7:18 A.M. According to Mr. Gearhart, a conductor on the train informed passengers that an embankment had been washed out but that the train's engineer ''was going to try to get over it.'' The train derailed moments later, he said. ''The first couple of cars made it, and then my car flipped over two times and everything collapsed around us,'' he said. Another survivor, Lonnie W. Kohl, 34, said he and a friend helped free a railroad employee whose legs were trapped in the wreckage and who was in danger of drowning in the shallow water where the cars had come to rest. ''We brought him out and laid him on a rock,'' Mr. Kohl said. ''He said his back hurt.'' Later, he learned the man had died. Another passenger, Arnold J. Sanow, 31, described the moment of the derailment. ''You're rolling over and you don't know what's going on,'' he said. ''You're very calm, but you don't know whether you'll live through it. Then when you stop, you say, 'Boy, I made it.' '' William G. Wite, 50, a Montreal real estate salesman who was returning home from New York, had just gone to the dining car for breakfast when the 13-car train left the track. ''The first thing I knew I was on the floor,'' he recalled. ''I was in one of the cars that went down the embankment. The force of it was so great, you couldn't grab onto anything.'' As soon as the car stopped rolling, Mr. Wite said, a member of the train's crew shouted for everyone not to move. Then, he said, he heard someone shout that another train was coming. Everyone who could climb out of the car then did, he said. Ambulances and emergency vehicles were unable to get all the way to the derailment in the muddy area. Bulldozers were brought to the site and created a makeshift road, about 60 yards wide, where before there had been only a footpath lined by maple and oak trees. Pat Cooper, the hospital spokesman, said four buses were used to deliver the injured to the Medical Center. beginning at about 8:15 A.M. ''We admitted 13 of the 88 people we saw,'' she said. ''There were all sorts of injuries: head injuries, back and neck sprains.'' After being treated, ''some of the people went on to Montreal, and some of them went in the direction of home,'' she said. Engines Made It Across The train derailed when it hit track over a culvert that had been washed out by overnight flooding, according to state police and civil defense officials. Two engines, a baggage car and a sleeper made it across the culvert before the tracks gave way. The remaining cars then began falling the 30 feet into the gully. In all, seven cars and two engines derailed, Amtrak said. Heavy rains fell across much of the Northeast on Friday night and today. ''There was a lot of flooding in that area overnight, a number of roads are closed and there was water over Interstate 89 at Williston,'' said George Lowe, the local civil defense director. A state police dispatcher in the Colchester barracks said she got word of the derailment shortly before 7 A.M. when an area resident called to report a ''ball of fire'' near the railroad tracks. The train, Amtrak's No. 60, passes through Connecticut and Massachusetts before entering Vermont at Brattleboro. Rail service was suspended in both directions on the route.

745-> BODDICKER BEATS ANGELS, 1-0
Mike Boddicker pitched his second straight shutout as the Baltimore Orioles defeated the California Angels 1-0, today, the only run scoring on a first-inning error by Mike Witt, the California pitcher. Boddicker (15-8) allowed four hits, struck out two batters and walked three en route to his fifth straight triumph. It was the fourth consecutive loss for the Angels. Witt (11-10) allowed six hits, struck out six and walked six in seven innings. He has lost three in a row to the Orioles this season without benefit of a California run, and the Angels have scored no more than two runs in eight of his losses. Mike Young opened the Orioles' first with a double off first base and took third on a fly ball by John Shelby. Witt, the American League strikeout leader, struck out Cal Ripken Jr., but he couldn't handle a bouncer by Eddie Murray. The ball skipped off the mound and ricocheted off Witt's glove. By the time he chased it down, Murray was safe and Young had scored. Boddicker, who has allowed 2 or fewer runs in 17 of his 26 starts, was helped by double plays in the first two innings. Twins 6, Red Sox 4 Twins 3, Red Sox 1 BOSTON (AP) - Bobby Castillo allowed only one hit in six innings in his first 1984 start and Rick Lysander completed a four-hitter as Minnesota swept a doubleheader. The Twins, raising their American League West lead to four games, won the opener wth a three-run, ninth-inning rally. In the second game Castillo, plagued by shoulder troubles for a year, earned his first victory since Aug. 10, 1983, and Lysander collected his second save of the day and third of the season. The only hit off Castillo was Wade Boggs's single, which Tim Teufel fielded behind second base leading off the first inning. Castillo walked three and struck out one. The Twins got five of their nine hits and all three runs against the Boston starter, John Henry Johnson (0-2), in the second inning. Kirby Puckett, Mickey Hatcher and Kent Hrbek drove in one run each in the ninth inning of the opener as the Twins overcame a 4-3 Boston lead. Puckett, Hatcher and Hrbek also drove in runs during a three-run fifth inning against Dennis (Oil Can) Boyd. Ron Davis, who bailed out John Butcher in the eighth, improved his record to 5-9. Lysander worked the ninth for the save. The Boston reliever Bob Stanley (7-9) was the loser. White Sox 7, Blue Jays 6 CHICAGO (AP) - Vance Law singled home the go-ahead run in the eighth inning and Harold Baines cracked a pair of home runs in leading Chicago to a victory over Toronto. With the score tied, 6-6, in the eighth, Greg Walker smacked a two-out double and Ron Kittle drew an intentional walk to set up the third hit of the game for Law, who had earlier hit a two-run single. The victory went to the reliever Bert Roberge (3-0), who came in for the starter, Floyd Bannister, in the seventh. Roberge walked the leadoff batter in the ninth and Juan Agosto came on for his seventh save. Roy Lee Jackson (7-6) took the loss in relief of Doyle Alexander. Baines ripped a homer into the upper right-field stands in the first inning after Jerry Hairston walked to give the White Sox a 2-0 lead. Baines hit his 24th home run of the season, a solo blast to right in the third. Tigers 4, Mariners 3 DETROIT (UPI) - Kirk Gibson lined a tie-breaking, three-run home run in the sixth inning and Juan Berenguer struck out a career-high 12 batters as Detroit defeated Seattle. Gibson's 20th home run of the season, to right field, was his 15th game- winning hit of the season, a club record. Berenguer, who had never beaten Seattle in six previous decisions, gave up three hits and walked four over 8Y innings as he raised his record to 6-8. Willie Hernandez finished for his 26th save despite allowing a two-run single by Steve Henderson. Alan Trammell opened the sixth with a single to left against loser Dave Geisel (0-1). Trammell stole second as Barbaro Garbey was striking out and that opened first for an intentional walk to Lance Parrish. Geisel got Larry Herndon on a fly ball to right but Gibson lined an 0-2 pitch over the lower deck fence in right to decide the game. Royals 5, Rangers 4 ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) - Buddy Biancalana smacked his first major league homer and had a bunt single that led to the ejection of the Texas pitcher Danny Darwin as Kansas City hung on to beat Texas. With the game scoreless, Don Slaught doubled to start the fifth and Biancalana then bunted. The first baseman Pete O'Brien fielded the ball and threw to Darwin, who collided with Biancalana and fell down. Darwin (6-9) was ejected after bumping the first base umpire Ken Kaiser while protesting the call. Bud Black (12-10), who had allowed George Wright's sixth homer to lead off the seventh, left with two outs in the ninth after doubles by Larry Parrish, O'Brien and Kunkel made it 5-3. Mark Huismann gave up a pinch-hit r.b.i. single to Bobby Jones before getting his second save.

746-> ABOUT MEN ; RIGORS OF THE ROAD
Many men think traveling for a living is glamorous and exciting, but not those of us who do it. We can tell you about nights in musty motels in Missouri or west Texas, sad ''gourmet'' dishes served by ''Continental'' restaurants with paste-on Spanish medieval decor, about napping on airport benches, mental and physical weariness, loneliness. Traveling makes for a scattered, dislocated life. Some men seek relief in food, some in alcohol, some in sex. My own alternative is exercise, keeping physically fit above all. It serves as a kind of anchor, a psychological safe harbor, for a life that is otherwise hectic, scattered and full of stress. The benefits are more than psychological. As I near my 43d birthday, I take a kind of perverse pleasure in meeting friends from high school or college days, especially the ones who were athletes. Most of them seem to have potbellies. But at 5 foot 11, I weigh 150 pounds. My pulse ranges from 55 to 60 at rest. I feel as sleek and agile as a leopard. This sounds immodest, yet I feel I have earned the right. Rather shy as a youngster in Brooklyn, I tended to shun athletic contests. Not the poorest softball player on the school playground, neither was I the first selected when sides were chosen. I often preferred to serve as umpire than risk humiliation on the playing field. My interest in sports and fitness today has little to do with what the sports pages consider sports. I no longer know the Lakers from the Giants or even what they play. It bemuses me to hear grown men arguing about so many yards gained or runs batted in. I find college sports a sordid affair, the schools having corrupted their academic ideals for the higher goal of supplying trained athletes to professional teams. Once my heroes, college and other professional athletes now seem to me largely boorish and shallow people. I lost interest in spectator sports the day the Dodgers left Brooklyn, which was also the day I became a cynic. As a kid, I spent nearly every weekend - and almost all of my allowance - in the second tier at Ebbets Field cheering Gil Hodges, Roy Campanella, Jackie Robinson, Pee Wee Reese, Duke Snider and the rest of that great team. The Dodgers were the good guys in the terrible fight against hate and racism, and they seemed to say, somehow, that Brooklyn was a more humane, liberal and moral place than, say, St. Louis. They deserved our loyalty. Then one day they moved to Los Angeles for something as trivial as money. I have never again been to a professional sports event. Rather, I have developed an intensely personal fitness ethic that seems to fit well with a job and style of life that, as with so many men in these times, is full of unpredictable hours and sudden travel. It is, moreover, an ethic that is shared by many others, to judge from the joggers and swimmers I see emerging from hotels every morning. Somehow, the exertion calms the troubled waters. Just the planning to do it, no matter what, serves as a stabilizing keel. The locale is almost never the same, but you can identify me wherever I go. It is 6:30 on a gray wintry morning in Jefferson City, Mo. A lone angular figure in a black sweat suit emerges from a downtown motel, fixes his stereo headphones in place and heads out down the road. A muscular rock beat explodes into the headphones, encapsulating the form in a private world. The jogging quickly conforms to the rhythm, transforming the jogger into a ballet dancer of the road, or so it seems from within. How odd it must seem to the commuters to see this galloping form leap into the air with the joy of it all. A few months later, the geography and seasons have changed, but the runner adapts. Now shirtless, the form is gliding past the mesquite along highway 90 in west Texas, watching the desert sun set over the Davis Mountains near Alpine. Or it may be the eucalyptus-spotted foothills of the Santa Clara Valley of California or the urban canyons of Chicago or Dallas. Soon the day's work looms in the mind. Ideas that would never come to mind at a desk seem to take shape effortlessly. Mine is not an ethic based on any central philosophy of fitness or health, just an ad hoc one that seems to fit a life in which it is impossible to know where one will be next week or even tomorrow. It is a noncompetiive regime that is based on being able to keep active wherever and whenever, and to do it alone if necessary. It eschews any activity for which you have to plan ahead, to reserve, say, a court two weeks ahead of time. I read no articles or magazines on running and fitness; I just do it. Staying fit is relatively easy when at home, which for me is Houston right now. Every morning, I either jog three miles or swim an equivalent distance before work, more when time permits on weekends. I supplement this three or four evenings a week by workouts at the Y.M.C.A. on free weights and Nautilus exercise equipment. This is combined with an ad hoc but wholesome diet low on animal flesh and high on fresh vegetables, whole grains, pasta, rice, potatoes, beans and dairy products. Often I forget to eat, which may be just as well. UT ON THE ROAD, IT takes considerably more thought and effort to keep to this routine after a day of dragging bags through air terminals, car-rental offices and motels. Some travelers choose hotels for their food, their service, their luxury. None of that matters much to me; I look for the place with the biggest swimming pool or exercise rooms, the one near a good jogging path. I carry running shoes and a nylon swimsuit in my bag wherever I go. If no elaborate athletic facilities are to be found, there are always roads and parks: Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, Loose Park in Kansas City, Forest Park in St. Louis, the lakefront embankment in Chicago. Any road will do. It's also a fine way to learn a city and its architecture. As for working out, I go to the local Y or private health club, many of which will take nonmembers. The reward is difficult to convey in words: A feeling of physical well-being, of course. But beyond that, the effort brings a sense of wholeness that is elusive these days when modern transportation and communication tear away at the man.

748-> CAMPAIGN NOTES; Jackson Is Still in Debt, His Campaign Reports
The Rev. Jesse Jackson's unsuccessful Presidential campaign is about $350,000 in debt despite its recent financial statement that indicated otherwise, his campaign manager says. Arnold Pinkney said that since the June 30, 1984, financial statement was filed with the Federal Election Commission, the campaign has run up additional bills. The campaign comptroller, Linda Moody, and Howard Renzi, the auditor, said the campaign is $351,136 in debt. The campaign had spent about $3.6 million as of June 30. Frank Watkins, Mr. Jackson's spokesman, said a series of appreciation dinners and other events would be held around the country on Sept. 15 and 16 to help retire the debt. Meanwhile, he said, Mr. Jackson will continue to solicit contributions wherever he goes.

749-> REP. FERRARO'S TRANSACTIONS DETAILED IN PUBLIC RECORDS
The following article is based on reporting by Ralph Blumenthal and Jeff Gerth and was written by Mr. Blumenthal. An examination of public records provides further details about the finances of Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro and her husband, John A. Zaccaro, including several transactions involving Mrs. Ferraro, her husband and his business associates that figured in a 1979 inquiry by the Federal Election Commission. Michael S. Berman, an aide to Walter F. Mondale, said in an interview this week that he had asked lawyers to go over the finances of the Queens Congresswoman and her husband, including the election commission matter, to make more information available. Since Mr. Mondale, the Democratic Presidential nominee, selected Mrs. Ferraro as his running mate July 12, she, her campaign aides and Mr. Zaccaro have turned away questions about their finances with the explanation that information would be made public in 30 days, as part of a required disclosure by Vice-Presidential candidates. Mrs. Ferraro, in a statement issued Tuesday in Washington, reiterated that timetable and said the data to be released would include several years of Federal tax returns for herself and her husband, who filed separately. Matter of 'Public Trust' Mrs. Ferraro said she planned to include her husband's financial holdings in that disclosure ''because my husband and I believe that it is in the public interest to do so and because the office of Vice President is one of high public trust.'' However, Representative Ferraro repeated her contention that she was correct not to list her husband's holdings on her annual Congressional financial disclosure forms, which require a listing of all the holdings of the legislator, their spouse and their dependent children, unless exempted. It is not clear whether Mr. Zaccaro's finances fulfilled the conditions for exemption. Mrs. Ferraro listed herself as secretary and treasurer and as a shareholder of P. Zaccaro & Company, the real estate firm founded by Mr. Zaccaro's father, and thus might be considered to have benefited from her husband's holdings. Examination of public real estate and other records, meanwhile, has yielded a partial picture of the family's holdings. These include three homes and several corporations and partnerships that own Manhattan real estate. The Zaccaro company also manages other properties. Family Role in Campaign Mr. Zaccaro inherited the company from his father, Philip, who founded it in 1935. When the elder Mr. Zaccaro died in 1971, he left an estate valued at $667,937.42, which came to $307,662.07 after taxes. Records also show that Mr. Zaccaro and his associates played a role in financing Mrs. Ferraro's political career. In 1978, in Mrs. Ferraro's first race for Congress, her campaign received about $130,000 in money from her family, including $110,000 in loans from her husband. The Federal Election Commission questioned the funds. According to public records, in the course of the commission's inquiry and subsequent Congressional filings, Mrs. Ferraro, her campaign and her husband gave varying accounts of the source of the loans and the value of the transactions used to pay them back. Ultimately, it was determined that the majority of the funds had come from loans obtained by Mr. Zaccaro using accounts separate from those of Mrs. Ferraro. Under election law, Mr. Zaccaro could loan or contribute a maximum of $1,000 to his wife's campaign, while the candidate herself was not subject to any limitation. The election commission's inquiry ended in 1979 when Mr. Zaccaro and the Ferraro campaign agreed to pay a total of $750 in fines for civil violations of the election laws. Mrs. Ferraro's campaign had to refund the family loans with allowable funds. Records show that these funds came from two transactions by Mrs. Ferraro in 1978. In one transaction, in October 1978, she sold for $100,000 her half interest in property she owned in lower Manhattan. The buyer was the Melro Company, which owned the other half. According to public records, Melro is a family partnership headed by Manny Lerman, a business associate of Mr. Zaccaro's. Mrs. Ferraro and Melro had acquired the property from a company controlled by Mr. Zaccaro in May 1978, shortly before Mrs. Ferraro declared her Congressional candidacy, according to public records and an attorney for Mr. Zaccaro. Records show that the Polarob Realty Corporation bought the property for $175,000 on May 1, 1978, then immediately transferred ownership to Mrs. Ferraro and Melro for an undisclosed amount. Polarob was a ''dummy corporation'' used by Mr. Zaccaro ''to avoid personal liability,'' according to Murry Kalik, a principal in Polarob who was once a lawyer for Mr. Zaccaro. Capital Gains on Property On her financial disclosure form for 1978, Mrs. Ferraro valued the capital gain on the sale at $15,001 to $50,000. On the same form, she listed both her interest in the property and the sale's value at $5,001 to $15,000. It was not clear how the gain on the sale could be greater than the value of the sale. The second transaction that Mrs. Ferraro used to repay her campaign for her husband's loans was the sale for $30,000 of her half interest in a mortgage on another property at 124-26 Bowery, she told the election commission. According to real estate records, the property was owned by a partnership made up of Melro and Frajo Associates Inc., a corporation controlled by Mr. Zaccaro and his mother. Though the mortgage was not listed in public records, Samuel Feldman, an attorney speaking for Mr. Lerman, said the other half-interest in the mortgage was held by Mr. Lerman's son and daughter. On her financial disclosure report for 1978, Mrs. Ferraro valued her interest in the mortgage at $2,501 to $5,000. It was not clear why this valuation varied from the $30,000 value listed with the election commission. The House financial disclosure forms do not require members to list residences or vacation homes unless the properties are held for investment or income. Accordingly, Mrs. Ferraro did not list her house in Queens, a condominium in the Virgin Islands and a vacation house on Fire Island. Late yesterday P. Zaccaro & Company issued a statement in response to questions about its management of a lower Manhattan building housing a tenant, Star Distributors, that law-enforcement officials have previously described as a distributor of pornography linked to organized crime. Mr. Zaccaro said he would investigate the use of the space, at 200 Lafayette Street, and that, if necessary, he would take ''immediate action'' to end the lease.

752-> AROUND THE WORLD; 49 Die in Bangladesh As Plane Plunges
A Bangladesh passenger plane crashed today while trying to land in a driving rainstorm, killing all 49 people on board. It was the worst air disaster in Bangladesh since the country became independent in 1971. Officials said all 45 passengers and 4 crew members were killed when the plane, a Fokker F-27 belonging to the national airline, plunged into a marsh near Dhaka Airport. Officials said the plane was en route to the capital from the port city of Chittagong. The passengers included one Briton, a Japanese and 33 Bangladeshis coming from Chittagong to catch a connecting flight to the Middle East.

753-> New & Noteworthy
THE BATTLE OF DIENBIENPHU, by Jules Roy. (Carroll & Graf, $8.95.) To write ''The Battle of Dienbienphu,'' published in 1965, Jules Roy - a journalist, novelist and former French Army officer - interviewed the participants and examined the records and site of the 1954 battle that ended French power in Indochina. Our reviewer, Robert Shaplen, wrote, ''Roy relates the basic facts perceptively and brilliantly and uses his novelistic technique to examine the motives and personalities of the various participants; he makes the whole tragedy come poignantly alive.'' Mr. Shaplen added that Americans reading the book will better comprehend Asia's revolution. WINTER'S TALE, by Mark Helprin. (Pocket Books, $4.50.) Mark Helprin won the National Jewish Book Award in 1982 for ''Ellis Island and Other Stories'' and lavish praise for ''Winter's Tale,'' published in 1983. The novel focuses on a series of interconnected heroic lives, chiefly that of Peter Lake, orphan, burglar, lover, idealist, mechanic first class. Benjamin DeMott wrote in The Book Review that ''a piercing sense of the beautiful arising from narrative and emotional fantasy is everywhere alive in the novel. And because the novelist commits himself throughout to the pursuit of nourishing truths - truths of justice, hope and cheer remote from the more fashionable truths of alienation and despair - 'Winter's Tale' stands forth in its own right as restorer and comforter.'' BLACK WOMEN WRITERS AT WORK, edited by Claudia Tate. (Continuum, $9.95.) In interviews, 14 prominent authors answered Claudia Tate's questions, which centered on their being black and female and on issues of style and vision. The answers make up ''Black Women Writers at Work,'' published in 1983. In The Book Review, Anne Tyler wrote that Miss Tate's ''main concerns are the creative process and the influence that race and gender have had on her subjects' work.'' ORAL HISTORY, by Lee Smith. (Ballantine, $3.95.) In ''Oral History,'' originally published last year, Jennifer, a student, interviews residents of her Appalachian birthplace, which she left too soon for memories, and she hears tales of murder, suicide, incest and complex blood relationships. The author has won two O. Henry Awards and been compared to Faulkner, Carson McCullers and Eudora Welty. But this novel, Frederick Busch wrote in The Book Review, ''is her own book, set in her own fictive country. She is nothing less than masterly as she starts us out with ghosts and bawdry, then finishes with wild song.'' OFF BALANCE: The Real World of Ballet, by Suzanne Gordon. (McGraw-Hill, $7.95.) What goes into the performances of ballet dancers leaping, spinning and gliding across the stage? After Suzanne Gordon, a journalist, talked to dancers and choreographers at the American Ballet Theater and other places, she wrote in ''Off Balance'' that part of the answer is pain, epidemic anorexia nervosa, low pay and an onstage career that ends at 35. Her 1983 book, illustrated by the photographer Earl Dotter, confronted issues rarely raised and was considered chilling and provocative. THE CONSTANT NYMPH, by Margaret Kennedy. (Dial, $8.95.) Henry Logan Stuart wrote in The Book Review, shortly after its publication in 1924, that ''by virtue of 'The Constant Nymph' alone, Miss Kennedy . . . finds herself well to the front among novelists, men or women, of today. Its theme is the clash between two incompatible worlds, and its solution is reached through tragedy.'' The decade's best seller, the book became a play and four films. The story tells of Tessa, a 14-year- old who falls in love with a composer. His marriage to her cousin and Tessa's exile to boarding school do not daunt her constancy, with inevitable - and inexorable - results. RIGHTS ON TRIAL: The Odyssey of a People's Law yer, by Arthur Kinoy. (Harvard University, $7.95.) The cover of ''Rights on Trial'' pictures Arthur Kinoy in the grip of three United States marshals who are removing him from a House Un-American Activities Committee hearing in 1966. This autobiography of an activist lawyer and Rutgers Law School professor, first published last year, focuses on his major constitutional cases during some 40 years of practice. THE DAY OF THE OWL. EQUAL DANGER, by Leonard Sciascia. (Godine, $8.95.) These are two detective stories in one volume by Sicily's best-known novelist. ''The Day of the Owl'' won Italy's Crotone Prize. When it was published in America in 1964 as ''Mafia Vendetta,'' Anthony Boucher, our reviewer, wrote that ''the telling is clean and direct (aside from fuzzy passages obviously written with libel laws in mind), and the evocation of Sicily is economic and masterly. Sicily is the protagonist.'' ''Equal Danger,'' published in 1973 in the United States, is set in an imaginary country. The author called it ''a fable about power anywhere in the world.'' IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF JOHNSON AND BOSWELL, by Israel Shenker. (Oxford, $7.95.) ''In the Footsteps of Johnson and Boswell'' is a journey through Scotland, where Israel Shenker, a former reporter for The New York Times, lives. Jan Morris, our reviewer, wrote this Johnsonian appraisal in 1982: '' Boswell: Have you read, Sir, Mr. Israel Shenker's new book of travel, in which he follows the tour that you and I took together through the western part of Scotland in 1773? Johnson: I have, Sir, and I have read it with admiration; for while it is a foolish error to retrace one's own footsteps through life, it is instructive to pursue the journeys of our predecessors; to compare the speculations of a generation other than our own, and to observe what changes have been wrought by the passage of time and the development of human instinct.'' MAN OF STRAW, by Heinrich Mann. (Penguin, $6.95.) This work, ''Der Untertan'' in German, was one of Heinrich Mann's most famous novels. (He was also the author of ''Professor Unrat,'' on which the classic film ''The Blue Angel'' was based.) Written in 1913, ''Man of Straw'' could not be published until 1918 - after Germany had lost the war. It is a satirical portrait of an ambitious small-time politician who was, as his type later came to be labeled, an authoritarian personality. B

755-> RESTORED AID LIKELY FOR PBS
When the House of Representatives voted Tuesday to authorize restoration of the funds that the Reagan budget had taken from public broadcasting, it was a kind of manna for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The authorization of a 25 percent increase in the funds it had expected for fiscal years 1985-87 means that the corporation - assuming the Senate finalizes its passage of an equivalent measure sponsored by Senator Barry Goldwater - will receive funds for both operating and building that will take some of the sting out of the President's cuts, which stay in effect until October 1986. Nevertheless, many conservative Republicans who opposed the bill are expressing irritation at what one observer, a staff member of Representative William E. Dannemeyer, Republican of California, called the Congress's profligacy. The bill was uncontroversial in spite of the fact that it seemed to fly in the face of the White House's general policy toward public television. In 'Fragile' Condition Although public broadcasting was freed three years ago to pursue other sources of revenue in addition to its traditional ones, it was not able to compensate for the Reagan cuts, and its spokesmen have made it clear that its existence would be endangered unless the cuts were restored. Representative Timothy Wirth, Democrat of Colorado, who sponsored the House bill, said that without the extra revenue, ''public broadcasting is very fragile right now.'' ''The equipment is becoming obsolete right now,'' he said. ''It's going to be tough to keep it alive unless we get a commitment from the Congress. We're seeing money from state agencies effectively disappearing, so it's going to be hard to do. There are not a lot of exciting new sources of revenue out there.'' Mr. Wirth said he hoped that such widely acclaimed shows as ''The Lawmakers'' and ''Sesame Street'' would be saved by winter. ''It's going to be tough,'' he said. ''It's going to be hard work to get this programming back on the air.'' Plant Assets Deteriorating In recent years, public broadcast programming such as ''The Lawmakers,'' a program hosted by the Washington journalist Paul Duke, and even the seemingly unassailable ''Sesame Street'' have been threatened by the budget cuts. Also, the physical and technical plants of many of the older public broadcasting stations have gone into an unremedied decline, largely because of the Reagan cuts. In 1981, Congress cut the spending ceiling for public broadcasting from $220 million in the 1983 fiscal year to $130 million for each of the next three fiscal years. In addition to restoring some of the funds for those years, the proposed legislation would increase authorized financing for the public broadcasting corporation to $238 million in 1987, $253 million in 1988 and $270 million in 1989. The proposal has cut across party lines in both the House and the Senate.''Senator Goldwater,'' said Dale Brown, a member of Mr. Goldwater's staff who worked on the bill, ''has been in favor of public broadcasting for a long time. He feels it is one of the better means by which the American public has to get good television and radio. He feels a lot of television is not particularly worthwhile.'' Mr. Brown said Senator Goldwater was ''adamant'' on the issue. ''Over the years,'' one of Representative Wirth's staff members said, ''public broadcasting has gotten a lot of bipartisan support.'' Another of his staff members said that ''members realize there isn't one constituent group that pays attention to public television. It has a diversity of constituency.'' Letter From Stockman Nevertheless, in May of this year, David Stockman, the President's budget director, wrote a letter to Representative John Dingle, Democrat of Michigan, the chairman of the House telecommuniations subcommittee. In the letter, Mr. Stockman stated a firm White House opposition to the restoration of cuts. ''In a time of severe budgetary constraints,'' he wrote, ''I believe that budget-busting spending envisioned by HR. 5541 would not be in the best interest of the Federal Government. Consequently, the administration storngly opposes HR. 5541. Its enactment would not be in accord with the program of the President.'' But the House passed the bill without major controversy by a vote of 302 to 91, signalling, many feel, a period of safety for public broadcasting in regard to Federal financing. Mr. Wirth said that without the extra revenue, ''what has happened is that once again the Congress has reaffirmed its support for public broadcasting.'' ''The sources for funds in 1982-83 from private sources simply haven't been there,'' he said. ''If PBS is going to survive, the recommendations on alternative financing are going to have to be followed - and we're going to need a return to a strong support. By 1987, we have moved the authorization back to where it was in 1981.'' The bill would also authorize $50 million in fiscal 1985, $53 million in 1986 and $56 million in 1987 for matching grants for planning and building.

756-> A BLUE-CHIP COMPLEX
FIFTEEN years ago Albert D. Phelps Jr., a real-estate developer, began acquiring land on Route 7 in Norwalk. He paid about $850,000 for 46 acres of gas stations, used-car lots, billboards, an abandoned factory and assorted debris. It was situated just north of the juncture of Route 7 and Exits 39-40 of the Merritt Parkway and overlooked the Norwalk River. ''When everybody told me I was crazy to buy there, I knew it was right,'' he said, his prescience vindicated by the subsequent appreciation of land values. Mr. Phelps said he agreed with an axiom attributed to George Bernard Shaw, when he stated that '' 'the majority is always wrong' - at least in the real-estate business. If I exercised my option to buy a little gas station next to my property now, it would cost me $1.2 million.'' Two of a projected 14 buildings in his 50-acre Merritt 7 Corporate Park are completed and almost entirely rented. A third building in the four million square-foot, $1 billion development is under construction. While studies showed that a shopping mall would be successful in that location, and a decade ago he had plans drawn up for one, Mr. Phelps did not like the results and scrapped them. For years the land remained untouched while the Phelps Corporation continued to build shopping centers and office buildings in Florida, Westchester County, N.Y., Connecticut and other locations. Office development in Stamford and Greenwich, meanwhile, began to overflow into Norwalk and Danbury. Gradually, Mr. Phelps said he ''cleaned up the neighborhood. I knocked down the junk,'' and moved his offices to the site from the Riverdale section of the Bronx. In 1978 he determined that his Norwalk land had ''the best situation for traffic in lower Fairfield County. Route 7 was the only north-south artery connecting the work force with jobs. And of the two east-west highways, we had the Merritt Parkway, which is better than I-95 because truck traffic is prohibited.'' He began planning ''the largest and finest development in New England - perhaps in the world,'' he said. Ralph Sorley, manager of real-estate investments for the Union Carbide Pension Fund, which provided capital for the second building, pointed out that ''Phelps has done everything he said he would. Both buildings are successful. He has attracted a variety of blue-chip tenants, begun to improve the area with amenities that have people convinced that he is not just building free-standing office buildings. Other buildings nearby are only partially leased or totally vacant.'' Those amenities include a helicopter pad that will be located atop one of the office buildings, on-site car rental and limousine service, municipal bus service, a newsstand, a cafeteria, banking, full janitorial and porter services, 24-hour covered parking, jogging paths, picnic areas and a sophisticated security system. A sampling of tenants includes I.B.M., Pitney-Bowes Credit Corporation, GTE Sprint, Merrill Lynch, General Electric, Arcata Graphics Corporation, Mercedes-Benz Credit Corporation and Novo Diagnostic Systems. Rents in the two buildings average $22 a square foot. The third building will rent for about $28 a square foot. Stamford and Greenwich office space ''will always cost a bit more, catering to companies that want a downtown location,'' said Gordon Clark of the commercial division of William Pitt Real Estate. New buildings there charge an average of $30 a square foot, he said. Still to come at Merritt 7 are an on- site railroad station, which the company will build for the convenience of commuters on the existing Danbury- New York line, several restaurants, cafes and shops that will remain open at night, a travel agency, access to advanced telecommunication and information systems, and a 300-room hotel containing a health club, more restaurants, amphitheater, indoor- outdoor swimming pool, meeting and banquet facilities and racquet-ball courts. Mr. Phelps has also assumed the $1.2 million cost of improving one mile of Route 7 from the Merritt Parkway past his frontage to Grist Mill Road. He will widen it from two to four lanes and build a northbound flyover that will eliminate lefthand turnoffs into the office park. He said he is doing this because he was impatient with the amount of time the State Department of Transportation was taking to do the job. As independent-minded in construction financing as in land acquisition, Mr. Phelps has a mortgage only on the first building, negotiated when fixed rates were available. The second and third buildings were financed without mortgages in joint ventures with Union Carbide, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and Equitable Life Insurance Company. ''I prefer not to be burdened with debt service,'' said Mr. Phelps. ''We have a lot more freedom of motion in leasing. When we rent one floor the building already carries.'' Mr. Sorley said that this is ''a financing technique that is usually employed for much larger buildings. We will get a far better return than with a simple mortgage.'' Alan Sive, regional manager of real-estate investments for Metropolitan Life in New York, commented that ''Phelps has an extraordinary ability to get leases in a fairly soft market. The fact that he owned the land showed real foresight.'' A member of what he claims to be ''the oldest continuous real-estate family in North America,'' Mr. Phelps noted that his ancestors owned extensive farmlands in Essex, Old Lyme and Saybrook since the 1600's, when the first Phelps emigrated from England. ''My grandfather had a lot of sons who scattered to the four winds,'' he said. ''They became prosperous in finance and business all over the world.'' Trained by his father in the family real-estate company in New York, he opened his own office in Riverdale in the 1950's. ''Downtown New York was no place for me because I had no money,'' he said. ''My father had money but he was not about to give me any. He sent me to Stanton Military Academy in Virginia, bought me a lot of boats, took me on business trips and to meetings where I listened to the grown-ups negotiate. But I put myself through college.'' He attended Babson Institute in Wellesley, Mass., where he studied business administration.He now lives in a Greenwich condominium, sails his 45-foot ketch out of Norwalk Cove Marina, and concentrates on training the young employees who will eventually inherit major interests in his company, since he has no heirs. ''I consider myself something of a benevolent dictator,'' Mr. Phelps said. ''I expect my people to use the authority I give them in the way I direct.''

757-> Ban Is Off for U.S.C. TV
The National Collegiate Athletic Association has acknowledged that it will not try to stand in the way of the University of Southern California's efforts to put its football team on television this season. The Trojans are in the second of two years' probation imposed by the N.C.A.A. for various rules violations and, as a result, were to have been barred from televison again this season. But the N.C.A.A.'s exclusive control of college football telecasts was voided by the Supreme Court last month, and exactly how much control the organization will be allowed to exercise is a decision for a lower Federal court, in Oklahoma City, which has yet to rule. U.S.C.'s president, James Zumberge, notified the N.C.A.A. Thursday that he no longer considered the television ban in effect. Yesterday, Bill Hunt, the N.C.A.A.'s assistant director of enforcement, said in an interview that, pending the lower court's ruling, the association would not seek to enforce such a ban. But, without discussing U.S.C. specifically, he added that if the court upheld such a role for the organization, then any school under a television ban could find that the penalty will be carried over to next year.

758-> CHILDREN'S FASHIONS; GROWING UP IN STYLE
Mothers try their best to make do, but children always seem to need new clothes. Thus the search for wearable and practical clothes - with a touch of style thrown in - is a never- ending one. Last spring, the grown-up markets had a great deal of influence on children's wear, and this fall that trend is stronger than ever. Initially, children's fashion began as mere adaptations of adult clothing. Then, due to the pioneer styling of Florence Eiseman and others, clothes were designed that were uniquely for children. Today, though, there appears to be a movement back toward dressing children in clothes that suggest the adult world. One of the reasons for this is that many name designers of women's and men's wear, both here and abroad, have added children's lines - scaled-down and simplified versions of their grown-up clothes - with the same quality of design and styling that adults demand. Clothing for fall is simpler and lighter in detail and fabric. Wools and acrylic blends are popular, and cotton is now a year-round favorite. Just as in women's fashion, the influence of men's-wear tailoring is also evident. For girls, textures, tweeds, checks and plaids show up in all sizes, in trousers, jackets, dresses and sweaters. While American designers traditionally show brighter colors, this season the palette has been muted with somber grays and blacks. And winter white, impractical though it may be, appears both in sportswear and dress-up outfits. Other surprises are the thermal fabrics, usually reserved for underwear, that are used in a number of outer-wear garments and the parachute cloth that has been turned into pants, jackets and coats. Pants, for both boys and girls, appear in a variety of shapes and styles - pleated, baggy, narrow or tapered. Dresses tend to be sophisticated, intended for truly dress-up occasions. They may be made of plaid taffeta, a delightful stained-glass plaid, velveteen combined with satin, organdy or lace. A little sparkle or glitter in belts, sleeves or re-embroidered sweaters often adds additional glamour. A blue blazer and gray trousers once were enough to deck out a boy for those special times. Not today. A new snap has been added this fall, and a young man's wardrobe can range from a shawl-collared tweed suit to checked jackets that reverse to tweed sport jackets (they can also be worn by girls) to a double-breasted, glen-plaid suit.

759-> BUSH ASSERTS MONDALE FAILED AS LEADER IN THE LANCE AFFAIR
Vice President Bush opened up a new avenue of attack on Walter F. Mondale today, accusing the Democratic Presidential nominee of failed leadership in handling the departure of Bert Lance as general chairman of his campaign. He also said the Reagan Administration would consider reducing the deficit through ''revenue increases,'' while stressing that such a program would not mean raising income taxes. Mr. Mondale has said that the Administration has a ''secret plan'' to raise taxes, but did not specifically mention income taxes. Mr. Bush made the comments at an airport news conference as he arrived here for a four-day campaign swing through the West. First Comments on Lance Aides to Mr. Bush said his criticism represented the first comment by the White House on the Lance matter. President Reagan is on a working vacation. Mr. Lance was appointed by Mr. Mondale in July to serve as the campaign's general chairman but voluntarily resigned last week after nearly three weeks of criticism. Mr. Lance, the director of the Office of Management and Budget in the Carter Administration, resigned that post after charges of financial irregularities, of which he was cleared. Consistent With Reagan Mr. Bush's statement on revenues was consistent with pledges by President Reagan that he would propose no increase in individual income taxes and would veto any bill raising individual income tax rates. Mr. Reagan has stopped short in such instances of ruling out other methods of generating additional revenue. Mr. Bush said the Administration could consider some ways to generate additional revenue if other methods of lowering the deficit came up short. Asked what form of revenue increases could be imposed, he responded, ''just figure that out.'' He said there already had been revenue increases in a couple of the recent compromises reached with Congress and that if there was any increase in revenue, the Administration would demand corresponding increases in spending cuts. Mr. Bush said that in the campaign issues that have arisen since the Democratic National Convention last month, the leadership issue had received little notice but would have real impact on the voters this fall. He said there had been two recent events in which Mr. Mondale ''has once again demonstrated his inability to say no'' to special interests. He said the first came last month when, on the eve of the Democratic convention, Mr. Mondale sought to remove the national party chairman, Charles T. Manatt, and replace him with Mr. Lance. As protests mounted, Mr. Mondale instead appointed Mr. Lance as general chairman of the campaign, the position he resigned from last week. Accusing Mr. Mondale of ''caving in,'' Mr. Bush said: ''After listening to a storm of protests from a collection of Democratic special interests, Mr. Mondale had his campaign chairman fire the man he had just hired. So what does he have? He's stuck with the man he tried to fire, and has fired the man he wanted to hire.'' By contrast, the Vice President portrayed Mr. Reagan as a candidate of strong leadership.

761-> COORECTION
In an article last week on the Long Island Rail Road's electrification project in Huntington, the position of a proposed second track at the Cold Spring Harbor station was given incorrectly. The railroad plans to lay that track south of the present line. Residents near the station have requested that the railroad construct the track on the north side.

762-> BLACK CHURCH IS RECLAIMING SOCIAL GOSPEL
There are times when the Allen Church in Jamaica, Queens, might seem more like a social-service organization than a house of worship. In any given week its activities might include sponsoring a break- dance contest, serving hot lunches to the elderly or evicting drug pushers from a local tenement. The church, of course, also holds Sunday worship services, concerts of gospel music and Bible classes, but church leaders believe that their religious role is not complete without the social dimension. ''It doesn't do much good to talk about salvation without asking the question, 'What are we saving people for?' '' said the pastor of the church, the Rev. Floyd H. Flake. Concern for the community is a long tradition in black churches, but by most accounts the Allen Church is one of the most successful in the city in spurring a revival in a blighted area. Filling Civil-Rights Gap Dr. Gayraud S. Wilmore of the New York Theological Seminary in Manhattan, who for years has studied the development of the black church, said the Allen Church represented the re- emergence of the black church from a period during the 1960's and 70's when it was eclipsed by the nation's civil- rights organizations. ''The church is regaining its stature in the black community,'' Dr. Wilmore said. ''The Reagan years have helped to blunt the cutting edge of the black civil-rights organizations. Churches are moving in to fill the gap.'' In the last eight years the Allen Church has completed, with Federal assistance, an $11 million housing complex for the elderly, purchased 10 dilapidated stores for rehabilitation at a cost of $250,000, provided subsidies of $2,500 to dozens of individual home owners and, without any government aid, built a $3.8 million elementary school. In that time the membership of the church, at 111-54 Merrick Boulevard in the southern part of the Jamaica section, has doubled to 3,200 members and the church's annual budget has quadrupled to more than $1 million. New Style of Ministry ''A lot of folk with a little bit put it all together,'' said the 39-year-old Mr. Flake, who was dean of students and dean of the chapel at Boston University before becoming pastor of the Allen Church in 1976. Dr. Wilmore, dean of the master of divinity program at the seminary, said that much of the credit for the success of the Allen church should go to its pastor. ''What Reverend Flake represents is a new style of ministry on the part of younger, well-trained black pastors,'' Dr. Wilmore said. ''Seminaries are now producing men and women who have excellent training not only in preaching, but in organization, community development and business practices.'' Dr. Wilmore added that he often sent students from the seminary to Jamaica to see what the Allen Church had accomplished. The church has succeeded in an area that has all the problems of a depressed community. The crime rate is high and the school attendance rate low. Along side streets private frame houses have been abandoned and are boarded up, and on main throughfares storefronts have become after- hours social clubs and havens for illegal gambling and illicit drug operations. 'We've Come Full Circle' The Allen Church is a congregation of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, which has two million members nationwide. The denomination was started in 1816 by the Rev. Richard Allen, who broke away from the Methodist Church as a protest against segregation. The Allen Church in Jamaica was established in 1834, just 18 years after the founding of the denomination. Mr. Flake said there was a certain irony in the church's decision two years ago to establish its own school. Soon after the founding of the church 150 years ago, he said, the church began a school because the public schools of the time were not open to black children. ''We've come full circle,'' he said. The school was revived, Mr. Flake said, because parents felt that their children were being ''miseducated'' in the city schools. Today there are 450 students in seven grades at the modern three- story Allen Christian School, one block from the church. While the church received Federal funds to help it build housing for the elderly and operate neighborhood rehabilitation programs, it had to raise money for the school from local contributions. Store Rental Project Planned Across Merrick Boulevard from the school is a row of shabby storefronts that have been used by drug pushers and illegal numbers operations, according to Mr. Flake. The church bought the property and plans to rehabilitate it with a $100,000 grant from the Port Authority of New York and New Jerseyas part of a program to aid communities near the port agency's airports. The church hopes to rent the stores to reputable business operators. Three blocks from the stores is the Allen Senior Citizen Housing Complex, where some 420 people live and 225 other local elderly residents get hot lunches daily. The other day Helen E. Jackson, who at 94 is the oldest member of the Allen Church, was having a turkey lunch at the center with a group of friends. Miss Jackson said that when she was growing up in Jamaica, the Allen Church was the center of her life. ''There were no other outlets,'' she said. ''There were no movies, no other social life. Everything was in the church.'' After raising the two children of her sister and retiring from a nursing career, she said that the church was once again the focal point. ''A church is not just a building,'' Mr. Flake said. ''It's a community. How people live in that community determines the success of the church.''

763-> Miss Bidart, J. M. Harris Are Married
Cynthia Anne Bidart, a daughter of Nancy Lion Bidart of Hemet, Calif., and Leonard Bidart of Winnemucca, Nev., was married yesterday to Jonathan Miller Harris in an ecumenical service in the chapel of St. George's School in Newport, R.I. The Rev. George E. Andrews 2d, headmaster of the school and an Episcopal priest, and the Rev. Mario Costa, a Roman Catholic priest, officiated. The bridegroom, who is a son of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Pratt Upham Harris Jr. of Brookville, L.I., and Holderness, N.H., was attended by his twin, Lieut. Comdr. Peter Webster Harris, U.S.N., and another brother, Henry P. U. Harris 3d. Mrs. Steven Nightingale and Mrs. John F. Seccombe attended their sister. The bride, a graduate of the University of Idaho, studied at Cambridge University, as did her husband. Her mother is a psychotherapist in Palm Springs, Calif., and her father raises beef cattle on the Leonard Creek Ranch. Mr. Harris, who teaches English and is dean of students at St. George's School, graduated from the Green Vale School, St. Mark's School and Harvard College. He served as a lieutenant in the Marine Corps. His father is the vice chairman of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company and president of the board of managers of the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York. His mother, the former Mary Jeanne Johnston, serves on the board of trustees of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in Cold Spring Harbor, L.I. The bridegroom is a grandson of Henry Pratt Upham Harris of Brookville, former chairman of Harris, Upham & Company, which was founded by the bridegroom's great- grandfather, John F. Harris of New York.

764-> CONTINUING EDUCATION; AT N.Y.U., 50 YEARS OF ADULT FARE
BEFORE New York University held classes for full-time students during the day, it was offering evening lectures for adults. But it was not until 1934, 103 years after the university was founded, that it organized those adult classes into the New York University School of Continuing Education. This year the school celebrates 50 years of teaching adults, and in that first half-century it has grown from 6,000 students in 200 courses to more than 50,000 in 2,000 courses, making it the largest program of its kind in a private university. Now there are professional tax and real-estate seminars, midday classes at a midtown center on West 42d Street and programs for students to earn associate and bachelor's degrees. ''The notion that there are times in our lives when we go to school and times in our lives when we don't is blurring,'' said Harvey J. Stedman, the school's dean. ''For many adults, particularly in large urban environments, learning has become a part of life.'' The school has benefited from a national trend in which more adults return to school either for personal reasons or to advance their careers. For example, from 1972 to 1983 enrollment at the School of Continuing Education increased 30 percent. One professor who has taught there since the early 1950's, Herbert C. Jaffa, said that in his nearly 30 years the school's growth has made it seem less like a series of classes and more like a part of the university. ''If I were to judge the ambiance now,'' he said, ''continuing education is part of the air you breathe at Washington Square.'' ''In the early years,'' Mr. Jaffa added, ''the school began to sell the idea that learning should never end. You don't have to sell continuing education anymore.'' In 1974, on the school's 40th anniversary, Dean Russell F.W. Smith said the university had begun by offering evening lectures before its daytime curriculum was established because of the founders' philosophy that the university should ''diffuse knowledge and render it more accessible to the community at large.'' Dean Stedman believes that the school has remained popular because it has kept itself current, offering courses that draw adults to its classrooms. ''This is not an enterprise in which the content leads the student, but the student leads the content,'' he said. ''It's student or community demand that drives the curriculum.'' Likewise, he said, it is the students who will determine the direction that the School of Continuing Education will take. ''There are a lot of adults who are interested in pursuing liberal arts,'' he said. ''I think you are going to see the emergence of more structured liberal- arts courses.'' During the Depression the school trained social workers, housing managers and labor leaders to staff New Deal programs. During World War II it trained people in technology, languages and industrial management. And after the war it taught languages to the waves of new immigrants and helped returning veterans move back into the labor market. ''As an enterprise,'' Dean Stedman said, ''continuing education is one of the ways higher education responds to community needs. If you read through the 50 years of bulletins, you see a barometer of issues.'' In 1944, for example, the school offered a course called ''Postwar Overseas Transportation,'' in which experts would discuss ''significant postwar developments in America's system of maritime and aerial transportation and port facilities.'' There were also courses offered whose orientation seems archaic today. In 1949, a section of the catalogue called ''Special Courses for Women'' offered ''Managing Personal Funds'' to ''help those women who are attempting to solve their investment problems as well as those who face frankly the fact that the time may come when they must assume full responsibility.'' Some courses were offered one year and never offered again, like one in 1956 that taught an international language called ''Interlingua.'' The course description read, ''Iste curso es offerite pro studentes qui desira acquirer complete maestria active e passive de interlingua. . . .'' Other courses were offered year after year. For example, a women's law class, which is still offered today, was first offered in the 1890's, at a time when the university was moving all but its law school from Washington Square to a Bronx campus. Because of an outcry from many people over the relocation, especially from teachers who wanted educational noncredit courses, the university established the Division of Extra-Mural Instruction at Washington Square to offer such instruction. In his 1974 speech, Dean Smith recalled that the Division of Extra-Mural Instruction had spawned a series of other schools - of pedagogy and of commerce and the graduate schools of business administration, public administration and social work. ''It was a home,'' Mr. Smith said, ''but not yet a school.'' IN that speech, he said that the Division of Extra- Mural Instruction - renamed the University Extension Division in 1926 - continued to offer noncredit courses until 1934. The university's trustees then accepted a suggestion from the director of the extension, Paul McGhee, to merge it with the Institute of Education, an off-campus credit-course program. The result of the merger was the Division of General Education, later named the School of Continuing Education. Mr. McGhee asked Mr. Jaffa in the 1950's to become his assistant, and later, in the early 60's, to begin developing a degree program for the Continuing Education School, which previously did not offer course programs that led to a degree. The degree program started in 1964, the year Mr. McGhee died. ''The whole idea in the first program,'' Mr. Jaffa said, ''was to develop courses primarily for adults, actually starting from scratch by asking oneself what should an adult know about biology. In the hiring of faculty, we wanted people who only wanted to work with adults.'' The students these faculty members taught, Mr. Jaffa said, seemed older then. ''The youngest might have been 30 and as old as in their 60's,'' he said. In a 1982 study, about half the Continuing Education students were between 26 and 35, and 82 percent were between 22 and 45. Dean Stedman said that the students now seemed to be more serious in what and how they studied. ''There's more interest today in structured programs,'' he said. More of the students' tuitions are paid by their employers, unions or Federal, state and local grants. And, he said, the students themselves seem more ''consumer-conscious'' about the courses they are taking, who is teaching and how the courses will help them. ''As I look at our group, I am impressed by the breadth of individuals who study with us,'' he said. ''There are a large number of immigrants, but the vast majority are native-born. There are many trying to build an economic foundation and others who are well established.'' In addition, he said, there is an increase in interest in ''colleagueship'' and friendship. ''It is in part about a search for like-mindedness.''

765-> A COMMANDING VOICE FOR THE MILITARY
Richard Halloran, a member of The Times's Washington bureau, covers military affairs. IT IS A POINT OF SATISFACTION FOR Gen. John W. Vessey Jr. that he has started to accomplish the task he set for the nation's military leaders two years ago when he became Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff: ''To give the President and Secretary of Defense military advice before they know they need it.'' Since then, General Vessey and the chiefs have taken the initiative in counseling President Reagan and Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger on current military operations, the needs of the armed forces in the 1990's and national defense in the 21st century. In so doing, General Vessey has emerged as the principal military adviser to the Administration in fact as well as in law. He has made the present Joint Chiefs - Army Gen. John A. Wickham Jr., Air Force Gen. Charles A. Gabriel, Marine Corps Gen. P.X. Kelley and Navy Adm. James D. Watkins - more influential than any of their predecessors in 20 years. With them, General Vessey has established new relations with the President and the Secretary of Defense, started breaking down barriers to interservice cooperation, and drawn field commanders into closer contact with Washington. That has been achieved, White House and Pentagon officials point out, with the blessing of the President and Mr. Weinberger, who have been receptive to military advice in their effort to ''rearm America.'' ''This Administration,'' said one official, ''wants to listen.'' Beyond that, General Vessey, unlike most of his predecessors, has taken control of military operations under an agreement with Mr. Weinberger. Although the Chairman is not authorized by law to command forces, General Vessey has asserted that he and other commanders should control military operations once strategy has been decided by the President. Thus, when the President decided to invade Grenada, General Vessey insisted that the military, not the White House, run the operation. Despite his growing stature, General Vessey is probably less well known to the American public than almost any of his predecessors. The general has sought what he calls ''effective anonymity.'' He has assiduously shunned publicity, and believes that the armed forces are better off if they are out of the public eye. That attitude, as well as a perceived need for operational security, was behind the ban on news coverage of the Grenada invasion, for example. In particular, General Vessey fervently wishes to prevent his post from being politicized and thus will not permit himself to become involved in the election campaign this year. The Democrats, whose nominating convention opens in San Francisco tomorrow, can be expected to try to exploit fears that President Reagan is prone to military ventures overseas. But that is a battle, say officers around General Vessey, that Mr. Reagan and his political allies must fight themselves. The military advice of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on immediate issues has been marked by restraint. General Vessey and the chiefs have urged the President to be wary of deploying American forces to the Persian Gulf. They have proposed limiting the American military presence in Central America to maneuvers. In 1983, they advised against sending the Marines to Lebanon and were ahead of the Administration in urging that they be withdrawn. For the longer run, General Vessey has said, ''I continually tell the Secretary of Defense and the President that they ought to spend more for strategic mobility,'' although American air and sea transport is the world's best. The chiefs have won approval for plans to revise operational areas for the four service's combat commands. They have refined doctrines for joint operations, commando operations, psychological warfare and electronic warfare. The Joint Chiefs have told Mr. Weinberger that while enlistments are going well now, a shrinking pool of 18-year-olds will make recruiting difficult by 1990. They have urged a push on ''smart weapons'' and other high technology. Perhaps most vividly, the Joint Chiefs told President Reagan last year it might be possible in the 21st century for the United States to defend itself against nuclear missiles, thus removing the need to rely on threats of retaliation to deter attack. Both the chiefs and Pentagon technicians were surprised, however, when Mr. Reagan announced that goal in visionary terms in his ''Star Wars'' speech. The proposal touched off a dispute in which some reputable scientists asserted that the plan was not feasible. But General Vessey and the chiefs have not always had their way. They recommended, in a 3-2 vote, against the ''dense pack'' base for MX nuclear missiles and were overruled. Their views were not sought when the President decided last year that military pay raises must be forgone in the name of fiscal constraint. Perhaps most far-reaching, the chiefs have failed to persuade the Administration that its global military strategy is too ambitious. The Administration wants a military force able to meet any contingency - from insurgency in Central America to an Iranian attempt to halt the flow of oil from the Persian Gulf to a Soviet invasion of Western Europe with conventional arms to protracted nuclear war. The chiefs have warned the Administration that such a capability would require a military budget 50 percent greater, or $750 billion more, than it has planned. Nor has General Vessey, who has just begun the second of the pair of two-year terms permitted by law, won universal applause. Some Republican political operatives in the White House and on Capitol Hill have complained that he has not been visible enough in supporting the Administration's military budget. The Navy, which has traditionally opposed giving an officer from another service control of naval forces, has chafed under the Army general's attempts to tighten the reins. IN SOME RESPECTS, JOHN WILLIAM VESSEY JR, of Crow Wing County, Minn., seems a surprising choice to be the nation's top soldier. Unlike his predecessors, he is not a graduate of West Point or Annapolis, but won his commission on the battlefield during World War II. Nor was he a ''fastburner'' who won swift promotion. He was 41 years old when he received a degree from the University of Maryland after struggling in night school, and 45 when he won the Distinguished Service Cross, the Army's second-highest decoration, usually awarded to aggressive young officers. He completed helicopter school at 48, when other students were his son's age, and got his first star as a brigadier general in his 27th year of commissioned service, several years later than most. But General Vessey, the last of the chiefs to have fought in World War II, is a late bloomer. In only five and a half years, he was promoted to four-star general - his reward, Army officers said, for superb leadership, skilled planning and an ability to inspire confidence at the highest levels. The general has spent much of his career commanding combat soldiers, and is known as a ''grunt's general.'' He is an unassuming officer, entitled to wear seven rows of battle decorations and campaign ribbons but usually seen with one. Instead of taking a staff car to a football game, he dons civilian clothes and rides the subway. That, along with his reputation for quiet team playing, was among the reasons President Reagan picked General Vessey, White House officials said. ''The President didn't want a flamboyant MacArthur,'' said one official. Although the general is 11 years younger than the President, he shares Mr. Reagan's belief in old-fashioned virtues. They are Middle Westerners who came of age during the Depression and the patriotic years of World War II. ''The President,'' the official said, ''is just very comfortable with Jack Vessey.'' The general is plain-spoken. He says ''resource- constrained environment'' are ''fancy Pentagon words that mean there isn't enough money to go around.'' He told a college audience: ''From my own experience, I can tell you, more has been screwed up on the battlefield and misunderstood in the Pentagon because of a lack of understanding of the English language than any other single factor.'' General Vessey holds strong religious convictions. He is active in the Lutheran Church and once considered leaving the Army to become a minister. He spends a few minutes each day reading the Bible, and electrified a National Prayer Breakfast last year with a moving talk on enlisting in the army of the Lord. At the age of 62, General Vessey keeps fit with running and handball, hardly drinks or smokes and seldom utters a swear word. He likes to tell stories about Scandinavians in Minnesota but was cautioned by a minister that ethnic jokes were unbecoming. So now he tells jokes about the two ancient Hittites - one named Ole, the other Sven. Beneath General Vessey's homespun air, however, is a cool, determined officer with self-confidence bred of years in command. ''Jack Vessey likes to play the simple soldier,'' says an official, ''but don't be fooled. He is a tough, shrewd man.'' General Vessey is secretive, and has mastered bureaucratic politics. ''He knows how to get a paper tabled at the four-star level, what the machinations are and what gates you have to go through to have it come out in a predictable way,'' said an officer. The general also knows when to set aside a paper. ''He realizes,'' the officer said, ''that he who controls the agenda controls the action.'' On the other hand, General Vessey, having served mostly away from Washington, seems ill at ease in the political arena and has shown little interest in explaining his views on defense issues to the American public. He speaks to military gatherings and church groups, but not to audiences that might be hostile. He rarely holds news conferences or appears on television. His testimony before Congress tends to be bland, and he seems taken aback when something he has said stirs dispute. ''We have had a lot of famous generals who have been in the public eye, and I think rightfully so - MacArthur, Eisenhower, Bradley,'' General Vessey said during a rare interview in his comfortable but unpretentious Pentagon office. ''But I am not in that category.'' He feels he can accomplish more without public attention. ''They don't need to see me. What they want me to do is to make sure that the armed forces of the United States are as effective as we can make them.'' N 1939, JACK VESSEY WROTE A HIGHschool essay on ''The Evils of War,'' then fibbed about his age to join the Minnesota National Guard just before his 17th birthday when the minimum age was 18. He enlisted for several reasons - the Depression, friends who had fought in the Spanish Civil War, the storm clouds gathering in Europe. ''But it wasn't any great idealistic thing,'' he says. ''I guess it was probably more an opportunity to wear high leather boots and ride a motorcycle.'' Called to active duty, he fought in the 34th Division's artillery in Tunisia and Italy. By 1944, he was first sergeant of an artillery battery on the Anzio beachhead. On May 6, he and two other sergeants were promoted to second lieutenant, which meant becoming forward observers. Several days later, he said, ''one was dead and the other was seriously wounded.'' After the war, Lieutenant Vessey married Avis C. Funk from Minnesota and settled down to troop duty, military schools and staff jobs. He missed the Korean War, having been sent to Germany, and thought of leaving the Army ''to do the Lord's work.'' But he was dissuaded by a friend who argued that he could do the Lord's work by soldiering. ''In his view,'' General Vessey says, ''I was a far better soldier than I would ever be as a pastor.'' Lieutenant Colonel Vessey went to Vietnam in 1966 to serve in the 25th Division's artillery. There he won the Distinguished Service Cross as commander of a battalion that was hit by five battalions of North Vietnamese regulars. The enemy got so close that Colonel Vessey and a sergeant major manned a howitzer, depressed the gun barrel and fired point-blank to drive off the attackers. When he later learned to fly helicopters, he was 15 years older than anyone in the class. ''But I was the first to solo,'' he says, ''and there were a lot of guys who would have dropped out but said: 'If that old fogy can do it, we can do it.' I think it was absolutely the most fun I ever had in my life. It was like drinking out of the fountain of youth.'' Then came promotion to brigadier general in 1971 and command of a unit in Thailand that supported anti-Communist tribes in Laos. For that he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal, the Army's highest noncombat decoration. In 1974, as a major general, he led the Fourth Division in Colorado out of what one officer called ''chaos and disaster'' in the undisciplined early days of the volunteer army. As a lieutenant general, he was Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans, the No. 3 post on the Army staff. There, General Vessey's career became linked with that of his deputy, Maj. Gen. Edward C. Meyer. The differences between them were striking. General Meyer was seven years younger, a West Pointer and a fast-rising star nicknamed ''Shy'' the way a chubby man might be called ''Slim.'' When Vessey was promoted to full general in 1976 and assigned to command United States forces in Korea, General Meyer succeeded him in the Pentagon. In Korea, General Vessey was a skilled operator in a delicate political situation. He learned Korean, worked well with Korean officers, won the respect of Air Force and Navy officers under his command and got along with the American Embassy. But he stubbed his toe with President Carter when Mr. Carter announced that he intended to withdraw American ground forces from Korea in five years. General Vessey protested, but kept his disagreement inside the Government. Several months later, however, Maj. Gen. John K. Singlaub, the chief of staff under General Vessey's command, criticized Mr. Carter's decision publicly, asserting: ''If we withdraw our ground s orces on the schedule suggested, it will lead to war.'' An angry President summoned General Singlaub to the White House and relieved him. Even so, General Vessey continued to oppose the President's policy. In 1978, the Army produced new intelligence placing North Korea's troop strength at 600,000, 25 percent above the previous estimate. When Mr. Carter visited South Korea in 1979, General Vessey urged him to set aside the pullout plan. Within a few weeks, the White House said the withdrawal had been ''suspended.'' Later that summer, President Carter picked General Vessey's former deputy, General Meyer, a bright, energetic young officer junior to 18 generals and lieutenant generals, to be the Army's new Chief of Staff. The Army, a carefully ordered, rank-conscious society, was stunned. Then, in a move almost as stunning, General Meyer asked General Vessey to be Vice Chief of Staff. General Meyer says he wanted ''to balance my youth with his experience.'' He also wanted to show other senior officers that he would avoid disruptions. General Vessey agreed, explaining: '' 'Shy' Meyer wasn't the only one who talked to me at that time and asked me to do it. But we had worked together before. We think enough alike so that we don't have to spend a lot of time talking to each other about what needs to be done, or arguing. I knew I could work with Shy Meyer, and it just seemed like the right thing to do.'' For the three years as Vice Chief of Staff, General Vessey never showed rancor, never upstaged General Meyer and often saved his boss from making mistakes. General Meyer says that General Vessey was ''selfless.'' When Air Force Gen. David C. Jones was about to retire as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs in 1982, Generals Jones and Meyer caught the eye of the Reagan White House by writing articles recommending that the Chairman be given greater authority. ''That,'' said an official, ''pointed away from the military bureaucrat or technocrat and toward somebody identified as an old soldier, an old salt, a silk-scarved flyer.'' The White House found General Vessey getting a steady stream of recommendations. Among his strongest advocates was General Meyer. In March 1982, President Reagan picked General Vessey. The general was surprised; he had planned to retire and had begun building a house in Minnesota. When he told his wife, she teased him: ''You lied about your age to get into the Army, and now God is punishing you.'' That June, at the White House ceremony to swear in the new chairman, an elderly retired major general, Charles C. Bolte, drew himself to attention to salute General Vessey. Thirty-eight years before, General Bolte had been Sergeant Vessey's commanding general on the Anzio beachhead. At that point, the Joint Chiefs may have been less influential than at any time since they were organized in 1947. After World War II, President Truman presided over demobilization, then set strategy for the Korean War with civilian advisers. President Eisenhower was his own Secretary of Defense, and often ignored the Joint Chiefs. But President Kennedy brought Gen. Maxwell D. Taylor, who had been Army Chief of Staff, out of retirement to be Chairman, and sought his advice. President Johnson, on the other hand, ran the Vietnam War from the White House. President Nixon distrusted military officers as he pursued detente. President Ford lacked time to effect a military policy. President Carter ignored military matters until near the end of his Presidency. During his first year, President Reagan left military affairs to Mr. Weinberger. But in early 1982, the Administration went through a time of ferment on military policy. It was during that shake-up that General Vessey was appointed Chairman, which gave him a clean slate on which to write. In his first meeting with the chiefs, General Vessey said he wanted them to produce timely advice by nurturing three sets of relationships - between themselves and the President and Secretary of Defense; among themselves, and between the chiefs and commanders of the operational commands. ''In the past,'' General Vessey says, ''the relationship of the chiefs to the President at times had been only through the Secretary of Defense, except for annual potted-palm operations,'' meaning formal receptions. Thus, he says, ''we needed to make it known to both the President and the Secretary of Defense that we thought the relationship needed tending.'' General Vessey persuaded the President to meet the chiefs every two or three months, more than other chiefs have met with other Presidents. At those meetings, General Vessey says, the chiefs give the President their ''general philosophy on how to defend the nation.'' Said an official: ''Those meetings give Jack Vessey a chance to prove his mettle in a way that is different from the past.'' It has been, perhaps, even more important for General Vessey and the chiefs to revitalize communication with the Secretary of Defense. They meet weekly with Mr. Weinberger and a few top defense officials without the ''straphangers'' who populate most Pentagon meetings. General Vessey says: ''We decided we needed to make those important meetings, that we and the Secretary should agree in advance on the agenda and prepare ourselves personally and give him the opportunity to prepare personally.'' In addition, the general and the Secretary talk once a day. General Vessey says he and Mr. Weinberger have agreed that ''he and I, not his staff or the joint staff, will argue out the issues between us.'' In public they address each other as ''Mr. Secretary'' and ''General,'' but in private it's ''Cap'' and ''Jack.'' Among the chiefs, General Vessey is a firm but fatherly squad leader. At the start, he suggested that they themselves find ways to be more effective. ''We wanted to cut the staff theologians out of the pattern,'' he says. ''We didn't even include the Vice Chiefs. We agreed that we were the ones designated by law to take up the job, so we and we alone had to do it.'' General Vessey has erased the pecking order among the chiefs. Instead of having the next senior officer act as Chairman when General Vessey is away from Washington, he has asked each chief to take a turn as Acting Chairman for three months of the year. Thus all have a chance to meet with the Secretary and the National Security Council. The chiefs have been plagued for years by arguments over service missions, assignments for senior officers and funds. General Vessey, however, has fostered agreements between the Navy and the Air Force, and between the Army and the Air Force, on combat coordination. Those agreements fall far short of resolving underlying issues, but General Vessey says ''we have gotten to the point where we can wrestle with the nation's problems despite the constant charge of interservice bickering.'' During the Memorial Day ceremony in May in which the Unknown Soldier of the Vietnam War was buried in Arlington Cemetery, General Vessey asked the chiefs to walk rather than ride in the parade. Later, with a twinkle, he said: ''We marched all the way from the Capitol to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier - and stayed in step the whole way.'' Legally, neither General Vessey nor the chiefs command forces. In practice, they translate national strategy into battle plans for field commanders to execute. When he became Chairman, General Vessey received authority over those operations. ''It was an oral directive given me by Mr. Weinberger when I assumed my duties,'' he told Congress. Early in his tenure, General Vessey wanted each command's war plans, which he thought outdated, to be rewritten. He told the chiefs: ''We could blame the Congress if the defense budget was too low; we could blame the parents and the educators if the recruits could not be trained easily; we could blame the defense contractors if they didn't produce good equipment; but if our contingency plans were no good, it was our fault and ours alone.'' Those contingency plans, which are highly perishable because situations change so quickly, cover potential operations in Central America, the Persian Gulf, Korea and Western Europe. For the future, General Vessey has proposed that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs be placed in the chain of command so that he could issue orders directly. As it stands, he has authority to issue an order only in the name of the Secretary of Defense. Congress is considering legislation to codify his agreement with Mr. Weinberger giving him operational control of combat forces. In justifying the proposal, General Vessey told Congress: ''In the event of war, the Secretary of Defense would not be able to focus on the daily operational decisions he has to address. We see where the Chairman would do much of that, referring the larger matters, such as national strategy and policy, to our civilian leadership.'' In his 45 years of service, General Vessey has arrived at several basic ideas on military power. ''We live at a time when we all fear greatly the consequences of war,'' he says, ''yet we recognize that we really don't know any other way to prevent war and/or political blackmail or persecution other than to have a big arsenal of military power. But if we think that military power is the supreme power, we are kidding ourselves. We see every day the limits of military power in solving problems in the world.'' On the other hand, he says, ''Weakness is provocative.'' In a talk to soldiers at Schofield Barracks in Hawaii, he said: ''Our strategy is one of preventing war by making it self-evident to our enemies that they're going to get their clocks cleaned if they start one.'' Discussing strategy before an audience of sergeants major at Fort Bliss in Texas, he said: ''It is also designed to restore peace - or what in Washington the wordmongers call 'restoring peace on favorable terms.' Now, that means to me, in soldier language, that we win the war.'' Among the legacies of Vietnam, many officers have said, is a conviction that political leaders must define objectives before putting soldiers at risk. General Vessey agrees. In a talk last year, he said: ''Don't send military forces off to do anything unless you know what it is clearly that you want done. I am absolutely, unalterably opposed to risking American lives for some phony sort of military and political objectives that we don't understand.'' Replying to a letter from Andrew Metropolis, a high-school history teacher in Peabody, Mass., the general said: ''My most difficult decisions all revolved around ordering people to do something in combat when I was not completely confident about the prospects for success.'' Thus, he said, ''a military leader should not commit the forces under his charge lightly.'' General Vessey has also given much thought to possible conflict between his military profession and his religious convictions. Asked about that, he said: ''Well, that's a question with which I have wrestled more than a little bit. I'm a Christian. I guess if we examined it, I might call myself an existentialist Christian. It seems to me that the Lord has given us a world, the only world we've got, and we have to deal with that world the way it is. There are two primary relationships that count - our relationship with the Lord and our relationship with our fellow men. ''As I look at it, it would be as immoral for me not to be ready to protect my fellow citizens as it would be to use violence to protect them. I would much rather not use violence, but we live in a violent world. ''Some people say that golf was invented for the entertainment of the rich. I tell them that God invented golf to teach us something about life. He may forgive your sins but he doesn't give you mulligans,'' a chance at a second drive after a poor shot. ''The ball is where it lies,'' he said. ''You are where you are. And it seems to me that where we are, there really isn't any substitute we can see right now.''

766-> Ratings Point Revised
Until this week, a ratings point counted for - according to the A. C. Nielsen Company - 1 percent of the 83.8 million households in the United States with television sets. No longer: from today on, a ratings point, according to the same company, will represent 1 percent of the 84.9 million households in the United States with television sets. That means, when a viewer notices his favorite series is earning a 10.0 rating, that it is being watched in 8.49 million households, not by 8.49 million people. The Nielsen Company says there are an average of 2.63 persons per American household.

767-> AIR FORCES'S ALASKA PILOTS AWAIT CALL TO INTERCEPT SOVIET CRAFT GALENA AIR FORCE STATION, Alaska (AP) - When Capt. Billy Bob Wimberly's F-15 jet fighter shrieks off the runway at this tiny air base near the Yukon River, he knows that within minutes he may be eye to eye with a Soviet military pilot.
Captain Wimberly, a taciturn 30- year-old from Muleshoe, Tex., has intercepted Soviet aircraft heading toward Alaska three times in 13 months in international airspace over Arctic waters. ''It's exciting,'' he said. ''It's a culmination of all our training.'' Another flier, Capt. J. J. Jackson, has not yet crossed paths with a Soviet aircraft in several months in Alaska. ''You sit and wait for something to happen,'' he said. ''You get real keyed up just waiting.'' The two Air Force captains are among two dozen F-15 pilots who rotate in pairs between this ramshackle facility in interior Alaska and Elmendorf Air Force Base in Anchorage. They draw seven-day stints in tiny quarters 100 yards from the Galena runway. Waiting for the Alarm They watch television, read, study, eat and sleep. They wait for the claxon to sound an alert that radar has picked up aircraft heading east toward Alaska from the direction of the Soviet Union mainland, 450 miles from Galena. When the horn blares, the men scramble into their flight suits, slide down a pole and sprint for their slate- gray airplanes, housed next door in hangars. The Air Force will not say how long it takes the pilots to intercept Soviet planes. But the F-15's can fly at more than 1,800 miles an hour, so it is a matter of minutes until the planes reach their targets, officials say. ''We are the top cover for America,'' says Col. Wilford Abbott, commander of the 21st Tactical Fighter Wing, to which Captain Wimberly and his colleagues belong. Colonel Abbott commands the forward base at Galena, about 275 miles west of Fairbanks, and another forward base at King Salmon, on the Alaska Peninsula about 300 miles southwest of Anchorage. The Air Force relies on pilots at these bases to check out unidentified aircraft over international waters from the Arctic Ocean to the north and the Pacific Ocean to the west. Some Wave, Some Don't When the pilots, working in pairs, intercept Soviet planes, one stays back to provide cover while the other moves to within 500 feet of the Soviet craft. ''Some of the pilots wave,'' Captain Wimberley said. ''I don't.'' The pilots take pictures with hand- held cameras, talk into tape recorders to describe the Soviet aircraft and look for any sort of detail of military interest, says Capt. Jay DeFrank, of the Elmendorf public affairs office. Presumably, Captain DeFrank says, the Russians are also checking out their United States counterparts. ''We are not going to defeat a Soviet invasion with these four airplanes, but we are going to provide warning,'' Colonel Abbott says from his office at Elmendorf. On his coffee table is a book titled ''Soviet Aerospace Handbook.'' 'Hours of Boredom' The colonel, who spent six and a half years as a prisoner of war after he was shot down over North Vietnam in 1966, says his pilots at the two forward facilities suffer ''hours and hours of boredom punctuated with an hour or two of adrenalin.'' The Air Force says it has intercepted Soviet aircraft over international air space 78 times from 1976 through mid- May of this year. The aircraft are usually bombers and reconnaissance planes, said Col. Charles D. Bozzuto, deputy commander for the 21st Wing's flying operations. The Air Force says Soviet aircraft have breached United States airspace, which begins three miles off the Alaska coast, six or seven times since 1961. Although it never knows for certain why Soviet planes are heading for Alaska, the Air Force says one obvious reason is to test American responses. Sometimes the Russians are simply checking ice conditions in the Bering and Chukchi seas for the Soviet Navy, Colonel Buzzuto said. Ups and Downs of Activity There is no pattern to Soviet flights toward Alaska, he said. ''We can go for months with no activity and then have a lot of it over a short period of time,'' he added. According to the Air Force, there were 43 intercepts from 1976 through 1979, but only 35 from 1980 through mid- May of this year. There were five in 1983 and two so far this year. After the Russians downed a South Korean airliner last September after it strayed into Soviet airspace, ''there was no activity for a long time, three or four months,'' Colonel Bozzuto said. ''We don't know why. Maybe they were nervous about what we might do.''

768-> OFFICERS TRADE SHOTS; 1 WOUNDED
A police officer was shot in the hand yesterday when he and two other officers mistakenly exchanged gunfire during a search for a purse snatcher in an abandoned Bronx apartment building, a police spokesman said. The injured officer, identified as 25- year-old Walter Lopez of the 42d Precinct anticrime patrol, was taken to Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center where he was admitted and listed in good condition, according to a police spokesman, Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell. The incident began late yesterday afternoon, Sergeant O'Donnell said, when Officer Frank Dragone, assigned to a foot patrol in the Morrisania section, pursued the suspect in the robbery of a woman's purse into the abandoned building at 1288 Hoe Avenue. A short time later two plainclothes officers assigned to the anticrime patrol entered the building from the rear in search of the suspect, Sergeant O'Donnell said. When the officers ''came upon each other'' in the building, Sergeant O'Donnell said, Officer Dragone fired two shots. One of the bullets glanced off Officer Lopez's bulletproof vest and hit him in the thumb. The anticrime officers fired two shots in return, Sergeant O'Donnell said, missing Officer Dragone. ''This type of incident,'' Sgt. O'Donnell said, ''happens very rarely.''

Dali's Condition Weak Despite Skin Grafts BARCELONA, Spain, Sept. 7 (AP) - Doctors successfully covered Salvador Dali's burns with skin grafts in six hours of surgery today, but the chief surgeon said the artist's condition remained ''precarious.'' Dr. Ramon Benedito, head of the seven-man team that did the surgery, said the painter ''withstood the operation well'' but remained in the precarious condition ''because at 80, it is difficult to escape all dangers.'' After the operation Mr. Dali was transferred to Pilar Clinic's intensive care unit, where he was expected to remain at least 24 hours. He agreed to the surgery after Dr. Benedito told him it was needed to guard against an infection that might prove fatal. Mr. Dali was burned on his upper legs, groin and buttocks Aug. 30 when his bedroom caught fire at Pubol Castle, his home. He was hospitalized a day later. The police initially said the fire was caused by an electrical short circuit, but the blaze is now under investigation.

The Moore Corporation Ltd. said a court judgment that might total about $27 million, plus attorneys' fees, had been awarded against its Moore Business Forms subsidiary in a patent infringement suit brought by the Scott Paper Company. Moore said it plans to appeal the judgment, which was made by the United States District Court in Delaware. Moore said the action involved charges of infringement of a patent used in making carbonless paper. The company said the patent had expired since the years of litigation and should have no further effect on Moore's continuing operations.

772-> FERRARO RECOUNTS SECOND THOUGHTS ON HER NOMINATION, CITING SCRUTINY
Geraldine A. Ferraro suggested today that accepting the Democratic Vice-Presidential nomination may not have been worth the pain caused by have been worth the pain caused by public attention to her family finances. She made her comments at her home in Queens in an interview televised on the ''NBC Nightly News.'' Mrs. Ferraro said her husband, John A. Zaccaro, had especially found the scrutiny embarrassing. ''I knew what I was getting into,'' Mrs. Ferraro said. ''I climbed into a boxing ring and I was ready to put on the gloves with any of the guys. But what they did was they took my husband, who was standing on the side, and pulled him into the ring.'' 'I'm Hurting, It's Hurting Him' ''I'm hurting,'' Mrs. Ferraro said. ''It's hurting him. He said to me this morning as he left - it's the first day he's gone back to the office. We've been back from the convention three weeks. He said to me, 'I'm embarrassed.' Mrs. Ferraro said she responded: ''What have you got to be embarrassed about? They should be embarrassed, what they're doing to you.'' ''My kids are devastated,'' she added. Connie Chung, the NBC News correspondent who conducted the interview, posed the hypothetical question of whether Mrs. Ferraro would again accept the nomination knowing what would ensue. ''I think I would look very closely at how many people would have been hurt,'' Mrs. Ferraro responded. ''And I might have said it's not worth it.'' But, she added later in the interview, ''when its all over there will be no scars.'' Ferraro Attacks G.O.P. MONTGOMERY, Ala., Aug. 24 - Mrs. Ferraro took the offensive against the Republicans as she arrived here today, attacking President Reagan as favoring the wealthy. Mrs. Ferraro said she agreed with him that the voters now had the clearest choice of the last half century. Referring to the Republican Party platform adopted this week, she said, ''I'd call it a new version of voodoo economics, but I'm afraid that would give witch doctors a bad name.'' She volunteered a joking reference to her financial disclosure troubles of the last 10 days, saying that as ''a taxpayer I want to make sure my taxes - which you all know about - are extremely well spent.'' As she fielded questions at a brief airport news conference, Mrs. Ferraro appeared undaunted by the controversy over her family finances and said, ''Do I look as though I'm falling apart?'' Mrs. Ferraro said she had sent a note of congratulations to Vice President Bush on his renomination. ''I was kind of torn how to sign: whether it would be Edith or Pamela,'' Mrs. Ferraro added in jest. ''But I decided on Geraldine.'' Mr. Bush had said at the Dallas convention that after Mrs. Ferraro and her husband had released their tax returns he thought the couple looked more like ''Averell and Pamela'' than ''Edith and Archie.'' This was a reference to the fact that Mrs. Ferraro's Ninth Congressional District in Queens was the fictional home of Archie Bunker and his wife, Edith, in the ''All in the Family'' television series about working-class life. Mr. Bush was implying that Mrs. Ferraro and her husband's combined assets of more than $3 million were more comparable to those of W. Averell Harriman, the former diplomat and former New York Governor, and his wife. Jest About Bush's Finances Mrs. Ferraro made another lighthearted but pointed reply when she was asked about Mr. Bush's income tax returns, which the Vice President has not released since putting his financial affairs in a blind trust in 1981. ''I haven't seen them, have you?'' she responded. Mrs. Ferraro said she had repeated her request for two debates with Mr. Bush in the fall. Discussing Mr. Reagan's speech Thursday night accepting renomination, Mrs. Ferraro said he had claimed as Republican symbols things that ''we're all very proud about'' like the Olympic Games, the Statue of Liberty and the beaches of Normandy. Democrats, she said, ''could talk about the nice things people would like to hear'' if not for Mr. Reagan's record of the last three years.

To the Editor: NATIONOF SPACE FANS Your Aug. 29 editorial ''Diary of a Space Enthusiast'' implies that new initiatives in space exploration and utilization are somehow frivolous. This fails to recognize the growth of public support for space activity since the low point of the mid-1970's. Studies have shown that the percentage of the American public who want the United States to do more in space has been rising steadily. One- quarter of American adults hold ''very positive'' attitudes toward space exploration, and another quarter are ''positive''; most of the remaining population accepts the need for a space program. Space interest groups have proliferated and now have a combined membership of a quarter-million. Much of this enthusiasm has been stimulated by - and is in support of - the manned space program.

774-> THE NOTED DEMOCRATS IN THE 'WOODWORK'
To the Editor: As a convinced but troubled Democrat, I write to inquire what has happened to the candidates who were in the race for the Presidential nomination and now seem to have gone underground. With the possible exception of Jackson, all of them - Askew, Cranston, Glenn, Hart, Hollings and McGovern (in alphabetical order) - seem to have disappeared into the woodwork when - if they are the solid Democrats they not long ago professed to be - they should be out thumping the tub for the party's choice and nominee. I would feel better about the solidarity of the party, and about the degree of conviction of its leaders, if I could dispel my suspicion that they are acting as spoilers. These men need the party, and the party needs them. Our attitude toward them in 1988 could depend on their behavior in 1984. JONATHAN B. RINTELS Chilmark, Mass., Aug. 29, 1984

775-> CURRENCY MARKETS ; Dollar Trading Mixed As Gold Rises in U.S.
The dollar turned in a mixed performance in a listless session yesterday as traders awaited fresh evidence on the course of the economy and interest rates in the United States. The pound fell as a dock strike began in Britain. Gold bullion prices edged lower in Hong Kong and Europe but rose later in the United States to salvage a slim gain for the week. Bullion was bid at $352 a troy ounce in late trading at the Republic National Bank in New York, up $2.50 from the late bid Thursday and $1.25 an ounce above the bid at the end of the previous week. Despite yesterday's mixed showing, the dollar advanced against all major currencies except the Canadian dollar over the course of the week. In London, the pound fell against the dollar, dropping to $1.3095, from $1.3130 late Thursday. Later in New York, the pound fell further, to $1.30725, from $1.3125 Thursday. Meanwhile, the dollar lost ground to the Japanese yen, slipping in Tokyo to 240.93 yen, from 240.95 yen Thursday. By the end of the trading day in the United States, the dollar had edged down to 240.925 yen, from 241.10 yen late Thursday. Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Thursday, included: 2.8700 West German marks, unchanged; 2.3892 Swiss francs, down from 2.3910; 8.8175 French francs, up from 8.8095; 3.2375 Dutch guilders, up from 3.2367; 1,777.50 Italian lire, down from 1,775.75, and 1.2983 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2989. Late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates Thursday, included: 2.86625 marks, down from 2.87175; 2.38175 Swiss francs, down from 2.3885; 8.8025 French francs, down from 8.825, and 1.29865 Canadian dollars, down from 1.29935. In bullion trading, gold slipped 97 cents in Hong Kong, to $350.88 a troy ounce. In Europe, gold fell $1.10 in Zurich, to $350.40 an ounce, and bullion declined $2.25 in London, to a late bid of $349.75 an ounce. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery ended the week at $351.90 an ounce, a gain of $2.10 from Thursday and up 80 cents from the previous Friday.

778-> Concerns Lose Ruling In School Lunch Case
An administrative law judge has ruled that Federal meat inspection should be withdrawn from three meat packing plants linked to a scandal over ground beef supplied for school lunches, officials said today. If upheld, the Agriculture Department ruling would mean that the companies could not operate. The decision is moot for one of the concerns, the Cattle King Packing Company of Denver, because it closed after it was accused last fall of processing substandard cattle under less than sanitary conditions. Another of the three concerns, the Stanko Packing Company of Gering, Neb., has been sold. The withdrawal of inspection presumably will not apply if Federal officials are satisfied that the old ownership is out completely, an Agriculture official said. The administrative law judge's ruling applies directly to Nebraska Beef Packers Inc. of Gordon, Neb. The company has until Sept. 24 to appeal the decision of Judge John Campbell to the Agriculture Department's judicial officer. Judge Campbell's decision on Monday ordered inspection withdrawn for two years from both Cattle King and Nebraska Beef, and for 23 months from Stanko. The ruling upheld Federal charges that Cattle King had illegally processed adulterated meat, had processed cattle that had died other than by slaughter and had concealed those activities from Federal inspectors.

779-> THE PROBLEM OF MAKING RESTITUTION FIT THE CRIME
To the Editor: New York State Attorney General Robert Abrams's paean to restitution as an integral part of our criminal justice system (Op-Ed Aug. 21) makes a point well-timed and well- taken. With his call for improved work-release and prison industrial programs, he even avoids the often- sprung trap of advocating reform without acknowledging the need for enabling reform. It is probably nit- picking to suggest that these are only part of the solution. Restitution, like many ''alternative'' programs, suffers from a dual drawback. On one hand, many alternatives are reserved for only those whose crimes or criminal history are so minor that they would not be sent to prison in any case. This inflates success stories but has added little to public safety. On the other hand, alternatives such as the enhancement of restitution suggested by Mr. Abrams, which embody the same rationales as those used to support widespread and long imprisonment, are likely to fail to meet crime-reduction goals to the same unhappy extent as imprisonment itself. Restitution-as-punishment remains punishment, and punishment does not reduce crime or make our lives safer. Restitution seen as a very positive step toward a caring community - one in which both the causes and the effects of crime are seen as a shared responsibility - will make an impact far beyond the dollar value of crime fixed by the courts. It is a conceptual problem. It is true (and not accidental) that most of those imprisoned are poor and therefore cannot simply repay the victim for the losses suffered. The number of ''organized crime'' figures apprehended, convicted and sentenced to prison is quite small. As for major economic crimes, which have a huge annual price tag for their multiple victims, the criminal justice system's track record is even more dismal. Victim-offender reconciliation, restitution, fines hinged on the offender's earning power, services for offender and victim alike - these are programs that require policy choices well within our power to make. This will take a shift in thinking on leadership's part and on the part of the public as well. But dressing up the old function of punitiveness in a new form won't solve the problem. Until we collectively come to grips with our inability to create a safer society through wholesale imprisonment, which is costly, shortsighted and ineffective, we are committed to continued fear and failure. This too is a conceptual problem. We must shift away from crime-control models based on punitiveness toward one based on accountability - the offender's accountability toward his or her victim and the community, and the community's accountability to both. VAN ZWISOHN Executive Director, New York State Coalition for Criminal Justice Albany, Aug. 21, 1984

781-> FED POLICY UNCHANGED LAST MONTH
The Federal Reserve decided last month to maintain ''the existing degree of restraint'' on credit, and to raise, by a modest half-point, the target interest rate range for overnight loans among commercial banks, according to minutes, published today, of its main policy-making arm. The vote at the July 16-17 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee was 11 to 1, with the vice chairman, Preston Martin, dissenting. Today's disclosure of the decisions at the meeting, and the reasoning behind them, sparked little reaction on Wall Street, where the Fed is seen as continuing a credit policy described as firm, but not severely restrictive. Traders in the money and bond markets, according to one specialist, ''yawned and went home'' shortly after the minutes were released at 4:30 P.M. One Mild Surprise The one mild surprise, said Raymond W. Stone, manager of financial economics at Merrill Lynch & Company, was that the committee raised the target rate for Federal funds only to 8 to 12 percent from its preceding level of 7 1/2 to 11 1/2 percent established in March. Mr. Stone, noting that the funds rate was already about 11 1/2 percent at the time of the meeting, said he thought the four-point reference band might have been lifted somewhat further, but attached little policy signficance to this. The committee regards the funds range mainly as a mechanism for prompting committee consultation when the limits are persistently exceeded. The minutes contained no mention of any consultation. Federal funds traded today mostly at 11 1/2 and 11 9/16 percent. There is no indication that the Fed intends to raise the discount rate, now 9 percent, on loans it makes to financial institutions, even though this source of credit is substantially cheaper than Fed funds. 'To Maintain Existing Pressure' The F.O.M.C., in its directive to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which executes committee decisions in the market for Government securities, declared that in the short run it seeks ''to maintain existing pressures on reserve positions.'' It said this is expected to be consistent with growth rates for M-1, M-2 and M-3 of about 5 1/2, 7 1/2 and 9 percent, respectively, for the June-to- September period. ''Somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable in the event of more substantial growth of the monetary aggregates,'' it declared, ''while somewhat lesser restraint might be acceptable if growth of the monetary aggregates slowed significantly.'' A Frequent Dissenter Mr. Martin, who has now dissented at three of the latest five F.O.M.C. meetings, said he wanted to assign more weight to the possible need for some policy relaxation, in light of the vulnerability of key sectors of the economy and of markets to very high interest rates. ''He also believed that somewhat higher objectives for monetary growth should be established for the third quarter,'' the Fed's account asserted. Mr. Martin is thought to be the board member most closely in tune with Reagan Administration thinking - and a candidate to succeed Paul A. Volcker as chairman. The minutes also expressed a view held by ''most'' members that there should be a ''somewhat asymmetrical approach'' for dealing with a significant change in conditions. In effect, the F.O.M.C. said it would move more quickly to tighten monetary credit than it would to ease it. This ''would involve a more prompt response to the potential need for a move toward somewhat greater restraint, if monetary growth should accelerate in association with continued indications of an ebullient economy,'' the committee said. It added: ''In this view, policy implementation should be relatively tolerant, for a time, of some shortfall in monetary growth, because the latter might well prove to be temporary, if the present apparent momentum in the economy were to continue.'' Rates Little Changed Interest rates fluctuated little yesterday, ending a quiet session slightly higher. Market participants had waited on the sidelines most of the day in advance of the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee. After the release, bond prices dropped slightly. The Treasury's 30-year bond due 2014, which had risen about 2/32 of a point before the release, quickly slipped back 6/32 afterwards. In late dealings, the bellwether 30- year Treasury bond was offered at 100 14/32, off about 1/8 point from Thursday, to yield 12.44 percent. In the shorter-term market, the 12 3/8 percent notes due in 1986 fell 2/ 32, to 99 30/32, to yield 12.41 percent. The five-year notes to be issued next Thursday were offered at 12.61 percent, unchanged from Thursday. Flurry of Offerings There was a flurry of corporate offerings. The First Home Capital Corporation, a unit of the First Home Federal Savings and Loan Association of Greensboro, N.C., is offering 1.5 million shares of perpetual adjustable- rate preferred stock at $50 each, through underwriters led by Kidder, Peabody & Company. The initial dividend yield is 11.56 percent. The Westinghouse Electric Corporation announced it is offering $200 million of 9 percent convertible subordinated debentures due 2009, through underwriters led by Shearson Lehman/American Express Inc. The debentures will be issued at par and are convertible into Westinghouse common stock at $31 a share. The American Southwest Financial Corporation announced an offering of $165.85 million in bonds collateralized with mortgages, through underwriters led by Salomon Brothers Inc. The bonds yield up to 13.84 percent.

782-> MEESE NOMINATION PUT ASIDE FOR '84 BY SENATE PANEL
The nomination of Edwin Meese 3d to be Attorney General will not be considered by the Senate this year, an aide to the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee said today. Senator Strom Thurmond, the South Carolina Republican who is the committee chairman, removed the nomination from the committee's agenda to keep it from becoming ''politicized,'' according to Mark Goodin, the Senator's press secretary. ''There was a very deep concern that other committee members would request additional hearings,'' Mr. Goodin said. ''There was a strong indication that the nomination would be politicized.'' Reagan Reconfirms Support President Reagan today reconfirmed his support of Mr. Meese, the Presidential counselor, and said he would resubmit the nomination if elected to a second term. The President, referring to an investigation into Mr. Meese's financial dealings being conducted by an independent counsel, said, ''Barring anything unforseen, and I don't expect anything of that kind, I have not changed my mind about him.'' Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, noting a report in The Los Angeles Times that said the independent counsel had found no evidence of criminal conduct on the part of Mr. Meese, said, ''Assuming that the story is correct, I see no reason why Mr. Meese should not be confirmed before Congress recesses.'' ''Frankly, I believe the Meese nomination has been held hostage long enough,'' he added. Proceedings Halted in April The Judiciary Committee halted its confirmation proceedings in April pending the findings of the Government-appointed independent counsel, who is investigating allegations of criminal conduct in connection with Mr. Meese's personal finances. Many of the charges had been raised by Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, Mr. Meese's severest critic on the Judiciary Committee, who has often suggested that the nomination be withdrawn. Several people close to the investigation disputed the report that Jacob A. Stein, the independent counsel, had concluded and would report next week that his five-month investigation had found no evidence of criminal conduct by Mr. Meese. The sources said the investigation was not complete. Counsel Declines Comment The newspaper report said Mr. Stein had found no evidence that Mr. Meese had arranged Federal jobs for several friends in return for money lent by the friends to Mr. Meese or his wife. The report also said Mr. Stein's inquiry had found no evidence of criminal conduct in Mr. Meese's omission on his Government financial-disclosure form of an interest-free loan of $15,000 obtained by his wife, Ursula, in 1981. Mr. Stein declined to comment on the report, but Leonard Garment, who is Mr. Meese's lawyer, said he believed the investigation was continuing. He said he gave Mr. Stein additional information only this morning. In April, a three-judge Federal panel appointed Mr. Stein, a former president of the District of Columbia Bar Association, to investigate Mr. Meese's financial dealings and other matters that led the Senate Judiciary Committee to halt its confirmation hearings. Mr. Reagan told members of his Administration ''to cooperate fully with the independent counsel,'' according to an aide. Attorney General William French Smith, who has said he intends to return to his Los Angeles law firm when his replacement is confirmed, asked the panel to name an independent counsel under provisions of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978. John R. McKean, Mr. Meese's personal accountant, was named to the United States Postal Service Board of Governors in 1981, shortly after arranging the first of two loans totaling $60,000 for Mr. Meese, according to testimony at the confirmation hearings. Other testimony showed that Thomas J. Barrack Jr., a California real estate developer, was named to an Interior Department job and then nominated as a Commerce Department Assistant Secretary after arranging the sale of Mr. Meese's California home and lending a friend $70,000 for the down payment. He later forgave the loan.

787-> GOODEN, ON 4-HITTER, DEFEATS VALENZUELA
California has been the land of broken dreams for the Mets in recent years but tonight, at the start of an eight- game road trip, they set about reversing that trend with Dwight Gooden's 2-0 complete-game victory over the Dodgers that included 11 strikeouts. Gooden was facing Fernando Valenzuela five days after he had given up 8 runs in a 10-1 loss to Houston and Nolan Ryan. The Met rookie obviously recovered. Getting stronger as the game progressed, Gooden held the Dodgers scoreless on 4 hits and struck out the last 4 batters in the game and 8 in the last 4 innings. Three of Gooden's strikeouts came in crucial situations: One to end the fourth inning with the bases loaded and two to end the sixth with a runner at third base. He is now tied for second in the league with Valenzuela behind Ryan, with 51 strikeouts in 38Z innings. The key offensive performer for the Mets was Mookie Wilson, who went 3-for-3 with two doubles, a run scored and a stolen base. In the previous five seasons, the Mets have won only 22 of 80 games in California. The Mets' first trip to the West Coast last season began so disastrously - with a 1-2 series in San Diego and an 0-3 series in San Francisco - that George Bamberger, then the manager, resigned before the team reached Los Angeles, and Frank Howard took command. Howard, now a Met coach, was temporarily managing again tonight because Dave Johnson was summoned home to San Antonio where his father was hospitalized. Howard, who managed the Mets to a 2-3 record in Dodger Stadium last year, said there is no mystery to what produces success and failure on a West Coast trip. ''It all depends on how the club is playing,'' Howard said. ''We could have a very good trip if we get the base hits and the pitching and make the routine plays. In the past, we haven't gotten the performance levels we needed.'' Wilson gave the Mets a push in the right direction with a one-out double off Valenzuela in the second inning, and then a stolen base, his seventh in a row. Hubie Brooks followed with a run-scoring single that extended his hitting streak to nine games. Gooden had a scare in the bottom half of the second inning, after Mike Marshall stroked the Dodgers' first base hit of the night. Rick Monday, struggling with a .190 batting average, then powered a ball that seemed destined to clear the center field fence. Instead, Wilson caught it with his shoulder to the wall and the Mets clung to their 1-0 lead. Monday got another chance in the fouth inning when Gooden loaded the bases with a one-out walk to Bill Russell, a single by Terry Whitfield and a two-out walk to Marshall. The Dodger veteran, twice as old as the Mets' 19- year-old pitcher, struck out on three pitches. Valenzuela was less successful in a similar jam in the sixth inning. After loading the bases with singles by Keith Hernandez, Darryl Strawberry and Wilson, the Dodger starter got the second out of the inning by striking out Brooks, but allowed a run- scoring single by Mike Fitzgerald before also fanning Gooden. Writing on the Wall Dick Tidrow and Craig Swan, two middle relievers released by the Mets earlier this week, left a parting message for their teammates on the clubhouse blackboard at Shea Stadium. ''When you guys get your rings for '84, send me me one!!!'' read the message, signed with the pitchers' nicknames, Dirt and Swannie. Beneath the signatures, someone had chalked, ''Who's next?'' reflecting the current uneasiness among certain Mets, most noteably Mike Torrez, who brings a 10.13 earned run average and an 0-2 record into his scheduled start against the Dodgers on Sunday. . . . Tim Leary, who has a history of disabling arm injuries, was unable to pitch on Thursday because of a stiff forearm. Johnson, who moved Leary to the bullpen last week, seemed miffed at being informed of the pitcher's problem in the seventh inning of the Mets' loss to the Braves. ''I don't like surprises late in the game,'' the manager said. Braves 4, Pirates 2 ATLANTA (AP) - Dale Murphy's two-run homer with one out in the 10th inning gave Atlanta the victory. Claudell Washington opened the inning with a single to center and went to second on Paul Runge's sacrifice before Murphy struck his game-winner over the right-center field fence off Kent Tekulve (1-3). Reds 4, Cardinals 3 CINCINNATI (AP) - Dave Parker extended his hitting streak to 12 games with a run-scoring single and Cesar Cedeno drilled a two-run homer to give Cincinnati their fifth straight victory. Astros 3, Cubs 1 HOUSTON (AP) - Nolan Ryan allowed four hits and struck out eight over seven and a third innings and the rookie catcher Mark Bailey's seventh-inning single provided the winning run to lead Houston over Chicago. Ryan (3-2) extended his career strikeout total to 3,732. Phillies 6, Padres 4 SAN DIEGO (UPI) - Sixto Lezcano, a pinch-hitter, hit a two-run homer in the top of the ninth inning to break a 4-4 tie. Lezcano, batting for Ivan DeJesus, got his fifth homer of the year, off the reliever Dave Dravecky, after Ozzie Virgil singled with one out.

788-> JUDGES DISCUSS INNOVATIVE JURY PROCEDURES
How can juries in the Federal courts be more efficient? Should they be allowed to question witnesses? Should the judge give them a preview of the case on trial? Those questions and others were addressed by a panel of Federal judges who recently completed a series of experiments designed to test innovative jury procedures in the Federal courts. At a meeting sponsored by the City Bar Association last Wednesday night, they discussed the findings, which were released in a report last August. The panel was formed in 1982 by Chief Judge Wilfred Feinberg of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to consider how to improve the work of juries in the circuit, which includes New York, Connecticut and Vermont. He appointed six judges and four practicing lawyers to the panel. The group's chief conclusion was that judges may find it helpful to permit lawyers to take part in jury selection, which is now handled almost exclusively by judges. Debate on 'Pre-Instruction' But much of the debate last Wednesday night was over whether a judge should give a jury a taste of a case before the first witness is called. The procedure, called ''pre-instruction,'' is used infrequently in the Federal court system. Near the start of trial, juries involved in the experiment were told about the issues and legal principles to be discussed in the case they were about to hear. ''I found it very useful,'' said Judge I. Leo Glasser of Federal District Court in Brooklyn. ''Juries have been given a sense of what it is that's relevant and what they should be thinking about.'' Pre-instruction, he said, produced more attentive and interested jurors. Most of the other judges who tried the system said they also found it useful. Judge Robert W. Sweet of Federal District Court in Manhattan said he worried, however, that judges previewing a complex case might simply bore juries, confusing them even before they hear any testimony. He cited what he called the mego factor - mine eyes glaze over. ''It can be an exercise in futility,'' he said. If you start with complicated jargon or detail, he said, ''you can just see the jurors start to flow away from you,'' to the detriment of a trial. According to the report, judges also favored a plan that would allow jurors to ask questions of witnesses, which is generally not permitted in Federal courts. Judges at the meeting said the questions often helped jurors understand basic court jargon and procedures. Judge Leonard B. Sand, chairman of the panel, recalled that a juror once became confused in a civil case involving claims and counterclaims. The juror's question: ''Who is the plaintiff and who is the defendant?'' ''What a shame it would have been had that very innocuous clarifying question had not been answered,'' the judge said. Four of the six judges who experimented with the questions said they had found the procedure helpful.

789-> FOOD; ADDING A MEXICAN TOUCH TO MEALS OF OTHER BACKGROUNDS
MEXICAN food is hot these days, even when it is not peppery. There are Mexican restaurants, both fast food and more upscale, in many communities and new ones opening all the time. For the cook who would like to add a touch of South of the Border, supermarkets and groceries stock various condiments and ingredients. Increasingly, greengrocers are carrying fresh chilies and fresh cilantro (coriander) frequently required for preparing Mexican dishes from scratch. Jicama, the black-skinned Haas avocados and even fresh tomatillas (Mexican green tomatoes), once almost impossible to find, are now sold in some of the better produce markets. It is not necessary to plan an entire Mexican meal in order to serve a bit of Mexican flavor. As anyone who has dined in a Mexican restaurant knows, the first taste comes from the tortilla chips dipped into a bowl of salsa, a condiment that often combines raw tomato, onion, cilantro and chilies. This salsa is also used to season the guacamole, tacos, enchiladas or carne asada. Salsa means sauce in Spanish. With fresh salsa at home you can add a vibrant dimension of flavor to many foods. Broiled, steamed or poached fish, broiled chicken, steaks, hamburgers, omelets and vegetables all can be enhanced with some salsa spread on top just before serving or spooned on the side. Try it in soup, on a salad or to season tofu. Anyone on a restricted diet who must limit the intake of fat and sodium might appreciate the taste of fillet of sole simply steamed and served with salsa. Salsa contains no fat and, if made with fresh, not canned ingredients, is low in sodium. Fresh uncooked salsa can be prepared at the touch of a button with a food processor (use a pulse mechanism to achieve a uniform chopped texture). Otherwise, hand-chopping is required. How spicy your salsa will be depends on how much chili you add. These recipes call for fresh Jalapenos, a dark green oval-shaped chili about two inches long. If you cannot find Jalapenos in your market, use the long, slender green chilies sold in Oriental markets that tend to be a little less hot than Jalapenos. With any of these chilis, the seeds are the hottest part, so use discretion if you add them. And when working with fresh chilis, wear rubber gloves to protect your hands, and be careful not to rub your eyes. Fresh salsa will keep for several days in the refrigerator. Fresh Tomato Salsa, Mild to Medium 1 medium onion, coarsely chopped 1/2 medium lean bell pepper, seeded and coarsely chopped 1 seeded fresh Jalapeno chili or a 2- to 3-inch seeded piece of slen der green chili or, if necessary, a seeded canned Jalapeno (or to taste) 2 pounds ripe tomatoes, peeled, juiced, seeded and coarsely chopped (canned drained toma toes may be substituted) 3 tablespoons finely minced fresh cilantro (coriander) leaves. 1 tablespoon finely minced flat- leaf parsley 3 tablespoons fresh orange juice 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice. 1.*Combine the onion, green pepper and chili in the bowl of a food processor and process, using a pulse mechanism, until finely chopped (or chop by hand). Transfer to a bowl. 2.*Without rinsing the food processor chop tomatoes until medium fine in texture (or chop by hand). 3.*Mix the tomato with the onion mixture and add remaining ingredients. Allow to sit for one hour before using. Yield: 3 1/2 cups. Hot Green Tomato Salsa 1 small onion 1/2 fresh jalapeno chili, seeded, or 1 small long green chili, seeded (or to taste) 1 pound fresh husked tomatillos (Mexican green tomatoes) or a 1-pound can of tomatillos, drained 2 tablespoons mixed fresh cilan tro (coriander) Juice of 1/2 lime. 1.*In a food processor with a pulse mechanism, or by hand, finely mince the onion, chili and tomatillos and combine. 2.*Add cilantro and lime juice. Allow to sit one hour before using. Yield: 1 cup. Hot Pepper Salsa 1 small onion, coarsely chopped 1 medium green bell pepper, seeded and coarsely chopped 1 medium sweet red pepper, seeded and coarsely chopped 1 fresh Jalapeno or long green chili, seeded and minced (or more or less to taste) 1 clove garlic 1 medium ripe tomato, cored and coarsely chopped 2tablespoons minced cilantro (coriander) 1 1/2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice. 1.*In a food processor with a pulse mechanism, or by hand, finely chop the onion, green and red peppers, chili and garlic. Transfer to a bowl. 2.*Chop the tomato to a medium- fine texture in a food processor or by hand (it is not necessary to rinse the food processor between steps 1 and 2). Combine with the onion-and-pepper mixture. 3.*Add cilantro and lemon juice and set aside one hour before using. Yield: 2 cups.

790-> CONCERTS FIND NEW AUDIENCE
THE cellist closed her eyes, and built to a crescendo with passionate intensity. Some members of the audience closed their eyes, too, as if to shut out all but the music's beauty. Many of these listeners had not been to a concert for a very long time. They were elderly, and the opportunities to attend such events had dwindled. Now they were residents of the stately John E. Andrus Memorial Home in Hastings-on-Hudson, where the concert had come to them. The cellist, Nancy Green, and a pianist, Diana Kasco, were playing Brahms, Beethoven and Chopin in the large living room of the home under the auspices of Performers of Westchester, a group that has received a one-time grant from the International Business Machines Corporation to conduct a series of free concerts. ''Ordinarily our artists perform chamber music in private living rooms to a paying audience,'' explained Joel Rosen, artistic director of Performers of Westchester. ''We wanted to reach out to a larger audience, especially to those with an appreciation of fine music who for one reason or another are unable to get out to hear performers of this high caliber.'' The musicians, all Westchester artists either working or living in the county, are selected by audition and repeat these programs in the regular evening series, which has recently begun. Benefit concerts were held last spring at the Burke Rehabilitation Center in White Plains and at the Sarah R. Neuman Nursing Home in Mamaroneck; several more remain to be scheduled. ''The responses we have received to these concerts have been just overwhelming,'' said Mr. Rosen, himself a pianist with many performance credits. ''We hope to be able to share our music with these special audiences for many years to come.''

791-> BOTTI HELPS SACHEM BEAT WARD MELVILLE
Michael Botti, the Sachem running back, knows how to make a triumphant return. Botti, the leading rusher in Suffolk County last season with 1,436 yards, has watched from the sidelines since injuring his shoulder in a scrimmage two weeks ago. But yesterday, with Sachem clinging to a 7-6 lead in the fourth quarter after halting a Ward Melville drive at the 11-yard line, Coach Fred Fusaro decided to insert his star runner into the game. ''We were hoping to rest him another week, but we needed a shot in the arm, and he said he was ready,'' said Steve Tuttle, the Sachem assistant coach. ''He really carried the freight.'' The announcement of Botti's name incited the enthusiastic home crowd, and the senior runner sparked the Sachem offense as well, carrying the ball six times for 65 yards, including a 26-yard touchdown with four minutes remaining, as the Flaming Arrows marched the length of the field to take a 14-6 lead. Ray Curtin, the Sachem senior linebacker, made that margin stand up for a victory with an interception to thwart Ward Melville's attempted game-tying drive. The game was a close one throughout. John Pierro gave Sachem an early 7-0 lead in the first quarter with a 1-yard plunge, a score set up by a 77- yard pass from the quarterback Michael Passantino to Mike Johnson on the Flaming Arrows' second play from scrimmage. Ward Melville narrowed the lead to 7-6 early in the third quarter with an 8-yard touchdown pass from Craig Darrheh to Mike Kelly. The Patriots challenged for the lead with a long drive midway through the fourth quarter, the charge that Sachem halted on its own 11-yard line before Botti's heroics. The victory gave the Flaming Arrows a 2-0 mark and put them atop the League I standings. The loss dropped Ward Melville to 1-1 in League I play. Another League I team, Lindenhurst, got a fine individual performance from the senior quarterback Nick Lombardo, who led the Bulldogs to a 22-6 victory over 0-2 Northport. Lombardo completed 12 of 20 passes for 217 yards and one touchdown, made an interception of his own on defense, and kicked a 27-yard field goal and one extra point to help raise Lindenhurst's record to 1-1. Sayville, frustrated by dropped passes in the first half against Kings Park, went to the ground in the second half and ran roughshod over the Kingsmen to triumph, 12-0. Michael Duffy led the way for the Golden Flashes with 111 yards, complemented by Kenny Jones's 63 yards and Michael Buck's 57. John Glenn continued to shut down its foes while scoring aplenty itself, crushing Centereach, 44-6. The Knights led by only 14-0 at halftime, but two touchdowns in each of the last two quarters, highlighted by a flea- flicker strike to Kyle Chaikin, turned a close game into a blowout. Glenn has outscored its opponents, 68-6, in its two contests. A second consecutive strong rushing performance by Bay Shore's Mike Phillips helped the Marauders to their 12th straight triumph, a 22-3 victory over East Islip. Phillips, who ran for 74 yards last week, romped for 124 more yesterday while the Bay Shore defense, led by Willie Hough, Errol Doebler and Mike Woytusik, held the Redmen to a single field goal. West Islip's Chris Dennehy ran for a pair of second-half touchdowns to lift the Lions past Patchogue-Medford, 21-7, in League I play. Dennehy bulled for touchdown bursts of 2 and 4 yards, one in the third quarter and one in the fourth, while the West Islip defense shut down the Raiders.

792-> CHINA CUTS A HONG KONG DEAL WITH ASSURANCES ON ALL SIDES
The surest guarantee of Hong Kong's capitalist future after it submits to Chinese rule in 1997 may be not the joint declaration that Britain and China initialed last week but the international fanfare that surrounded it. Details had been leaking for months, but summed up in a single document, they amounted to an extraordinary promise by China to let Hong Kong's free enterprise continue unbridled for 50 years. The British Foreign Secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, called it a revolutionary proposition that the world's largest Communist country should be setting out to maintain perhaps the world's liveliest capitalist population. According to the agreement, China's red flag will replace the Union Jack, but Hong Kong can fly its own flag too. Queen Elizabeth's portrait will be removed from the Hong Kong dollar, but the currency will still circulate freely. Chinese troops will replace the British garrison but they will not be deployed to maintain public order. Most important for Hong Kong's five million inhabitants, freedom of speech, press, assembly, and worship, even the right to strike, will be respected. For China, basking in world acclaim for the agreement on the eve of this week's 35th anniversary of Communist rule, the rewards were obvious. After two years of negotiations, it has gotten Britain to accept its right to Hong Kong without a struggle. By creating the precedent of a special administrative region in Hong Kong, China was making more credible its offer of similar peaceful reunification with Taiwan. Congratulations came in from around the world, including the United States. They conferred on Peking the kind of prestige that it has sought since emerging from the reclusion of the Maoist years. China's Foreign Minister, Wu Xueqian, who was at the United Nations, predicted that ''the settlement of this question will contribute significantly to the lofty cause of the reunification of our great motherland and to stability and peace in Asia.'' It remained only for China to deliver on its promise not to meddle in a social and economic system that, ideologically, it should despise. In Hong Kong, the fear lingered that China, barely eight years out of its chaotic cultural revolution, could shift course again, if not premeditatedly then through the death or replacement of the grand design's original architects. The British insisted that the accord would be legally binding, although no formal sanctions exist to keep Peking from reneging. At stake, according to a British diplomat, is China's reputation as a party that has freely entered into the highest form of agreement that a state can legally assume. That might carry little weight after Hong Kong returns to the motherland. China is accustomed to dismissing foreign criticism as interference in its internal affairs. On the other hand, the Chinese have become hostages to the respectable image that they want to cultivate in the international community. A state lays its prestige on the line when it agrees to abide by such an agreement, another British diplomat observed. The opinion of the people of Hong Kong was conspicuously absent from the agreement that now decides their future. It cannot be changed to accommodate their views, which are being solicited after the fact by a British office set up in the territory. But their belated support should reinforce the moral weight of the agreement. China may need all the help it can get to keep Hong Kong's talent and capital from hemorrhaging. Many of the businessmen who make Hong Kong thrive have already explored ways to get out if things sour under Chinese sovereignty. A serious exodus of skills could leave Peking with little more than an overcrowded island. The friendly persuasion of countries with a stake in Hong Kong's continuing success was typified in an assurance last week by Burton Levin, the American Consul General, that the United States would continue to treat Hong Kong as a separate trading partner after 1997. Otherwise, Hong Kong's textile quotas would be merged with China's. Other countries have indicated that their investments will be based on assurances that China will protect their economic interests in the territory. Once the glow has faded, the recovery of Hong Kong could pose some headaches for the Chinese leadership. Young Chinese, in particular, will inevitably wonder why they are forbidden the kind of freedoms guaranteed their peers in Hong Kong. And Hong Kong's influences, from its brassy television fare to disco music and mod fashions, which ideologists were attacking as spiritual pollution less than a year ago, might further erode the Marxist verities to which China at least pays lip service. China also has some ill-wishers who want to see its one country-two systems experiment flop. They include the nationalist Government in Taiwan, which tried to upstage the joint declaration last week by offering to provide visas and housing loans to Chinese in Hong Kong who wanted to flee to Taiwan. For all its sincerity about the accord, Peking may find that the greatest threat is its own demonstrated inability to keep hands off. Hong Kong Chinese have not forgotten how the Communists offered guarantees to capitalists to remain in Shanghai in 1949, then later took away their businesses and persecuted them as class enemies. But any tinkering with Hong Kong would discredit China's new reputation for reliability, especially now that its agreement with Britain is being held up as a model for other countries.

794-> CUOMO SAYS A BID FOR PRESIDENCY WOULD RULE OUT A 2D TERM IN '86
Mario M. Cuomo says he would not run for re- election as Governor in 1986 if he decided to seek the Presidency in 1988. The Governor made his remarks in an interview in which he discussed his thoughts about running for President while emphasizing that he had made no such decision yet. He said he believed Walter F. Mondale, this year's Democratic nominee, would come from behind to defeat President Reagan. Subject Could Be 'Academic' If Mr. Mondale won, he said, any discussion that Mr. Cuomo might seek the Presidency would be ''academic,'' because Mr. Mondale would presumably run for re-election in 1988. ''The logic is so strong against this Reagan,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''The more he talks the weaker he gets.'' Even if Mr. Mondale lost, Mr. Cuomo said, there would be other candidates with what he described as a head start for the Democratic nomination in 1988. ''If Mondale loses,'' he said, ''then Hart is running, Kennedy is running. This guy is running. And they'll start right after November.'' ''If I want to run for President, you'll be able to tell,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''Because if I want to run for President, the only way to do it is not to run for Governor and start running for President. Because the alternative is to run for Governor and win, and then turn right around and start running for President. And I'm not going to do that.'' Mr. Cuomo was asked about the Presidency after assertions by three current or former state officials that he has discussed with advisers whether it would be best for him not to seek re-election if he chose to run for President. ''Absolutely not,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''I never, never, never have talked to anybody about the possibility of running for President in any form, directly or indirectly.'' Mr. Cuomo noted that some politicians and commentators had listed him as a formidable contender for the nomination in 1988 in the event Mr. Mondale lost this November. But he said he was doing nothing to encourage such speculation. Mr. Cuomo said at least four potential contenders for the Republican nomination in 1988 already had speaking engagements scheduled for after the November election in New Hampshire, traditionally the site of the first Presidential primary. Many of the successful candidates for their parties' Presidential nomination have campaigned essentially full time for the job, or at least while holding no public office. They include Jimmy Carter, Mr. Reagan and Mr. Mondale. Mr. Cuomo said that in 1978, when Gov. Hugh L. Carey was considering seeking the Democratic nomination in 1980, he had advised Mr. Carey not to run for re-election in 1978 but instead to simply run for President. Mr. Carey ran for re-election as Governor and won. Mr. Cuomo said he becomes annoyed when political columnists say he has expressed interest in seeking the Presidency. ''I've done everything just the opposite,'' he said. ''All of the things you should be doing if you wanted to run, I'm not doing - practically all.'' He said he turned down most of the requests he received to make out-of- state appearances. In October, however, he will travel to California to appear at a fund-raising event for Willie Brown, speaker of the Californa Assembly, and he plans to go to New Jersey Wednesday to help raise money for Senator Bill Bradley. ''I'm not a terrific candidate,'' he said. ''I gave two good speeches.'' In the last few months, Mr. Cuomo delivered the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention and a speech on religion and politics at the University of Notre Dame. Making Decisions He compared his current political situation to the period during 1981 when, as Lieutenant Governor, he was repeatedly asked if he would challenge Mr. Carey for Governor and he refused to answer. His diaries show that at that time he was laying the groundwork for a gubernatorial campaign. Mr. Carey decided not to seek re-election in 1982 and Mr. Cuomo then announced he was running. ''I know how not to make decisions,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''I know how to make decisions. Part of the secret of making decisions is to know which decisions not to make.'' Mr. Cuomo said he had been asked on some occasions about the Presidency and answered this way: ''I invariably say, 'If I feel like talking at all, I hope the question never comes up. I hope Mondale wins. If he wins it's academic. If he didn't win I'm not sure I'd ever think of myself as capable of being President.' ''I still would not be eager to face that question, and that's not the real question. The real question would be, 'Are you running for Governor?' How do you run for Governor and then run for President? The real question you should be asking me is, 'Are you going to run for Governor?' And if you ask me that question, I'm going to tell you, 'We'll see.' '' During the interview, Mr. Cuomo raised the reasons why it would be better not to seek re-election as Governor if he were planning to run for President. He pointed out that the Republicans would be willing to spend a great deal of money against him in the 1986 gubernatorial race if he were a likely Presidential contender. 2d Inauguration He estimated that the Republicans would seek to raise $20 million to $25 million for that race. He said he would have to spend at least $10 million. Then he sought to depict what would happen at his second inauguration as Governor if he had decided to run for President. He offered a mock inaugural address that included a variation of the way he had invoked his late father's name in his first inaugural in 1983: ''Well, ladies and gentlemen, I know I said I really wanted to be Governor and I was serious about it. However, having been sworn in, I would like to take this occasion to announce 'Poppa, wherever you are, I'm running for President.' '' The Governor's actions - and even his statements - could affect many aspects of politics in New York. The notion that he might not seek re-election runs counter to most of the conventional political wisdom in the state. Members of his own administration said the possibility that he might not seek re-election could affect his fund- raising efforts and his ability to recruit or retain staff members. Support From OthersOther politicians will be watching closely, including Democrats such as Stanley Fink, the Assembly Speaker, and Alfred Del Bello, the Lieutenant Governor. Both Mr. Fink and Mr. Del Bello have said they think Mr. Cuomo should run for President. Both have indicated their interest in being Governor but would be unlikely to challenge Mr. Cuomo. Republicans are having a difficult time identifying a strong challenger to what they have presumed would be a re-election bid by Mr. Cuomo, who is doing well in public opinion polls. George Clark Jr., the Republican State Chairman, said this week that he believed Mr. Cuomo already was running for President and that his actions were geared to that goal. Mr. Clark said he thought Mr. Cuomo had done little to help Mr. Mondale's campaign and had at various times made negative comments about Mr. Mondale that might have hurt him. But even Mr. Clark said he expected Mr. Cuomo to run for re-election first before announcing for the Presidency.

795-> U.S. IS SPEEDING UP AID TO COSTA RICA
United States officials said today that shipments of military aid to Costa Rica would be speeded up to help that country's security forces deal with what Washington called border incursions by Nicaragua. The officials also said the United States planned to ask the Organization of American States to press Nicaragua to halt incursions into Costa Rica. ''Costa Rica has asked for our assistance,'' Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, said. ''We're also going to talk to the O.A.S. and pursue diplomatic avenues.'' The accelerated aid, other officials reported, will include light trucks, communications equipment and uniforms. Originally those shipments were to be made later this year as part of $2.15 million in military aid for Costa Rica. Costa Rica has long been considered the most stable, democratic and peaceful country in Central America. But recent border incidents have raised some questions about the future. Lightly Armed Police Units John Hughes, the State Department spokesman, said the aid shipments would be speeded up because Costa Rican security forces ''are now ill- equipped to control the country's borders or deal with the current attacks from Nicaragua.'' The security forces consist mainly of lightly armed police units. Mr. Hughes did not term the accelerated shipments emergency aid. But he said consideration of emergency aid was ''under review'' and he noted that the Reagan Administration had already asked Congress for an additional $7.85 million in military aid this year so that more small arms, ammunition, observation planes and helicopters could be sent to Costa Rica. ''Under the circumstances,'' Mr. Hughes said, ''prompt Congressional action is clearly needed.'' Nicaragua has denied Costa Rican charges that it deliberately attacked Costa Rican border areas. The incursions have occurred, Nicaragua has said, when its forces engaged Nicaraguan guerrillas who use Costa Rica as a rear base. The most recent of the incidents was Thursday, according to officials in San Jose, the capital of Costa Rica. They said that Nicaraguan gunners fired mortar shells into Costa Rica near Penas Blancas and that Costa Rican gunners fired back. No casualties were reported. Mr. Hughes said the Nicaraguan version of what was happening along the border was ''clearly nonsense.'' Nicaraguan Hails Aid SAN JOSE, Costa Rica, May 4 - Nicaragua's Ambassador to Costa Rica said today that the Sandinistas welcomed increased United States military aid to Costa Rica if it was used to patrol the border region properly and enforce Costa Rica's official policy of neutrality. Ambassador Leonor Arg"uello said in an interview, ''It's fine with us if the Costa Ricans really want the equipment to patrol the border and prevent further trouble.'' The Nicaraguan Government charged in a protest note that Costa Rican forces fired without provocation in the border incident Thursday to create further conflict between the two countries.

797-> WITNESS UNCERTAIN DELOREAN INTENDED DRUG DEAL
Owners of stainless steel DeLorean sports cars hope the autos will become collectors' items. Page 33. LOS ANGELES, May 4 - A Federal agent testifying in the drug trafficking trial of John Z. DeLorean said today that from July 12, 1982, when a paid informer first reported he had been approached by Mr. DeLorean about a narcotics transaction, the agent had ''no doubt'' the automobile manufacturer wanted to engage in a drug deal. But after a brief recess the agent, Benedict J. Tisa of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, returned to the witness stand and said that after speaking with the prosecutor, Robert Perry, ''I misspoke when I said 'no doubt.' '' Howard L. Weitzman, one of Mr. DeLorean's lawyers, suggested that even before an investigation of the former chairman of the DeLorean Motor Company was started, the agent judged him guilty and interpreted Mr. DeLorean's actions in that light. In cross examination by Mr. Weitzman, Mr. Tisa, a Government witness, appeared to score several more points for the defense's case: - He described disagreement between the F.B.I. and the Drug Enforcement Administration over the handling of the DeLorean case, including his unsuccessful attempt to exclude from the investigation a D.E.A. agent, Gerald Scotti. Mr. Tisa said Mr. Scotti was ''under internal investigation for leaking information'' in another case. - Mr. Tisa told the court that it was the informer, James Timothy Hoffman, who had initiated a contact with Mr. DeLorean that the informer said led to a conversation about dealing in drugs. Mr. Tisa said he was correcting false information in a teletype sent Sept. 6, 1982, informing the F.B.I. in Washington that the informer ''was contacted by John DeLorean'' to discuss ''the importation of heroin from the Orient.'' - Mr. Tisa conceded that he did not know if 500 shares of stock in the DeLorean Motor Company Inc. that Mr. DeLorean signed over as collateral to an agent posing as an important figure in the narcotics underworld, had any monetary value. If they did not, Mr. Tisa said, Mr. DeLorean had invested ''nothing'' in a narcotics transaction. Mr. Tisa had posed as a crooked banker in the investigation. Second F.B.I. Teletype According to a Sept. 6, 1982, F.B.I. teletype introduced by the defense today, ''it was deemed essential to introduce an individual other than a source or agent for the government into the DeLorean investigation.'' It said ''the solution would be to approach'' William Morgan Hetrick to furnish the narcotics. Mr. DeLorean and Mr. Hetrick were introduced Sept. 20, 1982. Mr. Hetrick pleaded guilty last year to cocaine trafficking in charges stemming from the DeLorean investigation. Mr. Weitzman asked Mr. Tisa if the reason the Government brought in Mr. Hetrick was because ''up until that time John DeLorean had not conspired with anybody, right?'' Mr. Tisa said he was acting on a vague belief that Mr. DeLorean ''had associates,'' but Mr. Tisa did not say they were associates in a conspiracy. Today, for the first time, Mr. Tisa said, ''That's a possibility,'' when asked whether Mr. DeLorean was trying to indicate he did not want to enter a drug deal by telling Mr. Tisa at a meeting Sept. 15, 1982, that he no longer had $2 million to invest. Irish Republican Army The jury of six men and six women had already listened to tapes of Mr. DeLorean telling Mr. Tisa his $2 million investment was coming from the Irish Republican Army. That dramatic assertion had led to an investigation by the F.B.I. that began with a meeting Sept. 17, 1982, with British authorities, according to documents produced this week in the absence of the jury. The inquiry turned up no connection between the I.R.A. and Mr. DeLorean. Defense Calls it a Hoax Mr. DeLorean's defense asserts that Mr. DeLorean introduced the I.R.A. as a hoax to get out of the deal after he realized narcotics were involved. Saying that since Mr. DeLorean had apparently manufactured the participation of the I.R.A., Mr. Weitzman asked the agent, ''Do you think it's possible he didn't want to get involved in a drug deal?'' ''Yes,'' Mr. Tisa said, ''That's a possibility.'' His answer came after Judge Robert M. Takasugi had ordered his first reply, ''I don't know,'' stricken from the record as unresponsive. Mr. DeLorean, his wife, Cristina, and his attorneys walked out of today's court session to be greeted by a group of teen-agers and other well-wishers on the courthouse steps. The teen-agers, who had been in the courtroom, clamored for autographs.

799-> FOLLOW-UP ON THE NEWS; Patriotic Trouble
One hundred days after Iran seized 52 Americans as hostages on Nov. 4, 1979, Hillcrest Memorial Park in Hermitage, Pa., gained national attention by raising 100 American flags in their honor. Each day thereafter the cemetery put up another flag, until the men were released Jan. 20, 1981. Early this year, with 444 flags still flying, the 71-acre cemetery was in financial trouble. Some buyers who made down payments on crypts had sued, charging that money was being diverted from crypt construction to the tribute to the hostages. Two banks had filed foreclosure claims. Hillcrest filed for protection under Federal bankruptcy laws in January, as its parent company, Homewood Memorial Gardens in Chicago, had done a year earlier. The owner of the two companies, Thomas Flynn, filed for bankruptcy last October. Today, Mr. Flynn says, he and Homewood are out of bankruptcy and Hillcrest is pressing a $5 million suit against one bank it blames for most of its problems. It is charging, among other things, breach of contract. ''The cemetery itself is doing fine,'' the owner reports, and ''all 444 flags are flying.'' A museum opened at Hillcrest in July 1982 with photos of the hostage crisis, is also intact, he says, as is a granite monument ''for the boys who died in the rescue attempt'' in Iran. ''We have built 500 crypts so far,'' Mr. Flynn says, ''and they will be dedicated Nov. 4.'' ''The flags,'' he asserts, ''are forever. They will never come down.''

801-> DEBATE ENVELOPES CONDOMINIUM PLAN
or 202, or 194, or 180 - on the site of an old golf course at the northern tip of New Castle has brought the opposition of hundreds of residents, repeated requests for revisions by the town's Planning Board and outrage from neighboring Mount Kisco. The Mount Kisco Village Board was so angry at the proposal, known as Fox Hollow Run, that it threatened to close off the street connecting the development with the village's main street, three-quarters of a mile from the site. The New Castle Planning Board has considered the proposal at 12 meetings in the last year and sent the plans back for numerous changes. The developer, Harvey Shapiro of New York City, has submitted 15 possible site plans, six of them ''considerably different'' from one another, according to Erwin N. Potter, the site planner, with the others being merely modifications. Now the developer is back at the drawing board, after a meeting earlier this month at which board members said that even 180 condominiums would be more than they want. The number has been reduced three times, but the board has not specified how many units would be acceptable. The 129-acre site is one of three large sites that were designated in 1979 by New Castle's planning consultants as suitable for multifamily housing, after a court ruled that the town, almost entirely zoned for single- family residential use, must provide for multifamily use. The town plan said the site would be suitable for 160 to 192 units. Although the proposed housing would be owned, either as condominiums or as a homeowners association, it qualifies as multifamily housing because the dwellings would be attached to each other. Arnold Spurr, chairman of the Planning Board, said recently that even though the proposal conformed to the town plan, ''the plan was written in the past, and to do a good job now we have to deal with what we have now. Traffic has increased, and the population has grown.'' The major objection is the traffic that is expected to come from the new residents onto Route 133, also known as Main Street, in Mount Kisco, near an exit from the Saw Mill River Parkway. Residents also say that the traffic would clog the two-lane rural road leading to Route 133. The Mount Kisco Village Board wrote a letter in July saying, ''Our village will receive the bulk of the traffic impact, with absolutely no benefits. It seems an unfair burden.'' Later the board passed a resolution suggesting closing off the road. The town of Bedford, New Castle's neighbor to the north and east, suggested that the development be ''scaled down'' and said a large amount of traffic would go over Bedford Road. The land is a hilly, rocky, wooded irregular site something like the shape of Texas. The Kisco River flows through it and is 30 feet wide when it is fullest. There is still the remnant of an old road for horse carts. There are ruins of several buildings dating back more than a century, where old bottles and earthenware have been found in recent months, and the land is crisscrossed by stone walls. The land was a golf course for many years, until about 1919, and the former clubhouse has been occupied in recent years by Dr. and Mrs. Jules Koch. They will retain their house and tennis court and 2.4 acres of land. The Fox Hollow Run development is opposed by several groups: the Kisco River Association, with 150 to 200 members, which was formed specifically to oppose it; the Kisco Park Taxpayers Association of 111 residents on neighboring property; Neighbors Organized for the Protection of the Environment, or NOPE, organized to oppose another New Castle multifamily development and successful in having it changed to single- family; and the Regional Review League, a 20-year-old organization concerned with planning and zoning in northern Westchester. There have also been petitions signed by 43 residents of Croton Avenue who object to the traffic past their homes. In an effort to mollify opponents, the developer presented a five-minute videotape at a Planning Board meeting attended by about 75 residents this month, showing traffic at the intersection at the peak hour. Mr. Spurr, however, described the videotape as ''a waste of time,'' and one resident shouted that it was a ''fraud'' because it was taken from an exit ramp, where traffic is light in the morning. Besides traffic, residents said there was ''a serious threat of sewage being dumped into the Kisco River and in turn into New York City's drinking supply in the Croton Reservoir.'' They said the development was too dense and would destroy a wilderness area. Jay Davies Maddox, president of the Regional Review League, wrote that ''it is a fact that when a rural area begins to suburbanize, the incoming immigrants will demand increased public services.'' The developers submitted a draft environmental-impact statement, as required by state law, and the document is about three inches thick. And after many questions were raised by critics, Mr. Shapiro submitted a supplemental statement of about the same size. Stuart R. Shamberg, lawyer for the developer, said the two statements dealt extensively with each of the complaints. He said that ''those who are criticizing the density of development live in areas that are developed at a higher density,'' citing the Kisco Park houses on one-quarter or one- half acre, compared with an average of 0.7 acre per dwelling for Fox Hollow Run. He reminded the board that the town had chosen the site as ''eminently suitable'' for multifamily housing and that the project had been designed to meet that need, which he said was for ''small units, attached, requiring little maintenance, for the smaller family unit which is now dominating our society.'' Mr. Shapiro said the units would sell for about $150,000 to $225,000 and would be built gradually over three to five years. ''The site is magnificent,'' he said. ''It is unfortunate that environmental-protection laws can be used by groups not to protect the environment but to cause delays.'' Although Mayor Ferd Vetare of Mount Kisco was a supporter of the village resolution threatening to close Croton Avenue, he implied that he expected to see the development built anyway. ''I am sure that there are some that would prefer to see it go away,'' he said. ''But it is a fact of life, sometimes, that things must be developed.''

803-> AROUND THE NATION ; Top Illinois Court Backs Town's Ban on Pistols
The Illinois Supreme Court today upheld the nation's first pistol ban, ruling that the law in Morton Grove, a Chicago suburb, did not violate the constitutional right to bear arms. The court said in its 4-to-3 decision that Morton Grove had the authority to impose the ordinance under its law-enforcement power, as a way of reducing weapons-related injuries and accidents in the village. The 1981 ordinance, which bars the possession and sale of pistols in the village of 23,000 people, has been upheld by state and Federal appeals courts. Last year the United States Supreme Court declined to hear a challenge to the ban. That decision let stand a Federal appeals court ruling upholding the ordinance. However, legal experts speculated that the High Court did not want to take up the case until the highest Illinois court had done so.

804-> CRAFTS; MUSEUM'S IMAGE KEPT ALIVE
ANYONE aware of crafts for more than a year must feel a loss on confronting the excavation where the American Craft Museum I stood on West 53d Street in Manhattan. A new craft museum, scheduled to open late in 1986, will occupy the lower floors of the high-rise being built on the site. Although major exhibitions, such as the current retrospective of works in clay by Rudy Autio, continue at the museum's second location - American Craft Museum II at the International Paper Plaza, 77 West 45th Street - that is off the normal ''museum beat'' of enthusiasts. As a result, the American Craft Museum Associates, a volunteer group of collectors, artists and professionals, works to keep the image of the craft museum in the public eye. The group's president is Myrna Zuckerman of Englewood Cliffs, a former teacher of gifted children in New York City, who began ''haunting art museums'' when her first child, now 14, was in his stroller. Although her teaching specialty was mathematics, art, she says, ''was something I had always loved.'' Mrs. Zuckerman started taking art courses, and for several years has attended seminars of the Collectors Institute at the New School in New York City. There, talks by art authorities and visits to the studios of prominent artists have brought the field alive for her. Through her exposure to museums, Mrs. Zuckerman began to stop distinguishing between ''fine'' and ''applied'' arts. She was drawn to contemporary crafts by her innate appreciation of excellence. ''That quality, which moves me in a wonderful performance or in the books of certain authors, can be present in a piece of clay or wood,'' she said. Eventually, Mrs. Zuckerman decided to ''put my money where my heart was'' and lured her husband, Robert, from collecting paintings to collecting crafts. Her active involvement in the field began about four years ago. Then, after working with Barbara Fleischman on the Channel 13 auctions - Mrs. Fleischman's husband owns the Kennedy Galleries, 40 West 57th Street - Mrs. Zuckerman was invited by her to join a group working on a 25th anniversary celebration of the craft museum. That was the beginning of the associates, which has since grown from 5 members to 72. ''It has been an incredible learning experience,'' Mrs. Zuckerman said. ''Admiring craft is one thing; studying it - to understand the enormity involved - is another. Now I am trying to learn the difference between perfection and excellence.'' For example, she explained, in a strong ceramic work, such as that by Mr. Autio, a crack is unimportant. Mrs. Zuckerman's ''almost full- time role'' with the museum has immersed her in plans for a benefit, built around an auction and sale of ''art for the table,'' on Oct. 17. Tableware and accessories designed by distinguished artists for the occasion will include limited editions of plates by James Makins, a covered casserole by Karen Karnes and an ice bucket by Byron Temple, a 1984 winner of a New Jersey craft fellowship. A collection of one-of-a-kind functional pieces by artists such as Wayne Higby and Mark Lindquist - they were selected by Jack Lenor Larsen, the textile designer - will occupy a ''celebration table.'' Finally, there will be 15 handcrafted tables by woodworkers from all over the country. Included will be one by Edgar and Joyce Anderson of Morristown that resembles a giant chess piece. Order bids are being taken for the tables, which are now on view at the 45th Street museum. Based on their past efforts, the associates are expected to contribute $55,000 to the museum this year. Any surplus will be used for acquisitions. In addition to raising funds, they are concerned with education and public relations. ''I feel very strongly about our educational program,'' Mrs. Zuckerman said. The associates introduced a program for training docents, who are available to guide groups through the museum. Another project they are underwriting is a craft film festival, through which a package of 10 films can be sent around the country. ''Because we are centered around the museum, our national impact is limited,'' Mrs. Zuckerman said. ''However, the films can go anyplace.'' The associates are in communication with similar groups, such as The Friends of the Crafts in San Francisco. Mrs. Zuckerman also envisions a series of informal luncheons at which leaders in the field might address her colleagues and other interested people. The recent winning of a seat on the board of the American Crafts Council for the president of the associates was ''a great satisfaction,'' Mrs. Zuckerman said, adding: ''It puts us on a more professional basis.'' Since corporate collections are an obvious market to tap, representatives of companies often are taken by associate members through International Paper's collection of works in wood - furniture by George Nakashima, for instance - and paper chosen by a professional curator. ''One of the best aspects of collecting crafts is that, at an affordable price, you can have the finest example of an artist's work,'' Mrs. Zuckerman said. Although tempted by papermaking since organizing a series of craft demonstrations by local artists at the Elizabeth Morrow School in Englewood, Mrs. Zuckerman says that her creativity is expressed in planning how goals can be accomplished. ''I lie awake at night trying to think of ways to promote the cause without sounding like an evangelist,'' she said. The benefit, which will take place at Windows of the World on the 106th floor of the World Trade Center, will begin with cocktails at 5:30 P.M., followed by dinner. Individual tickets are $40 for cocktails only and $175 for the entire evening. For further information, call the museum at (212) 869- 9425.

805-> U.S. ROLE IN SALVADOR
The accusation made by Senator Jesse Helms that United States Embassy officials have manipulated the presidential election campaign here in favor of the Christian Democratic candidate has focused new attention on United States activities in El Salvador, particularly in advance of the election runoff Sunday. The charge, in a letter from the North Carolina Republican to President Reagan, was denied by both the embassy and the White House. The text of the letter was made public Wednesday by Hugo Barrera, the vice presidential candidate of the far- right Nationalist Republican Alliance. His party's standard-bearer, Roberto d'Aubuisson, is generally expected to lose Sunday to Jose Napoleon Duarte, the Christian Democratic leader. The letter was telephoned to Mr. d'Aubuisson's party from the office of Mr. Helms, long a supporter of the far right in El Salvador. After the letter was made public, Mr. Barrera complained that his party felt under siege. ''We have the United States against us,'' he said, ''the Christian Democrats against us, the Social Democrats against us and the international press against us.'' Advice From U.S. The notion that the United States intevenes here is hardly new. More than 100 members of Congress have come to El Salvador to tell Salvadoran officials what needs to be done in their country, American military advisers tell the Salvadoran Army how to run the war, and liberal and conservative representatives in the United States have provided technical and political advice. An international press center set up at the suggestion of the United States Embassy has been of primary benefit to the the moderate candidates, according to the right. Both the United States Congress, by withholding aid until after the election, and the Reagan Administration, by dening a visa to Mr. d'Aubuisson, have made clear their concerns about the far-right candidate. Such negative feelings toward Mr. d'Aubuisson were already well-publicized in 1982, when the United States made known its opposition to his being named Provisional President by the Salvadoran Constitutent Assembly. Instead, Alvaro Magana was named. Support for d'Aubuisson Mr. d'Aubuisson has his American supporters, mostly from the private sector. Wealthy rightist backers in the United States lend their private jets to fly members of Congress to meet with conservative party members in El Salvador and to carry Salvadoran rightists to Washington. And conservative legislators, like Senator Helms, lobby for the right in Congress. United States aid supports the salaries of cooperative managers, some of whom are aligned with the far right. Conservative foundations in the United States provided technical and political advice to Mr. d'Aubuisson's party. Publicly in El Salvador, the United States Embassy has remained neutral in the elections and made it clear it would support either candidate and judge him on his performance. But diplomats here say it was inevitable that preferences be known. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering said: ''We have not in any way said to any of these guys that this particular guy is our guy. Congressmen have, from Washington and here. They don't always speak for the Administration, but they carry a message that is very clear.'' United States officials acknowledge that the refusal to give Mr. d'Aubuisson a visa to travel to the United States was designed to send the Salvadorans a message, and the officials defended their right to relay their concern about the far-right leader. The decision to reject the visa was made after Administration officials said Mr. d'Aubuisson's associates might be involved in death squads. ''First of all, d'Aubuisson did not get a visa,'' a United States diplomat said. ''There is no clearer way of showing how a country feels'' about the candidate.

806-> ACCORD IS SET ON PAYMENTDEADLINES FOR STATE
Governor Cuomo and key legislators have agreed on a measure to require the state to pay its bills on time - or pay an interest penalty to state contractors. Businesses and nonprofit groups - who provide the state with everything from pencils to residences for the retarded - have long complained that the state is lax in paying its bills. Under the measure, the state would have 45 days to pay a bill. If it failed to do so, it would pay a daily interest penalty. The penalty, based on prevailing interest rates, would be paid at the same rate charged to businesses for overdue taxes. Mr. Cuomo vetoed a similar measure last year. In negotiations this year, he said many of the technical objections he had raised had been met. Action on the measure is expected in the next few weeks. The Expected Cost In announcing the agreement, Mr. Cuomo's office said that unless improvements were made in the current payment system, the measure would cost the state between $20 million and $35 million a year. Each state agency would be forced to absorb the cost of interest payment for its own bills. The legislation is scheduled to take effect July 1, and would require that bills be paid within 30 days by 1988. The Federal Government adopted a similar bill, with a 45-day limit, in 1982. ''All of us as private citizens are expected to pay our bills on time,'' said the Senate majority leader, Warren M. Anderson, Republican of Binghamton. ''The State of New York certainly should do no less.'' ''Prompt payment by government is especially important to small business,'' said the Assembly Speaker, Stanley Fink, Democrat of Brooklyn. The measure contains some significant exceptions. The state would be exempt from the penalty if it did not have the cash to pay its bills. This would protect the state in the event that the adoption of a budget was delayed. In addition, the measure does not apply to payments to local governments or to the state's public authorities. However, Mr. Cuomo and the legislative leaders have agreed to study this issue. There were also these developments in Albany this week: Utilities A group of 52 Assembly members, joined by some labor unions and consumer groups, has called for gradual state acquisition of New York State's private utilities as a way of reducing rates. The Governor has expressed interest in the idea, but the sweeping measure received a cool reception in the State Senate. ''It's not going to be paid too much attention to over here,'' said Raymond W. Hull Jr., a chief aide to Senator Dale M. Volker, chairman of the Energy Committee and a Depew Republican. ''We have a lot of important issues to consider, and I doubt we will get to this one.'' Supporters said the measure would reduce rates, because a state-owned utility would not have to pay Federal taxes and would not have to make a profit. They put the savings to customers at between 10 and 15 percent. Under the proposal, the state would buy the utilities through the sale of tax- exempt bonds by the New York Power Authority. The bonds would be repaid through customers' bills. The bill's supporters said that these interest charges would be lower than the charges now paid to utilities to finance their investments, and that rates would therefore go down. ''The utilities of ths state have brought us near to bankruptcy and will soon make electricity a luxury, as it was 60 years ago,'' the legislators said in their letter to Mr. Cuomo. ''The Governor is interested in the concept, but is not ready to rush into it,'' said Stephen J. Morello, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo. ''The legal and fiscal complications involved are enormous and could endanger any reductions in rates.'' Wine A Senate panel, in an attempt to help the state's ailing wine industry, has proposed increasing taxes on out-of- state wine and reducing taxes on wine made in New York. Under the proposal, the tax on out-of- state wine would go to 25 cents a gallon from the current 12 cents, and the 12- cent-a-gallon tax on New York wine would be dropped. The measure's supporters say the proposal would produce $12 million in additional revenue, which would be used to pay for promotion and research programs to increase the sales of state wines. It would remain in effect for two years. The panel, composed of Senate Republicans, said 16 stqtes already taxed out-of-state wines. A challenge to a similar measure in Hawaii is now before the United States Supreme Court. The panel also supported several measures proposed by the Governor to help the wine growers, including allowing the sale of New York wines in grocery stores, and allowing the sale of wines at tourist shops and fairs. Senator Anderson, the majority leader, has raised constitutional questions about selling solely New York wines in grocery stores. The proposal faces significant opposition in the Assembly, too. David Langdon, a spokesman for Speaker Fink, said the Speaker had not yet studied the Senate plan. He said the Assembly expected to seek to provide some relief to the state's grape growers this year. Billboards As he did last year, Mr. Cuomo vetoed a measure that would have required municipalities to compensate the owners of billboards that are removed because of local laws. In explaining his veto, Mr. Cuomo said, ''The cash expenditures required by the bill would have deterred local efforts to improve the visual and aesthetic appearance of urban and rural environments.'' Existing law requires municipalities to provide a reasonable period to allow owners to recoup their investment and realize a reasonable profit. Under Federal law, the state stands to lose between $40 million and $70 million in Federal transportation aid if it does not approve some sort of compensation legislation. But in his veto message, the Governor said, ''This bill goes far beyond what is needed to protect the state from a loss of Federal funds.''

807-> LONG ISLAND JOURNAL
A BIBLICAL injunction instructs farmers to leave a corner of the field for the poor to glean or pick. Since few Long Islanders have farms to leave ungleaned, a group from the Melville-Dix Hills area is doing what the members consider the next best thing: They are going out into the fields themselves to glean for the poor. Sponsored by the Social Action Committee of Temple Beth Torah in Dix Hills, the group includes members of that congregation, of the Honor Society at Burr's Lane Junior High School, also in Dix Hills, and parishioners of King of Kings Lutheran Church in Melville. Several hundred people are expected to participate in today's gleaning project. They will wander into the fields, actually Meyer's Farm Stand, and, in the shadow of the Long Island Expressway, fill bushel baskets with string beans, tomatoes and green peppers hand-picked from the vines. The produce will then be donated to the Long Island Regional Food Bank for distribution to several day care facilities and centers for the elderly as well as emergency food pantries. The project started modestly two years ago, involving fewer than 20 people. But soon word spread in the community, and ''Gleaning Day'' now has become an annual event, with parents and their children participating. Accounting for the enthusiastic support of this project, Marc Gellman, Temple Beth Torah's rabbi, said: ''Good deeds transform not only the world but the doer; they are small steps in helping us overcome selfishness that is damaging to the soul.'' Those who wish to join the gleaning project should be at Meyer's Farm Stand on Old Country Road in Melville at 1 P.M. today. In this year of 1984, Hofstra University is taking a look at the prophetic writings of George Orwell, subject of the school's 26th International Scholarly Conference, to be held on the campus in Hempstead Thursday through Saturday. Papers will be presented by Orwellian scholars who are coming from Britain, Canada, Singapore, Malta, the Netherlands and Italy to examine what Natalie Datloff, assistant director of Hofstra's Cultural Center and conference coordinator, calls ''the literary, social, political and legal implications of George Orwell's writings 36 years after the publication of his most famous work.'' ''How can you get through 1984 and not consider Orwell?'' Mrs. Datloff asked. Among the guest speakers will be the British scholar William J. West, who discovered misfiled Orwell documents and letters in the BBC archives, including 62 radio scripts broadcast by Orwell providing a weekly commentary on World War II, thought to be lost in the London blitz. On Thursday at 4:30 P.M. Mr. West will give an address on ''A Dialogue With William J. West - the New BBC Orwell Manuscripts.'' Five of the scripts are still known to be missing, among them a five-minute birthday tribute to Adolf Hitler, presumed to be satirical. Among the special guests are the Russian dissident Alexander Shagin, formerly chief artist at the Leningrad mint, who settled in the United States in 1979, in Los Angeles. The most significant works of Mr. Shagin, who designed an Orwell bronze medal in honor of the year (84 were struck, and one purchased by Hofstra will be on display), were a series of medals designed for the Russian Olympic coins issued in 1980 to commemorate the Summer Games in Moscow. Those interested in registering for the conference (a $15 fee includes admittance to all lectures, films and displays, excluding a banquet dinner) may call 560-5669. Both Old Westbury Gardens and the Planting Fields Arboretum will stage special events on Saturday. At the gardens, on Old Westbury Road, there will be a symposium, ''American Gardens: The Influence of the Italian Renaissance,'' an all- day program with lectures, tours and workshops. The fee is $30; reservations may be made by calling 333-0048. The arboretum, in Oyster Bay, will be host its annual fall flower show and sale, with displays, lectures and competitions. Described as the oldest and largest autumn exhibition in the Eastern United States, the show runs through Oct. 21 and is open from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. daily. Admission is $3. (Further information is available by calling 922- 9201.) A traveling version of the exhibition ''Black Wings,'' mounted by the Smithsonian Institution at its National Air and Space Museum in Washington in 1982 and depicting the contributions of black Americans to the history of aviation and space, opens at the Cradle of Aviation Museum at Mitchel Field tomorrow and runs throughout the month. A new segment of the exhibition, developed by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, is ''New York Black Wings,'' which chronicles the achievements of regional black aviation pioneers, their role in aviation history and how they fought discrimination. The exhibition, organized in four parts, covers pioneers at black flight schools of the 1930's, discusses the changing role of blacks in aviation before America's entry into World War II, details black involvement in the war effort and shows the role that blacks played from the closing days of the war to the present, concentrating on black breakthroughs and their continuing presence in aviation, from the era of the first black combat pilot to the designation in 1978 of two black astronaut candidates. Two of the aircraft types used by some of the airmen, the Curtiss P-40 (Tomahawk) and the Republic P-47 (Thunderbolt), part of an extensive collection of aircraft, artifacts and memorabilia, are on display here, among them Republican Aviation's Seabee, F-84 and F-105, the Grumman Corporation's F6F Hellcat, F9F Cougar and F-11A Tiger, as well as an original lunar module. Hours for the free exhibition, sponsored by the Federal Aviation Administration, Eastern Region, and local sponsors, housed in Hangar 3, are 10 A.M. to 2 P.M. weekdays. On weekends (Friday through Monday) the exhibition will be open from noon to 5 P.M. Many people have suggested ways to save the 18th-century Orient Point Inn, on the tip end of Long Island. The present owner, Nicholas Schick, president of Schick Realty International, who bought the landmark inn in 1982, offered to turn it into a convention center if the town would rezone his adjoining 42 acres for condominiums. The town said no. A Greenport real-estate woman wanted to buy it for $75,000 this summer and restore it as a bed-and- breakfast hotel. Mr. Schick turned her down. He wanted $600,000 for the windowless, decayed building and the five or six acres it is built on. His latest offer, Mr. Schick said, was from a Connecticut woman who wants to transport the once- elegant four-story hotel on the Sound and rebuild it. But it's too late. The Southold Town Board says it gave Mr. Schick two years to restore or remove the historic inn, which in its glory days was host to President Grover Cleveland, Walt Whitman, Benjamin Franklin and other notables. Since it has not been removed or restored, the town says it has ordered the inn demolished by Thursday. If it's not gone by then, the town will tear it down and charge the owner. Mr. Schick said that he was getting demolition estimates and that ''we don't want any more headaches.'' Robert MacKay, director of the Society for Preservation of Long Island antiquities, called the Orient Point Inn a testament to the lack of serious landmark control in Southold and other Long Island towns. ''There used to be hundreds of these resort-type hotels around the Island,'' he said. ''Every town had its own, but without penalties in our landmark ordinances we've lost them. The only way to keep what we have left is to put teeth in the ordinances.'' For Town of Hempstead residents living in unincorporated areas, among them Bellmore, Oceanside, Baldwin, Woodmere, North Woodmere and a portion of Lawrence, the publication by the Town Board of a new edition of the Building Zone Ordinance will make it easier to understand existing town building regulations. According to David Vieser , a town spokesman, incorporated villages generally have their own zoning boards and abide by those zoning rules. Mr. Vieser said that only one incorporated village, Atlantic Beach, uses town zoning ordinances. ''There are many details and restrictions that comprise our Building Zone Ordinance, which residents may have occasion to consult,'' said Thomas S. Gulotta, Presiding Supervisor of the Town of Hempstead. Mr. Gulotta said that the rewrite of the existing town code with a codified system, which for the first time includes a full subject index, will help both residents and professionals who need to consult town laws to ascertain what they are allowed to do and if their plans require a variance. Previously, Mr. Vieser said, residents had to wade through a lengthy document that also required additional explanation by the town's Building Department. ''Years ago it was rare that people looked up zoning laws on their own,'' Mr. Vieser said. But today he noted that on Long Island the trend is for more homeowners ''to stay put and improve their homes.'' Pointing out the high cost of construction and fluctuations in interest rates, Mr. Vieser said that homeowners are finding it pays to become more involved ''and do their own homework before they go to a builder or architect.'' The new edition of the Building Zone Ordinance is available for inspection at the Town of Hempstead Building Department at Town Hall Plaza in Hempstead. Copies are also distributed to some area libraries. Those who wish to purchase a book, priced at $25, may call the Building Department at 489-5000, extension 417.

808-> GROUP FINDS VOTERS LACK CHOICES IN MANY SUPREME COURT ELECTIONS
Eighty-seven percent of the elections for New York State Supreme Court justice in the last six years were either uncontested or noncompetitive, according to a group studying the process. The group, the Fund for Modern Courts, examined 188 Supreme Court elections in its study. It said that, since the judicial nominations were in most cases tantamount to election, ''the selection of Supreme Court justices in New York is, by and large, a process controlled not by the voters but by political leaders largely unaccountable to the citizens of New York.'' M. L. Henry Jr., executive director of the fund, said the group favored appointment of all judges by the governor or local mayors and county executives. It also recommended that voters have the opportunity to recall a justice in a referendum after two years' service. Plan Called Unrealistic Under the group's plan, all judicial candidates would be recommended for appointment by bipartisan community panels. These panels would be named by the governor, the chief judge of the Court of Appeals, the appropriate Appellate Division presiding justice, the majority and minority state legislative leaders and the local mayor, county executive or board of supervisors. But Donald J. Sullivan, who was denied renomination to the State Supreme Court last year by the Bronx Democratic chairman, Stanley M. Friedman, told fund members at a luncheon last week in Manhattan that he favored ''a more realistic approach'' than the fund's. ''The voters are still reticent to give up the right to have the final say,'' said Mr. Sullivan, who is now a lawyer in Westchester County. He said in an interview that he favored the current system of nominating and electing judges for initial terms then holding a referendum on a judge's service after the first term, 14 years in the case of Supreme Court judges. Mr. Friedman, the Democratic leader, said an appointive process would amount to ''substituting one set of politics for another.'' A Growing Trend In its report, the fund said that the trend toward bipartisan nominations had accelerated in the last three years to 53 percent of all Supreme Court candidates from 17 percent during the preceding three years. These bipartisan nominations, traditional for sitting judges seeking re- election, have also extended to initial election of judges. In some cases, they stemmed from bipartisan legislative agreements between the Democratic- controlled Assembly and the Republican-controlled State Senate to create judgeships. Mr. Henry attributed much of the increase in bipartisan nominations to agreements between political leaders in the 3d and 8th Judicial Districts. Comprising the Albany and Buffalo areas, respectively, they are two of the judicial districts in the state where the parties are evenly enough matched to have competitive elections. The fund said that, in other areas of the state, Supreme Court and other judicial elections are essentially ''noncompetitive '' because of domination by one party. The report said 91 of the 188 elections in the six-year period - 48 percent - were noncompetitive, and 74 - or 39 percent - were uncontested. The remaining 23 - 13 percent - were competitive, according to the fund. 'Generate Mass Disinterest' Long Island produced an exception to the trend this year when Republican leaders broke the tradition of bipartisan agreements on sitting judges due to squabbles over dividing judicial nominations between the major parties. The report contended that voters know little about judicial candidates and that such campaigns ''generate mass disinterest.'' As a result, voters tend to pass up judicial elections or to vote party labels on judges. Reviewing past elections, the fund said that there was a dropoff of 15 to 58 percent between the vote for the top of a ticket and the Supreme Court vote. The fund also said that even noncompetitive judicial campaigns, ''often serve as fund-raisers, funneling donations from lawyers who may later appear before the judge in court, into the coffers of party organizations.''

809-> FIELD GOAL LIFTS 4-0 DEPAUL
Jim Lacava kicked a 25-yard field goal with 36 seconds left to boost DePaul (4-0) over Millburn, 10-7, yesterday in Millburn. DePaul came back from a 7-0 deficit, driving 55 yards after the second-half kickoff and scoring on Matt Wright's 1-yard plunge. Lacava, who kicked the extra point, added the field goal after DePaul advanced 47 yards on a drive set up by Kevin Melly's interception. Fumble recoveries led to both touchdowns when Clifton (3-0-1) and Montclair settled for a 7-7 tie in Montclair. Jeff Mills recovered a fumble and Clifton drove 19 yards to score on a 1-yard run by Wayne Rose in the third quarter. Quintus McDonald added the placement. A fumble recovery by Owen O'Rourke set up a 16- yard march and Mike Henry's 1-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter. Jack Belanger tied it with his kick. Donnell Powell went 2 yards to a touchdown in the third quarter and lifted Rahway (4-0) over host Scotch Plains, 7-0. Emil Lee returned a punt 32 yards to the Scotch Plains 15 to set up the winning score. Todd Simonson, a senior fullback, ran for 139 yards on 22 carries and scored three touchdowns to spark Union (4-0) to a 42-7 victory over Westfield in Westfield. Simonson scored on runs of 26, 10 and 1 yards. Westfield was limited to 26 yards. Robert Thomas ran for one touchdown and passed for another to lead North Edison (4-0) to a 21-14 victory over Trenton in Edison. Thomas, who scored on a 46-yard run in the second quarter, hit George Boothe with a 12- yard touchdown pass in the third for a 19-8 lead. Michael Frauenheim threw three touchdown passes and Angelo Parenti kicked four extra points and two field goals to lead Immaculata (4-0) to a 34-8 victory over Berkeley Heights in Somerville. Frauenheim, a senior quarterback, ran 1 yard for the first touchdown and passed 9 yards to Dennis Heidt, 70 to Shawn Power and 86 to Glen Gardner for others. Larry Lawson ran for two touchdowns to pace Plainfield past Cranford, 26-6, in Plainfield. Fumble recoveries, including one by Lawson, set up Plainfield's first two touchdowns. Lawson ran in from the 15 and from the 3 for a 12-6 lead. Bill Young scored on twice on 78- yard runs to send Morris Hills (5-0) past Parsippany Hills, 18-7, in Parsippany. Young, a junior, scored on a 78-yard run from scrimmage in the first quarter and returned a kickoff 78 yards into the end zone in the second. Scott Anderson completed a 23-yard pass to Mike Danciak for Morris Hills's first touchdown. Darren Iaione, a junior tailback, scored on a 2-yard run and Chris Dooley kicked the extra point in the third quarter to send host Springfield to a 7-6 victory over Roselle. A 42-yard interception return by Leven Bayrasli set up Springfield's touchdown. Roselle scored in the fourth quarter on Kelvin Grimsley's 1-yard run. The conversion pass failed. Seton Hall Prep (4-0) got two touchdown runs from Greg Ansler and defeated West Milford, 21-14, in West Milford. Ansler's 5-yard run in the fourth quarter broke a 14-14 tie. Ansler, who also kicked three extra points, had opened the scoring with a 2-yard run in the first period. Mark Chegwidden scored from the 1 and John Swenty kicked the extra point in the third quarter to give Morris Catholic a 7-7 tie with Madison Borough (3-0-1) in Denville. Gordon Drewery's 66-yard touchdown run and the placement by Neil O'Donnell gave Madison Borough a 7-0 lead in the first quarter. Rob Neuner threw two touchdown passes to send Bergen Catholic (4-0) to a 21-0 defeat of Paramus Catholic in Paramus. Neuner, who completed 9 of 19 passes for 121 yards, hit Mike Sullivan on a 36-yard pass and John Twomey on a 3-yard pass for touchdowns. Paramus Catholic's deepest penetration was at the Bergen Catholic 26 after a fumble recovery. Mike Grifone capped a long drive with a 14-yard touchdown run in the second quarter to spark Ramapo to a 7-0 victory over Northern Highlands in Ramapo. Ramapo drove 80 yards in 14 plays after a punt for the score. Paul Granatell added the extra-point kick, his 11th straight. Paul Feola threw two touchdown passes to aid Roselle Park's 28-6 victory over Manville in Manville. Roselle Park scored 21 points in the second quarter on Feola's touchown passes of 23 yards to Ed Jachim and 8 yards to Phil Carpenter and Jim Shriner's 25-yard run. Shriner also ran 85 yards to a touchdown and kicked four extra points. Tom Bill ran for one touchdown and passed for two to lead Hunterdon Central past Piscataway, 26-21, in Piscataway. Bill, who completed 26 of 32 passes for 298 yards, scored on a 1-yard run in the second quarter and hit Tim Apgar with a 6-yard pass and Jeff Bias with a 58-yard pass for touchdowns. Steve Hughes, a senior quarterback, completed 12 of 19 passes for 141 yards, ran for one touchdown and passed for two, and intercepted a pass to lead East Brunswick (5-0) to a 31-0 shutout of Woodbridge in East Brunswick. Hughes ran 1 yard to a touchdown and passed 9 yards to Glenn Pazinko and 7 yards to Barry Flannigan for touchdowns.

810-> SPORTS PEOPLE; Kingman Suspended
Dave Kingman, the Oakland A's slugger who is second in the major leagues in home runs (35) and runs batted in (117), may not be able to pick up any ground next week. Yesterday, he was given a three-game suspension by the American League president, Bobby Brown, for charging the mound and touching off a bench- clearing brawl after being hit by the Chicago White Sox pitcher Rich Dotson in a game Sept. 10. It was the 11th suspension Brown has imposed this season, his first as president. The suspension will begin Monday unless Kingman appeals before then.

811-> COLONIAL PENN MERGER IS CALLED OFF
The Colonial Penn Group, a Philadelphia insurer, said yesterday that its planned merger into the St. Regis Corporation had been terminated. The move had been widely expected in light of St. Regis's subsequent agreement to be acquired by the Champion International Corporation. St. Regis already owns a 9.9 percent interest in Colonial Penn, acquired from Leonard Davis, the company's founder, and his family. Champion has agreed to assume St. Regis's obligation to acquire the remaining 12.1 percent Davis interest in Colonial Penn in exchange for Champion convertible adjustable preference stock. Thus Champion would end up owning 22 percent of Colonial Penn. It agreed to limitations with respect to the voting of shares while Colonial Penn seeks another merger partner. St. Regis also said it would reacquire Colonial Penn's holdings of St. Regis preferred stock for $55 a share in cash when it merges with Champion later this year. Colonial Penn sells insurance through direct mailings, and thus avoids the use of the more expensive agent system. Such insurers tap markets for low-premium policies that insurance agents would not pursue. The company reported net income of $10.3 million, or 63 cents a share, in the second quarter, compared with $11.3 million, or 70 cents a share, in the comparable period a year ago. John J. MacWilliams, chairman and chief executive of Colonial Penn, said that, ''given the unusual and difficult circumstances surrounding our merger with St. Regis, we have reached a satisfactory conclusion.'' Colonial Penn and its financial adviser, Morgan Stanley & Company, would proceed ''in an orderly manner to consider other opportunities for the sale or merger of the company.'' Analysts had said that St. Regis's move to acquire Colonial Penn had been engineered to make itself financially unattractive to Rupert Murdoch, the publisher, who had bought a stake in St. Regis. Champion International, a paper and building products company based in Stamford, Conn., then made a friendly $1.8 billion bid for St. Regis, the Philadelphia-based paper company, and ended the Murdoch threat. Champion has said it was interested in St. Regis's paper operations and planned to sell off other interests. The original agreement by St. Regis to buy Colonial Penn, announced in June, was valued at $570 million. Yesterday's move to terminate the deal came after the close of stock trading. Colonial closed at $27, down 25 cents, on the Big Board.

812-> SCOUTING; Quotable Berra
Yogi Berra received a surprise of sorts yesterday. Since the publication of the 15th edition of Bartlett's Familiar Quotations in 1980, Berra has been in the company of William Shakespeare, Abraham Lincoln, Winston Churhill and others who also have added to the richness of the English language. On Page 903 of the compilation of memorable quotations appears the following: ''Yogi (Lawrence Peter) Berra 'The game isn't over till it's over.' Attributed.'' As the Yankees prepared to play the Tigers in Detroit yesterday, Berra said, ''You know, I never heard about that until now.'' ''I said that in 1973 when I was managing the Mets,'' he recalled. ''It was a close race and we were behind late in the season. We finally won the division and the pennant.''' The remark, and variations of it, have been applied so often to sports competitions that its familiarity was acknowledged by the editors at Little, Brown and Company, the publishers of Bartlett's. As Charles Dillon (Casey) Stengel often said, ''You could look it up.'' But Stengel, another masterly phrasemaker, didn't make Bartlett's.

814-> 'DIARY,' ON HUNGARY IN THE 1940'S
Diary for My Children'' by Marta Meszaros, the highly regarded Hungarian director who's best known in this country for ''Adoption,'' ''Women'' and ''Just Like Home,'' is her most politically explicit film yet seen here. That Miss Meszaros was able to make the film at all is some kind of political statement, but the film contains much more. ''Diary for My Children'' will be shown at the New York Film Festival at Alice Tully Hall tonight at 7 and tomorrow at 9:30. Like Juli (Zsuzsa Czinkoczi), the new film's solemn, skeptical teen-age heroine of ''Diary for My Children,'' Miss Meszaros, at the age of 5 migrated to the Soviet Union in 1936 with her father, a sculptor, who was later arrested and then officially disappeared. This new film begins with Juli's return to Hungary in 1947, in the company of her fearful grandparents, to live with her politically committed, Stalinist aunt, Magda (Anna Polony). Though Juli, played with a kind of independent stoicism by Miss Czinkoczi, is the heart of the film, as well as its eyes and ears, it's Magda who is the most complex and interesting character. Once a young, fiery revolutionary who endured prison and torture, Magda survived to see her revolution triumph, after which, for what she considered the greater good, she shaped her principles to fit monolithic Stalinism. It is this stern Magda, the faithful party hack, against whom Juli rebels, at first in minor ways, such as cutting classes to spend hours at the movies, and then by making an irrevocable break. Though the movie never sentimentalizes Magda by suggesting that she would ever deny her life's work, as other Stalinists later did, the character, as written and directed by Miss Meszaros and played by Miss Polony, provides the film with its sorrowful tone. Magda is not a stupid woman. It's one of the better ways in which the film works that it is through the reminiscences of one of Magda's former comrades, who becomes a victim of the Stalinist purges she supports in the late 1940's, that Juli comes to understand something of Magda's sacrifices in the name of the Communist Party and its revolution. To understand Magda, however, is not necessarily to like her. She is a fact of history. Miss Meszaros makes use of a lot of newsreel footage of the period, which is blended with her new material to create an unusually graphic picture of Hungarian political, cultural and social life in the late 40's. One of the funniest, most poignant scenes is a dreary birthday party for the spoiled young son of a party leader. Not so effective, if only because they are redundant, are a series of flashbacks that describe Juli's relations with her father and mother in the Soviet Union and the trauma she experienced on losing them. All of the performances are good, including that of Jan Nowicki, who plays the disillusioned party worker whose imprisonment brings the film to its conclusion. Also good is the black-and-white photography of Miklos Jansco Jr., the son of the talented, extremely independent Hungarian director who has recently worked mostly abroad. The film is also illuminated by everything we know to have happed after ''Diary for My Chidren'' ends, including the aborted Hungarian uprising of 1956, the Soviet invasion and then the gradual thaw that, among other things, has allowed Miss Meszaros to make this movie. The Cast DIARY FOR MY CHILDREN, directed and written by Marta Meszaros; director of photography, Miklos Jancso Jr.; music by Zsolt Dome; a Mafilm-Budapest Studio Production; a New Yorker Films Release. At Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, as part of the 22d New York Film Festival. Running time: 106 minutes. This film has no rating. Juli . . . . . Zsuzsa Czinkoczi Magda . . . . .

818-> Bridge: Alert' System Breaks Down In Use of a Negative Double
The idea of the ''alert'' system, long firmly established in tournament play, is to advise an opponent that something unusual has happened in the bidding. He can therefore infer normality in the absence of an alert. In one specific situation the alert has turned topsy-turvy. The negative double, a novely when it was introduced three decades ago, has become normal. So the low-level double of an overcall is almost always alerted, and when it is not the opponents suspect an oversight. The diagramed deal occurred during the crucial final session of the Grand National zonal playoffs in Port Chester, N.Y. The South player for New York, Brian Glubok, ventured a one-heart overcall of one club. West doubled with a hand that might be suitable for either type. An Unwise Assumption There was no alert, but the North player, Edgar Kaplan, unwisely assumed the negative variety, in which case his opponent had forgotten the customary, almost inevitable, alert. He contributed an optimistic preemptive raise to three hearts. East and West were Robert Stone and Howard Piltch, who are one of the few regular partnerships who do not employ the negative double. Piltch, who had doubled for penalties at the one-level, was surprised and delighted to have another opportunity at the three-level. He led his singleton club, and when Stone won with the ace he returned the deuce. This was a suit-preference signal for diamonds, so Piltch now led that suit and received another club ruff. The defense still had to score the heart queen and three aces, so the result was down four for 1,100. In the replay the New York players reached four spades for 650, so New England gained 10 international match points. This helped them defeat their famous opponents, a foursome that included two world champions, by 28 points. Kaplan, who invented the alert system, now recommends a change. If he gets his way, the normal negative doubler will say nothing, and the handful of traditional positive doublers, like Piltch and Stone, will have to alert.

823-> SENATORS WARNED TO KEEP SECRETS
The Senate Republican and Democratic leaders formally warned their colleagues today that Senate rules prohibited disclosure of intelligence information obtained from the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence or any other sources. The warning, sought by the intelligence committee, was made in a letter to each senator from Howard H. Baker Jr., Republican of Tennessee, the majority leader, and Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, the minority leader. They noted that Senate Resolution 400, which set up the intelligence committee, barred disclosure without committee approval of intelligence material obtained from the committee or any other source. The letter was prompted by a written request from the chairman and vice chairman of the intelligence committee, representing the unanimous views of committee members. This request, made in a hand-delivered, ''eyes only'' letter that is now in the committee's safe, cited disclosures by Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, about the role of the Central Intelligence Agency in the presidential election in El Salvador. Mr. Helms has vehemently denied he disclosed information obtained from the intelligence committee. He has said he got his information from sources in El Salvador. Undermining Confidence The letter sent today said: ''The appearance that details of proceedings before the intelligence committee or sensitive information before the intelligence committee are being discussed in open session on the floor, or in any other manner not authorized by S. Res. 400, cannot help but undermine the mutual confidence that must exist between the committee and the intelligence community if congressional oversight of intelligence activities is to be effective.'' It cautioned: ''If any senator receives information about alleged intelligence activities from sources other than the intelligence committee, he or she should bear in mind that such information may well be classified and the subject of the committee's oversight. Accordingly, he should seek the advice of the committee before making any public comment.'' Senators Barry M. Goldwater, Republican of Arizona, committee chairman, and Daniel P. Moynihan, Democrat of New York, vice chairman, said in their letter that although they cited the conduct of Mr. Helms there was no conclusive evidence that he had violated Senate rules, according to those familiar with the letter. However, Mr. Helms's conduct was severely criticized at a meeting at which Mr. Goldwater and Mr. Moynihan showed the letter to the Senate leaders, according to those familiar with the meeting. ''He certainly did an extraordinary thing,'' one committee member said of Mr. Helms. Mr. Helms said today that he had started a Senate Ethics Committee inquiry to determine who leaked the Goldwater-Moynihan letter to The New York Times, in violation of the Senate rules. He charged Mr. Moynihan with the leak because, he said, Mr. Moynihan was supporting Gov. James B. Hunt Jr. of North Carolina, a Democrat who is seeking to unseat Mr. Helms in his campaign for re-election this fall. ''Senator Moynihan is again playing politics, and that's all it is,'' Senator Helms said. Aid to Presidential Candidate Senator Helms disclosed on the Senate floor last week that the agency had given to the campaign of Jose Napoleon Duarte ''comprehensive, across-the- board services,'' including money for precinct organizers, radio and television advertisements and computer vote registration. This information was identical to information given to the Senate Intelligence Committee two days earlier by the C.I.A, according to three committee members. In his speech, Mr. Helms also referred to the intelligence committee's briefing by the C.I.A., which the committee members said was the first disclosure that the agency had acknowledged its role in the Salvadoran elections. Mr. Helms said that he received this information not from the committee but from a radio broadcast in San Salvador.

825-> LONDON'S BLOSSOMING CHELSEA DISPLAY
When Robin Herbert, the new president of the Royal Horticultural Society, was in America studying for an M.B.A. at Harvard, he would escape frequently to the Arnold Arboretum in Boston to study the trees. Now a London banker, he is overseeing his first Chelsea Flower Show, the 27-acre gardening extravaganza, which opened Tuesday and which the society has sponsored since l9l3 on the grounds of the Royal Hospital in Chelsea. The great symmetrical wings of Christopher Wren's l692 brick complex on an embankment overlooking the Thames are rivaled for this week only by the three-and-a-half-acre Great Marquee, an enormous nine-peaked white tent that houses ll8 floral exhibits. Surrounding the marquee, along avenues lined with pink-blossomed chestnut trees are l7 exhibitions of outside gardens. In addition, there are l80 dealers of gardening books and equipment and furniture. The point is that what is on show inside and out is also for sale: the plants and trees are sold at the end of the event. The various floral classes were judged on Monday, and the show was visited by Queen Elizabeth II, the Prince and Princess of Wales and Princess Margaret. According to the show's manager, Allan Sawyer, some quarter of a million people will have seen the displays by Friday afternoon when it closes. ''Time was, 60 years ago,'' says Mr. Herbert, ''that people came with their gardeners, ordered their plants directly from the exhibitors, and then these were delivered in the fall with a bill.'' Now, visitors try to order the featured specimens directly from their local nurseries as well as from the exhibitors, the majority of whom are nurserymen themselves, some with chains of garden centers. Mainly, the Chelsea Flower Show is the annual meeting place to view the new species and cultivars, and particularly this year, contemporary ideas in landscape design. The regeneration of inner-city housing prompted The Sunday Times's contest for its outdoor exhibit of three l2-by-l6-foot front gardens for Victorian terrace houses, those rows of attached working class dwellings that line the streets of England's industrial cities. Three identical brick row-house facades, with curtained bay windows, entrance doors and front gardens with garden gates provide the framework. The winners used beds raised to the level of the walls to provide privacy as well as climbing vines on trellises. Other outside exhibition gardens include an l884 Victorian villa garden, with circular beds and a rustic summerhouse to commemorate Amateur Gardening magazine's centenary, and a medieval herb garden with an arbor of apple and pear trees trained in arched cordons. Inside the marquee, the show stopper is a 12-foot-high mounted guard and sentry box of reddish-green alternanthera and green echeveria created by personnel of the Borough of Tor Bay parks department. Their specialty is carpet bedding, the closely planted plots of brilliantly colored flowers that are a feature of their local Devon parks and surround the Tor Bay exhibit as well. Amid the mounds of rhododendron and clematis and arches upon arches of roses, the visitor observes that the new colors emphasized in the Chelsea Flower Show are gentler: apricots, blush pinks and pale yellows, which the nurserymen now say make better blends in gardens. The cool and restrained planting of Beth Chatto, an author and nursery owner, is on a miniature hillside. She plants uphill in triangular formations of plants chosen for their interesting leaf patterns, and each side represents a different growing condition - shade, damp or dry. The great variety of soils is what makes English gardens challenging, and several exhibitors featured special plantings with this in mind. One nursery created a singular laburnum arbor arching over a canal, with plantings on either side for alkaline soil and acid soil. Another exhibit planted for the chalky soil of the Cotswolds featured dry-stone walls and a lawn accented with spiral plantings of chamomile. No garden in England is complete without a traditional garden seat, and among the many companies showing versions of these is Chatsworth Carpenters, a design collaboration between the Duchess of Devonshire and the interior designer David A. Mlinaric. Many of the wood benches, like the slat-backed Peacock seat, the orignal version of which was used by Sir Edwin Lutyens and Gertrude Jekyll, are used at Chatsworth, the Derbyshire seat of the Dukes of Devonshire. The Duchess was on hand at her booth. As Queen Elizabeth said recently at the opening of the International Garden Festival at Liverpool: ''Gardening has been a national occupation for centuries. There cannot be any other occuption that absorbs equally every section of society.'' In London, this week, one wonders who was home minding the gardens.

826-> NEW YORK DAY BY DAY
Accolade At 8:40 A.M. yesterday, a police car, siren wailing, pulled up in front of Robert Colon's house in West New Brighton, S.I. Neighbors popped their heads out to look and so did Robert Colon, a little sheepishly. ''They're probably thinking,'' he said, '' 'I always realized that kid was going to get into trouble!' '' The police car whisked him to headquarters, and there, instead of getting into trouble, the 17-year-old high school senior was sworn in as Police Commissioner for a day. The youth won the honor by writing an essay on closer cooperation between the police and the public in a contest sponsored by the Police Athletic League. After the swearing-in, he went to the Commissioner's office and sank into the chair normally occupied by Benjamin Ward. ''Hey, this is nice,'' he said. Asked whether there was any advice he could pass on, Mr. Ward said, ''Make sure you get a medicine chest to go with the pens and pencils because there are lots of headaches in the job.'' He doesn't plan to go into police work, Robert Colon said, leaning back in the chair. He wants to be a lawyer and get into politics. He was obliged to cut his term as Commissioner short. At 3 P.M., he had to go to a local TV station where he was a finalist in another contest - editorial writing.

828-> ART:ANTES 'VOTIVES' AT GUGGENHEIM
-Expressionism rolled in several years ago, there was the German painter Horst Antes who had been exhibiting work of highly Expressionist persuasion in this country since 1967. His obsessive motif is a gnomish little figure - derived from Picasso out of Etruscan and more archaic art - of a man whose big-eyed, helmet-shaped head rides his legs without benefit of torso. This hieratic homunculus (sometimes it's a woman, a couple, several figures; sometimes it's normally shaped) gropes and gesticulates in a tight, claustrophobic cosmos where homey symbols commingle topsy-turvily with those of more poetic and spiritual allusion. In 1983, disturbed by the Falkland War and the threat of nuclear destruction, Antes turned to a different method of picture-making, producing a group of tiny ''sculptural environments'' in gold and transparent acrylic. Called ''Votives,'' they are - I suppose - to be taken literally as offerings to the gods. In these, on view at the Guggenheim Museum, Fifth Avenue and 89th Street (through Nov. 25), the figures and symbols of his painting, now shaped from the thinnest of gold sheet or clear acrylic, are deployed in small Plexiglas boxes, often - despite their scale - to dramatic effect. And he exhibits a new and rather different group of paintings at the Lefebre Gallery, 47 East 77th Street (through Nov. 10). For the ''Votives,'' his vocabulary of images is small - the odd little humanoids, with details embossed in the gold by a blade or a fingernail; flattened, two-dimensional props such as chairs, tables and partitions of clear acrylic; spoons, offering bowls, floral blooms, stylized spermatozoa as fecundity symbols. And there are several motifs from Hopi Indian culture, in which his interest runs deep: a jagged horned serpent, a ladder, a stylized rain cloud. In each box, several of these paper-thin icons are placed to form a spare, non- narrative tableau, which at times seems merely a formal exercise in spatial relationships, at others, when it really works, a myth touching on psychological themes. Flight from the world, for instance, is depicted in several ''Votives,'' one of which portrays a figure that vomits, then vanishes into a giant head; another, a rather Gauguinesque scene of an infant returning into its mother's body, watched by a despairing male figure that could be its adult self. A more accepting mood prevails in a splendid piece called ''7 Flowers,'' in which a small man stands in puzzlement, a ladder leaning against him, in a jungle of tall, aggressive flowers, while around him horned serpents cavort and a golden spoon lies nearby. The flowers are the world; the ladder, the joyous snakes and the spoon seem to offer means of survival. In other hands, this could be very heavy stuff. Yet in this scale, the combination of opaque gold and sheer acrylic works with surprising effectiveness, and the dazzling orchestration of the figures and props (viewed through either end of the box, rather than its side, their thinness making razor cuts into space) in their tiny crystalline chambers confers on the best of them an unexpected monumentality. Among a number of paintings at the Lefebre Gallery, a grand-scale frieze offers on canvas a decorative, shallow-space anthology of Antes's themes. At left stands a heavy-headed, thick-lipped priestly figure, confronted by a horned serpent. Behind it loom a male and a female idol, each rendered like a ''primitive'' statue. A large head, a pair of floating spoons, a chair in skewed perspective to the floor, and a rain-cloud motif complete the picture, brushily grounded in a delicate bedroom pink. Almost nothing of the earlier Antes tension is here, and for all its size, it dosn't compare in drama with the tiny ''Votives.'' Its syntax and emotional temperature make it very much of the Neo-Expressionist breed. Also of interest this week: Ida Applebroog (Ronald Feldman Fine Arts, 31 Mercer Street): The small, cartoony panel strips in which Ida Applebroog has - for some time now - been scoring off humanity's cliches, are upstaged here by a group of large paintings and multi-panel drawings. Some of the drawings, in color and black and white, with captions, are wonderful; in them Applebroog breaks out of her rigid ''cartoon'' formula, and line flows gaily. One 11-panel work starts out with a vertical drawing of a man lifting up a woman; then the drawing is sliced to lose its bottom half and turned on its side so that for the next nine panels their posture is one of love-making. Nothing clinical, mind you, but very wittily observed. The paintings, which deal with the theme of ''inmates''- in hospitals, old folks' homes, and so forth - are more problematical. In these the canvas is generally divided into two unequal parts, the larger bearing the main image, the smaller, what's presumably a comment on it. In ''Riverdale Home for the Aged,'' for instance, we get - on a densely painted black ground - a back view of an old woman in a worn, shapeless coat, equipped with purse and shopping bag. She's colored a shrieking pink. By contrast, on the narrow strip of canvas alongside of this image, a beautiful, languid youth in bikini shorts looks dreamily out a window. Or, in ''Willow Point V.A.,'' a blown- up cartoon drawing in black and white of a Boy Scout saluting has, in the sleeve of the scout's uniform, an echoing salute, this time rendered by a grim-looking military man. A narrow frieze at the top of the canvas contains fragmentary scenes of grief and disablement, presumably pointing up what military salutes can lead to. Not to carp at the artist's concepts, as paintings , they simply don't seem substantial enough to justify their scale. Applebroog the less pretentious needler has more appeal. One of her small, old-style cartoon panel strips here shows a man seated by the bedside of a prostrate woman. Watching her closely for several silent panels, he finally says, ''Your eggs are getting cold.'' (Through Nov. 24.) ''On 42d Street: Artists' Visions'' (Whitney Museum at Philip Morris, 120 Park Avenue at 42d Street): Would you believe that in 1901 the elite met to eat on 42d Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, as painted by William Glackens in ''Hammerstein's Roof Garden'' of that year? Forty-second Street's glamour has tarnished somewhat since then, but the street has always had, if not class, a certain visual impact. As evidence, this branch of the Whitney Museum, a recent addition to the thoroughfare, presents the work of 24 artists who have seen 42d Street in its full gamut of 20th-century incarnations, from splendor to sleaze. Red Grooms's homage, from his famous environment ''Ruckus Manhattan,'' takes the form of a huge panel titled in mock neon, ''Girls, Girls, Girls,'' and arrayed with three pairs of stuffed street figures - two policemen, two grifters, two ''girls,'' each pair sharing a single set of legs. Both Christo and Chryssa are represented, he with a collaged photo that proposes the wrapping of the Allied Chemical Tower, she with a blinking set of abstract neon motifs that represents Times Square. The environmental sculptor Mary Miss contributes a model for her ''42d Street Project,'' a serious structure of walkways, balconies and a sunken water tank. By contrast, there's Claes Oldenburg's proposal for a Times Square monument - a colossal, half-peeled banana lying on its side. With such additional talents as Richard Estes, Richard Haas, John Held Jr., Alex Katz, Joyce Kozloff, Saul Steinberg and Mark Tobey, the show - assembled by Susan Lubowsky, director of the branch museum - pays spirited tribute to this razzle- dazzle street. (Through Dec. 5.) Philip Trusttum (Kornblee Gallery, 20 West 57th Street): A New Zealander making his American debut, Philip Trusttum celebrates his family's doings in big, folksy collages that cleverly combine drawing and painting with cloth cut-outs. A relatively simple one is ''Us,'' in which he and his wife lie sleeping, their heads and bodies indicated by flat, crudely scissored burlap shapes, a quilt drawn up halfway in a colorful, almost aboriginal arrangement of lines and dots. More complex is ''Martin's Clothes,'' a multi-layered work commenting on his adolescent son's sartorial interests. Its paper-doll-like central figure, intricately cut out of and into the canvas, is appliqued with five layers of raucous wearables, pressed onto each other by means of Velcro strips. A strong, free hand with paint and patterning gives this work a manic vitality. (Through Wednesday.)

Foreign Minister Claude Cheysson said today that concern expressed in the United States about the withdrawal of French troops from Chad without a Libyan pullout corresponded ''to the Americans' desire to show that their way of dealing with Nicaragua is the right one.'' ''There's also the desire perhaps to give us indirect advice to deal with the Libyans like they do with Nicaragua,'' Mr. Cheysson said before he took off for Washington, where he will have discussions with Secretary of State George P. Shultz. ''France was not convinced about the American approach in Nicaragua.'' He repeated French statements that French troops might return to Chad, but did not indicate if France had given Libya a date for taking action.

833-> Feldstein Sees Tax Increase WASHINGTON, Oct. 30,
(Reuters) - Martin S. Feldstein, the former top economic adviser to the Reagan Administration, said today that the Administration would probably raise taxes in 1985, despite President Reagan's insistence in the election campaign that he is against it. Addressing a conference of thrift institution executives here, Mr. Feldstein said that the President would eventually accept a tax increase to bring down the huge Federal budget deficits. ''He'll bring down spending as much as possible, but then in the end he will accept an increase in taxes as a political compromise with Congress,'' said Mr. Feldstein, who left the White House in July. On Monday, Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan repeated the Administration line to the same conference, ruling out any tax increases during a second Reagan term. Mr. Feldstein, now an economics professor at Harvard University, clashed repeatedly with other officials over the issue of tax increases during his 20 months in the Administration.

834-> TRIBES DISPUTE RIGHT TO HUNT ON INDIAN LAND
A century ago, white hunters nearly wiped out the bison that fed and clothed the Plains Indians. Today Shoshone Indians are fighting again to preserve the few big game animals left on their reservation. But this time their opponent is another Indian tribe and the battlefield is a Federal court. The Shoshone and Arapaho tribes have shared the two-million-acre Wind River Reservation 280 miles northwest of here for more than 100 years. The issue dividing them is a hunting code, imposed by the Federal Bureau of Indian Affairs in July at the request of the Shoshone, who contended that unrestricted hunting had depleted deer and antelope herds and threatened the elk population. The code limits the number of animals that may be taken and regulates hunting from four-wheel-drive vehicles. But the Arapaho tribe repeatedly opposed the hunting code and finally filed suit in Federal District Court challenging the bureau's authority to impose it. The suit was dismissed, but the tribal lawyer, Dale White, has said the tribe will appeal. The Shoshone's lawyer says the Arapaho have no right to intervene. Old Tribal Enmity The tribes were enemies when the Federal Government settled 1,000 Arapaho on the reservation 10 years after it was created for the Shoshone in the Fort Bridger Treaty of 1868. The Government granted the Shoshone cash compensation in 1938 for Arapaho use of the reservation. And 30 years ago, the tribes formed a joint business council to deal with such common interests as oil and gas production on the reservation. But many decisions are still made by separate tribal governments, and the rivalry continues. ''There are tensions between the tribes, and this is one of them,'' said Ken Guido of Washington, a lawyer for the Shoshone. Hunting Rights Are Major Issue Mr. Guido said he believed the major issue was preserving of hunting rights guaranteed to the Shoshone by treaty. The use of four-wheel-drive vehicles opened up the reservation, creating unprecedented hunting pressure that could wipe out deer, antelope, elk, moose and big horn sheep, according to Mr. Guido and witnesses he produced in court. But the Arapaho tribe resists the game code, which it regards as an erosion of tribal sovereignty. Tribe members also say they distrust Bureau of Indian Affairs game figures. Dale White of Boulder, Colo., a lawyer for the Arapaho Indians, said the tribe does not like ''the B.I.A. coming in - I wouldn't say it's anything because of bad blood.'' Richard Whitesell, the bureau's area director in Billings, Mont., imposed the game code. He said he was reluctant to do so, but felt the code was necessary. ''Maybe a little bit of the tribal rivalry is surfacing at this point,'' said Mr. Whitesell, superintendent at Wind River in 1982-83. Arapaho Have Hunting Tradition ''I think the Arapaho traditionally are hunters,'' he said. ''It would appear to them they have a treaty right to hunt and fish on the reservation as they see fit. I think that sticks in their craw more than anything else.'' He said the bureau-imposed code was just temporary, until the Arapaho and Shoshone agreed on a code of their own. In court, Mr. Guido raised the question whether the Arapaho had any hunting rights on the reservation. He noted that only the Shoshone signed the 1868 treaty, and said the limited Federal compensation for the uninvited Arapaho did not include hunting and fishing. But Mr. Whitesell said: ''As far as we're concerned, it's a jointly owned reservation.'' Mr. White called the attack on Arapaho treaty rights ''gratuitous,'' saying: ''It probably will cause some short-term bad blood between the tribes. It can't help but do that.'' John Washakie, a member of the Shoshone Business Council, defended the burerau action. He said the Arapaho and Shoshone would discuss the code again in the next month. ''I'm hopeful the two tribes will get together,'' he said.

835-> Work on Secret Shuttle Trip
With astronauts and space officials still glowing over their first space salvage mission, technicians started preparing the space shuttle Discovery for a top-secret Defense Department flight in January. Discovery was towed into a processing hangar Friday just a few hours after the ship and its crew of four men and one woman landed here with two communications satellites that were plucked from useless orbits in daring space walks. Jesse Moore, director of the shuttle program for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, reported that the shuttle ''looks like she's in excellent shape,'' and there should be little trouble getting it ready for the next mission, scheduled to start Jan. 21 or Jan. 22. The shuttle Challenger originally was to have flown the secret Defense Department payload Dec. 8. But that spacecraft is undergoing extensive repairs to thermal tiles damaged in its last mission in October and will not be ready for several weeks. Because of the high priority the Pentagon places on the mission, it was decided to shift Discovery to the assignment. The Spacelab flight that Discovery originally had been scheduled to fly in January is being delayed.

836-> THE WORLD ; Food to EthiopiaIs Still Short
Food from the United States and other Western countries, sometimes transported on Soviet planes, was reaching hundreds of thousands of famished Ethiopians last week. But relief officials warned that many more, especially in remote or war- ravaged parts of the country, were still in danger. ''Nobody knows how many people are dying at home or while walking to a center,'' a Western official said. Efforts to get food deep into the countryside have been complicated by the activities of several guerrilla groups. Last week there were widespread reports of clashes between Government troops and rebels of Tigrayan People's Liberation Front, which is seeking independence for the northern province of Tigre. Fighting around the airport near the town of Korem cut off food for thousands of drought victims for a time. Relief officials said the lives of more than six million Ethiopians - possibly 15 percent of the population - were at risk. Death rates in many of the 100 refugee camps, where about half a million Ethiopians are being fed daily, have dropped dramatically since the food started flowing in late October. But Tafari Wassen of the Ethiopian Government's rescue commission said new supplies were slow in arriving from abroad. The United Nations emergency coordinator for Ethiopia, Kurt Gunnar Jansson, said 200,000 tons of grain had reached that country, less than half the 430,000 tons pledged and only about a quarter of the 800,000 tons that Mr. Jansson estimated would be needed to halt starvation. ''The pipeline has to be refueled,'' he warned.

837-> COWBOYS GAIN TIE FOR FIRST
Gary Hogeboom threw a 26-yard fourth- quarter touchdown pass to Ron Springs to break a 17-17 tie today as the Dallas Cowboys took advantage of six turnovers to beat the St. Louis Cardinals, 24-17. The victory left the Cowboys tied with Washington for first place in the National Conference East, both with 7-4 records. The Cardinals are 6-5. Hogeboom's toss to Springs with 9 minutes 3 seconds left came three plays after Victor Scott had intercepted a Neil Lomax pass that had been tipped away from Roy Green by Dennis Thurman. St. Louis fumbled four times and was intercepted twice. A Cardinal touchdown was called back because of offensive pass interference, and a St. Louis field-goal attempt was blocked to set up the Cowboys' first score. Lomax was also sacked six times. Trailing by 17-7 at the half, the Cardinals took less than two minutes to take the ball 62 yards for a touchdown as Lomax began to find Green, held to only 25 yards in three catches before intermission. The key play came on third-and-1 situation from the Dallas 25, when Lomax hit Green on the 1. On the next play, Lomax flipped off a scramble to Randy Love for the touchdown to cut the lead to 17-14. Neil O'Donoghue's 30-yard field goal tied the game for the Cardinals. But St. Louis kept getting thwarted by its own mistakes, including an offensive interference call on Green that nullified a 39-yard TD pass from Lomax. Redskins 28, Lions 14 WASHINGTON (AP) - Otis Wonsley scored three touchdowns as Washington continued its mastery over Detroit Keith Griffin, a rookie subbing for the injured John Riggins, rushed for 114 yards as the Redskins downed the Lions for the ninth straight time, the longest current streak for one team over another in the National Football League. The victory raised the Redskins' record to 7-4. The Lions (3-7-1) have never won in Washington in 12 tries. Wonsley, who usually serves as Riggins's blocking back in short- yardage situations, was called on with Riggins sidelined by a back injury. He responded with two 1-yard touchdowns as the Redskins took a 21-0 lead at the half. The touchdowns were his first in a regular season game in four years as a pro. Wonsley scored his third touchdown in the third quarter, from the 3-yard line, giving Washington a 28-0 lead three minutes into the second half. The Lions closed the gap to 28-14 before the end of the quarter on James Jones's 1-yard touchdown run and a 19-yard pass from Gary Danielson to Rob Rubick.

838-> ABROAD AT HOME; MEANING WHAT WE SAY
BOSTON Around the world brutal governments torment their people, and often the United States can do frustratingly little to stop them. But sometimes we do have leverage. Such an opportunity is at hand now: a chance to restrain Gen. Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship in Chile. This week the Inter-American Development Bank is due to vote on hundreds of millions of dollars in proposed loans to Chile. The U.S. vote will be crucial. By opposing the loans we would send a necessary message to General Pinochet - and, incidentally, would also serve our political self-interest and our law. At a time when there is movement toward democracy in various Latin- American countries, Chile is going in the opposite direction. Eleven years after the military coup that overthrew the elected Government of Salvador Allende, General Pinochet is tightening the screws of repression. Two weeks ago he imposed a state of siege, shut down all opposition newspapers and banned political activity. A photograph published in U.S. newspapers last week brought the nightmare of Pinochet's Chile to us. It showed 5,000 men and boys held at gunpoint in a Santiago football stadium. They had been taken en masse - every male between the ages of 16 and 60 - in a military sweep of the shantytown La Victoria. It was the second such massive raid on a crowded slum town in a week. Each time all the men were taken away in buses and held for many hours while they were checked by secret police. Then hundreds were marched off to detention, the rest released and told to walk home. ''This is done to terrify and punish the population,'' a priest in La Victoria, Father Pierre Dubois, said. With political voices silenced, the Catholic Church has spoken out strongly against the intensified repression. The Government has started to move against the church, among other things refusing to let the head of its human rights office back into the country when he visited Rome. The Archbishop of Santiago, Juan Francisco Fresno, is a conservative whose appointment was hailed by the Government. Last week he called General Pinochet's repressive moves ''a grave reversal for understanding and peace'' in Chile and said they had provoked ''disquiet, fear and anguish.'' What the Archbishop and others fear is that the rigidity of General Pinochet - his refusal to countenance a gradual return to democracy - is working to divide Chile between extremes of left and right. And that obviously must be a concern for the U.S., too. The United States has been involved in Chile's political fate for a long time now. When the left-wing Allende Government came to office, President Nixon vowed to do what he could to destroy it. He told aides to ''make the economy scream.'' He had Henry Kissinger head a committee to see that international lending agencies cut Chile off. In the three Allende years, 1970-1973, the Inter-American Development Bank and the World Bank together lent Chile less than $12 million. In the first three Pinochet years, 1973-76, they lent Chile more than $300 million. The Reagan Administration has been particularly friendly to General Pinochet. Jeane Kirkpatrick met him early on. Last September, when he celebrated the anniversary of the coup, European diplomats stayed away; the U.S. Ambassador was there. Reagan gestures have gone so far as to strain - many would say to break - the law. A law passed by Congress in 1977 requires U.S. delegates on international lending agencies to vote against loans to countries with a consistent pattern of human rights violations: torture, for example, or prolonged detention without trial. Torture is endemic in Pinochet's Chile. People are routinely detained and sent off to remote regions, or held without trial in prison camps. The Carter Administration, obeying the law, opposed loans to Chile. President Reagan abruptly changed that policy in 1981. He also restored Export- Import Bank financing of Chilean purchases here, which had been cut off when the Pinochet Government refused to hand over to the secret police officials who planned the murder of the former foreign minister, Orlando Letelier, in Washington. Chile is heavily dependent on foreign loans. Four new ones, totaling $340 million, are pending in the Inter- American Development Bank - two due to come up this week. For the United States to support them at a moment of flagrant tyranny in Chile would be not only indecent but stupid. The Reagan Administration has said repeatedly that it wants Chile to move toward democracy. Here is a chance to show that those words mean something.B

839-> TOPICS ; Afloat in New YorkMacy's first marched its Thanksgiving Day parade down Broadway in 1924 as a holiday event to engage its ''family'' of employees. The kinship now extends to millions who watch along the parade route or on television across the country.
In 1924, according to The Times, Santa arrived at Macy's newly expanded Herald Square store ''with a retinue of clowns, freaks, animals and floats.'' Today's star attractions are the giant balloons that first appeared in 1927 when an air-filled Felix the Cat rode on a float. This year's feline was a helium-filled Garfield, awesome, but inanimate. The real life is down on the street. Squads of handlers, all from Macy's, scurry about to keep their monsters in tow past buildings, trees and unpredictable air currents. A dozen high school bands that have won out against dozens of others nationwide keep the parade moving. Floats carry along Cabbage Patch dolls, the gang from Hill Street Blues, Placido Domingo atop a big red apple. Macy's won't say how much it all costs. So let's just say it's priceless.

841-> Citicorp, Penney, RCA Holding Videotex Talks
Citicorp, the J.C. Penney Company and the RCA Corporation are in discussions about forming a joint venture to provide videotex service, an official of one of the companies said yesterday. ''The three companies have formed a study team to explore the opportunity,'' James Alic, RCA senior vice president of corporate planning, said. He would not elaborate on details but said a decision might be reached in about a month. A joint venture involving the nation's largest bank holding company, its third-largest retailer and a major consumer electronics and broadcasting concern would be the second powerful corporate combination to enter the business of electronic information services. Earlier this year, Sears, Roebuck & Company, the International Business Machines Corporation and CBS teamed up to form a videotex venture known as Trintex. Trintex is not expected to begin offering service until 1986 at the earliest. Early Stumbling Blocks Videotex is a service allowing consumers to use home computers or specially adapted television sets to retrieve information or conduct transactions, such as ordering merchandise or paying bills. Early efforts at marketing the service have run into stumbling blocks. Knight-Ridder Newspapers Inc. said last week that it was laying off about 20 percent of the staff working on its Viewtron service in south Florida, after attracting only 2,800 subscribers instead of the first-year goal of 5,000. The early problems have not deterred large corporations with deep pockets, which see a business arising eventually. But even these companies are teaming up to spread the risks. Other joint ventures are likely to be announced in the coming months, according to sources in the industry. 'Very Optimistic' ''We're very optimistic about this business,'' Mr. Alic of RCA said, but he conceded, ''There's a leap of faith involved.'' RCA organized a Home Information Services Group this summer to formulate a strategy for entering the business. Its NBC subsidiary has been involved with a similar but more limited technology known as teletext. Citicorp has been experimenting with home banking for several years. Recently, it began offering access to Focus accounts, a type of cash management account, through personal computers. Penney has been working in the videotex area since 1983, when it purchased a videotex operation from First Bank System Inc. of Minneapolis.

843-> DAMASCUS WARNS THE P.L.O. NOT TO HOLD TALKS IN JORDAN
Syria has warned the Palestine Liberation Organization against holding a meeting of its government in exile here later this month. Al Fatah, the largest of the P.L.O.'s eight official factions, decided to convene a meeting of the long-delayed Palestine National Council here after months of bitter disputes among the various groups over whether the meeting should be held. Fatah leaders, in announcing their decision, denounced Syria for trying to divide the P.L.O. The Syrians back rebel factions within the P.L.O. that oppose the organization's chairman, Yasir Arafat. In Damascus Saturday the Government-controlled daily Al Thawrah said the Fatah decision proved that ''Arafat and his Central Committee have at last opted to divide and fragment the P.L.O.'s unity.'' Mr. Arafat is also the head of Al Fatah. ''This deviation is as dangerous as Sadat's deviation from the Arab consensus,'' the newspaper warned, referring to the assassinated Egyptian President, Anwar el-Sadat, who signed a peace treaty with Israel. Threat on Arafat's Life Western diplomats here said today that they interpreted this statement as a threat against the life of Mr. Arafat and his top aides. Last month Damascus indirectly threatened King Hussein of Jordan for resuming diplomatic relations with Egypt, a move that isolated the Syrians, who are trying to become a major power broker in the region. Syria warned that the King might suffer ''the same fate'' as Mr. Sadat. Mr. Arafat and his followers were expelled from their base in Syria last year and from Syrian-controlled areas of Lebanon, such as the Bekaa, after Damascus gave its support to the Palestinian rebels. Four of the Syrian-backed breakaway factions have already said that they would not attend a council meeting unless Mr. Arafat first resigned. The four factions - the Fatah rebels led by Abu Mousa, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine General Command, the Popular Struggle Front, and As Saiqa - have reportedly been warned by Syria that they would not be allowed to return to Damascus if they left for the Palestine National Council meeting. Four other hard-line factions - the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the Palestine Liberation Front and the Palestinian Communist Party - had earlier said that they would attend the council meeting only if it was held in Algeria or Southern Yemen. On Guard for Disruptions However, Nayif Hawatmeh, the leader of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, was quoted in published reports in Damascus today as saying that his group would go to the meeting. But Mr. Hawatmeh omitted any reference to Al Fatah's selection of Amman, saying only that ''the place and venue for the P.N.C. will be fixed within one week'' at a meeting in Tunis. P.L.O. leaders here have expressed concern about possible attempts by Syria to disrupt the council meeting if it is held in the Jordanian capital. ''It is expected that the Syrians will create some problems,'' said Khalil Wazir, the deputy commander of the P.L.O.'s forces, who uses the code- name Abu Jihad.

844-> ART:2 SHOWS FEATURE LE CORBUSIER PAINTINGS
WHAT to think of the paintings of Le Corbusier is a problem that has taken many years to resolve. It was clear to anyone who called on the great man that although he did not begin to paint until he was 31 years old, he was as committed to painting as he was to architecture. Form was form, as he saw it, no matter whether it turned up in painting, in sculpture or in building. But whereas his Villa Savoye on the outskirts of Paris impressed one immediately by its lightness, its elegance and the apparent ease with which it rose above the suburban scene, his paintings often looked both programmatic and inept. There was effort without fulfillment, and although there were plenty of ideas, they were bruised, rather than enhanced, by mutual proximity. He had neither the irresistible human warmth of his friend Fernand Leger nor the ethereal finesse in still life painting of his friend Amedee Ozenfant, with whom in 1920 he had founded an influential magazine called L'Esprit Nouveau. After Le Corbusier died in 1965, not much was heard or seen of his paintings in this country for almost two decades. But as of fall 1985, a two-volume catalogue of his paintings from 1918 to 1965 will be published in Switzerland. Whether coincidentally or not, two exhibitions of his paintings, collages and drawings can now be seen in New York. One is at the Xavier Fourcade Gallery, 36 East 75th Street, through Nov. 24. The other is at the Prakapas Gallery, 19 East 71st Street, through Dec. 21. Between them, they present a revisionist view of Le Corbusier the painter. The Prakapas is an intimate gallery, and much of what is on show has a confidential air. The scale is not striven for, but given, and we realize that when Le Corbusier worked with the fingers and the wrist, rather than the whole arm, he had quite another gamut of touch. The confidentiality is heightened in the small inner room by the presence of illustrated working notes that have the effect of a private diary on which we can eavesdrop at will. In the earlier work at Prakapas, we can see the iconography of Cubism - the bottle, the violin, the stoppered jar - put at the service of Purism, the movement toward clarity and simplicity of statement that Ozenfant and Le Corbusier founded in 1918. But we can see elsewhere in the show that there was a human face behind these rigorous formulations. In particular, the Prakapas show includes a group of late collages that impress by their strength of color, their freedom of drawing and their take-it-or-leave-it conviction. Though not without its delicate echoes - for example, the voluptuous little drawing of two women carrying a boat - the Fourcade show is primarily of monumental paintings in which Le Corbusier goes all out for maximum complexity of subject matter and saturation of color. Leger is somewhere there behind them, and so is the Picasso of the symphonic still lifes of the 1920's. But there is also something that is Le Corbusier's own in the hide and seek of form, color and line. These are paintings to which he returned again and again - one took him 36 years to finish - but the progression is toward an ever greater freedom of attack. Even in a relatively straightforward painting like the ''Game of Chess,'' the complexity of reference and the mingled firmness and sweetness of color are peculiar to Le Corbusier. So maybe it is time that we rethought the whole problem of Le Corbusier and his paintings. Also of interest this week: Inaugural Exhibition (Claude Bernard Gallery, 33 East 74th Street): English-speaking visitors to Paris have long ago learned to beat a path to the Galerie Claude Bernard in the Rue des Beaux-Arts. They find there an exhibition policy that is shrewd and discerning, open-minded and incisive. (The catalogues are exemplary, too.) Claude-Bernard Haim, its owner, is a dealer, and a very good one, but he is also someone who enjoys himself and knows how to communicate this to others. For his inaugural show in New York, he has brought over what is in effect a personal anthology. No ax is ground, no polemic essayed. One man's enveloping taste does all the work. There are two exiled Russians, Boris Zaborov and Yuri Kuper, whose work - low in key, subtle in tone, delicate in its symbolic intent - will be a revelation to many. There is an exiled Hungarian, Tibor Csernus, who treats today's Bohemia in a way that suggests a late 17th-century follower of Caravaggio who has somehow arrived by time capsule. There is a Spaniard, Luis Marsans, who takes library shelves for his subject matter and throws in some stylish passages of auxiliary still life - dice, a little sculpture, a picture within the picture. There is a Whistlerian view of the Dogana in Venice by the Yugoslav painter Zoran Music and a study of Anglo-Saxon adolescence called ''Hollywood Blondes vs. The Gilded Sluts'' by the English painter Peter Blake. This show is not like anything else in New York. (Through Nov. 10.) Old Master Drawings (Galdy Galleries, 19 East 71st Street): Primarily of French 17th,- 18th- and 19th-century drawings, this show seizes our attention at the outset with a drawing of a man's head by Simon Vouet that somehow encapsulates a certain idea of French manhood in the century of Racine and the Jansenist abbey of Port Royal. That observant and quite unforgiving face will haunt this visitor for weeks. There is also a very curious image, by Hubert Robert himself, of a group of people opening Robert's tomb. (There is even an imaginary date of death on the tombstone.) A little more bite in the drawing would have intensified a rather easygoing treatment of a wonderfully ironical subject, but then no one ever thought of Robert as a humorist. A twofold drawing of a female nude by Natoire will also give great pleasure. (Through Nov. 17.) Works on Paper by Helen Franken thaler (Andre Emmerich Gallery, 41 East 57th Street): Helen Frankenthaler's current show is a small-scale postscript to her last show of paintings in the same gallery. Those who prized that show will find that the jolts, the surprises and the audacities of color that marked the large paintings are every bit as effective in a smaller compass and on paper. This is chamber music, and consistently in tune. (Through Nov. 3.) Woodcuts and Monotypes by Sam Glankoff (A.A.A. Gallery, 20 West 57th Street): Sam Glankoff was as secretive as he was gifted. Few visitors are likely to know that when it came to the ancient craft of digging an image out of a solid block of wood he was one of the more doughty of our century's performers. We would have to go to German Expressionism in its heyday to find someone with quite his density of statement, whether in still life or in the portrayal of the human body. (Through Nov. 3.) Prints by Henri Matisse (Lucien Goldschmidt Gallery, Madison Avenue at 84th Street). Aquatints by Henri Matisse, (Pace Gallery, 32 East 57th Street): To mark the appearance of the monumental two-volume catalogue raisonne of Matisse's prints by Marguerite Matisse-Duthuit and her son Claude Duthuit, the Lucien Goldschmidt Gallery ( the distributor for the catalogue in this country) has mounted a loan show that is primarily of prints that belong to the estate and will be unknown to almost every visitor. There are remarkable images from almost every phase of Matisse's long career, including a small-scale version in color of a variant of the large mural of dancers in the Barnes Collection. Concurrently at the Pace Gallery there is a show of late aquatints that, though not quite so distinguished and indeed somewhat monotonous in its general effect, has the advantage that we can have them wrapped up and take them home. (The Goldschmidt show runs through Nov. 30; the Pace show through tomorrow.)

845-> HOSPITALS IN STATE WELCOME GUIDELINES ON BRAIN DEATH
Hospital administrators, doctors and lawyers responded with relief yesterday to the State Court of Appeals decision establishing a new definition of death in New York. They said the ruling would now allow hospitals to deal openly with what had often been a covert and confusing decision - when and under what circumstances a patient could be declared officially dead. Most of the state's large teaching hospitals had quietly accepted ''brain death'' as a criterion for ending artificial life support. But until yesterday the status of that policy was regarded as legally ambiguous, and hospitals often left the ultimate decision of shutting off respirators and other devices to doctors. An Uncomfortable Feeling With hospitals sidestepping institutional responsibility for shutting off life support systems, doctors often felt uncomfortable about taking such a step on their own. At smaller hospitals, policies were even less defined. Some accepted the notion of brain death. Others did not. Still others never took a stand. Presumably, according to the doctors questioned, the decision yesterday by the state's highest court would permit hospitals to take a more active role in determining when it was appropriate to end life support. In addition, the doctors said, the decision would most likely step up hospital cooperation in the procurement of kidneys, livers, hearts and other organs for use in transplant operations. Dr. Kurt Hirschhorn, chairman of the Department of Pediatrics at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, reacted ''with relief'' to the decision. ''It will be easier for hospitals to make rules,'' he said. Until recently, rules were never necessary when it came to death. Death was a statement of fact and did not require definition by hospitals, courts or anyone else. But as technology - particularly involving respirators - has advanced to enable medicine to prolong life artificially, courts and state legislatures have grappled with new standards. The need for accepting brain death as such a standard has already been acknowledged in most other states and endorsed by the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association and in 1981 by the President's Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research. The term brain death generally refers to the medical condition in which a patient has suffered irreversible and complete cessation of brain function. This means that a brain's cortex - which controls learning, memory and movement - and its stem - which controls so-called ''vital functions'' such as breathing, heart rate, and temperature - do not function. There have been disagreements from time to time over what makes up brain death and how much damage is actually required. For example, Karen Ann Quinlan, who was disconnected from a respirator in 1976 and remains in a vegetative state in a nursing home in New Jersey, is capable of breathing on her own and would therefore not be considered under most accepted definitions as brain dead. Some have argued that the definition of brain death should be expanded to include patients in Miss Quinlan's condition. In its decision, however, the Court of Appeals specified that only a comatose patients without a functioning brain stem - that is, a patient unable to breathe on his own - would be considered brain dead. But the court did not outline how that should be determined. Doctors in Disagreement As new technology improves the measuring of brain activity, doctors continue to disagree about how to assess the cessation of such activity. One set of guidelines, established by Harvard University, requires among other things that a patient undergo an electroencephalogram at least twice - 24 hours apart - and that this measure of brain wave activity be absolutely flat. In addition, the patient must be totally unresponsive to light and unable to breathe on his own. The State Health Commissioner, Dr. David Axelrod, said yesterday through a spokesman that he would not comment on the court's decision until he had had a chance to read it. But the spokesman, Peter Slocum, said the decision would probably serve as a starting point for a gubernatorial task force on life and the law. He said the task force, soon to be appointed, ''may want to take a look at the decision to see it there is a need for guidelines to establish when brain death has occurred.'' Doctors involved in organ transplants have long argued that one reason for the shortage of organs in the state has been the legal ambiguity of brain death and the hesitation of doctors to remove organs from patients who could possibly be regarded as alive. The decision yesterday appears to put that fear to rest.

846-> WASHINGTON; BACK TO GENEVA
WASHINGTON The first serious test of President Reagan's effort to preside over an effective bipartisan foreign policy in his second term will come when he picks the people who will go back to Geneva to talk to the Russians about the control of nuclear weapons. There's no great hurry about this. Secretary of State Shultz and the Soviet Foreign Minister, Andrei Gromyko, are going to meet in Switzerland for a couple of days in January, merely to talk about what to talk about and where. But later, President Reagan will have to decide whether he wants his Administration to go it alone with the Russians or get the Democrats involved in what promises to be a long, difficult and dangerous series of negotiations. In accordance with the election returns, Mr. Reagan can do anything he likes, and in accord with history, he can choose to follow the examples of either President Woodrow Wilson or President Harry Truman. After the First World War, President Wilson almost destroyed the League of Nations by allowing U.S. participation to become a partisan issue with the Republicans, and wrecked his own health in the process. Roosevelt and Truman took a different view after the Second World War. They brought the leaders of the Republican Party - at that time Gov. Tom Dewey and John Foster Dulles of New York - into the negotiations that led to the formation of the United Nations. This experiment in bipartisan foreign policy at the end of the last world war worked fairly well. Secretary of State Shultz has been impressed by it, but whether President Reagan wants to leave the issue of arms control to his own people who do not agree about how to approach the Russians, or whether he wants to bring the Democrats into the negotiations as observers, is not yet quite clear. The Democrats in Congress, nursing their wounds from the election, are not sure that they want to cooperate with the President on either foreign or economic policies. Speaker Tip O'Neill in the House is in no mood to compromise on the budget; Mr. Reagan has stated his policy, Tip says, and the voters have supported him. So let them deal with the consequences of their deficits and defeats. In the Speaker's mind, at the end of 1985, the winners in the election of 1984 will envy the losers. But foreign policy is a different thing, and now that the President has won and is trying to talk seriously to the Russians about arms control, at least some of the leaders of the Democratic Party want to help if they can and if they're asked. That, of course, is up to the President and the Secretary of State. If Mr. Reagan really wants a bipartisan foreign policy, there are experienced Democrats beyond political ambition who would help, maybe be even more helpful than Jesse Helms of North Carolina if he becomes chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. For example, the last two Democratic Secretaries of State, Cyrus Vance of New York, who has devoted most of his life to diplomatic negotiations in the service of his country, and Edmund Muskie of Maine, who knows the puzzles of the Senate and foreign policy, are surely available. They would come running to help the President even as observers in the coming nuclear negotiations if invited, especially if they were asked to go back to Geneva, which remains a symbol of the possibility of peace among the nations. It's interesting that Mr. Shultz and Mr. Gromyko will go back to Geneva, that lovely city on the lake, the place of Woodrow Wilson's disappointed dreams. In November of 1927, Maxim Litvinov, who preceded Mr. Gromyko as the Soviet Ambassador in Washington and Foreign Minister of the U.S.S.R., went to Geneva to propose that the nations of the world agree to the abolition of all weapons of destruction. That is not a typographical error - all weapons; Mr. Litvinov insisted on the possibility of ''total disarmament.'' He invented the phrase that ''peace is indivisible,'' now a cliche, and like Woodrow Wilson, said that world peace was attainable only by the common action of the major responsible powers. This is precisely what Secretary of State Shultz is going to Geneva in January to say, and what the NATO allies have been saying for a long time. But it cannot be done in Washington by one party alone. President Reagan has defeated the Democrats in the election, yet he needs their help on both domestic and foreign policy. The guess here is that he will be reaching out for cooperation rather than confrontation on Capitol Hill after he has to face the problems of his second term in January.B

847-> Charges Reinstated
A judge today reinstated all charges against the five defendants in the ''Twilight Zone'' movie accident, including two counts of involuntary manslaughter based on child endangering against the director John Landis. The charges stemmed from the deaths of the actor Vic Morrow and two children during the shooting of a helicopter crash scene in the film ''Twilight Zone - The Movie.''

848-> YEAR-END TACTICS FOR TAXES
PHIL POHL, a Huntington Beach, Calif., engineer, intends to check out his financial situation soon to determine if there are any steps he can take to reduce his 1984 taxes. ''I'll try to look for something that I can do before the end of the year,'' he said. ''For example, I was thinking of putting a little bit of money into a real estate limited partnership that will give me a little more write-off.'' Francis Krill, a semiretired Milwaukee executive, also has a year-end planning idea. ''I'm going to push up some of next year's itemized deductions into 1984 and take the standard deduction in 1985,'' he noted, using the old term for the zero bracket amount. ''That way I'll have more than $3,400 in deductions this year, and next year I'll take the $3,400 standard deduction.'' Virginia Greenman, a health consultant in St. Paul, plans to sit down with her husband to investigate whether there are any last-minute tax-saving moves they can make. ''We'll try to look at the various things we can do,'' she said. ''It seems to me you can benefit yourself and not cheat the Government by being well informed.'' What Mr. Pohl, Mr. Krill and Mrs. Greenman are doing, and what other investors are doing as well, is an annual exercise known as year-end tax planning. The idea is to investigate whether securities trades or other moves should be made before Dec. 31 to lessen an individual's Federal income tax, while remaining consistent with the broader process of family financial planning. Those who wait until next April to think about their tax returns may discover that they, too, could have lowered their tax liability if they had considered what to do before the year expired. For example, if an investor has short-term gains in the stock market this year and is holding other stock with a paper loss, he or she might want to cover those gains by first taking the long-term losses, if any, and then the short-term losses. That is because $6,000 of long-term losses, but only $3,000 of short-term losses, can be used to offset $3,000 of ordinary income. Another tactic is to freeze a paper profit or loss on a security, while deferring recognition of that profit or loss, by making what is known as a short sale against the box. This type of sale is made with borrowed securities, and the trade is not concluded until the taxpayer covers the sale next year with other securities that he or she owns. ''Because of indexing and the change in income averaging next year, the tax rates are going to seem fairly high this year,'' said Deborah Walker, senior manager in the Washington office of Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co's Washington office. ''More people should plan at year-end than usually do or else they are going to be in for some big surprises.'' The goal of year-end securities transactions, insofar as taxes are concerned, of course, is to pay the lowest tax on realized capital gains and to use capital losses to the greatest extent possible to offset income. One procedure for sorting out investment results is preparing separate tabulations for both long-term and short-term transactions, and then combining the two lists, so as to arrive at whether a gain or loss will have to be reported. While the decision as to how, when and whether to sell a security should be made primarily on economic factors, tax aspects also play an important role. Since only 40 percent of the excess of net long-term capital gains over any net short- term capital losses is included in taxable income - and such gains are usually taxed at rates ranging from 4.4 percent to a maximum of 50 percent - it makes sense to consider the tax implications of selling stocks versus holding them at this time of year. Although the new tax law shortened the long-term capital gains holding period to six months and a day from the previous requirement of a year and a day, the reduction began with assets purchased after June 22, so the benefits of the change this year encompass only those securities sold between Dec. 24 and Dec. 31. ''You should specifically identify the securities you are selling and keep track of the dates of acquisition,'' Sidney Kess, director of tax policy and planning at KMG Main Hurdman, said. ''If you have no identification of what you are selling, then the first in, first out method is used.'' This accounting method, referred to as FIFO, is an inventory flow assumption by which ending inventory cost is determined from most recent purchases and cost of goods sold is determined from oldest purchases, including beginning inventory. The 1984 tax law also eliminated the use of straddles, using stock options for tax purposes, as of last July 18. But other actions could be taken between now and year-end to save on taxes. One possibility is taking a tax loss on a security by selling depressed stocks or bonds and simultaneously buying other securities of a similar nature. Such a loss may be disallowed as a wash sale if the acquired security is purchased within 30 days before or after the sale of the same or a substantially identical security. Another possible action is contributing a substantially appreciated security to a charity after it has qualified as a long-term capital asset. In that way, the full value of the property is deductible, and none of the appreciation is taxable to the donor. The basic, and most widely used, tax-reduction technique is to try to move deductions into 1984 from 1985 and to postpone income to 1985 from 1984. Such a process is often referred to as stop-and-go tactics, because it is essentially an attempt to establish the time when expenses are deductible and income is reportable for tax reasons. Since most individuals use the cash receipts and disbursements method, deductions are generally recognized when actually paid rather than when incurred, and income is recognized when received rather than earned. Advancing deductions is usually easier for the average person than delaying income, for it is often at the discretion of the taxpayer whether to make payments at the end of one year or the beginning of the next for charitable contributions, medical expenses and state and local income and real estate taxes. Deferring income may be less an alternative for employees than for the self-employed. But business and professional people can probably wait until 1985 before performing certain work; they can prolong the mailing of invoices or permit laggard customers to procrastinate even more. Because settlement dates for routine securities sales made on or after Dec. 24 will probably fall in 1985, an investor can postpone the income from such sales into next year. This plan to push income into the following year takes on special significance because tax indexing begins next year, as authorized by the 1981 tax act. Individual rate brackets, personal exemptions and the zero bracket amount will all be adjusted for inflation every year, based on the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index - in effect, a tax cut related to the inflation rate. Thus a dollar earned next year may be worth more to a taxpayer than one earned in 1984. Another way to reduce tax liabilities - although many experts urge caution - is purchasing a tax shelter. Typically, a shelter is an investment in oil and gas, real estate or similar business intended to provide substantial current deductions by taking advantage of tax breaks - such as the deductions allowed for depletion and depreciation - to offset ordinary income from other sources. Although many shelters are legitimate, many others, especially some of those offered and promoted at this time of year, are economically unsound in light of the potential risks and rewards. Furthermore, all tax-sheltered investments sold after Aug. 31, 1984, and likely to provide more than a 2-to-1 write-off over the first five years are required to register with the Internal Revenue Service. The purpose is to facilitate I.R.S. review of tax shelters that it calls abusive - those that ''utilize extreme, improper and even illegal interpretations of the law or involve incomplete or misleading facts in an attempt to secure for investors substantial tax benefits which are clearly disproportionate to the economic reality of the transactions.'' Another warning that financial planners sound about tax shelters is that, like those who exercise certain incentive stock options or realize certain net long-term capital gains, the person who is ''oversheltered'' could end up having to pay the alternative minimum tax. The intent of that tax, generally referred to as the A.M.T., is to require some payments from every taxpayer with substantial income, even if part or all of that income would not ordinarily be taxable. It is calculated separately from the regular tax, and if it is greater than the tax figured the regular way, the A.M.T. prevails. ''The alternative minimum tax is sort of an insidious tax because it is not something that most people are used to,'' said Albert S. Messina, vice president of the Wood, Struthers & Winthrop Management Corporation. ''It can be triggered by one or more tax preference items, itemized deductions not allowed in computing the A.M.T. or combinations of both. And it's a flat 20 percent rate, whereas the regular tax has a maximum rate of 50 percent.'' Tax experts suggest, therefore, that those who expect to pay the A.M.T. this year but not next year would do well to reverse the normal tax-planning tactics. Their objective should be to accelerate income into 1984, when it will be taxed at a 20 percent rate, and to postpone certain expenses until 1985, when they will be tax deductible at a rate of up to 50 percent. For instance, ways to mitigate the effect of the A.M.T. include realizing short-term capital gains and taking capital losses through bond swaps. Whatever planning moves are made during the next six weeks to lower 1984 taxes, it could be even more worthwhile to resolve to start earlier in 1985. As Gerald W. Perritt, president of Investment Information Services, put it: ''At this stage of the game, it may be too late. Year-end tax planning should start in January.''

850-> Texas Upset From S.W.C. Lead, 24-10
Coach Fred Akers said that he had never seen his Texas team play as badly this season as it played today in the 24-10 upset loss to Baylor that knocked the Longhorns out of the Southwest Conference lead. During the week, Texas was No. 2 in the computer ranking by The New York Times, No. 4 in the United Press International coaches' poll and No. 6 in The Associated Press writers' and broadcasters' poll. Texas was driving toward a potential touchdown with 4 minutes to play when Thomas Everett intercepted a Todd Dodge pass and returned it 45 yards down the right sideline for the score that sealed the Longhorns' fate. Baylor not only ended the Texas hopes for a national championship but also reduced its chances of representing the S.W.C. in the Cotton Bowl against Boston College on Jan. 1. Texas fell to 7-2-1 over all and 5-2 in the league, a half-game behind Southern Methodist, which became 6-2 in the conference and 9-2 over all tonight when it defeated Arkansas, 31-28. Texas will end its regular season with a conference game next week against Texas A&M at home. Houston, a 24-17 victor today over Texas Tech, is tied with Texas at 5-2 in the conference, with a game remaining against Rice at home next Saturday. The conference tie-breaking procedure in case of co-champions is based on how each did against each other during the season. This is how it would work: - Houston can win the Cotton Bowl berth by defeating Rice, because Houston defeated both Texas and S.M.U. this season. - If Houston loses and Texas wins, then Texas would be in the Cotton Bowl because it beat S.M.U. this season. - If Houston loses and Texas loses to Texas A&M, S.M.U. would be in the Cotton Bowl Texas Christian was eliminated from the race today when it suffered its third conference loss, 35-21, to Texas A&M but accepted a bid to the Bluebonnet Bowl. Baylor, which beat Texas for the fifth time in the Longhorns' last six trips to Waco, finished 5-6 over and 4-4 in the league. ''It surprised me very much. I thought we'd come in here and play a good ballgame,'' Akers said. ''We made too many mistakes, and you simply cannot do that against a good football team. We continue to have turnovers, and today we had them in our end of the field. I don't know whether it is a lack of concentration or what, but we were just throwing footballs to the wrong players.'' The Longhorns' turnovers - 5 passes intercepted and a fumble lost - resembled the 9-turnover 29-15 loss to Houston two weeks ago. Texas rebounded last week, however, with 44- 23 triumph at Texas Christian. Dodge's three interceptions today give him a school-record 17 for the season, one more than Joe Clements had in 1956. ''Texas had the Cotton Bowl to play for,'' the Baylor coach Grant Teaff said. ''All we had was pride. This is the secondary that started so slowly against Brigham Young's great passing team and finished so well with this super performance against Texas, another national powerhouse.'' Dodge's 88 yards passing pushed the junior's season total to 1,441, breaking a record by Robert Brewer in 1982. His 8 completions also tied the school record of 91 for the season. Texas managed only a 38-yard field goal by Jeff Ward in the first quarter and a 1-yard touchdown run by Kevin Nelson in the third quarter. Baylor took a 7-3 lead with 2 minutes 40 seconds left in the first half on a 14-yard pass from Cody Carlson to the tailback Derrick McAdoo. The drive was set up by Ray Berry's interception of a Dodge pass at the Texas 18-yard line. The backup quarterback, Danny Akers, the son of the coach, replaced Dodge, who was knocked dizzy late in the second quarter. Akers moved Texas 59 yards in 49 seconds to give the Longhorns a chance to cut the margin to a point with 4 seconds to go in the first half, but Ward's 38-yard field goal attempt was wide to the left and the half ended with Baylor ahead 7-3. Baylor's Derek Turner recovered Nelson's fumble on the Texas 19 early in the third quarter. On fourth and goal, Baylor's Ralph Stockemer scored from the 1 to make it 14-3. Dodge led Texas 54 yards for Nelson's 1-yard run to make the score 14- 10, but Baylor responded with a 25- yard field goal by Marty Jimmerson early in the fourth quarter.

851-> Upsets Mark Tennis Trials
Richard Matuszewski of Hopewell Junction, N.Y., stunned top-seeded Lawson Duncan of Asheville, N.C., 6-1, 7-6, and Larry Scott of Merrick, L.I., was an 0-6, 7-5, 6-4 winner over third-seeded Michael Kures in the fourth round of the Olympic tennis trials yesterday at the National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows. Like Matuszewski, Scott is a late developer. His best ranking was No. 9 nationally in the boys' 16 division 3 years ago. Kures ''was always No. 1 or No. 2 in the juniors,'' Scott recalled. But the 19-year-old, who plays No. 1 for Harvard, scored a surprise victory over Kures, U.C.L.A's top player, in the first round of the National Collegiate Athletic Association championships two weeks ago. Several high school players advanced, including 18-year-old Eric Amend of Rolling Hills, Calif.

852-> THE DAY BEFORE SURGERY, PATIENT IS PHILOSOPHICAL
William J. Schroeder was in a philosophical mood as he readied himself to become the world's second human recipient of an artificial heart, his brother said today. ''If it works out, it's wonderful,'' Gerald Schroeder quoted his brother, William, as saying. ''If it doesn't, maybe it'll help somebody else.'' Mr. Schroeder, a 52-year-old retired Federal Government worker from Jasper, Ind., is to receive an artificial heart early Sunday at Humana Heart Institute International in Louisville. His relatives and acquaintances said he was the perfect recipient. ''He's an outgoing person, a real bulldog of a personality, not at all afraid to take on new tasks and pursue them to the finish,'' said Dick McGarvey, director of administration of the Naval Weapons Supply Center in Crane, Ind., where Mr. Schroeder worked for 18 years. ''He would have the guts to do this if anyone would.'' Former Air Traffic Controller Don Rumble, who was Mr. Schroeder's supervisor, added: ''It's difficult for him to slow down. It took something like this to do it. As soon as he'll be allowed to move, he'll be up and about.'' Mr. Schroeder, the eldest of three brothers, was born and reared in Jasper, a town of 10,000 people in southern Indiana. He joined the Air Force when he got out of high school and spent 14 years as a military air traffic controller in several states and countries. ''He is an ordinary, good, red- blooded American,'' said his uncle, the Rev. Sylvester Schroeder, a Roman Catholic priest. Mr. Schroeder left the military 18 years ago and came home to Jasper. Shortly thereafter he went to work in Crane, about 40 miles away, for the Government. Mr. McGarvey said he inspected and tested the Army's plans for pyrotechnics, such as flares that are dropped from planes to light the sky for soldiers below. He was also the chief contract negotiator for the American Federation of Government Employees at Crane. Mr. McGarvey described him as a tough but fair negotiator. Mr. Schroeder also had been president of the union's three- state district council. Mr. Schroeder's path into medical history began in 1982 when he suffered his first heart attack, said Dr. J. P. Salb, the Schroeder family's physician for 20 years. Mr. Schroeder had another heart attack a year later, Dr. Salb said, and underwent a coronary bypass operation in Louisville. It was performed by Dr. Allan M. Lansing, who will assist Dr. William C. DeVries in the operation on Sunday. Mr. Schroeder returned to work after surgery, but suffered from cardiomyopathy, or congestive heart failure, a weakening of the heart that is usually fatal. He retired on medical disability on May 7. After that, said Gerald Schroeder, ''he was in and out of the hospital. You could tell he was deteriorating fast.'' Conventional Transplant Refused Dr. Salb said he tried last spring to get doctors in Indianapolis and Louisville to implant a human heart into his patient, but they refused because Mr. Schroeder is a diabetic and older than 50. Without some remedy, Dr. Salb said, Mr. Schroeder probably would not have lived until Christmas. Mr. Schroeder talked on Nov. 8 with Dr. DeVries in Louisville and after discussing the possible implant with his wife, Margaret, and their six children, he entered the Louisville hospital on Nov. 11. It was not a difficult decision, said Father Schroeder. ''He said, 'When you have eight or nine months to live it may be different, but when you've got just over a month, you've got to go with it,' '' Father Schroeder said. The family has supported the decision, according to Gerald Schroeder. ''Our whole family has always been really close,'' he said. ''They're thinking positively about it. They figure he's going to pull through it.'' Dr. Salb said he believed Mr. Schroeder had made the right choice. ''He has the intellect to understand what's going on,'' Dr. Salb said. ''He's made a commitment to do it, because he wants to live a little more.''

855-> TELEMANN RIDES A RISING TIDE OF POPULARITY
The roller-coaster reputation of Georg Philipp Telemann over three centuries ended with critical and popular favor, which is today reflected in the constant release of recordings of his music. Considered the leading German musician in the first half of the 18th century, when Bach was also active, he lost status after his death. The vast amount of music he produced came to be regarded as trivial. No one could write that much, it was said, and produce serious results. A reevaluation of his music, beginning in the first quarter of this century, brought critical admiration and respect, and in the rising tide of popularity for Baroque music has found a wide audience today. Telemann wrote ''Musique de table'' or ''Tafelmusik,'' to be played at banquets, between 1731 and 1733. It comprises three sets of instrumental compositions, each including an overture (really a suite), solo, trio, quartet, concerto and conclusion. The complete work has been recorded at least twice, using six disks. Now Musical Heritage Society has issued the nine ''band'' sections - overtures, concertos and conclusions - for a three-disk album (MHS 834814T). The honorable performances are by the Jean-Francois Paillard Chamber Orchestra and assorted soloists under Mr. Paillard's direction. Judged by its purpose, the music serves nicely. It never lacks melodic invention, although it is largely facile and seldom cuts deeply, and in bits and pieces can be quite charming. Perhaps because he had to strive harder for new ideas, the composer's work becomes more interesting as it goes along. The final ''conclusion'' is a curious and tantalizing one-section Furioso. As decent as the Paillard performances are, they do not make the most of the music. This is apparent when comparing them with two single disks of Telemann's music. On one, the Musica Antiqua K"oln under the direction of Reinhard Goebel plays five chamber concertos (Archive 2533 421). On the other, The Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields led by Iona Brown plays a suite and two double concertos (Philips 6514 165). What both these disks bring out is the important coloristic element in Telemann's style. The K"oln group does this superbly by using period instruments, recorders and Baroque strings. The strings, played without vibrato and with swelling accents, have a distinctive penetrating quality which makes one understand the music's effectiveness in its time. The Concertos are for Two Violins in scordatura (specially tuned) in A; Recorder and Viola da gamba in A minor; Recorder and Violins in F minor and two, in D and C, for Four Violins without Continuo. They all sound vital in these interpretations, and the two works for four violins alone are striking indeed. The English ensemble gives persuasiveness to Telemann's music through the sheer exuberance, rhythmic vivacity and finesse of its playing. The three works feature the brilliant recorder playing of Michala Petri in a Concerto in F for Recorder and Bassoon, Concerto in E minor for Recorder and Flute and a Suite in A minor for Recorder. There are surprising folkish elements here, and on listening to this recording, one begins to feel that Telemann was a worthy contemporary of Bach and Handel. Another currently popular Baroque composer, Antonio Vivaldi, whose music at one time suffered some of the same eclipse accorded Telemann's, is represented on two Philips disks. The Academy of St. Martin-in- the-Fields, this time steered by Neville Marriner, plays six double concertos (6514 379), while I Musici plays nine concertos for strings (6514 371). The English group offers the more interesting material, partly because the concertos are more substantial, partly because the pairs of solo instruments add needed tonal variety. Vivaldi interweaves the solo lines ingeniously, and all the music is eminently listenable. Outstanding, perhaps because of their exotic sound, is the Concerto for Two Mandolins in G. The slow movement, with the solo parts accompanied solely by a plucked string instrument, is riveting. I Musici gives wonderfully robust and energetic performances, but their recording is not one that can be played at a single sitting with continuous pleasure. The nine string concertos follow one another in the same brief fast-slow-fast pattern. Still, brevity has its virtue, and it is worthwhile to watch the composer searching for variety in style and texture. When the Baroque period ended, roughly in the middle of the 18th century, there was a natural transition era before the Classical symphony was codified. Many composers contributed to this shift (Telemann himself made some changes from the Baroque style), and there was a kind of free-for-all in the music that resulted. One center of this early-Classic time, that at Mannheim, Germany, has been given its due. But change was also going on in Vienna, although the move towards symphonic form was less cohesive that at the German court. It took longer for this center to be recognized. Nevertheless, some excellent music came from the composers associated with the Austrian capital, and some have considered it superior to the Mannheim product. In any case, a generous sampling can be heard in a three-disk Archive album called ''Die fr"uhe Wiener Schule'' (''The Early Viennese School'') (28941-05991). The musicological fine points can be ignored by the ordinary listener; the works give pleasure by themselves. One of the best is Karl Ditters von Dittersdorf's Sinfonia in A minor, solid and steadily engrossing. His Oboe Concerto in G is almost equally effective. Anton Zimmermann's Sinfonia in C was good enough to be attributed to Haydn for many years; its attractive slow movement is graced by a lovely oboe solo. Matthias Georg Monn's Sinfonia in B is worthy, particularly its final exuberant Presto. His Violin Concerto in B flat is somewhat prosaic. Josef Starzer's Divertimento in C has an unusual and delightful Minuet, and there is a decend Sinfonia in G minor by Johann Baptist Vanhal (Wanhal). Georg Christoph Wagenseil's Sinfonia in D has a simplistic style, sounding playful, yet it is one of the most appealing works in the album. Johann Georg Albrechtsberger, one of Beethoven's teachers, is represented by a Fugue for Quartet in C. From Antonio Salieri, another of Beethoven's teachers, there is a substantial, if rather bland, Concerto for Violin, Oboe and Cello. Some of these scores had to be prepared for modern performance especially or this recording. All of them are beautifully played by the Camerata Bern, whose leader and violin soloist is Thomas F"uri. For the Salieri he is joined by Heinz Holliger, oboe, and Thomas Demenga, cello, all superior artists.

856-> College Linemen Honored
A pair of senior defensive tackles - Tony Degrate of the University of Texas and Bruce Smith of Virginia Tech - shared the limelight yesterday as college football honored its linemen. At a dinner in Houston, Degrate, 6 feet 4 inches and 280 pounds, was named the winner of the Vince Lombardi Award as the nation's top collegiate lineman in a vote by a panel of 217 coaches, sports writers and broadcasters. He led the Longhorns with 147 tackles, 123 of them unassisted, and 13 quarterback sacks. Earlier in Oklahoma City, Smith, 6-3 and 275, was named winner of the Outland Trophy, for interior linemen, in a vote by the Football Writers Association of America. He accounted for 71 tackles, 52 unassisted, and had 16 sacks that gave him 46 for his career.

She finished 20 meters ahead of Katie Ishmael of Wisconsin in 32 minutes 43.81 seconds, a collegiate record. Only three other American women have run the distance faster. The race was the only final of the day at Heyward Field, where there were trials in 17 events. In the hammer-throw trial, Matt Mileham of Fresno State and Britain set a meet record of 238 feet 11 inches. Joaquim Cruz of Oregon and Brazil, the defender, led the men's 800-meter qualifiers in 1:46.34. Patty Bradley of Villanova (57.38 seconds) was the fastest qualifier for the women's 400-meter hurdles.

858-> U.S. HOLDS ITALY TO SCORELESS SOCCER TIE
The United States national team held Italy, the defending World Cup champion, to a scoreless tie tonight in an international soccer match in heavy rain at Giants Stadium. The coach and several American players considered the result the most significant in American soccer since the Americans shocked the world with a 1-0 victory over England in the 1950 World Cup in Brazil. Although the game was only an exhibition and was played on a slippery artificial surface unfamiliar to the Italians, the result is indeed of tremendous significance for the Americans, who were dominated but managed to keep the visitors at bay. A crowd of 31,210 watched the Italians put the pressure on the Americans, especially in the second half, but the Americans had at least two good scoring chances. Parkinson Comes Close The first American chance came in in the 18th minute, when a shot by Hugo Perez was deflected by the goalkeeper, Giovanni Galli, who ended up with four saves. Andy Parkinson came closer for the Americans in the 73d minute, but his header from 18 yards away was tipped by Galli off the left post. ''It was going for the corner of the goal,'' Parkinson said, ''but the goalkeeper made a good save. I thought it was in.'' The Italians had several chances. The closest they came was in the 30th minute, when Piettro Fana's header from 4 yards away was cleared off the line by Jeff Durgan, the captain of the Americans, who anchored the defense along with Dan Canter, his teammate on the Cosmos. ''I'm sad we didn't put the ball in the net,'' Durgan said. ''It would have been better with a victory, but this is a big result for us.'' Italians Greeted Warmly Considering that the American players had one full day of practice with Coach Alkis Panagoulias, they were rather solid on defense and had plenty of coordination between the midfield and the forward line. The Americans were greeted with jeers when introduced, while the predominantly Italian crowd showed its affection for the visitors. Green, white and red flags with the words ''campione del mundo (champion of the world)'' were visible everywhere, while very few American flags were in view. ''I heard a few 'U.S.A.-U.S.A.' chants,'' said Angelo DiBernardo, the playmaker for the Americans in midfield. ''I think we showed that we can compete with anybody.'' ''I'm very encouraged by this result,'' Panagoulias said. ''I thought we played tactically the right way on defense and in midfield. Several of our players were magnificent.'' ''The Americans have a great future,'' Marco Tardelli, the captain of the Italian team, said. ''In three, four years, they will be very good. There are a lot of good players.'' Enzo Bearzot, who coached Italy in the 1982 World Cup triumph in Spain, said that although he was disappointed with the performance of his players, he was pleased ''considering the field conditions.'' Last Stop on the Tour The game was the last stop of a three-match tour for the Italians. They opened the tour in Switzerland May 22 with a 1-0 loss to West Germany, the team they defeated in the final of the World Cup, to celebrate the 80th anniversary of FIFA, the world governing body of soccer. They beat the national team of Canada, 2-0, in Toronto last Saturday.

859-> THE ENVIRONMENT
STATE officials, legislators, aides and lobbyists say the Legislature has been so inundated by environmental bills that the public often does not get legal notification of required hearings. Even people on the mailing lists of legislative environmental committees and the Office of Legislative Services - the state agency responsible for scheduling and announcing hearings - most often receive their notices after the required 5- and 10-day notification periods. ''We take the position here that we'll sometimes only get two days' notice,'' said Robert E. Hughey, Commissioner of the state's Department of Environmental Protection and one of several people who, in recent interviews, said the notification process had generally been insufficient. State Senator Raymond J. Lesniak, Democrat of the 20th District (covering parts of Middlesex and Union Counties) and a member of the Senate's Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said that lobbyists usually knew about quickly scheduled hearings before members of the specific committees did. Indeed, the interviews indicated that businesses and chemical trade associations, environmental lobbies and D.E.P. officials were sometimes the only ones directly informed about a hearing. ''We used to maintain an extensive mailing list of anyone who wanted to be informed,'' said one committee aide, ''but the people kept getting the announcements after the meeting or hearing was held, or on the day before, and couldn't work it into their schedule. So we've had to rely on Legislative Services and the 'Listen Line' number.' '' However, numerous calls to the Listen Line - a toll- free number, (800) 792-8630 - in recent weeks more often than not got only a busy signal. When someone did answer, there was no information available on environmental hearings more than four or five days ahead. Calls to Legislative Services' alternative number, (609) 292-4840, also got mostly busy signals. Beverley Schrum, a spokesman for Legislative Services, said that the telephone company had been performing ''busy line'' studies on the 800 number since last summer and that better service was imminent. James Lanard, a lawyer and lobbyist for the New Jersey Environmental Lobby, the political voice of the state's environmental movement, said that a lobbyist's job was to keep abreast of the latest listings for meetings and hearings. On occasion, he said, he had had only a couple of days to notify his own constituents. Those without a lobbyist in Trenton - and even members of environmental organizations and business groups who receive regular newsletters and bulletins - do not always find out about important hearings. Mrs. Schrum said that major news organizations with reporters at the State House sometimes received announcements or press releases on future hearings. However, the publication of this information depends on the news organizations' time and space considerations, as well as the judgments of reporters and editors. Those interviewed said that weekly and biweekly community newspapers, upon which many people rely, usually did not receive notices. Hearings can be over by the time editors are notified by mail by Legislative Services. Mark Smith, an aide to the Assembly's Agriculture and Environment Committee, said that the committee had, at any given time, 200 to 300 environmental or environmentally related bills under consideration. Only five to eight are discussed at each occasional committee meeting, and such meetings are held only when the Assembly is in session, Mr. Smith said. Thus, he said, it is not difficult to see why proper notification is not given for each bill. In addition to the Assembly's Agriculture and Environment Committee, environmental legislation comes from the Assembly's Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the Senate's Natural Resources and Agriculture and Energy and Environment Committees. Mr. Hughey said that, on the final day of the Senate's most recent session, 33 bills were introduced, 30 of them dealing in some way with the D.E.P. ''That's unbelievable,'' the Commissioner said. Sparing Dead Trees The state's Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife has asked woodcutters to spare more dead trees when gathering firewood this season because trees such as these are habitat for wildlife. Noting a significant increase in the use of wood for home heating, the division says in the current issue of its newsletter, Non Game News, that the dead trees - or snags - provide den and nest sites for squirrels, raccoons, six species of woodpeckers, owls and many small mammals. The cutting, the division said, has resulted in ''the loss of a large percentage of the natural cavities that many wildlife species require for nesting, food and cover.'' The decline of two species, the barred owl and the red- headed woodpecker, has been attributed in part to fewer snags, the division said. Woodcutters, it said, can determine which trees are used by wildlife by ''looking for holes or scratch marks.'' Calendar Wednesday and Thursday - The Youth Environmental Society will hold a program of seminars and displays called Earth Day. Wednesday's program will be at Rutgers University in New Brunswick and Thursday's at Montclair State College. Each program begins at 9 A.M. Information: Call Patricia Wish at (609) 655-8030.

861-> O'CONNOR SAYS HE MIGHT REJECT CITY'S FINANCING
The Archbishop of New York startled Mayor Koch yesterday by suggesting that he might consider operating the archdiocese's social programs without government funds rather than comply with a city policy banning discrimination against homosexuals. The friendly but unexpected exchange between Archbishop John J. O'Connor and Mr. Koch occurred in the Blue Room of City Hall during an unusual event - what was, as far as observers could remember, the first visit to City Hall by a leader of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese. The Archbishop had been invited to join Mr. Koch at an announcement about a housing program to aid the poor. But questions about the directive on bias, Executive Order 50, which the church has been battling in the courts, changed the topic of conversation. Maintaining Their Smiles ''The Mayor doesn't know this: We have been examining how we would provide precisely the same services without any city, state or Federal support at all,'' said the Archbishop. ''That's impossible - that's $72 million,'' Mr. Koch interrupted, sounding startled but maintaining a smile. ''It's more than that, because it involves state and Federal matching funds,'' said the Archbishop, also smiling. The encounter was, at first, relaxed and, to use a favorite word of the Mayor's, jocular. It remained amicable throughout, but took on a more serious tone when questions from reporters shifted from the housing policy to the order barring discrimination in hiring because of race, creed, age, sex, sexual orientation or handicap. City and Private Workers The order covers not only city workers but also people employed by private and religious and other charitable organizations that receive city money. Last spring, in an agreement with the city, the archdiocese went to court to test the legality of the order. It argued that the city did not have the right to tell it whom it could hire. The Archbishop said yesterday, as he has before, that none of the social agencies run by the archdiocese discriminate against any group. The Mayor said, as he has before, that he hoped the issue could be settled in a way that protects the rights of all people and meets the needs of the church. The issue is the subject of two suits, one challenging Executive Order 50 and the other questioning the Board of Estimate's authority to put the same antidiscrimination provisions into city contracts. The plaintiffs in both suits are the archdiocese, the Salvation Army and Agudath Israel. In September, Justice Alvin F. Klein of State Supreme Court in Manhattan ruled that the Mayor had exceeded his authority by including ''affectional preference'' in the order. The order has been blocked while the case is on appeal. In the Board of Estimate case, Justice David B. Saxe, also of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, decided the board was within its rights. An appeal is expected. 'One Quick Comment' At City Hall, as Mr. Koch moved to close the news conference, the Archbishop stopped him and asked, ''May I add one quick comment?'' ''I am told that, in fact it was alleged, that the archdiocese has threatened government, threatened the city, threatened to deprive the poor of its services,'' Archbishop O'Connor said. The church has ''absolutely no intention'' of discontinuing its programs should it lose its suit, he said, but it might reduce the help it provides ''rather than violate our principles.'' ''I have said in the past I would close our agencies rather than violate principles,'' Archbishop O'Connor said. ''I have never said I had any intention of closing our agencies or of not taking care of those young people.'' Exchange Over 'Threats' He turned to Mr. Koch and said: ''Now the Mayor has a secret. He can threaten me if he wants.'' The Archbishop was apparently alluding to any action the Mayor might take, including withholding funds. ''No,'' Mr. Koch said. ''No threats. No threats.'' Later, at an impromptu news conference in his office, Mr. Koch acknowledged the Archbishop's remarks had been a surprise and he did not think that, ultimately, the church would refuse public money for its programs. ''That would be a tragedy for the City of New York and for children in particular,'' he said. A withdrawal by the church would, he conceded, save the city money, but he quickly added that this was not the issue. Mr. Koch said he was worried that without government money, the archdiocese would have to cut back on its social programs. In addition, as several city officials pointed out yesterday, an open break with the archdiocese could put the Koch administration in an uncomfortable position, particularly with a mayoral election coming next year. The archdiocese operates programs that touch thousands of New Yorkers. They involve day-care centers, adoption services, centers for the elderly, job training and other services. Neither the city nor the archdiocese said yesterday what parts of the social programs were paid for by government funds. 'Encroachment' Is Seen Mr. Koch made clear that for him the issue centered on using city money. The city maintains that if private agencies receive city money, they must observe the city's employment guidelines. During the joint news conference, the Archbishop focused on a different issue - freedom from government influence. ''This is only one of several other concerns that we have about what we see as potential government encroachment,'' he said.

862-> FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; A Mortgage Series For Salomon Unit
Salomon Brothers Mortgage Securities II Inc. filed a shelf registration with the S.E.C. for up to $1 billion of collateralized mortgage obligations issuable in series. The company, an indirect, limited- purpose finance subsidiary of Phibro- Salomon Inc., said the terms of each series would be set as it comes to market. The underwriter for the offering is Salomon Brothers. The company said the bonds would be collateralized by fully modified pass-through mortgage-backed certificates guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association, guaranteed mortgage pass-through certificates guaranteed by the Federal National Mortgage Association or mortgage participation certificates guaranteed by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. The company said it would use the proceeds to purchase the certificates to be pledged as security for the bonds.

863-> CORRECTIONS
An article in Metropolitan Report on Wednesday about plans to build garbage-burning incinerators in New York City omitted part of a statement by Dr. Barry Commoner on the possibility of building one to test how much dioxin would be produced. He said that while such a test would take 5 to 10 years, there would be no time to carry it out before the city's shortage of landfill space required a new system of disposal.

864-> FINANCE/NEW ISSUES ; Treasury ConsideringZero-Coupon Offerings
Treasury officials are considering changes in the marketing of United States Treasury notes and bonds in the hope of reducing the interest rates paid on future issues. Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan said yesterday that the Treasury is studying the possibility of issuing zero-coupon bonds that pay no interest. He spoke at a conference in Washington sponsored by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Securities dealers now earn a profit from buying Treasury notes and bonds and repackaging them as zero- coupon issues. Sales of such issues have been brisk the past two years. The zero-coupon securities, which sell at a discount from face value, are comprised of the semiannual interest payments or the principal amount of a note or bond. Participants estimate that more than $50 billion of Treasury notes and bonds have been repackaged and sold as zero-coupon securities. Joseph E. Plocek, a money market analyst at McCarthy, Crisanti & Maffei, noted that sales of zero-coupon securities by the Treasury would require much larger increases in the debt ceiling than Congress is accustumed to granting. For example, to raise $4 billion of cash with the sale of 20-year securities, the Treasury would have to issue about $70 billion of zero-coupon securities. Another possible change could be in the Eurobond market, where trading activity has fallen off while securities dealers wait for Treasury action leading to increased sales to foreigners. The tax act passed by Congress this week halts the withholding of 30 percent of the interest paid on Treasury notes and bonds to foreign investors. The Treasury, for its part, is considering issuing so-called bearer securities, for which the issuer does not keep a record of ownership. Since the start of 1983, the Treasury has issued notes and bonds only in registered form, with records of ownership, as required by the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982. Foreign investors, however, are accustumed to guarding their privacy through bearer securities. ''We have to look at the technical implications of the new tax act and how it interacts with T.E.F.R.A.,'' said Brien Benson, a spokesman for the Treasury. When that study is completed in about 30 days, ''we will decide whether we want to move ahead with bearer securities,'' he said. Securities dealers expect the Treasury to devise regulations that would allow sales of bearer bonds to foreigners, perhaps with a requirement that at least the initial buyer of the securities be identified.

866-> Haitian Boat Capsizes As Coast Guard Boards
Six Haitians drowned and 61 others were rescued when a sailboat capsized tonight after the Coast Guard boarded the vessel, suspecting her passengers were trying to enter the United States illegally, officials said. A search was launched for other Haitians who may have been aboard the 30- foot wooden boat, said Joe Gibson, a spokesman for the Coast Guard station here. Survivors estimated that 80 to 90 people had been on the vessel. ''The Coast Guard cutter Hamilton was conducting a boarding of the vessel when the smaller vessel capsized,'' Mr. Gibson said. None of the Coast Guardsmen aboard the sailboat when it capsized about 20 miles off the coast of Haiti were injured.

Nicor Inc. said that because of the depressed energy markets it serves, the company expected ''significant asset write-downs'' to be included in its full-year 1984 results. Nicor said it was completing studies of the asset carrying values in its coal, contract drilling, mineral and marine businesses. It said the impact of any related accounting adjustments would have little or no impact on cash flow. On the New York Stock Exchange today, Nicor fell 75 cents, to $26.375.

869-> FILM: 'TOP SECRET!', PARODY OF SPY MOVIES
Consider Omar Sharif staring earnestly out of a coffin- shaped bundle of metal splinters and wires that was once a Mercedes-Benz, which has recently been compacted with the indestructible, uncompactable Omar inside it; or, a white cow, covered with large black polka dots, ambling across a soggy field, in the manner of a beast that knows there are a thousand tomorrows, wearing rubber boots; or, the recollection of an East German who says that he had an uncle who was born in the United States, ''but he escaped during the Carter Administration - in a balloon.'' These are some of the reasons you might want to walk rather than run to see ''Top Secret!'', the first theatrical film to be written and directed by Jim Abrams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker since the release of their riotous parody ''Airplane!'', the original, not the sequel. ''Top Secret!'' comes nowhere near ''Airplane!'' but in its own cheerful, low-pressure way, it's about as amiable an entertainment as you will find this summer. It's not so hip as ''Ghostbusters,'' but then you never get the feeling that you're watching someone else's private joke, played by people who are simply too laid back to share the punch lines. The people who made ''Top Secret!'' - and who appear in it - have the enormous energy and outgoing good will of the college kids who used to say, ''Let's put on a show!'' Unlike ''Airplane!'', which devoted itself to sending up one, very easily identifiable kind of popular film and which was performed by a large cast of almost-stars whose careers were made in such films, ''Top Secret!'' is based on no immediately recognizable antecedent. It's mostly a parody of East-West espionage movies, as they might have been fashioned to suit a performer like Elvis Presley or even Fabian, something that no East- West espionage film ever was. The film, which opens today at the Embassy and other theaters, isn't bouncing off something so familiar that we automatically respond to every foolish variation it works. It has no comic center of gravity to keep it from wandering around its own landscape, as aimless as it is amiable. The story has something to do with an East German plot to reunite Germany, apparently by bottling up the United States fleet just inside the Strait of Gibraltar. There's also something about a secret weapon and, more important, a huge cultural festival in East Germany designed to distract the attention of the Western powers from events in the Mediterranean. This really is a funny idea - I mean, can you imagine the Joint Chiefs of Staff being so concerned with whether or not Leonard Bernstein appears at a cultural festival that they would not read their daily intelligence reports? Maybe Mr. Abrams and the Zucker brothers know something the rest of us don't. The cast is full of engaging actors, few of whom, with the exception of Mr. Sharif, who plays an allied agent, and Michael Gough, as a scientist imprisoned in East Germany, are especially well known to movie audiences. Val Kilmer is extremely funny in the Presley-Fabian role, that of a popular American rock-and-roll star who, at the last minute, substitutes for Mr. Bernstein at the cultural festival. At the drop of the merest song cue, Mr. Kilmer is ready to jump atop a nightclub table and suddenly transform a sedate, elegantly dressed crowd into a giant, frenetic production number built around ''Tutti Frutti.'' The best of these parodies, though, is something called ''Skeet Surfing,'' based on ''Surfin' U.S.A.'' Supporting Mr. Kilmer are Lucy Gutteridge, as a pretty young thing, whose scientist father is imprisoned by the East Germans; Christopher Villiers, as the leader of the East German underground who, just by chance, was once marooned on a ''Blue Lagoon''-like desert isle with Miss Gutteridge, something seen in a quick flashback, and the venerable Peter Cushing, who has a tiny but funny role as the proprietor of an East German shop specializing in ''rare Swedish books.'' With the exception of the sequences involving Mr. Sharif and the polka- dot cow, there are no moments in ''Top Secret!'' that you'll remember with the vividness with which you may recall almost everything in ''Airplane!'' However, I can't imagine a nicer way to lose a couple of hours. ''Top Secret!'', which has been rated PG (''parental guidance suggested''), contains some vulgar dialogue and situations. Amiable Espionage TOP SECRET!, directed by Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker; written by Mr. Abrahams, David Zucker, Jerry Zucker and Martyn Burke; director of photography, Christopher Challis; edited by Bernard Gribble; music by Maurice Jarre; produced by Jon Davison and Hunt Lowry; released by Paramount Pictures. At Embassy 1, Broadway and 46th Street; Embassy 2, Broadway and 47th Street; Tower East, Third Avenue and 71st Street, and other theaters. Running time: 90 minutes. This film is rated PG.

870-> ESTELLE WINWOOD, AN ACTRESS WHOSE CAREER BEGAN IN 1888
Estelle Winwood, an actress for nearly a century, died Wednesday at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital in Los Angeles. She was 101 years old. Among her hundreds of appearances on stage, screen and television, Miss Winwood was perhaps best known for playing the Fairy Godmother to Leslie Caron's Cinderella in the 1955 movie ''The Glass Slipper,'' one of the madwomen in the Broadway production of ''The Madwoman of Chaillot'' in 1949 and Lady Bracknell in ''The Importance of Being Earnest'' on Broadway in 1939. Although Miss Winwood was a slight woman - roughly 90 pounds and five foot three - she was an indefatigable worker. At the age of 83, she complained in an interview that under union rules rehearsals could not exceed seven consecutive hours. When Miss Winwood turned 100 in early 1983, she was still drinking sherry, smoking three packs of cigarettes a day and playing bridge three times a week. Queen Elizabeth II sent a letter and President Reagan sent a telegram on the occasion, but Miss Winwood was blase. ''Who wants to be 100?'' she said. Asked if it wasn't preferable to the alternative, Miss Winwood responded: ''I wouldn't mind being dead. It would be something new.'' Began Acting at Age 5 Miss Winwood was born on Jan. 24, 1883, in Lee, England. She began acting at the age of 5 in Tom Robertson's ''School'' and went on to study at the Liverpool Repertory Theater, where she acted in more than 100 plays in three years. She made her Broadway debut in 1916 in ''Hush.'' Her career went on to include plays by Noel Coward, James M. Barrie and George Bernard Shaw, movies such as ''The Misfits'' and ''The Producers'' and television appearances on Playhouse 90, Alfred Hitchcock Presents and Dr. Kildare. Ironically, when she was young, Miss Winwood was taunted about her looks by classmates, who called her ''Cow Eyes.'' It never deterred her acting career and she once remarked: ''My advice to actresses is don't worry about your looks. The very thing that makes you unhappy in your appearance may be the one thing to make you a star.''

872-> CHERNENKO DEFIED BY FRENCH LEADER
Francois Mitterrand and Konstantin U. Chernenko clashed publicly over human rights tonight, with the French President abandoning diplomatic convention to raise the case of Andrei D. Sakharov, the physicist and rights activist, at a Kremlin dinner. At a news conference this morning, meanwhile, a Soviet spokesman, Leonid M. Zamyatin, indicated that Mr. Chernenko, the Soviet leader, was not prepared to meet with President Reagan soon at a summit meeting. Mr. Zamyatin said, ''We see no changes in the position of the United States leading from statements of desire to expression of concrete readiness to raise and solve questions that would be required at a summit meeting.'' Mitterrand Was Warned Mr. Mitterrand spoke tonight after the Soviet leader, in his dinner speech, warned him against raising human rights issues, saying, ''We shall not allow anyone to interfere in our internal affairs.'' Mr. Mitterrand, the first leader of a North Atlantic Treaty Organization country to hold full-scale talks with Mr. Chernenko since the Russian took office in February, mentioned Dr. Sakharov in the context of the human rights provisions of the 1975 Helsinki accords, which he said had ''contractual value.'' ''We must not disappoint our peoples,'' Mr. Mitterrand said, speaking from notes. ''This is why we raise the cases of people who are sometimes symbolic. This is how one should understand the emotion that exists in Europe and in many other places over cases that concern citizens of your country - similar cases exist elsewhere - such as the case of Professor Sakharov, or of unknown persons in all countries of the world who cite the Helsinki accords.'' Mr. Chernenko, citing the Soviet Union's guarantees to its citizens against some of the ills of Western societies, like unemployment and homelessness, said, ''Those who are trying to give us advice in respect of human rights can only cause an ironic smile here.'' 3 Hours of Talks Although Mr. Chernenko's remarks preceded Mr. Mitterrand's at the dinner, they followed three hours of talks today in which the French President raised the case of Dr. Sakharov, among other topics. Dr. Sakharov reportedly started a hunger strike May 2 to demand permission for his wife, Yelena G. Bonner, to travel abroad for treatment of a heart ailment. Friends of the Sakharov family have not received independent word since early May on the condition of the rights activist, who is in internal exile in Gorky, a city that is off-limits to foreigners. The health of Dr. Sakharov, who himself is reported to have a heart ailment, was a concern of the French in confirming Mr. Mitterrand's plans to visit Moscow. Mr. Zamyatin, the Soviet spokesman, said today that Dr. Sakharaov was ''alive and well and eating normally.'' 'Must Be Thoroughly Prepared' At his news briefing this morning, Mr. Zamyatin explained Moscow's unwillingness to meet with President Reagan soon. Last week, Mr. Reagan said he was ready to ''meet and talk any time'' with Mr. Chernenko. Mr. Zamyatin said Mr. Mitterrand's visit showed the Soviet Union's readiness to hold such meetings, but added, ''Each such meeting must be thoroughly prepared in order to be useful and produce results.'' ''There are no changes in the position of the United States,'' Mr. Zamyatin said, ''giving reason to think that the question of the meeting is being raised by it seriously.'' This statement appeared to damp hopes raised by Mr. Zamyatin last Thursday, when he said Moscow favored the idea of a summit meeting. At that time, he said that ''proper preparation'' would be necessary and that ''there are a huge number of issues that could be examined and prepared for a summit conference.'' The general nature of those remarks, in which he said that ''it is hard to forecast'' when a summit meeting might take place, drew attention, particularly because they were the first mention of talks by a high-level Soviet official since Mr. Chernenko took office. 'Do Not Want to Interfere' Mr. Mitterrand, on his first visit to the Soviet Union since becoming President in 1981, couched his criticism of human rights in words of respect. ''We do not want to interfere in your internal affairs,'' he said, ''and I say this because, in a word, we respect you. ''Sometimes we have to mention also our disagreements,'' he said, and listed Afghanistan, where Soviet troops have been fighting since 1979, and Cambodia, which has been occupied by Moscow's Vietnamese allies since 1978. Mr. Mitterrand also made a clear allusion to the imposition of martial law in Poland three and a half years ago when he spoke of ''cases in which liberty was taken away, as happened in 1981.'' The French President said his country would not agree to having its nuclear weapons counted in arms-reduction negotiations between Moscow and Washington, as the Soviet Union has insisted. France has been a strong supporter of the placing of new American missiles in Europe, although none will be on French soil. Mr. Mitterrand said the NATO deployment was in response to a buildup of Soviet SS-20 missiles. French officials had earlier said that they hoped Mr. Mitterrand's comments tonight would be broadcast live to a press center for Western correspondents, and discussions apparently continued into the day. In the end, the Russians, saying such a service did not conform to established procedure, denied the French request.

873-> FINANCE/NEW ISSUES ; A Zero-Coupon Issue Of Sears Eurobonds
Sears, Roebuck & Company became the second United States company to offer zero-coupon bonds in the Eurobond market this week. Through a subsidiary, Sears is selling $500 million face amount of zero-coupon bonds, which do not bear interest, through underwiters led by the Goldman Sachs International Corporation. The Sears bonds mature in 1998 and are offered at a price of 20.50, thus yielding 11.99 percent a year until they mature. A day earlier, the General Electric Credit Corporation sold $600 million of zero-coupoon Eurobonds due in 1996 at a price of 25.55, to yield 12.04 percent to maturity, also through a Goldman Sachs group. Both financings were arranged at interest rates well below what would be paid on interest-bearing bonds in the domestic market. The issuers' cost was reduced by one-fourth to one-half percentage point by selling in the Eurobond market, where there is no witholding tax. And by selling zero-coupon bonds, they reduced their interest rate by three-fourths to a full percentage point more. Zero-coupon issues can be sold at a lower interest cost than interest-bearing issues because of tax advantages for some foreign investors. Also, by eliminating the need to reinvest interest payments, zero-coupon issues allow an investor to lock in current yields more easily.

IN CHURCH The arts flourish in New York's houses of worship, from imposing cathedrals, such as St. John the Divine, where the very architecture may serve as backdrop for an exhibition or an avant-garde musical, to side-street churches that contribute a room for a theater group. One has a jazz ministry, another a poet's center, another a gallery. They are found in all boroughs and include St. Ann's, in Brooklyn Heights, at 157 Montague Street, corner of Clinton (834-8794), the arts are very much a way of life. Tonight at 8 o'clock the Arts at St. Ann's and the American Music Theater Festival launch a new chamber opera, ''Trio,'' composed by Noa Ain, winner of an Obie for ''Metamorphosis in Miniature.'' This melange of classical, jazz, rock and avant-garde styles is scored for four jazz musicians and three singer-actresses, who are Val Eley (''One Mo' Time''), Phyllis Bash and Karla Burns. Its 30 songs explore conflict and resolution among a grandmother, mother and daughter. Maya Lin, creator of the the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington, designed the set. Through June 15, after which it opens in Philadelphia as part of the Music Theater Festival's first concert season. At 8 P.M. today through Saturday and Sunday at 4 P.M. Then June 15 and 16 at 8 and June 17 at 4. Admission: $10; students, over-65's and unemployed with identification, $5. PROTEIN PERFORMANCE Overweight has never quite been the stuff for heavy drama in the way that alcoholism is. Excess poundage, waiting for its Eugene O'Neill to elevate it to serious theater, continues to be taken lightly onstage. What may be a start in this direction is ''Oh! Oh! Obesity,'' by Gerald W. Deas, which starts performances tonight at 7:30 at the Henry Street Settlement's New Federal Theater, 466 Grand Street (598-0400). Thursdays through Sundays at 7:30 P.M. and Sundays at 3. Admission: $5. ANOTHER BEAT The house, usually full, jumps to different thumps at S.O.B.'s, the restaurant-club downtown at 204 Varick Street (243-4940). The beat is usually Brazilian, but from tonight through Saturday this Brazilian enclave is giving itself over to an ''African Music Festival,'' a beat that traveled to the New World, later incorporated into a variety of music, from samba to jazz, and has gone back home for even further modification. At 9:30 and midnight today, Sonny Okosun leads his 15-piece Ozziddi band through a repertory of sound described as a blend of politically charged highlife, reggae, Afro-pop and funk. Mr. Okosun, who hails from Nigeria, has had his band for more than 10 years and now sings lyrics in English as well as Yoruba. His group, with two backup singers, plays guitar, bass guitar, horns, drums, congas, talking drum and traditional African percussion, and keyboards. Admission tonight is $12. At tables, there is also a two-drink minimum. Drinks, $2.50 up. Main courses, $10.95 to $15.95. Tomorrow the seven-piece African Connection, with roots in Sierra Leone, takes over. On Saturday, things wind up with The Flamingoes, a.k.a. The Sweet Talks, eight visitors from Ghana, who sing in English and in their own dialects, Twi and Fanti. On these nights, admission is $10 ($6 if you're having dinner at the tables). Entertainment Events is on page C17. Thursday Sports is on B18.

875-> THE CITY;
A civilian official of the Navy pleaded guilty yesterday to racketeering charges of extorting $120,000 in cash and free construction labor and supplies for himself from private contractors. The official, Louis J. Blanco, 53 years old, was in charge of the 1982 move of the headquarters of the Navy's resale and services support office from Bush Terminal in Brooklyn to three renovated buildings at Fort Wadsworth on Staten Island. The contractors were working on or seeking work on the project. Mr. Blanco, who has been suspended without pay from his job, faces up to 20 years in prison when he is sentenced July 27. Mr. Blanco conceded that, over all, he had received $315,000 from his illegal activity, and he agreed to forfeit this amount by giving the Government his home Marlboro, N.J., and most of its appliances and fixtures. He also agreed to testify for the Government in other trials stemming from the relocation. Two contractors face trial in the case, and several others have already pleaded guilty.

876-> WINFIELD SETS PACE
In the only game in town tonight, Dave Winfield took off on a one-man fast break and ran the Yankees into a 4-2 victory over the Boston Red Sox. The victory, which halted Boston's winning streak at five games, was a welcome event for the Yankees because the Red Sox had frustrated them to distraction in their previous four encounters. Last week the Yankees lost twice at Yankee Stadium because their hitters left a total of 27 runners on base. This week they lost twice at Fenway Park because their pitchers gave up three-run home runs in Boston's last time at bat. ''We've lost games every conceivable way,'' Winfield said. ''You just have to go out and keep fighting. That's all you can do.'' Winfield hit a two-run homer against Dennis Boyd in the fourth inning that offset Jim Rice's two-run homer off Phil Niekro in the first. And then he ran a routine single into an exceptional double in the ninth. Winfield, who also doubled in the second inning and raised his average to .347, opened the ninth by grounding a Boyd pitch slightly to the left-field side of center field. When he reached first base, though, he was not content with a single. He sped round first and slid head first into second just ahead of the throw from Tony Armas. After Steve Kemp sacrificed Winfield to third, Roy Smalley singled him home, snapping the 2-2 tie. Later in the inning Willie Randolph singled across another run. Not all of the Yankees agreed with Winfield at the time that he should have tried for a double on his hit. ''When he took off for second,'' Randolph said, ''a lot of guys on the bench were yelling no, no, no.'' ''The play is in front of him so I can't tell him anything,'' added Roy White, the first-base coach. ''If I had said anything, I would've told him not to go because it was going to be close.'' Winfield, though, was confident that he could reach second before the ball. ''That's the kind of play I've done before,'' he explained. ''When I make contact, as soon as I know it's a hit, I know I have one base, so I might as well think two. Making that play is as much catching them off guard as moving quickly out of the box.'' He was able to beat the throw because Armas, playing deep center, had a long run to retrieve the ball. Kemp noted that if Winfield had been thrown out, ''it looks bad.'' ''But when someone does that,'' Kemp added, ''it gets people pumped up. Aggressive play is a catching thing. It carries over.'' It carried over into a victory that Dave Righetti preserved for Phil Niekro by striking out all three batters he faced in the ninth inning. Twenty-four hours earlier, it was Righetti who gave up Dwight Evans's three-run homer that gave the Red Sox a 9-8 victory. ''If I was a starter and I had given up that home run to Evans and had to sit for four days, it would be nerve- wracking,'' Righetti said. The save was Righetti's eighth. Niekro gained his ninth victory against three defeats. After Rice hit his 12th home run in the first inning, Niekro stranded eight runners. Rice's homer was only the second the knuckleballer has allowed this season in 101Z innings. The Yankees had 12 hits, giving them 71 hits in six games against the Red Sox. Winfield has 12 of those hits. He also has 31 hits in 61 times at bat in his last 14 games, a .508 average. Rijo Moved to Bullpen Manager Yogi Berra said that Shane Rawley and Jose Rijo had been moved from the starting rotation to the bullpen, and Bob Shirley and Jay Howell were scheduled to start Friday and Saturday against Baltimore. Berra said that Rawley had to build up his arm, and Rijo had to stop thinking and start throwing. ''He tries to get too cute when he starts,'' Berra said. ''When he relieves, he won't have to think as much, just come in and pop the ball.'' . . . The next time Shirley's slot comes round, it could be filled by Clay Christiansen.

A jury of nine men and three women began deliberations today in the trial of Samuel Brown, the last of the defendants in the 1981 robbery of a Brink's armored truck and the murder of a guard and two police officers. Mr. Brown, 43 years old, has admitted that he was at the scene of the robbery at the Nanuet Mall in Rockland County and at a shootout in nearby Nyack, but he has denied being a participant. Witnesses have testified that he was among those who did the shooting. The jurors asked Judge David S. Ritter in Westchester County Court whether they could visit the scene of the shootout if necessary. The judge denied the request, saying it was ''not appropriate to return to the scene three years after the incident.'' The jurors were sequestered for the night.

A 26-year-old Brooklyn man has been indicted in eight rapes, most of them in the Flatbush section, the Brooklyn District Attorney's office announced yesterday. The man, Gregory Pought of 1150 Gates Avenue in the Bushwick section, was indicted Tuesday on nine counts of rape in the eight rapes that occurred between Feb. 24 and May 8. He was also charged with 8 counts of sodomy, 10 counts of sexual abuse and 8 counts of robbery. In most of the rapes, the assailant attacked women from behind, thrust a gun or metal object against their heads and forced them into an isolated area, where he raped them. The police said Mr. Pought was identified in a lineup by several of the rape victims. He was in Rikers Island prison when he was arrested on the rape charges June 4. He had been arrested May 26 and charged with illegal possession of a .25-caliber pistol. If convicted of the rape charges, he could face a sentence of 12 1/2 to 25 years in prison on each count.

882-> ECONOMIC SCENE; THE WORRIERS OF WALL STREET
THE ''flash'' report from the Commerce Department that the gross national product, adjusted for inflation, has expanded at an annual rate of 5.7 percent in the second quarter, following the upward revision of the first-quarter rate to a sensational 9.7 percent, drew mixed reviews in Washington and New York. President Reagan called it ''remarkably good news.'' Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan seconded the President, saying, ''Outside the canyons of Wall Street, this should be good news for most people.'' But within Wall Street's canyons, apprehension reigned. Richard A. Debs, president of Morgan Stanley International and a former officer of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, said he had reacted ''nervously.'' He commented, ''The Fed thought it was being tight, but I guess it wasn't tight enough for the domestic economy.'' Mr. Debs said the Fed had probably been kept from tightening further by its concern that climbing interest rates could aggravate the international debt crisis. There is fear in banking circles that Argentina will not pay the interest due on its debt before the end of this month. Despite the Fed's efforts to avoid driving interest rates up and aggravating the international debt problem, soaring credit demands have forced interest rates up, anyway. ''So far this year,'' said James J. O'Leary, economic consultant to the United States Trust Company, ''there has been an explosive mixture of total private credit demands which, along with the continuing huge United States Treasury borrowing, has created severe strains in the credit markets.'' That powerful growth of private and public debt has also fueled a vigorous increase in output and employment. Before the Commerce Department released its latest report on the fast growth of the G.N.P., the Federal Reserve had already put out new figures showing a terrific upsurge in credit this year. The Fed's flow-of-funds data indicated that, during the first quarter, private nonfinancial institutions and households increased their borrowing by 12.3 percent, while the Federal Government's debt climbed at an annual rate of 14.2 percent. This rapid increase in debt, powering the growth of the national economy, has heightened fears in Wall Street of an acceleration of inflation. Those fears have been reflected in the rising rates on long-term fixed-rate bonds and mortgages. The rapid credit expansion and economic growth have strengthened expectations that the Fed must become more restrictive - even, as Mr. O'Leary put it, ''in a time of great uncertainty about both the domestic and international monetary systems and with a national election in the fall.'' But the Federal Reserve may still avoid cracking down at once, because the new figures issued by the Commerce Department indicate that inflation, instead of accelerating in the second quarter, has been slowing down. According to one measure of the ''deflator,'' used to adjust the nominal G.N.P. for inflation, prices rose at an annual rate of only 2.8 percent in this quarter, after rising at a rate of 3.9 percent in the first quarter. By another G.N.P.-based price index, inflation has slowed to just 3.5 percent in the second quarter - still a low rate by modern standards. Robert Ortner, chief economist of the Commerce Department, attributed the drop in the inflation rate mainly to falling food prices. But the great majority of economists believe that inflation will accelerate to a rate of more than 6 percent next year, and some think it may even hit double-digit levels again. The huge American trade deficit, with far more goods entering the country than leaving it, has helped hold prices down. So have excess capacity and the hangover of unemployment. But if the economy continues to expand at a good clip for the rest of this year, even at a second-half rate well below that of the first half, price pressures will intensify. Treasury Secretary Regan conceded as much this week. ''Traditionally,'' he said, ''as an economy matures and as prices rise, you can get a return of inflation, and at that point the Fed would have to tighten.'' But he did not see why it should happen before the end of this year. The business cycle has now entered its ''euphoric stage,'' as Mr. Ortner put it, and the White House may be most euphoric of all. As soaring public and private debt drives the economy forward, the recovery of productivity, the trade deficit, and the persistence of unemployment and spare capacity still hold the rate of inflation down. But Wall Street obviously does not share this euphoria. It fears that the glow on the economy will fade in 1985, maybe even before the 1984 election. The big worry is over interest rates. The performance of the dollar in foreign-exchange markets may be crucial to the timing of interest-rate behavior. The huge flow of foreign capital to the United States has helped keep rates from rising faster in this country. If the foreign inflow slows or goes into reverse, domestic savings will be inadequate to cover both private and public borrowing, and interest rates could soar a lot higher, knocking the stuffings out of both the securities markets and the economy. For the time being, however, Washington is leaving those fears to Wall Street, which is paid to worry.

A 25-year-old Bronx man was arrested last night and charged with murder and arson in connection with a four-alarm fire that killed a woman in the South Bronx yesterday, the police said. The suspect was identified as Pancracio DeJesus of 985 East 163d Street. He was charged in connection with a blaze that erupted at about 10:55 A.M. in a social club called El Barrio at 980 Westchester Avenue. The victim, 22-year-old Susan Cruz, was found dead on the floor. Seven stores in the one-story building containing the club were heavily damaged, a fire official said. About 120 firefighters battled the blaze, which was brought under control in about an hour. Four firefighters were treated for minor injuries.

Raul Allegre , who kicked 30 of 35 field goals as a rookie last season, says he is unhappy with his contract with the Indianapolis Colts. ''I talked to kickers around the league, and they all say I'm getting a pretty bad deal,'' said the former University of Texas star. Allegre said he planned to meet with club officials in Indianapolis next week in an attempt to renegotiate his contract, which calls for slightly more than the $40,000 minimum with small raises each year. A native of Torreon, Mexico, Allegre originally signed as a free agent with the Dallas Cowboys, but was traded to the Baltimore Colts for a ninth- round draft pick.

It's not often that he ducks controversy, but Ted Turner , whose holdings include the Atlanta Braves, the Atlanta Hawks and the Cable News Network, has avoided some problems by rejecting a Soviet offer that CNN televise the Friendship Games, the Eastern bloc's alternative to the Los Angeles Olympics. Turner said that the network would simply give spot coverage to the Friendship Games, ''as we would any other sporting event.'' Televising the so-called Red Olympics, which are scheduled for Aug. 16-30 in Budapest, would have offended many of this country's 31 million cable-television viewers, according to advertising executives. ''You'd probably have a lot of people saying, 'Why are you doing this? Why aren't you supporting the home team?' '' said Tony Lunt , an executive for the Association of National Advertisers.

889-> SOTHEBY'S DELAYS SALE OF GUEVARA'S DIARIES
Sotheby's, which had hoped to auction the last diaries of Ernesto (Che) Guevara next Monday, has agreed to postpone the sale indefinitely until their true ownership is decided in court, according to a spokesman for the auctioneer. The spokesman, Annemarie Arpels, said Thursday that the Bolivian Government, which claims ownership of the diaries, would pay the auctioneer $15,600 for the cost of preparing the diaries for sale. They cover the last 11 months before Mr. Guevara was captured and killed by the Bolivian Army in 1967. Miss Arpels said it could be up to 18 months before the matter was resolved. In offering the diaries for sale last May, Sotheby's declined to identify the owner but vouched for the authenticity of the diaries and the seller's right to auction them. The Bolivian Government then filed suit, asserting that it owned the diaries and that they had been stolen. 'International Snobbery' ''They are historical documents and belong to our national patrimony,'' Jorge Crespo, Bolivia's Foreign Minister, said in La Paz last week. ''It is part of international snobbery to want them as a relic. But they were stolen and we want them back.'' Mr. Crespo said the army believed the documents ''were stolen by Col. Luis Arce Gomez,'' who headed the intelligence section between 1980 and 1982. He is widely held to have been involved in Bolivia's cocaine traffic and to have fled the country. Although the texts of the diaries have been published in many languages, their value, estimated by Sotheby's at $350,000, lies in the fact that they are the originals, containing several portions previously unpublished. The originals, written in different inks in two notebooks, have not been seen since since Oct. 10, 1967, when they were exhibited to journalists who earlier in the day saw the revolutionary's dead body in a small laundry in Valle Grande, Bolivia.

The suit, filed in Federal District Court, says that Mr. Sicaras's civil rights were violated. Named in the suit were the former City Manager, Woodrow Wilson Gaitor, who retired last week; Mayor Thirman Milner; Deputy Mayor Francisco Borges; former Deputy Mayor Rudolph Arnold, and Henry Langley, an aide to Mr. Gaitor.

There may be glory enough in victory, but United States athletes who win medals at the Summer Games will experience more than a triumphant circuit around the Olympic track. They will go on a five- day, four-city, coast-to-coast tour, described as ''an unprecedented National Tribute.'' Beginning Aug. 13, the day after the closing ceremonies, it will take them from Los Angeles to celebrations in Washington, New York, Orlando, Fla., and Dallas. The tour is sponsored by the Southland Corporation, which operates the 7-Eleven convenience stores. It has the sanction of the United States Olympic Commitee, according to a Southland announcement, which said that the committee's president, William Simon, and its executive director, Col. F. Don Miller, had agreed to accompany the medalists and their guests. After a breakfast with President Reagan in Los Angeles Aug. 12, the athletes will proceed to Washington for ceremonies on the Capitol grounds the next day, then move on to New York for festivities Aug. 14 that will include lunch at the Plaza Hotel, a motorcade downtown and a reception at City Hall. The group, including medalists from the Winter Games, will then fly to Orlando for a day at Walt Disney World, before ending the tour in Dallas Aug. 17. The sponsors are apparently preparing for a sweep: They have chartered three DC-8's.

897-> OFFICERS TRACING GUNMAN'S HISTORY
A gunman whose rampage at a motel bar began with a traffic ticket and ended with his own death was a ''terroristic person'' who had been banned from taverns throughout the town, motel workers said today. Before he died, the police say, Wayne Lee Crossley killed four people and wounded two more. On Tuesday, Mr. Crossley and Sgt. Wayne Warwick, 36 years old, wounded each other in a gunfight after Sergeant Warwick stopped Mr. Crossley and three of his companions for a traffic ticket. Then Mr. Crossley, bleeding from a stomach wound, went into The Other Place Lounge and opened fire, killing four people and wounding another. A special weapons team was dispatched to the motel and arrived while shots were still being fired. Officers were posted on the roof, while others searched the three-story motel for other suspects. ''All I know is Wayne's been awfully pressed the last two months,'' Mr. Crossley's father, Robert H. Crossley, said today. The manager of the Quality Inn, across the road from the murder scene at the Grand Central Motor Lodge, described the dead man as a ''terroristic person.'' The manager, Margaret Echols, said, ''In February, he told one of our clerks, Kelly Meeks, he was going to die in a gunfight.'' The dead were identified as Juanita Allen and Helen Frazee, both of Hot Springs; James F. Stephens, of Little Rock, and Tom Altringer, 34, a trucker from Fargo, N.D. Mrs. Frazee was proprietor of The Other Place Lounge. John David Crue, 34, of Lonsdale, was wounded. Mr. Crossley died at the lounge, but the authorities were not certain whether he died of the earlier wound, was shot to death by a state police special weapons and tactics team or committed suicide.

901-> WHITE HOUSE; BEHOLD, AN ALLIANCE ON THE SUPPLY SIDE
Two years ago, with President Reagan's political fortunes brought low by the recession, bitterness permeated the relationship between key Republicans in Congress and the ''pragmatists'' dominating the White House senior staff. At its heart was the dispute over Mr. Reagan's efforts to raise taxes that year. On one side were the ''supply siders'' led by Representative Jack F. Kemp of suburban Buffalo, N.Y., who believe almost religiously in tax cuts to encourage a growth in the ''supply'' of capital. Mr. Kemp, an author of the President's original tax- cut proposal in 1981, fought hardest against the tax increase in 1982. On the other side were the ''pragmatists'' at the White House, chiefly James A. Baker 3d and Richard G. Darman, who said a tax increase was needed to help close the Federal budget deficit. That provoked a furious dissent among Republican conservatives and raised cries of betrayal from the likes of Mr. Kemp. A Startling Development In the end, the tax increase was enacted, leaving remnants of the ideological strains. As time passed the tension eased, yet now an actual alliance has replaced the hostility that existed back then. And in a city where relationships shift constantly, many politicians find such a development startling. The two main proponents of the tax package were Mr. Baker, the White House chief of staff, and Mr. Darman, a Presidential assistant who coordinates the White House legislative strategy group. The two are old friends from the Ford Administration who came late to Mr. Reagan's camp and thus remain the focus of distrust among many longtime Reaganites. Yet now they win praise from Mr. Kemp and others, who assert that they have come round to the ''supply side'' viewpoint on the economy. ''Darman and Baker wanted to reach out to broaden their contacts with the Reaganauts,'' Mr. Kemp said recently. ''They were right to do it. I don't want to sound smug about it, but it's clear we were closer to being accurate about the economy than the Administration's economists.'' Changes in Tactics Mr. Baker and Mr. Darman deny that there has been a shift in their opinions but acknowledge that there have been changes in tactics. ''I really don't think I've changed my views,'' Mr. Darman said. ''I think that what's happened is that some on the supply side have gotten to know me better.'' Many White House colleagues agree that Mr. Baker and Mr. Darman are genuine conservatives who are determined to carry out the President's agenda and have had to trim their sails only when forced. But for some Republicans, the latest shift by Mr. Darman and Mr. Baker has prompted speculation about their motives. These Republicans say the two aides are basically moderates who have decided, now that the Presidential election is approaching, to curry favor with the ''supply siders'' to help their careers. Mr. Baker is mentioned widely as a possible Treasury Secretary in a second Reagan term, and Mr. Darman is mentioned as a possible director of the Office of Management and Budget. ''It's purely a strategy of self- preservation, a Dick Darman career advancement plan,'' an Administration aide said, referring to the new supply-side alliance. Shift Began Late Last Year Whatever the reasons, everyone agrees the shift began late last year when Mr. Reagan, to the dismay of both David A. Stockman, the budget director, and Martin S. Feldstein, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, dropped his 1983 proposal for another tax increase that would have been on a standby basis. More recently, the White House has echoed the warnings from Mr. Kemp and others that the Federal Reserve Board's tight grip on the money supply could undercut the economy, again amid the protests of Mr. Feldstein and other Republican economists. White House officials say that Mr. Feldstein, who was once friendly to Mr. Darman and Mr. Baker, left the Administration this month with feelings that they had led an effort to discredit him. Another feature of the new supply- side alliance is the praise from Lewis E. Lehrman, the businessman who ran unsuccessfully for Governor of New York in 1982. In 1981 Mr. Lehrman was blocked from a job in the Administration by some who worried that he was overly zealous in his views. Today he is chairman of a pro-Administration lobbying group called Citizens for America, a frequent visitor to the White House and a backer of the Administration's criticism of the Fed. If Reagan Is Re-elected The disagreement over whether Mr. Baker and Mr. Darman underwent a conversion is important because of speculation about what they might advise Mr. Reagan to do next year if he is re-elected. The President has said he favors a vast simplification of the tax system, and many experts feel he will have to propose at least some tax increases to help close the deficit, again angering conservatives. Both Mr. Baker and Mr. Darman have long accepted the label of ''pragmatist,'' but they say they have always believed in achieving economic growth through market-oriented economic incentives, including tax cuts. Both say it was circumstance that forced them to endorse tax increases in 1982. ''In 1982 and early 1983, the Administration was under a great deal more pressure,'' Mr. Baker said. ''We were in the middle of a deep recession. Our policies were being doubted by a lot of people. We were forced therefore, in order to govern, to make more accommodations than we are making today.'' Mr. Darman and Mr. Baker have both won credit for the White House's legislative successes, with Mr. Baker regarded as having the better political instincts and Mr. Darman considered to have the better instincts for rigorous policy analysis. Mr. Darman, however, has made enemies among those in the Administration who feel he is abrasive, and these are among the people who are questioning his motives today. Mr. Feldstein is known as something less than a fan, for example. Mr. Darman got a reputation as a renegade in 1981, when, in contrast with the President's optimism, he issued early private warnings about an economic downturn. He was known then to be concerned about the consequences of deficits and tight money. The deficits, he warned, were being created by tax cuts, military spending increases and the fact that many proposed domestic spending cuts were being rejected in Congress. 'Never Was a Pure Monetarist' Today Mr. Darman says the 1982 recession made it necessary to have ''a correction'' in fiscal policy to lower the deficit, preferably by spending cuts. ''The only correction that was feasible then was one that involved a negotiated settlement with both spending cuts and tax increases,'' he said. According to Mr. Darman, supply- siders got an erroneous impression that he had advocated tight money in the first place. ''I never was a pure monetarist,'' he said. Mr. Baker, on the other hand, said his own concerns about the dangers of tight money have increased as he has studied the subject. ''I've spent more time on that and learned more about it in recent months,'' he said. Neither Mr. Baker nor Mr. Darman says what he thinks will happen on tax policy next year. Mr. Darman says only that there is an emerging consensus in the country over ''market-oriented populism'' that has begun crossing ''old party lines and labels.'' That consensus, he asserts, will help guide the tax revisions that he and others in the Administration hope Mr. Reagan will be in a position to propose.

906-> ARTICHOKES AS A CROP STUDIED IN STATE
GROW artichokes in Connecticut? Why not, asks Dr. David Hill, a botanist with the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station in Hamden. If his experiments continue to be successful, the state may be soon be joining California in the commercial production of the vegetables. Ordinarily artichokes must be grown in a cool but mild climate. California's frost-free Monterey Peninsula has long been a prime production area. But the largest market for globe artichokes in this country lies between New York City and Boston. Local consumers must add transportation costs from the West Coast to the cost of the artichokes. Since there has been a drastic decline in the state's tobacco production, researchers have been looking for other crops to reactivate idle acres of farmland. In trial fields at the experiment station's farm, Dr. Hill pointed to wide rows of young artichoke plants that resembled sturdy thistles. The deeply cut gray-green foliage arched gracefully over the deep mulch. There are problems to overcome with growing artichokes in the East and some of Dr. Hill's research may be pointing the way. The artichoke is a biennial; it grows the first year and flowers and fruits the second year. But in the frost-free fields, it is a perennial. Mature plants are five to six feet tall with as wide a spread, and yield two crops each year. It is the flower head that is eaten, specifically the bract tips or bud scales. After producing six or so ''chokes,'' the plants are cut to the ground and rested for a period and then brought back into production. Spring and summer are California's peak production months, while there is a lag in September, January and February. Dr. Hill's hope is to pick up this slack and provide a local crop for these periods. Dr. Hill achieved his artichoke successes by fooling artichoke seed into a false winter in a process called vernalization, or cold storage. The seed was held at cool temperatures (35-40 degrees) as it germinated. The vernalized seed was grown in the greenhouse until the plants attained some size. By this time it was mid-May and the seedlings could be moved into the fields. As soon as the young artichoke plants had 10 full-sized leaves, they were treated with a plant hormone that accelerates growth and production of side branches. Under this treatment, about 90 percent of the plants will produce four to six ''chokes'' in the fall. ''This crop would be ready just at a time when the California field production is low,'' Dr. Hill said. He also hopes to investigate cold-storage possibilities for the artichokes so they could be sold in the market in January and February. This is the second year for the artichoke experiments. Last fall's plants were cut off at the ground after the initial crop was achieved. Some were heavily mulched and protected for the winter in hopes of survival, while others were stored indoors. It is these later plants that were the first to bear artichokes in early August. The two varieties used for Dr. Hill's research are the standard American crop: Green Globe and Grande Beurre, a hardy European variety. Artichokes have been popular for a long time. The ancient Romans were enamored with them for centuries, but popularity fell along with the Roman Empire. It was not until the reign of the Medicis in Italy that interest in the unusual vegetable was revived. The artichoke became popular in France and was spread to the New World by French and Spanish colonists. Dr. Hill is also investigating a second crop for the state, witloof chicory, which is currently imported from Belgium, the Netherlands and France and sold commercially as Belgian endive. Dr. Hill's field tests include eight European varieties, which he wants to check for adaptability to Connecticut climate and soil conditions.

907-> JAPANESE INVENTIVENESS
It is incredible how persistent one bad idea can be. This is the notion that, in order to be ''cooperative'' and ''coordinated,'' the efforts of a large group of people must be planned from the top down . This was the idea around which the fascist regimes of Germany, Italy and Japan were built in the 1930's. It is the idea that keeps Russia and Eastern Europe in permanent stagnation today. Yet it persists. Let the Japanese build their eight-zillion-dollar, government-business complexes set up to study mud slides. Who cares? We have the perfect institution to coordinate research and progress in this country. It's called free enterprise - the spontaneous exchange of economic desires among an independent people. For the coordination of scientific effort, we have the free intellectual exchange in the marketplace of ideas that goes on among researchers everywhere. It is only when Government bureaucrats enter the picture and try to ''coordinate'' these efforts that we end up with things like the Synthetic Fuels Corporation. It is strange that, even as the Japanese are trying to build ''fifth-generation computers'' that avoid the ''bottleneck'' of one-calculation- at-a-time thinking, they continue to use the bottleneck of government planning. The Japanese may talk a good game about passing us technologically, and have all sorts of ''government blueprints'' for doing it. But I'll bet that we will invent the new technology long before they do. WILLIAM TUCKER Brooklyn, N.Y.

908-> L.I.U. PWill Resign in '85
The president of Long Island University, Albert Bush-Brown, announced today that he will resign early next year. He gave no reason for his decision to step down as head of the university, which has campuses in Brooklyn and in Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester and Rockland Counties. He said that over the last year he had helped strengthen the university's central administration, enabling L.I.U. to survive well without him. An architectural historian, he had served as chancellor of the institution until last year, when he was appointed president. William Zeckendorf, Jr., senior vice president of the university's Board of Trustees, said the resignation was accepted with reluctance. ''He has been a splendid leader,'' Mr. Zeckendorf said.

909-> Lewis Feat on Tape Delay The 400-meter relay race in which Carl Lewis won his fourth gold
medal, wasn't seen on live television in the United States last night. ABC, which has the broadcast rights to the Games, showed Lewis's achievement on tape about 15 minutes after the race was run. The network showed preliminaries of men's platform diving while Lewis was anchoring the United States' 400-meter team to victory in world-record time. An ABC spokesman, Irv Brodsky, said he did not know the reason for the delay. The relay was seen live in Canada and some parts of Europe off ABC's world feed from Los Angeles. ABC televised it in the United States after breaking for commercials and showing a taped profile of Lewis.

910-> Derbyshire
To the Editor: Having done research at Chatsworth House over a decade ago, I thoroughly enjoyed your articles on the ancestral home of the Dukes of Devonshire and the surrounding countryside of Matlock and Bakewell (Travel, July 8). But you neglected my favorite Duke, Spencer Compton Cavendish, eighth and greatest Duke of Devonshire (1833- 1908). The most politically involved of all the Dukes of Devonshire, in an age of great eccentrics he surely stood out. He is the only man I know of who turned down the office of prime minister three times and married a woman who, therefore, became a double Duchess (his wife had been Nicknamed Harty Tarty after his courtesy title of Lord Hartington, he was famous throughout England for his interests in hunting and horseracing. His indolence was also legendary. After his maiden speech in the House of Commons he sat down and fell asleep, prompting Disraeli to predict a great political career for him. JOHN P. ROSSI, Professor of English history, La Salle University, Philadelphia

911-> Advertising; Publisher Seeks Rich Readership
AFTER a multitude of conversations with magazine publishing companies and a considerable amount of help from an investment banking firm that specializes in magazines, Mark B. Inabnit, a magazine entrepreneur out of Texas, has sold his company. Now, he has the money to turn another concept into reality. The 41-year-old Houston man is going to change his focus from locally oriented shelter magazines, a la Houston Home & Garden, to magazines for the rich. ''Like a small Conde Nast,'' he said describing his plans for Inabnit Communications of Southport, Conn., and New York. As he had linked up with Veronis, Suhler & Associates, the investment bankers, to sell his old company, he has now retained Decker, Decker & Freas, a marketing communications firm, to help put flesh on the bones of his latest dream. His first effort, due next May beginning with a six-a-year frequency, will be European Travel & Life, subtitled, The Magazine for the Sophisticated American Traveler. Right now he envisions, conservatively, an initial circulation of 100,000, a four-color advertising cost-per-thousand rate of $45, and a cover price of $3. ''What Architectural Digest is to Better Homes & Gardens, we will be to Travel & Leisure,'' Mr. Inabnit commented. And he truly believes that he will be moving into an unfilled niche as he did when it first thought up a local business publication (The Houston Business Journal) around 1969 and later Houston Home & Garden. The new magazine, never smaller than 148 pages no matter how much advertising comes in, will deal editorially only with Europe because that is where most of Mr. Inabnit's kind of people are bound for. In every issue there will three special sections of at least 16 pages that will be called ''The Streets of Paris,'' ''The Streets of London'' and ''The Streets of Rome.'' These sections will zero in on those cities and carry advertising from them. A fourth ''Streets of'' section will be added later and will rotate among other cities. Mr. Inabnit, who will be president, is looking for an editor, a publisher, who will be charge of ad sales, and a circulation director. He was reticent about naming the purchaser of his 10-year-old Bayland Publishing Company, believing that such an announcement should properly come from the buyer. However, reached later in the day Robert J. Krefting, former president of the CBS Consumer Publishing division, said he and Arthur Diesdrick of Communications International have formed an organization that has signed a contract to buy Bayland.

912-> JOAN MONDALE SERENE IN SUPPORTING ROLE
She is the forgotten member of the Democratic quartet. With the unusual attention focused on the party's historic campaign - a floodlight illuminating Walter F. Mondale, Geraldine A. Ferraro and John A. Zaccaro - Joan Mondale is often asked about eclipses. Has Mrs. Ferraro eclipsed Mr. Mondale as the strongest member of the ticket? Has Mrs. Ferraro eclipsed Mrs. Mondale as the leading female star of the ticket? ''The whole thing is certainly making Joan Mondale take a back seat,'' said Daryl Glenney, a Washington campaign consultant. ''For the first time in our minds, the female can be the Vice- Presidential candidate, she doesn't have to be 'the wife' any more. That leaves the wife wondering what her role is.'' Publicly, Mrs. Mondale, who won a reputation as one of the most influential of Vice President's wives through her work with the arts when her husband was in the Carter Administration, flicks away such speculations with a serene smile that indicates she is above political casting disputes. Praise for Woman on Ticket ''Oh, I think Gerry's wonderful,'' she told reporters at a campaign stop at a New Haven day care center when the question of Mrs. Ferraro's possibly overshadowing presence arose. Mrs. Mondale, ringed by wriggling tots and clutching two pink roses, pointed out that she had encouraged her husband to choose a woman as his running mate. ''She brings a strength and vitality and toughness that complements my husband,'' she said, in a soft voice that lingers on certain syllables, leaving the impression of italics. ''Fritz is crazy about her!'' Privately, because Mrs. Mondale has been asked the question so often, she wrinkles her nose, rolls her large brown eyes and says with a wisp of exasperation: ''I don't know why they keep asking me about the role of the candidate's wife. They think: wife, BONG!'' ''I don't want to be in the limelight,'' said Mrs. Mondale, an amiable and unpretentious woman with an elegant style and a girlish manner. ''I am a traditional wife. I know that is a vanishing breed.'' Wife's Job Is Different The nontraditional situation in which a woman is running with her husband has not changed her role, the Presidential nominee's wife says. ''She is the candidate, and I know what it was like when Fritz was Vice President,'' Mrs. Mondale said. ''He was always reading those big, black briefing books. And there is so much to learn.'' ''My job is a surrogate and an advocate. And as First Lady, there is a huge job in the White House. You need to make it a friendly place, and the food and the flower arrangements have to be wonderful!'' She has grown accustomed to swatting away questions of the etiquette involved in dealing with the first coed ticket, such as whether the two women, who attracted comment when both wore beige dresses the night of the Presidential nomination and red dresses at a Democratic breakfast the next day, plan to coordinate their outfits. (They don't.) She said that, as women have come into their own, the expectation for political wives to talk seriously about the issues has risen. About Recipes and Clothes ''I don't talk about recipes and I don't talk about clothes,'' she said. But a moment later she was talking about both. She gave a reporter an autographed copy of her new ''Mondale Family Cookbook,'' discussing the difficulty of properly cooking Minnesota wild rice. Mrs. Mondale said she did not offer advice to Mrs. Ferraro. Asked what they had talked about at a Labor Day dinner, she replied: ''Oh, what do women talk about? She liked my new red dress. I was so surprised that she could still think in feminine terms. That's what's so wonderful! She's not jaded and sour and crabby.'' The candidate's wife slips from serious discussions of the issues into homey topics, perhaps indicative of her ease with her status. She shows no symptoms of stifled identity. At a high school in Ridgefield, N.J., she recently criticized President Reagan over military spending and asserted that her husband did not need the Rev. Jesse Jackson to be a broker for the black vote. 'A Very Important Moment' Then, without skipping a beat, she said that she liked campaigning because ''I would hate to be in my kitchen baking cookies. It is a very important moment in history.'' Although some Democratic campaign consultants have suggested that Mrs. Mondale could play a valuable part in fleshing out and warming up her husband's public persona, that is not the approach she takes. Her speeches are polished, impersonal discussions of the issues, echoing her husband's positions and phrases. She works in ladylike jabs at Mr. Reagan, criticizing his ''bombing'' joke and other gaffes. Mrs. Mondale campaigns more independently than Nancy Reagan does and speaks out on women's rights. But Mrs. Reagan, by all accounts, has more influence over her husband's political decisions. When asked whether she offered her husband advice, Mrs. Mondale grimaced. ''He doesn't necessarily take advice on clothes or attitude,'' she said. Not a Polo-Shirt Man She recounted how she tried to persuade him to loosen up before one campaign appearance by forsaking his ubiquitous dark suit for a bright polo shirt. ''He looked at me and said: 'A polo shirt? I am going to wear my suit and tie, and if it's hot, I'll take my jacket off.' '' She shrugged. ''Who am I to want to change the way he dresses or combs his hair?'' She is asked what evolution brought a man of Mr. Mondale's generation to the point where he could become the first man to pick the first woman for a major party's Presidential ticket. She said he had become more sensitive over the years, as he dealt with social issues such as battered wives and day care. And, she said warmly, he has always been liberated at home. ''He has always encouraged me to pursue my own interests,'' she said. ''He never tried to say, 'Why are the beans burning?' '' Robert Squier, the Democratic campaign consultant, said Mrs. Mondale would be another valuable ace in seeking women's votes. Bolstering Each Other Many of those who have come to Mrs. Mondale's campaign stops agreed. ''In a sense Geraldine Ferraro being on the ticket kind of helps Mrs. Mondale, each kind of bolsters the other one as far as speaking up on women's issues,'' said Stina Santiestevan, a Detroit resident who heard Mrs. Mondale speak at a Labor Day rally there. But comparisons are inevitable. On a misty morning in Springfield, Mass., Mrs. Mondale went to a construction site of a high school where only a few people were on hand as she began trooping through the mud to look at exposed beams. ''Geraldine Ferraro would have attracted more people,'' said John Moriarty, the chairman of the school building committee. But Mrs. Mondale was unfazed. She held her orange hard hat and listened raptly as Mr. Moriarty told her that the three-story building would have a 750- pupil capacity, was 42 percent finished after only 30 percent of the allotted time, had been 14 years in the making and encompassed 20 acres of land. Afterward, in an interview with a television crew, she wove information gleaned from Mr. Moriarty into a plug for her husband's position on education. ''That,'' said Mr. Moriarty admiringly as she glided off to her motorcade, ''is a very sharp girl.''

913-> LETTER TO THE CONNECTICUT EDITOR
Ideas for Hiring The Middle-Aged Publishing Allen M. Widem's recent Opinion article (''Age 59, Experienced but Jobless,'' July 15) was a thoughtful choice. There are many of us - 59, experienced, competent and jobless that share Mr. Widem's frustration in what is becoming a national problem as longevity stretches. I have several thoughts on the subject; supportive comments on the frustrations aspect and proposals to ameliorate the growing crisis. Perhaps it's the perspective of being on the outside looking in, but it is amazing how rude and thoughtless people can be. Being rejected or replaced is deeply demoralizing to the individual and the family. Not getting responses to carefully prepared job solicitation letters or phone calls multiplies the misery. Any reasonable response indicating the reason for rejection can be helpful, and much preferable to no response at all. There may be many unspoken reasons for the reluctance to make a long-term hiring commitment to talented, senior people, but I suspect it all comes down to economics. That is, the assumption of future health and overhead costs, and the impact on younger incumbents' growth. Both can be overcome by a creative approach to executive employment, taking advantage of the talent now being wasted in our steadily aging population. Senior personnel could be hired as independent contractors, excluded from the standard corporate benefits package. A flexible package, financed by the employee on an individual basis, would become part of the compensation consideration, and handled similar to the high-risk automobile insurance pool. The senior employee could be used in a project-oriented way, concentrating on cost control and productivity issues in relation to his/her skills and experience. The line organization could off-load these critically important projects, allowing for more concentrated effort on the daily routine and at the same time making these new hirings self-financing, with zero effect on overhead. Getting started is a distinct problem. I would think that a pilot program would be in order to demonstrate feasibility. ADOLPH C. NEADERLAND Norwalk The Times welcomes letters from readers.

915-> LETTERS ; Danger on the Job
To the Editor: ''Workers Are Often a Hazard to Themselves'' (July 8) presents a confused combination of ideas that the business community and the Reagan Administration would have us all believe. Looked at more closely, the argument deteriorates into two parts that add up to an insidious example of blaming the victim. First, to blame workers for their own vulnerability reflects a basic misunderstanding of the relationships of social power in the workplace. For 80 percent of the American labor force, there is no union representation and employees depend for their livelihood upon the uncontested initiatives of management. The overwhelming majority of workers today are, in effect, powerless. Is it any wonder that ''many ignore unsafe conditions or fear to complain about them''? Is it surprising that workers are ''easily reassured by company experts'' when an employer threatens to close a plant because of the costs of safety and health compliance? When you have to keep your job in order to survive, you have to believe that things will turn out all right, which is exactly what employers want their workers to think. This is the coercion of the marketplace. One purpose of public regulation of workplace safety and health is to rectify this imbalance of social power. But OSHA has betrayed legislative intent and abandoned its commitment to workers. The agency has changed from regulator to industry consultant, and a generally cynical attitude about the efficacy of calling OSHA has been growing among workers for some time. It is wrong to throw the responsibility for job safety back into workers' laps. Do we ask the holdup victim looking at the point of a gun, ''Why don't you call a cop?'' A second element of the article is more subtle. If workers won't wear protective equipment even when it is provided, are they not to be blamed for their own plight? No, usually not. Where personal protective equipment is too cumbersome, too uncomfortable, or simply not usable by some workers, it cannot be called effective. Respirators, for example, often fit badly, and reduce the amount of air any person can breathe while wearing one. They can make an already hard job impossible. This was not the intent of the Occupational Safety and Health Act. Alternatives are available. The Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers' Union, in a report released in March 1983, found widespread employer compliance with the 1978 cotton dust standard - and also found that the companies investing in workplace improvements for the purpose of compliance made larger profits than the industry as a whole. (See ''Current Report, Occupational Safety and Health Reporter,'' Vol. 12., p. 908, March 24, 1983.) But fundamentally, the health and safety of those in hazardous work must not depend upon the profitability of effective hazard protection. Society as a whole derives the benefit of hazardous work. Society should take the initiative to protect those who must perform it. ROGER TULIN Arlington, Mass., July 11

916-> MOSTLY MOZART: STOLTZMAN AND GOODE
THE Mostly Mozart Festival concerts in Avery Fisher Hall are often preceded by short 7 P.M. recitals, at which interested ticketholders for the main event can cluster near the front of the huge auditorium and hear chamber music with something like intimacy. Tuesday, the stars of the 8 P.M. program participated in the warmup act as well. They were the clarinetist Richard Stoltzman and the pianist Richard Goode, and they gave the most poetic performance I have ever heard of Schumann's ''Fantasy Pieces'' (Op. 73). They dared to play so gently and slowly that forward motion was all but suspended. That ''all but,'' of course, defines - or would if verbal definition were possible - the invisible line between a slack performance and a magical one. Nothing on the program proper quite regained this level, perhaps because Mr. Goode and Mr. Stoltzman were not heard together again. The clarinetist, for instance, entered that special state of serenity once again in the slow movement of Mozart's clarinet quintet, but though it was wonderful, one couldn't lose oneself in it quite the same way, because of the moments of slight unsteadiness in the accompaniment of the American String Quartet. The American did not on the whole have a good night. In the pre-concert recital they gave a ragged account of a Haydn quartet (Op. 64, No. 6); Beethoven's third ''Razumovsky'' quartet also had a disconcerting dosage of small fumbles, and the first violinist, Mitchell Stern, played with unusual reticence at times. Daniel Avshalomov, the violist, seemed consistently the strongest member (lovely in solo lines of the Beethoven; crisp enough in dotted figures, as his colleagues weren't, to avoid blurring in the big hall). In Weber's piano quartet in B-flat, David Geber made little of a genial L"andler tune that could have been charming. This was shared with Mr. Goode, who certainly caught the charm in his part of it. The Weber piece is hearty and varied (''rambling,'' one might have said after a lesser performance); its main virtue Tuesday was to give scope for the pianist's ebullient, generous playing. His sense of musical event, of the simple but keen satisfaction to be had from the workings- out of a good sonata allegro movement, is a joy. It's an odd comparison, but I found myself reminded more than once of Rubinstein: Mr. Goode shares in some part his way of seeming to embrace a piece of music. It is difficult to find words, meanwhile, for the satisfaction that the famous clarinetist gave with his part of the Mozart work. Faust's, perhaps: Stay awhile, you minor triad, you tender little scale, you bit of chromatic inflection of which Mr. Stoltzman makes a moment so fair!

917-> 5 HURT BY BOMB IN JOHANNESBURG
Five people, four of them police officers, were wounded today when a bomb exploded at a building housing the Government department that oversees apartheid regulations, the authorities announced. The explosion occurred two days after elections for a new, segregated assembly of mixed-race representatives. A bomb damaged Government education offices in an industrial suburb Thursday but no one was hurt. No one took responsibility for today's explosion. The African National Congress, the largest guerrilla group trying to end white rule in South Africa, has taken responsibility for other bombings. The bomb appeared to have been in the middle levels of the downtown Johannesburg building, and it buckled walls on three sides. Windows, air- conditioners and pieces of shattered furniture were blown out on the third, fourth and fifth floors. Railway Policemen Hurt Most offices in the seven-story building were closed for the day. Maj. Gen. Robbie Robbertze, police deputy commissioner of the South African Railways, said four railroad policemen were slightly wounded and a civilian woman had undetermined injuries. The railway police have offices in the building. The building also houses offices of the Department of Community Development, which runs the white-minority Government's apartheid laws affecting the Asian and mixed-race minorities. The department is responsible for keeping white, Asian and mixed-race neighborhoods segregated. Under a new Constitution, the Government has set up parliamentary chambers for the country's 850,000 Asians and its 2.7 million people of mixed race. Parliament's white chamber will have veto power over the other two assemblies. The Asians are to elect delegates to their chamber next Wednesday. The nation's majority, 22 million blacks, still have no vote and cannot own land or move about freely.

918-> JOE CRONIN, AN EX-EXECUTIVE AND STAR PLAYER IN BASEBALL
Joe Cronin, the soft-spoken bank clerk-turned-shortstop who spent 20 sparkling years as a major league player and player-manager and later served two terms as president of the American League, died yesterday at his home in Osterville, Mass. He was 77 years old and had been ill for some time. In his years as an active player - for the Pittsburgh Pirates, the Washington Senators and the Boston Red Sox - Cronin gained a reputation as a sure- fielding, hard-throwing infielder, but it was his performance at the plate that assured his election to baseball's Hall of Fame in 1956. Although not a power-hitter (he never had more than 24 home runs a season and usually hit fewer than 10), Cronin was known as one of the great clutch-hitters of his time. ''With a man on third and one out,'' the famed manager Connie Mack once said, ''I'd rather have Cronin hitting for me than anybody I've ever seen, and that includes Cobb, Simmons and the rest of them.'' Record Still Stands Cronin's five pinch-hit home runs with the Red Sox in 1943 established an American League record that still stands, and he ended his playing career in 1945 with a lifetime batting average of .301. He was also known as one of the most polite players in baseball, a characteristic Cronin attributed to the influence of an early teammate, Pie Traynor, the great Pirate third baseman, whom Cronin described as a perfect gentleman. ''I probably caught it from him,'' Cronin once told an interviewer. Joseph Edward Cronin, the son of an Irish-born horse-team driver and an Irish-American mother, was born in San Francisco on Oct. 12, 1906, just a few months after the great earthquake and fire had devastated the city and impoverished his family. He attended local schools, played endless hours of baseball in Excelsior Park across the street from his home and emerged as a star athlete in several sports. As a member of a blue-collar family, he startled local society figures when he was 14 by capturing the city's junior championship in the society sport of tennis. While his brothers worked as manual laborers, Cronin worked as a bank clerk, graduated from high school and then turned down a scholarship from St. Mary's College to continue assisting his family. Signed by Pittsburgh Baseball was his major love, and while playing semipro ball in Napa, across the bay, he caught the eye of a Pittsburgh scout, Joe Devine, who offered him a professional contract in 1925. Cronin started his career that year with the Pirates' farm club in Johnstown, Pa. But with Traynor and other star infielders on the Pirate team, Cronin had trouble breaking into the lineup. He played part of the 1926 season in Pittsburgh, but spent most of the time with the New Haven minor league team. After appearing in a few Pirate games in 1927, mostly watching from the dugout as his teammates won the pennant, Cronin was sold the next year to the American Association team in Kansas City, Mo., where he was promptly spotted by Joe Engel, a scout for the Senators. Sold to the Senators for the unusually large sum, at that time, of $7,500, Cronin had a shaky debut in 1928 but improved a bit for his first full season in 1929. The next year he made his mark on the game by hitting .346 and being selected as the American League's most valuable player. In 1933, Clark Griffith, the Senators' owner, made Cronin player-manager, and under Cronin, who hit .309, led the league in doubles and led the league's shortstops in fielding, the Senators won the pennant. But they lost the World Series to the New York Giants. A Dubious Distinction The next year proved disastrous as the Senators dropped to seventh place, but during the All-Star Game Cronin earned part of a special footnote to baseball history. He was one of five future Hall of Famers, including Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, who were struck out in succession by Carl Hubbell. After the 1934 season, Cronin married Griffith's niece and secretary, Mildred Robertson. Griffith then sold his new nephew-in-law to the Red Sox for the then-extraordinary sum of $250,000 plus a shortstop, and also saw to it that Cronin got a five-year, $50,000-a-year contract as player-manager. Cronin continued as an active player until he broke a leg in July 1945, but he had taken himself out of the regular lineup in 1942. The Red Sox did not win a pennant with Cronin as manager until 1946, when the club won 104 games but lost the World Series to the St. Louis Cardinals. Headed American League After retiring as field manager in 1947, he served 11 years as a Red Sox executive before being named president of the American League in 1959. In his 14 years in the job, Cronin oversaw the expansion of the league from 8 to 12 teams, stirred controversy when he dismissed two umpires for ''incompetence'' after he learned they were trying to form a union in 1970 and ended his career in further controversy when he vetoed the Yankees' effort to hire the Oakland A's manager, Dick Williams, while approving the Detroit Tigers' signing of the Yankees' former manager, Ralph Houk. In addition to his wife, he is survived by three sons, Thomas, Michael and Hayward; a daughter, Maureen Hayward, and several grandchildren. A funeral service will be held at 11 A.M. Monday in Hyannis, Mass.

919-> LETTERS TO THE LONG ISLAND EDITOR Women, Crime And Jail Capacity
The recent article ''Violent Crimes by Women Increasing'' has brought attention to the problems of women in the criminal justice system. However, it is inadequate in the conclusion that an increase of women committing violent and drug-related crimes has caused the need to expand the women's facility in the Nassau County jail. Usually, this jail holds 80 women out of a total population that recently has varied from 800 to 1,000. While the current number of women is more than double the average daily population of women 10 years ago, recent research indicates that the number charged with violent offenses, which is less than 10 percent, has decreased during the same period. Many women are charged with nonviolent offenses and are not a threat to community safety. Sixty percent of the population in Nassau's jail have not been convicted of the crime with which they were charged. Many await trial month after month in substandard, inadquate conditions. These conditions are responsible for the Thompson lawsuit, a class-action litigation pertaining specifically to the conditions of the women in the jail. The suit alleges that they are held without adequate medical care and without services and programs to prepare them to return to the community as productive members. A forthcoming report from the Nassau Coalition for Safety and Justice will make information on women in the Nassau County jail available. Half have no previous occupation; less than half have completed high school. Many are functionally illiterate. They tend to be young and unmarried, and the majority have dependent children. Many are victims of troubled or abused childhoods. Many are dependent on alcohol or drugs. The majority have children; we must consider the needs of both the women and their children and the consequences to society if we don't. The system is detrimental to the mother-child relationship. It cuts off women from their children but does not remove a mother's commitment to them, nor does it determine that she is unfit as a parent. Even short periods of confinement may force a mother to place her children in foster care. Subsequent problems may arise upon release, when mothers may have difficulty reuniting their families. The jail makes no accommodations for children. They must wait in long lines to enter and leave the jail, and are not allowed to bring in bottles or toys. The required adult escort is counted against the mother's maximum of three visitors a week. No visits are permitted on weekdays or holidays. Recently, two newborns were housed with their mothers at the Nassau County Medical Center because of a lack of facilities. Women in the Nassau jail are not treated equally to their male counterparts. The women are confined to their cells or to their unit most of, if not all of, the day. Men can participate in programs that give them access to other areas. The jobs women can perform are more limited. This prevents them from earning extra visiting days, the compensation for jail work. Women do not have the same access on a consistent basis to programs such as high school equivalency, English as a second language and drug counseling. Men can see a doctor every day, women only twice a week. To say that the decision to expand the women's unit at the Nassau jail was caused by an increase of women committing violent and drug-related crimes is erroneous. The increase in the number of women in Nassau County's jail is an outcome of the same events that created a tremendous strain on the whole criminal justice system. Let's not overlook the fact that once the women are moved, their old unit will be used to house men. Less expensive, more effective alternatives to jail expansion could be found. If Nassau County persists in the belief that the answer to its problems is to expand the facility for women, let them recognize the needs of the women and their children. Eventually these women return to the community. These women and children are part of the future. AMY JALBERT Resource Coordinator Nassau Coalition for Safety and Justice Inc. Mineola

920-> ZAPMAIL MAY BECOME PASSE
The Federal Express Corporation has made a habit of turning businesses into industries. In 1973, the business was shipping packages overnight. Three years later, it pushed into overnight documents. Then in 1981 came overnight letters. Now the company, flush with confidence from its success so far, is turning to electronic mail. But electronic mail may be one of its riskiest ventures yet, analysts say. Federal Express plans to invest as much as $1.2 billion over the next decade in electronic mail, nearly the amount it has spent to date on airplanes and trucks for its regular service. The risk, experts say, is that the electronic mail technology it has chosen - facsimile machines - may make quick profits for the Memphis- based company now, but leave it out of future competition when most offices are computerized. The company, as ever, is confident. It expects that over the next two years, the service, which it has named Zapmail, will replace as much as 30 percent of its existing document and urgent letter traffic, which, at 180,000 pieces a night, now accounts for about a third of its revenues and more than half its package shipments. By 1988, the company has said, Zapmail could be generating $1.33 billion in sales, or about a third of Federal Express's expected overall revenues, up from about $35 million this year. A Different Approach Introduced in early July, Zapmail differs from traditional electronic mail now being offered by the MCI Communications Corporation, the Western Union Corporation and a raft of other competitors. Aiming at customers who would rather have an actual document in hand, Federal Express is using facsimile machines to send documents in as little as an hour in 80 percent of the territory it serves. The other companies offer computer-based correspondence transmission, or so-called computer mailbox service. ''We're of the opinion that this will coexist with high-speed data transmission; we've never looked at MCI as a competitor,'' said Thomas R. Oliver, senior vice president for marketing and customer service at Federal Express. Analysts, on the other hand, expect most of the long-term growth to be in computer mailboxes, currently the smallest segment of the business, as offices of the future incorporate computers, copiers, work stations and other computerized peripherals into one network. Federal Express, however, believes such developments will be slow to come and that managers will continue to need paper copies. ''They're right on target for today's market, but to dismiss computer communications out of hand could be very shortsighted,'' said H. Paris Burstyn, an analyst for Arthur D. Little Inc., a research concern. ''Is the paperless office going to be a long time in coming, so that Mr. Oliver can make money? Or is it going to happen very fast, so that by not even entering the electronic mailbox business, they are cutting themselves out of the growth market?'' To succeed, Federal Express must now convince managers of the need to get documents almost immediately. But the company has thrived on using marketing muscle to create business. A 'C' Idea Works Out Frederick W. Smith, the company's chairman, proposed the idea of shipping high-priority packages by air in a class paper at Yale University, where he studied economics in the mid-1960's. He got a ''C'' for his effort. But once the idea got off the ground, Mr. Smith succeeded in convincing American executives that they ''absolutely, positively'' had to receive important documents by noon the next day. Zapmail merely compresses the delivery time. Now Mr. Smith is telling businesses to use Zapmail ''when there's no tommorrow.'' The technology is not new - the ITT Corporation has been offering an in-office facsimile service, Faxpak, since 1979 - but the marketing angle is. Federal Express began seriously studying facsimile mail service about four years ago, to meet the challenge of electronic mail to its overnight document and letter delivery service. A Decision to 'Attack' ''We could either consider it to be a threat, or we could attack,'' Mr. Oliver said. Marketing research studies showed that the company would face little customer resistance in making the shift. ''They perceived that this was the same Federal Express that they already knew, except that it shipped with electronics rather than airplanes,'' Mr. Oliver said. In 1982, Federal Express began installing prototype computerized dispatch terminals for the service. With traditional overnight document and letter delivery, Federal Express couriers have much more leeway in picking up and delivering documents and packages. The only requirement is to get the package delivered by 10:30 A.M. the next day. The typical cost of an overnight letter is $12.50. With the new service, Federal Express promises to pick up the message, deliver it to a nearby base station, where it will be ''faxed'' to a base station near its destination and finally delivered, all within two hours. The cost is $35 for up to five pages. If the customer brings the document to a Federal Express office, the company charges $25 and promises delivery within an hour. A $100 Million Outlay, So Far Federal Express has invested about $100 million in the venture so far, mostly for installing the newest- generation facsimile machines, designed specially by the NEC Corporation of Japan, and computer dispatch systems in about 50 key stations. It plans to spend about $25 million in its fiscal year 1985 to promote Zapmail. The outlays are depressing short- term profits, but Federal Express expects a big payoff in two or three years. Zapmail eliminates much of the labor-intensive sorting and transportation costs associated with the regular overnight service, which is expected to continue flourishing. Moreover, the company is counting on productivity improvements, because it believes most Zapmail will be picked up, transmitted and delivered during the lull between 10:30 A.M., when regular deliveries are finished, and 2 P.M. or 3 P.M., when pickups begin in volume. The company plans to increase savings further by leasing facsimile machines to high-volume customers, probably early next year, reducing transportation expenses even more. Any company that transmits more than 10 to 20 documents a month will probably find it cheaper to install a leased facsimile machine in house, Mr. Oliver said. Satellite Link Envisioned Longer term, the company intends to transmit most of Zapmail messages by satellite instead of through more expensive telephone lines now leased from long-distance carriers. The company is seeking permission from Federal regulators to launch two satellites in early 1988. ''We think that the operating margins will be better in this than in the express business,'' Mr. Oliver said. He added that Federal Express expects to turn a profit in Zapmail, which is handling about 1,000 messages a day, by its fiscal fourth quarter, which ends May 31. Only DHL Worldwide Courier Express, the largest international priority package carrier, is challenging Federal Express in the facsimile services. The privately held company, which began its push into the American package market last year, hopes to test its network next year. For now, Mr. Oliver said, Federal Express is staying out of the electronic mailbox segment of the market that has attracted a swarm of competitors. ''We wouldn't bring anything to the party,'' he said. The electonic mailbox suppliers use mainly computers to transmit text, either to a personal computer or to printers, where it is delivered by the Postal Service or private couriers. A 'First-Class' Target The players generally are hoping to capture correspondence that would otherwise travel by slower, first-class mail, such as multiple memos to corporate field offices or, in the printout letter segment of the industry, marketing and political mailings. Analysts estimate the demand for such service at about $150 million this year, growing to more than $1 billion by the end of the decade. ''None of that stuff is in Federal's market,'' said J. Robert Harcharik, president of the MCI Digital Information Services Corporation, which began its electronic mail service, MCI Mail, last September. MCI subscribers pay $1 to send messages of up to 7,500 words to another subscriber's computer. To nonsubscibers, members can send printed messages one of three ways: for usual next-day delivery by regular mail for $2; by noon the next day for $6, via Purolater Courier, and within four hours the same day via Purolator for $25. Mr. Harcharik said the company delivered 700,000 messages in June. Mr. Oliver said Federal Express expects plenty of demand for its facsimile copies, even if the office of the future arrives sooner than expected. But competitors and analysts, noting the company's satellite network plans, are not counting Federal Express out of electronic mailbox contention yet. ''I don't think Federal Express is going to stop where they are by any stretch of the imagination,'' Mr. Harcharik said. ''I think, in the long haul, they will have a system like ours. I would, if I were them.''

921-> 17 ARE KILLED AS 2 PLANES COLLIDE OVER CALIFORNIA
A commuter plane operated by Wings West and a private plane on a training flight collided in flight today, killing all 17 people aboard the flights. The collision occurred at 11:34 A.M. midway between Los Angeles and San Francisco in what an air traffic controller described as ''excellent'' weather. The crash scattered flaming wreckage and ignited a 20-acre brush fire that was quickly contained, the authorities said. A preliminary report indicated two people were aboard the small plane and 15 were aboard the commuter flight, said Lester Ringold, a National Transportation Safety Board spokesman in Washington. Wings West Flight 628, a twin-engine jet-prop Beechcraft C-99, left San Luis Obispo for San Francisco just before the collision, said Barbara Abels, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration. The other plane was a single-engine Rockwell Commander that left Paso Robles Airport at 10:55 A.M. with an instructor and student aboard, said the air traffic controller at Paso Robles, who spoke on condition his name not be used. The Commander, a single-engine, four-seat aircraft, was owned by the Aesthetech Corporation, a flight school in Paso Robles, according to the Air Force Rescue Control Center in Belleville, Ill. A woman who answered the telephone at Aesthetech's offices today said, ''We have no statement.'' The Wings West flight originated in Santa Maria and stopped in San Luis Obispo to pick up additional passengers, said Carol Kronin, a Wings West spokesman. Six people boarded in Santa Maria and seven in San Luis Obispo, she said. She identified the pilot as Capt. Paul Nebolon, 27 years old, of Rolling Hills, and the co-pilot as Deverl Johnson, 45, of Merced. Another spokesman for the airline, Joanne Dowty, said it was the first fatal accident involving one of its flights. In a 1983 crash involving a commuter airline, 10 people were killed when an Air Illinois plane crashed Oct. 11, near Pinckneyville, Ill. The last major commercial airline accident in the United States involved a Pan American World Airways jet that crashed July 9, 1982, killing 149 people. On June 2, 1983, 23 people died when a fire forced an Air Canada DC-9 to make an emergency landing at the Greater Cincinnati Airport, in Covington, Ky. Crashed in Hilly Area Miss Dowty said the crash today occurred north of the airport and west of Laguna Lake in a hilly, rural area inside the San Luis Obispo city limits. The crash site was a grazing area called Soze Ranch. An ambulance attendant on the scene after the accident said, ''There was wreckage on top of hillsides and wreckage strewn over a real wide area.'' The attendant, who said he spoke only on condition he not be identified because he feared losing his job, added, ''All the bodies were in such bad shape there was no chance at all of resuscitating anybody.'' After the crash, rescue workers formed a line to walk across the pasture to search for airplane parts and remains of the victims. Lieut. John Hastie of the San Luis Obispo County Sheriff's Department said that the remains were taken to funeral homes and that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had been asked to help identify the victims. 'I Heard a Blast' Bill Machado, 60, who lives in a mobile home half a mile from the crash site, said he was hosing down his dog when he saw the two aircraft heading toward each other. ''I watched those planes, and then I heard a blast,'' he said. ''I looked and saw this plane spiraling down. The little one disappeared so fast. The big two-engine job was coming down slow, spiraling, spiraling down.'' Moments later, he said, a ball of flame shot up over a hill. Don Llorente of the National Transportation Safety Board said no flight plan had been filed for the Commander. Investigators for the board flew immediately to the scene, 175 miles northwest of Los Angeles, he said. The Los Angeles Air Traffic Control Center in Palmdale had just made contact with the commuter plane before 11:34 A.M., when both radio and radar contact were lost, said Miss Abels, the F.A.A. spokesman. She said visibility was good for 15 miles. Miss Dowty said the Wings West plane was on a regularly scheduled flight.

923-> BLACKS AND JEWS SEEKING BETTER TIES
NEW ROCHELLE THEY had watched as recent events inflamed passions, heightened tensions and fueled misunderstanding between blacks and Jews across the nation and in their own city. They watched as the rift between the two groups widened and as what was called a ''greater chasm'' was being enlarged by the Rev. Jesse Jackson's campaign and statements by the Muslim minister Louis A. Farrakhan. But rather than sit by and allow outside forces to erode the historic alliance between the two groups, members of the black and Jewish communities in this city have gotten together to discuss how recent events are affecting their relationship and what can be done to avoid further polarization. ''I was informed that a meeting was desired,'' said Rabbi Amiel Wohl of Temple Israel in New Rochelle, ''that a simmering situation existed that could blow up.'' Rabbi Wohl said that while he and others had not witnessed any great dissension among blacks and Jews in New Rochelle, there was concern that a rift could develop unless steps were taken. So they got together beginning in May: Rabbi Wohl, the Rev. Vernon A. Shannon of St. Catherine's African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, the Rev. Calvin Sampson of the Shiloh Baptist Church in New Rochelle; Jamil Abdul-Malik, spiritual leader of the Islamic Mission of America, and Frances Clements, president of the New Rochelle branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. ''We came together to solve social problems and overcome injustice, racism and bigotry and to eliminate group animosity,'' Rabbi Wohl said. ''We pledged to pool our energies to overcome our common foe.'' By the third session, Mr. Shannon recalled, the group had expanded and began dealing with specific issues regarding what he described as discrimination against blacks and Jewish victimization. The meetings will end Sept. 19 in a daylong conference at the New Rochelle High School. It is believed to be the first conference of its kind to deal with what some have called ''the black-Jewish problem'' in this country. Billed as a ''day of interaction,'' the conference will bring together representatives from the black and Jewish communities - young and old - throughout the county and across the country to deal with issues concerning the two groups, ranging from images and stereotypes to politics and aspirations. The keynote speakers will be Ossie Davis, the actor and black activist who lives in New Rochelle, and Albert Vorspan, vice president of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations - the national body of the Reform Jewish Congregation. The conference has been endorsed by the Westchester Jewish Conference, the umbrella organization for all Jewish groups in the county; the Black Ministers Coalition of Westchester, the N.A.A.C.P. of New Rochelle and the city's Youth Bureau. Dr. John Gaddy, principal of New Rochelle High School, has agreed to release students from classes to attend the conference. The conference's organizers said they hoped their undertaking would serve as a prototype for use in other communities. ''People have to talk to each other,'' Mr. Shannon said. He and Rabbi Wohl represent two of the largest congregations in the city. ''Too often people internalize their feelings,'' Mr. Shannon added. ''That leads to misunderstanding and misconceptions. As long as we maintain a dialogue, we can head off that happening here.'' Rabbi Wohl said: ''We must persevere and not permit careless extreme statements by persons prominent or ordinary to inflame passions in an unproductive manner. There was a desire among those in this community to reaffirm the central core of the traditional relationship between blacks and Jews.'' It had not always been that way. In the 1960's, New Rochelle was the site of racial tension and while the problems were resolved, a racially divided city remained - an image that was further tarnished in 1977 when Frederick Cowan, a Nazi cultist and avowed racist, went on a rampage in downtown New Rochelle, killing six people including himself. The black and Jewish populations of New Rochelle are about equal in number, each representing 20 to 25 percent of the city's 70,000 residents. But the groups have traditionally been divided geographically and often politcally. The city's black community is concentrated largely in the central city area that has been the focus of urban renewal. Many middle- and upper- middle-income black families also live in a long-established integrated community in the northern part of the city, where a majority of the Jews live. In 1979, members of the black and Jewish communities found themselves at odds over the national debate generated by the resignation of Andrew Young as Ambassador to the United Nations, which many blacks said was a result of Jewish pressure stemming from Mr. Young's overtures to Yasir Arafat and the Palestine Liberation Organization. It was Rabbi Wohl and Mr. Shannon, each of whom came to New Rochelle in 1973 - the minister from North Carolina, the rabbi from Ohio - who decided that the ''decade of silence'' that had existed between the two groups should end. At their initiative, members of the two congregations began meeting to discuss problems. Those initial meetings, which were punctuated by shouting matches, led to the Coalition for Mutual Respect, a group of clergy, lay people and civic leaders working together to help improve conditions in the city. The meetings also resulted in an interdenominational observance of Thanksgiving and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, an yearly awards dinner, and an increase in Jewish membership in the N.A.A.C.P. More important, according to Mr. Shannon, the meetings have led to a ''mutual respect of each other.'' ''We are peoples tied together who can achieve more working in concert than in our separate ways,'' concluded Rabbi Wohl. ''The conference is open to all those interested in re-cementing the firm foundation that undergirds the historic black-Jewish relationship in America.'' Historically, Jews, sharing a feeling of discrimination with blacks, have been in the forefront of the fight for civil rights. The conference's organizers conceded that there may be little they can do to effect change on a national level. They said they believe, for example, that the problems existing between blacks and Jews underscore a growing race problem in this country. ''When you talk to a lot of young people today, they don't break it down into a black-Jewish conflict, as much as a black-white conflict,'' suggested Mr. Shannon. ''They see Jews as part of the white establishment.'' Although the conference will not specifically deal with political issues, its timing - less than two months before the Presidential election - may provide a forum to address some of the political issues that have contributed to the rift between blacks and Jews. Many blacks are still upset over the reaction in Jewish communities to statements made by Mr. Jackson. They blame the Jewish leadership for exerting pressure on Walter Mondale and the Democratic Party to disavow Mr. Jackson because of anti-Semitic statements he made during the campaign and because of his association with Mr. Farrakhan. Some members of the Jewish community, in turn, feel that Mr. Mondale did not respond quickly or decisively in calling upon Mr. Jackson to dissociation himself with Mr. Farrakhkan. Now members of both groups are waiting to see how Mr. Mondale will respond to Mr. Jackson's requests. If he is too conciliatory to Mr. Jackson, he may lose the Jewish vote nationwide. If he is not, he may lose the black vote, many political experts predict. Rabbi Wohl and Mr. Shannon both agreed that the political situation had only exacerbated tensions between blacks and Jews. But they have appealed to the black and Jewish communities to look beyond what has happened to what can be. ''We are not asking that Jews give up their Jewishness or blacks their blackness,'' Mr. Shannon explained. ''At the same time, we recognize we have a common background of suffering and aspiration. And we must work together to fulfill our dreams and aspirations. That is what has made America a great nation.''

924-> THE FLAW IN SOCIAL SECURTIY'S 'CATCH-UP'
To the Editor: May I ask a moment of your readers' time to walk through the recent decision of the Senate to act on the President's proposal to give a cost-of- living adjustment to Social Security recipients next year? The first thing to be said is that the Senate's action will have no significant long-range cost to the trust fund. This is the view, for example, of Robert J. Myers, for 23 years chief actuary of the Social Security Administration and executive director of the President's National Commission on Social Security Reform. It helps to be an actuary to explain this, but allow me to try. Twelve years ago, in 1972, Congress decided to set in place automatic cost- of-living adjustments for Social Security benefits. However, such adjustments would be skipped in years when the price index rose by less than 3 percent (which is happening this year for the first time since the provision went into effect). As much as anything, this was done to save the bother of reprogramming the then-antiquated computers. Congress provided, however, that a ''catch-up'' would be made in whichever subsequent year the cumulative price rise passed 3 percent. One result of this approach is that people retiring in a year in which a 3 percent ''catch-up'' COLA does occur will receive a double adjustment, that for the year in which they retire and for the previous year or years in which they were not retired. This double adjustment continues for the rest of their lives and their survivors' lives also. All this is a bit technical, but the central fact is simple. The present system overpays some recipients, i.e., those who retire in a year following one or more for which the cost-of- living adjustment has been postponed. Call it double-dipping. The simple solution, especially now that we have a much-improved computer system, is to give a cost-of-living adjustment each year that prices rise. I have introduced such legislation, as has Representative Barber C. Conable Jr., also a member of the President's Commission. DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN U.S. Senator from New York Washington, Aug. 7, 1984

925-> Ali Testifies
Muhammad Ali denied yesterday that Champion Sports Management Inc. of Virginia Beach, Va., had deceived investors, as charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Ali, the company's chairman, made the statement in a Federal court hearing. The S.E.C. charged last week that the company failed to disclose a $600,000 loss, reporting it as a gain and making it appear that the company was an attractive investment. Mr. Ali, who is not accused of any wrongdoing in the suit, said he appeared voluntarily ''to clear my name.'' Handed a copy of the company's prospectus, Mr. Ali admitted that he had never read it. Judge Robert Ward said he would reserve decision on an S.E.C. request for an order barring the company and its president, Richard Herschfeld, 36, from future violations of securities laws, but at another point urged both sides to settle the matter among themselves.

926-> CRITICS' CHOICES; CABLE TV
Though life in general may be short on second chances, television is generous. For evidence, take three 1983 movies available on cable this week - ''Under Fire,'' ''Never Say Never Again'' and ''Octopussy.'' Though all have been broadcast previously, all can be recommended to anyone who missed them the first time around. By far the most compelling is the sometimes underrated Roger Spottiswoode film ''Under Fire,'' scheduled by HBO at 10 P.M. on Wednesday. Starring Nick Nolte, Gene Hackman and Joanna Cassidy, ''Under Fire'' is at once an engrossing adult love story, an exciting portrait of journalists at work and a drama of political upheaval in Nicaragua. The musical score by Jerry Goldsmith is extraordinary. ''Never Say Never Again'' and ''Octopussy'' furnish an oppportunity to judge competing Bonds - James Bonds, that is: Sean Connery in ''Never Say Never Again'' and Roger Moore in ''Octopussy.'' Basically a remake of ''Thunderball,'' ''Never Say Never Again'' (HBO on Tuesday at 11 A.M. and 11:45 P.M. and Friday at 1:30 P.M. and 1:10 A.M.; SHO Monday at 7:30 A.M. and 10 P.M.) pits the British agent 007 against SPECTRE's scheme to hold two cruise missiles for ransom. ''Octopussy'' (Cinemax, Saturday at 4:30 P.M. and 3:25 A.M.) sends its Bond from Cuba to India to Europe in the course of a yet another tale of saving the world from nuclear disaster. Mr. Connery - given an opportunity by the script to acknowledge advancing age - plays 007 with the dry wit characteristic of his early Bond portrayals. Mr. Moore, ever the tongue-in-cheek playboy, ambles through the role. Though the critical edge goes to ''Never Say Never Again,'' there is ample fun in ''Octopussy,'' too. Lawrence Van Gelder Broadcast TV Last Thursday, Horace Rumpole, the unorthodox British barrister, was seen in a two-hour special giving up retirement in sunny Florida (''I am not an orange,'' he grandly declared) and returning, via various outrageous ploys, to law practice at London's Old Bailey. This Thursday, on channels 13 and 49 at 9 P.M., he settles in for a run of six weeks in new hour-long episodes of ''Rumpole of the Bailey.'' Needless to say, Rumpole is still being portrayed by Leo McKern. One never meddles with inspired casting. Rumpole was created by John Mortimer, whose other writing credits include the adaptation of Evelyn Waugh's ''Brideshead Revisited'' and the autobiographical ''Voyage Round My Father.'' Like his father, Mr. Mortimer is a barrister, and his grasp of the more unorthodox, if not seamier, aspects of the profession is unusually thorough. He clearly enjoys having a bit of fun at the expense of life's more absurd pomposities, and Rumpole serves him well. Looking like a large sack of slightly soiled laundry, Horace growls constantly and puffs aways on dreadful little cigars, scattering ashes recklessly, while periodically reverting to the Great Poets to underscore his more profound points. Shakespeare, of course, is a great favorite, but Wordsworth will be trotted out for his more pastoral moods. This somewhat Falstaffian rogue is surrounded with an appropriately distinctive gallery of characters, most notably his wife Hilda, also known as She Who Must Be Obeyed (Peggy Thorpe Bates) and Guthrie Featherstone (Peter Bowles), the social climber who is never quite sure if old Rumpole is being serious. This season gets off to a nifty start with a case involving an elderly artist seemingly bent on being convicted as a forgerer and tweaking the pretensions of the art Establishment. The devious codger is played by Emlyn Williams. Rumpole pontificates, of course, about beauty being truth, truth beauty, but concludes that barristers ''have to know a damn sight more than that - Keats only knew the half of it.'' John J. O'Connor Photography Joel Sternfeld is one of a number of young American photographers whose romantic view of their native land is admirably expressed in a hymn written by a 19th-century Bishop of Calcutta: ''Where every prospect pleases and only man is vile.'' Whether Sternfeld photographs Alaska, Atlanta, California or the industrial Northeast, the beauty of nature is inevitably marred by a dump site, a trailer park, a factory or people. Most of the recent work on view at Daniel Wolf, 30 West 57th Street, through Nov. 3, has not been seen before in New York. The large color photographs, taken with an 8 by 10 view camera, have all the opulance of color and detail that admirers of his earlier work will expect, but there is more emphasis on people than previously, and in a few photographs of migrant workers in Texas, people fill the pictures completely, leaving no room for nature. In one Colorado landscape, golden Autumnal trees tower in sunlight over a shady gully into which five derelict automobiles have been pushed. In a splendid panorama of the Arizona desert, a large, fat woman in the foreground partially obscures the view of a housing development, which itself mars the primeval splendor of the landscape. In a California picture, a solemn-faced youngish man (a writer? a psychiatrist? a successful business executive?) sits in an outdoor hot tub surrounded by redwood decks, a brick terrace, gardening tools and all the luxuriant vegetation that the well-watered California desert produces. Except in his choice of subject matter, the photographer maintains a discrete emotional distance. His pictures, though at bottom romantic, seem to express a pained acceptance of the inevitable. Gene Thornton Music ''Trio,'' a ''jazz chamber opera'' that opens Wednesday evening at Carnegie Recital Hall and is repeated there Thursday, Friday and Saturday, is a haunting a heartening gem about a grandmother, mother and pregnant daughter. The music and lyrics are by Noa Ain; although no particular song struck me as a hit when I saw the July premiere in Philadelphia, the whole is touchingly poetic. There is no real plot. Dahlia (Val Eley) is about to give birth. In a series of 32 songs (some only a few seconds long), she, her mother Francine (Novella Nelson), and grandmother Mary (Karla Burns), explore their loves and hostilities, reminisce, and fantasize and affirm familiness in preparation for extending it to a new generation. There was a special kind of lyricism and vibrancy in the Philadelphia performance, which featured the same cast. The audience was spellbound. Miss Eley gave a beautiful, varied, open performance; Miss Burns sang stunningly, and all three women were utterly involving.

927-> NEW YORK; TAX BREAKS NEVER DIE
In New York City, tax concessions for those who don't need them never die. In fact, they don't even seem to fade away. The current city administration acknowledges that over the last decade or so, hundreds of millions of dollars in city tax gifts were awarded unnecessarily to developers and others through an ill-planned and ill-supervised collection of programs designed to revive a flagging economy. The general conclusion now is that the early critics were right - most of the projects would have been carried out anyway, without the tax concessions, and beyond that, most of the benefits went to the already affluent and almost all the projects were in Manhattan. Yet the waste of tax dollars continues, in large amounts. The latest giveaway involves a program known as 421-A. This is a section of state law that was enacted 13 years ago to stimulate the building of apartments on economically unattractive sites in this city where housing would otherwise not be built - sites defined in the statute as ''vacant, predominantly vacant, or underutilized.'' No one imagined in 1971 that the Trump Tower, on ''underutilized'' Fifth Avenue, would qualify for these tax gifts, but it has them - $40 to $50 million worth. (Under 421-A, the developer, after construction, pays only partial taxes for 10 years.) But the issue goes beyond past errors, because our political leaders are doing it again. Earlier this week, the City Council's Housing Committee gave away more of the store to developers - and Mayor Koch seems to be accepting this. The Mayor has a confusing record on 421-A. First it took him several years to acknowledge that the program was egregiously wasteful. Then in 1982, his fifth year in office, he announced he was going to crack down, by narrowing the areas in Manhattan where the tax abatements would apply. But two years passed before he produced his legislation - years in which developers were forgiven $110 million more in property taxes. Finally, this week, when his restrictive legislation came before the Council committee, the committee chairman, Thomas Manton, said the Mayor had gone too far in limiting the eligible districts, so he tacked on a few more neighborhoods where the 421-A tax goodies could still flow. One such ''underutilized'' area in need of a tax fix, Mr. Manton decided, is the Upper West Side between 77th and 96th Streets. The Queens Councilman - now running for Congress to fill the Ferraro seat and apparently in need of campaign funds - must be the only living New Yorker unaware that the real estate gold rush on the Upper West Side is so feverish these days that to suggest it needs a stimulant is to suggest that a heroin addict who is flying high needs another shot in the arm immediately. A detailed study that was produced by Councilwoman Ruth Messinger and the New York Public Interest Research Group - whose data no one disputes - provides some stunning examples of the misguided use of 421-A. For example, the River Tower at 420 East 54th Street - which is far from the most expensive of the buildings to benefit (one has rentals as high as $20,000 a month and another, a condominium, has apartments that sell at $7.5 million) - will receive nearly $13 million in tax gifts. In this 39-story rental building, one-bedroom apartments start at $2,000 and three- bedrooms at $3,600.Why should the taxpayers of this city, the vast majority of whom could never afford to live in River Tower, subsidize the developer and tenants of such a building to the tune of $40,000 an apartment? Developers argue, unconvincingly, that they couldn't build these gilded apartments without the tax breaks. They say rents and prices would have to be 20 percent higher. But there's no evidence that their affluent customers would balk at the higher prices. In any event, the city's genuine housing crisis has nothing to do with a dearth of luxury apartments. It exists because we are desperately short of moderate-income and low-income housing. The city has available to it inventive ways to assist and subsidize reasonably priced housing rather than allowing Manhattan, through luxury tax abatements, to become a place off-limits to all but the rich. The Manton giveaway bill must still face the full City Council and the Board of Estimate. It would be a great credit to this city administration if, instead of keeping 421-A alive at all in Manhattan below 96th Street, it put its money and its brains into creating housing for those without limousines.

929-> IDEAS & TRENDS ; ChallengerTakes a CloserLook at Earth
At least one flight took off on schedule last week. The space shuttle Challenger was launched exactly one month after the return of its troubled sister ship, Discovery. ''This is a harbinger of how well things can go in the future,'' Thomas Utsman, director of shuttle operations at the Kennedy Space Center, said of the dazzling predawn liftoff at Cape Canaveral. NASA considers monthly shuttle launchings critical to its plan to attract paying cargo from other nations and private businesses. Challenger carried a full load of equipment for its eight-day trip, the most ambitious manned earth-observation mission since the Skylab space station a decade ago. And there were no seats to spare. Seven astronauts are on board, the largest number ever sent into space on one ship. The crew includes two women - Dr. Sally K. Ride, in her second shuttle flight, and Dr. Kathryn D. Sullivan, scheduled to be the first American woman to walk in space. Once aloft, the astronauts encountered delays. Their first project, deploying an energy-monitoring satellite, ran into trouble when solar panels froze shut. Three hours later, Dr. Ride managed to shake the panels loose with the spaceship's robotic arm and push the satellite into orbit. It will help with weather forecasts by measuring the amount of solar energy reflected into space by the Earth's atmosphere. The crew also unfolded a large antenna on radar that is examining clouds and producing detailed pictures of 10 percent of the Earth's surface. Eastern Peru, usually covered by clouds, is expected to be clearly mapped for the first time. Yesterday, the crew had trouble stowing the antenna, delaying an orbit-lowering maneuver. Still a problem was another faulty antenna, required to transmit radar data to a satellite that in turn transmits to Earth. A few days before Challenger went up, three Soviet astronauts came down, after setting a new endurance record of 237 days in space. One was a cardiologist, who monitored the effects of eight months of weightlessness on the crew.

931-> GREEK TRAGEDY AND AMERICAN GOSPEL MAKE A JUBLILANT ALBUM
The release of the magnificent original cast album of ''The Gospel at Colonus'' (Warner Bros. 25182-1) offers audiences who might have missed the show, which was the hit of the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Next Wave Festival last season, a chance to taste one of the richest musical-theater experiences of recent years. Given the public's expectations of what constitutes an innovative musical, it's easy to understand why many who might have liked the show shied away from it. On paper, the reconception of Sophocles' ''Oedipus at Colonus'' as a contemporary gospel service sounds dauntingly highbrow. And to a largely white audience unaccustomed to black gospel music, an all-gospel score could also seem culturally exclusionary. Those fortunate enough to attend found themselves part of an exhilarating musical celebration that seamlessly blended the agony of Greek tragedy and the ecstasy of American gospel into a jubilant meditation on fate and redemption. Conceived and directed by Lee Breuer of the Mabou Mines theater troupe, with a score by Bob Telson, the show was structured as a church service complete with invocation, doxology and everything but a collection. The Brooklyn Institutional Choir became a singing congregation receiving as gospel testament the story of Oedipus's final days. Though the role of Oedipus was divided up among several singers and actors, Clarence Fountain, leading the Five Blind Boys of Alabama, sang most of Oedipus's parts in a voice whose mixture of solidity and weariness suggested a man sorrowfully shouldering the world's grief. All four of the show's original singing units are on the cast album, and together they represent a stylistic cross-section of contemporary gospel. The 40-member Institutional Choir is a fine large ensemble in the exhortative mold of the Edwin Hawkins Singers. Closer to modern pop- soul are the J. D. Steele Singers, a young Minneapolis group whose featured vocalist, Jevetta Steele, has the song, ''How Shall I See You Through My Tears,'' that's closest to sounding like a top-40 hit. With her formal melismas, declamatory zeal and brittle timbre, Miss Steele resembles Deniece Williams. A more traditional and emotionally raw quartet style of gospel is represented by Mr. Fountain and the Five Blind Boys and by J. J. Farley and the Original Soul Stirrers. The late Sam Cooke sang with the Soul Stirrers before he became a pop star, and his powerful influence can be heard in the lithe, sweet tenor of Willie Rogers singing the score's final songs of spiritual affirmation, ''Eternal Sleep'' and ''Now Let the Weeping Cease.'' On the album of ''Gospel,'' the dramatic interweaving of the four ensembles and various soloists helps maintain the outlines of the story, which is told in sketchy liner notes for the 11 songs. The music has been arranged, with a minimum of overdubbing, for a small ensemble of electric guitar, horns and brass, and the composer playing piano and synthesizers. The skeletal arrangements don't depart signficantly from what one hears on a contemporary black gospel record. What distinguishes the songs from their sacred prototypes is the subtle elevation of their lyric diction. Lee Breuer's lyrics, adapted, sometimes word for word, from translations of Sophocles, have a smooth oracular fluency that's remarkably well-suited to Mr. Telson's music. From a mixture of Greek poetry with gospel music, one might have expected rough spots; there are none. And in the most powerful song, ''Numberless Are the World's Wonders,'' Mr. Telson and Mr. Breuer have fused the two traditions into a lyrical ode that transcends the idiom. ''Numberless are the world's wonders/ But none more wonderful than man/ The lightboned birds clinging to cover/ Lithe fish darting away/ All are taken, tamed in the net of his mind/ The wild horse resigns to him,'' proclaim the J. D. Steele Singers in long, elegant melodic phrases that enhance the beauty of the poetry. Taken directly from Dudley Fitts and Robert Fitzgerald's translation of ''Antigone,'' the lyric receives a musical setting that transfuses Greek dramatic imagery and American gospel emotion thoroughly and hauntingly. The album of ''The Gospel at Colonus'' is very different in feel from the actual performances of the work at the Brooklyn Academy. At BAM, on a good night, show became a gospel service, in which the rapport between the audience and performers would inspire the singers to incandescent crescendos of joy. At any point, the singers might extend a musical peak with spontaneous interpolation or repetition. On the album, the show's two great choral flights, the poundingly declarative ''Never Drive You Away,'' and the accelerated, climbing ''Life Him Up'' are delivered with a wonderful driving lilt that never, however, reaches the ecstatic heights of a good live performance. The original cast album, produced by Mr. Telson along with Donald Fagen, Gary Katz and Daniel Lazarus, is not unjoyous, but it maintains a tone of muted classicism. The cathartic peaks come and go very quickly, and the overall tone of the album is one of deep reflection leading to a serenely happy release. By being a hybrid of black and white musical cultures (Mr. Telson is a white composer who has worked with salsa bands as well with gospel groups), ''The Gospel at Colonus'' belongs to a tradition of black-white musical hybridization that embraces ''Porgy and Bess'' and ''Dreamgirls.'' ''The Gospel at Colonus'' is a good artistic sign in uncertain times. A musical theater that last year produced ''Sunday in the Park With George'' and ''The Gospel at Colonus'' - two works that are both proudly experimental but that come from almost opposite musical traditions, one European, the other Afro- American - cannot be in the state of terminal ill-health that some believe. In their overlaying of art forms - ''Sunday'' is a shimmering musicalized painting and ''Gospel'' a bold unlikely fitting together of two different spiritual and artistic traditions - both freely incorporate esthetic ideas about simultaneity and juxtaposition that come out of performance art. They exalt, rather than condescend to our intelligence.

932-> CRAFTS; NEWARK MUSEUM: CLOTHING AS ART
NEWARK AN EXHIBITION that justifies the term ''wearable art'' is now on view at the Newark Museum. Entitled ''The New Elegance: Contemporary Wearable Art,'' it sets a new standard in New Jersey for the display of clothes designed by artists. The important thing here is that the 28 garments on view have been regarded as impersonal objects with formal qualities of line, shape, color and texture. The exhibition design exploits those aspects so that one's first impression, on entering the gallery, is that of a visual order that transcends the individual components. Each kimono, jacket, coat, dress and sweater is displayed on a stand built to its proportions. On platforms parallel to the gallery walls, the clothes are arranged so the flow of color takes the eye around the room. The natural variations in scale and height provide an interesting rhythm. Although associations with the human body are de-emphasized, the works collectively assert a sense of dignity and presence. Complementing the exhibition will be a fashion show on Oct. 27 featuring an average of three additional garments by each of the 25 participating artists. Joanne Mattera, a senior editor at Women's Wear Daily and former editor of Fiberarts magazine, will serve as commentator. The exhibitors, representing almost every section of the country, were selected during a three-year search through craft fairs, galleries and national fiber publications. Jean West, director of the museum's arts workshop and coordinator of its Mini- Gallery, served as guest curator, with Patricia White, one of the exhibitors, as a special consultant. This intensive concentration on wearables will be Miss West's final project for the Newark Museum; next month, she will assume new responsibilities at the State Museum in Trenton. It seems appropriate that Miss White should leave behind this testimony to her commitment to a genre that has been an important focus of the workshop program. One intention here, she said, was ''to get a broad range of personal styles, clothing styles and techniques.'' The national scope, Miss White continued, reveals that ''where people live affects the kind of things that evolve.'' For example, a California life style is implied in Jane Thorpe's quilted jacket with a bold asymmetrical pattern, while Albertje Koopman's majestic handwoven gown embodies a sophisticated Eastern point of view. A further consideration was to mix well-known artists with those ''coming up.'' Thus, the show includes not only an elaborate crocheted and knitted gown representing the latest work of Norma Minkowitz, a veteran in the field, but also a tunic and harem pants with an imaginative use of machine stitching by Marion Spanjerdt, an artist from Canada whose work is unfamiliar in this country. Primarily, however, the exhibition represents an attempt to document the fact that, in the 1980's, wearable art, which had its origins in the stoles and ponchos of the 1960's, has developed a sense of style that provides an alternative to haute couture. Artists today are concerned with refined details and tailoring, imaginative but well-constructed patterns, surface decoration that complements the body and materials that both invite touching and are comfortable to wear. The result, as contrasted with earlier wearables, is that the overall image, rather than the textile process, dominates. For instance, in a garment such as Judith Bird's dress with a pattern of brush strokes in autumnal colors, the handwoven cloth is visually overpowered. The contemporary interest in the kimono form is expressed in many variations. Among the interpretations of this traditional garment are Sandra Ward's full-length design in quilted silk, with an applique design of falling leaves; Joan Faulkner's kimono jacket in leather, with beads and ribbon added on, and Micki Hitz Edson's sweater-style kimono, with wisteria in different colors built into the structure. Other materials used include hand- made felt, raw silk and painted cotton. Surface design effects have been achieved by photosensitive processes and various approaches to resist dyeing, and metallic threads trapping glints of light embellish many pieces. One of the most original techniques is Tim Harding's layered quilting, in which he makes slashes that reveal colors hidden between the surfaces. As in any show that attempts to summarize, not every piece will appeal to every viewer. And, from an art point of view, one might question the inclusion of a quilted leather ''bomber jacket,'' which is probably more effective worn than on display. Yet it is a credit to Miss West's selection - and to the installation by Mark Nolan - that fewer than 30 pieces of clothing can command a full-scale gallery. The prices of the clothes on exhibit range from $250 for a simple kimono to $6,000 for a floor-length dress by Mrs. Minkowitz. A sneak preview of the fashion show apparel indicates that there will be several tops below $200, plus affordable accessories such as knitted leg-warmers and hats. After the clothes are presented by models provided by Hahne's, a co- sponsor of the fashion show, they will be available for sale in a boutique in the museum's Community Gallery. At the same time, the Junior Museum Shop will be given over to contemporary jewelry by East Coast craftspeople. The fashion show is scheduled from 10 A.M. to 1 P.M., and will include a brunch. Tickets, at $25, are available through the museum (201) 733-6600. Attendance will be limited to 250. The exhibition will continue through Jan. 20. The admission-free museum is at 49 Washington Street, Newark, and is open Tuesday through Sunday from noon to 5 P.M. Events Calendar Today through Nov. 10 - Sheila Nussbaum Gallery, 358 Millburn Avenue, Millburn. ''Surface, Structure, Form: Wood Furniture by Ellen Mason and Dudley Hartung, jewelry by Kyle Leister and ceramics by Steven Schrepferman.'' Artists' opening reception: Today: 2 to 5 P.M.

934-> SPORTS PEOPLE; McNamara Signs
To no one's surprise, John McNamara , who had decided not to return as manager of the California Angels next season, was introduced yesterday as the new manager of the Boston Red Sox, succeeding Ralph Houk . McNamara is a good friend of Haywood Sullivan , one of Boston's owners, and the appointment had been expected for more than a week. When it was formally announced, McNamara had signed a two-year contract worth $150,000 annually. And what will be his managerial style? The same as it always has been. ''I don't believe in hollering and screaming at people,'' he said. . . . Tony LaRussa signed a new one-year contract to manage the Chicago White Sox, and most of his staff was also rehired for next season.

935-> OUTDOORS; A RODEO FOR BOAT FISHING
A wide-ranging two-day fishing tournament is planned in conjunction with New York Harbor Festival '84. The tournament, called the Harbor Festival Fishing Rodeo, will take place on inshore and offshore waters from Long Island's Fire Island Inlet to Manasquan Inlet in New Jersey. The rodeo, like the festival, is sponsored by the Harbor Festival Foundation. It is limited to boat fishing and is scheduled for Saturday, June 30, and Sunday, July 1. More than $30,000 in cash and merchandise will be awarded as prizes. There will be three divisions in the contest: party boat, inshore and offshore. Potential prize-winning species in the first two categories will be bluefish, fluke and weakfish, and in the offshore division, bluefish, mako and other sharks and bigeye tuna. The party-boat entry fee is $10 an angler, and one may fish from the boat of one's choice. In the other divisions there is a boat-entry fee - $20 inshore, $80 offshore. Both inshore and offshore anglers using charter boats will be charged the going rate for the division in which they are entered if no more than six fishermen per boat are involved. If there are more than six, they will be required to pay the individual angler party-boat rate. There will be first, second and third prizes of $1,000, $500 and $250 for each of the species in each of the divisions, plus $100 prizes - bluefish and fluke only - for 4th through 10th place in both the party-boat and inshore divisions. For registration information, write to the Harbor Festival Fishing Rodeo, 1120 Avenue of the Americas, Suite 1410, New York, N.Y. 10036. One may also call Helen Nicolaidis at 944- 9477. The 14th annual BASSmaster Classic, originally scheduled for New York State's Niagara River late this summer, has now been shifted to Arkansas. Ray Scott, president of the Bass Anglers Sportsman Society, the organization that puts on the event, explains the site change succinctly: It takes, he says, some $200,000 from local organizers to ''land the classic.'' The classic involves the 35 professional bass anglers who have scored highest in the society's invitational tournaments, plus the top five fishermen in the organization's divisional contests. There is no entry fee for the classic, all the contestants' expenses are paid, and prizes in cash and merchandise total $100,000, with the winner getting $40,000. Expanding on Mr. Scott's remark, Bob Cobb, a member of the society, observes: ''There is a promotional fee involved in a classic - about $200,000 in cash and services. The total budget of this year's classic may exceed $600,000.'' ''Last year,'' Mr. Cobb says, ''a group from Niagara Falls approached us and made a bid for the classic. We were pleased. It was a good site with good fishing. They felt they could raise the funds, so we announced Niagara Falls as a tentative location. The weeks and months went on, and they were not able to get the support they needed, so we had to look elsewhere.'' New York State still has two major BASS events this year: the $325,000 Super BASS IV tournament, Sept. 19- 22, in the Thousand Islands region of the St. Lawrence River, and the $112,000 BASSmaster Hudson River Invitational, Sept. 27-29.

936-> A DAY'S CAMPAIGNING
ANY seasoned politician knows that Monday mornings are not the best times for campaigning. And when it is a rainy, muggy Monday morning, like the one last week, and it is 6:45 A.M. at a train station where delays are being announced every five minutes - well, it might fluster even the most experienced politician. But there was Suzi Oppenheimer, Mayor of Mamaroneck and the Democratic candidate for the 36th Senate District, at the Scarsdale station, flashing the broad, easy smile that has been a trademark for most of her campaign and greeting commuters while Metro-North did all it could to irritate a receptive constituency. ''Good morning, I'm Suzi Oppenheimer and I'm running for State Senate. I'd like your support.'' ''Good morning, I'm Suzi Oppenheimer. I'm running for State Senate, for the seat vacated by Joe Pisani. I ran two years ago and lost with 49 percent of the vote.'' Again and again for two hours and 15 minutes, Mrs. Oppenheimer offered handshakes, smiles and campaign literature as she tried to capture, if only for a moment, the eyes and thoughts of a fast-moving voting public. All things considered, Mrs. Oppenheimer was quite pleased with the response. Granted, she said, late trains only irritate commuters, making them less receptive to political promises, but scores of commuters took time to shake hands with Mrs. Oppenheimer and offered to read the campaign literature she was distributing. Just as many offered encouragement. Others, a simple, ''Good luck.'' There were even four or five verbal commitments to vote for her. ''That was music to my ears,'' Mrs. Oppenheimer said, wedging herself between the doors of one car to prevent the train from leaving the station without a man who promised his vote. ''I'll do even more when I get to Albany,'' she said, with a wink. In what is expected to be one of the toughest, closely contested legislative races in the state, Mrs. Oppenheimer, a Democrat and Liberal, is challenging Assemblyman John M. Perone, a Republican and Conservative, for the Senate seat vacated by Joseph R. Pisani, a Republican who resigned from office last April before being convicted on Federal embezzlement and tax- fraud charges. The Right-to-Life candidate is Humphrey Sarlo of White Plains. Mr. Pisani's decision to step down offered county Democrats an opportunity to take the Senate seat held by him for 12 years, as well as the State Assembly seat held for three terms by Mr. Perone. Mrs. Oppenheimer, who came within 1,700 votes of defeating Mr. Pisani in 1982, was her party's first and only choice to run for the seat. Mrs. Oppenheimer's showing at the polls in 1982 established her among politicians as a strong candidate for state office. Some county Republicans have privately acknowledged that Mr. Perone's experience in the Legislature may not be enough to assure victory, even with the backing of the Conservative Party. In a day of campaigning that would take her from the station platform at Scarsdale to the steps of the County Office Building in White Plains, to the Dole Senior Citizens Center in Mount Vernon and finally to a shopping mall in Eastchester, Mrs. Oppenheimer would be reminded of her ''tough loss'' by many who said they had voted for her the last time. ''You should have won then, Suzi,'' one woman said, as she plucked a grocery cart from a lone line of metal carts outside the Food Emporium on West Post Road in Eastchester. ''Better luck this time around.'' ''We plan to win this time,'' Mrs. Oppenheimer said with assurance. The experience of the 1982 campaign has left the 49-year-old financial analyst confident about her chances. Over coffee and cigarettes at a coffee shop across from the Scarsdale train station, Mrs. Oppenheimer talked about the differences between herself and her 39-year-old opponent. ''He likes to talk about my lack of experience,'' she said. ''But my experience and leadership has been demonstrated during the last eight years as Village Mayor and in my service to the community. ''My opponent on the other hand,'' she continued, ''has taken credit for everyone else's legislation, while doing little of substance. He passed one bill this year. He's excellent at public relations and at issuing proclamations, but the people of this district need and deserve more than that.'' The Westchester Tenants League, which represents more than 2,000 tenants countywide, and the statewide Tenants Political Action Committee, are looking for a candidate that will act as a voice in Albany for tenants. They believe they have found such a person in Mrs. Oppenheimer. At 10:30 A.M., Monday, the two tenants groups gathered on the steps of the County Office Building to announce they were endorsing Mrs. Oppenheimer. ''Protenant bills routinely pass the Democratic-led Assembly but are killed in the Republican-controlled State Senate,'' said Charles Kaufman, president of the Westchester tenant group. ''With two more Democrats in the Senate we could change that, especially a Democrat who has demonstrated concern and understanding of tenants needs, like Mrs. Oppenheimer.'' Mr. Kaufman said that the group's decision not to endorse Mr. Perone should not be construed as a statement against the Republican candidate and his record on tenants issues. ''We just feel, he would have to follow the dictates of the majority leaderhsip in the Senate,'' Mr. Kaufman explained. ''And since the leadership is antitenant, we don't believe Mr. Perone could vote independently.'' In a brief statement, Mrs. Oppenheimer promised to do ''everything I can,'' to make sure tenants rights are preserved and protected. She said she supported a three-year moratorium on cooperative and condominium conversions - ''so that we can better study the issue,'' and would seek to further extend the Emergency Tenants Protection Act, which expires next May. Pressed for time, Mrs. Oppenheimer thanked the tenants' representative for their support, then dashed off to her tan stationwagon - with the huge Suzi Oppenheimer for State Senate sign on top - and headed for Mount Vernon. At each of her campaign stops, Mrs. Oppenheimer is accompanied by local volunteers. In Scarsdale, for example, County Legislator Audrey G. Hochberg was there to hand out campaign literature. Mrs. Hochberg, a veteran of campaigning at the railroad station, knew exactly where Mrs. Oppenheimer should station herself to receive the highest visibility. In Mount Vernon, County Legislator Ernest Davis was there to introduce Mrs. Oppenheimer to a largely black audience at the Dole Senior Citizens Center. But many of those at the center, which serves a predominantly black community, said they either knew or recognized Mrs. Oppenheimer from when she ran for office two years ago. ''I've worked with Suzi in the past, and I believe she has demonstrated her concern and support for the city,'' Mr. Davis said. ''She carried this area in 1982, but she's running against a very astute guy, and we have to make sure we get out the Democratic vote again.'' The 36th District includes the city of New Rochelle and portions of White Plains and Mount Vernon, as well as the towns of Rye, Eastchester, Mamaroneck and Harrison and the villages of Port Chester and Scarsdale. An ethnically and economically diverse area, it has 51,400 enrolled Democrats; 49,444 Republicans; 1,434 Conservatives; 1,020 Liberals; 314 Right-to-Lifers and 33,864 independent voters. Mrs. Oppenheimer, who says she enjoys street campaigning and is often at her best during brief encounters with constituents, paused during a 20-minute lunch of chicken salad at a delicatessan in the Eastchester shopping center to talk about the district and the major issues in the campaign. ''Education is a main concern in this area,'' she said. ''Housing, or should I say the lack of affordable housing, continues to be an issue here. Jobs, crime, the environment. You hear about these things again and again. But such things touch upon all of our lives.'' In a gray pamphlet entitled ''Why Guess?'' Mrs. Oppenheimer details her position on a number of issues. She describes the proposed equal- rights amendment as ''something so basic, that it seems hard to believe that is is still not law. John Perone was one of only 30 out of 150 Assembly members who voted against the E.R.A.'' On abortion: ''Abortion may not be for my house, but I will not decide what's right for others.'' On crime: ''I have no magic answers, but I do have an approach, which I think will help, and that is support for Governor Cuomo's life imprisonment without parole concept. I also believe we must institute determinate sentencing.'' ''I'm not running as a woman's candidate,'' she said as she finished lunch. ''I never have, nor will I ask anyone to vote for me because I'm a woman, but because of a record of demonstrated leadership. ''But,'' she added, ''women's legislation doesn't move in the Senate, nor does any progressive legislation. There are four women Senators and I'm very distressed by that.'' Miss Oppenheimer said she did not know how much she would be spending during the campaign, adding that it would be ''as little as possible, and as much as necessary.'' A quick check of her watch indicated that Mrs. Oppenheimer could get in ''30 minutes or so,'' at the Food Emporium before her 3 P.M. meeting of the County's Town-Village Task Force in White Plains. The rest of the day would be spent performing official duties: a 4:30 P.M. check-in at Village Hall; at 7 P.M., conducting, as Mayor, a wedding at her home in Mamaroneck; an 8 P.M. Board meeting at Village Hall. Mrs. Oppenheimer is married to Martin, a Manhattan lawyer, and they have four children. Between now and Nov. 6, Mrs. Oppenheimer plans to spend many more hours at train stations, in shopping malls and on the street meeting people. She and Mr. Perone are scheduled to appear in more than a dozen debates.

938-> CAMPAIGN NOTES; Kirkpatrick CriticizesReagan's Preparation
Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, chief United States delegate to the United Nations, said today that President Reagan was poorly prepared for his first debate with his Democratic rival, Walter F. Mondale, and as a result ''he wasn't a great deal better than Fritz Mondale.'' Mrs. Kirkpatrick, speaking on the Cable News Network's ''Evans & Novak'' program, said Mr. Reagan focused too much on details and facts, rather than ''on coming through effectively'' on broad themes. ''I don't think the President was either well or adequately prepared, quite frankly,'' she said. ''I really don't. I think that a debate is a very special kind of an encounter and requires some very special kind of preparation. And frankly, I don't think the president really had the best preparation for it.'' Mrs. Kirkpatrick said she thought the 90-minute debate, which focused on domestic policy, was a draw.

Poll-takers for Ronald Reagan and Walter F. Mondale predicted today that voter turnout in November could reach 100 million. Both Richard Wirthlin, Mr. Reagan's poll-taker, and Peter Hart, who works for Mr. Mondale, said increased members of minorities and people from the baby boom generation would vote in the Presidential election in November. Mr. Wirthlin said he expected turnout to rise to 57 or 58 percent of the voting age population in November, up from the 54 percent who voted in 1980. It would be the first increase since 1960. ''In 1984, we could be looking at the first 100 million voter election,'' Mr. Hart added. Both poll experts addressed the American Retail Federation.

940-> JOHN MARLEY, ACTOR, AN OSCAR NOMINEE AND VENICE WINNER
-haired, gritty- voiced character actor who won acclaim for his roles in such films as ''Faces'' and ''Love Story,'' died Tuesday in Los Angeles after open-heart surgery. He was 77 years old. Mr. Marley won the award for best actor at the Venice Film Festival for his role as an unhappily married businessman in the 1968 film ''Faces,'' and he was nominated for an Academy Award in 1971 as best supporting actor in ''Love Story,'' in which he played the father of the character played by Ali McGraw. Mr. Marley was born in Harlem and turned to acting after he dropped out of high school. His first film role was in ''Native Land,'' in 1941, and he performed on Broadway in the 1942 musical ''Johnny Doodle'' before joining the Army Signal Corps during World War II. He appeared in the 1947 film ''Kiss of Death,'' and during the 1950's he worked frequently on Broadway, in plays including ''An Enemy of the People,'' ''Skipper Next to God,'' ''Hope Is a Thing With Feathers'' and ''Gramercy Ghost.'' He also appeared in the films ''My Six Convicts,'' ''The Joe Louis Story'' and ''I Want to Live'' and performed in dramatic series on television including ''Pulitzer Prize Playhouse'' and ''Studio One.'' During the 1960's, Mr. Marley appeared in ''Cat Ballou'' and ''America America,'' and his starring role in ''Faces'' earned wide acclaim. He appeared during the 1970's in ''Love Story,'' ''The Godfather,'' ''Hooper'' and ''The Greatest,'' among other films, and in the 1980 television movie ''Word of Honor.'' His most recent performance was in the forthcoming film ''Glitterdome.'' Mr. Marley is survived by his wife, Sandra, and his children Alexis, Julia, Peter and Ben.

Net at Federal Express Down MEMPHIS, Sept. 21 (AP) - The Federal Express Corporation said the substantial start- up costs of its new Zapmail service caused its profit to decline 71.4 percent in the first quarter of its current fiscal year despite a 43 percent increase in revenue. The small-package delivery company said Thursday that profit fell to $8 million, or 18 cents a share, in the June-August period from $28 million, or 63 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $439 million, from $307 million. Frederick W. Smith, the Federal Express founder and chief executive, said he expects operating costs for Zapmail to decline by the end of the year. Zapmail is the company's new program for electronic transmission of documents. On the New York Stock Exchange today, Federal Express closed at $37.75, down $3.25.

942-> REAGAN, IN PARIS, SPURNS ALLIED BID FOR NEW APPROACH TO DEBT CRISIS
Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan today rejected calls for a new approach to the international debt crisis, as America's Western allies expressed alarm over the renewed upward trend in interest rates in the United States and the resulting debt burden on third-world nations. The United States Government ''continues to believe that the current debt strategy provides the right framework for addressing debt problems,'' Mr. Regan told the opening of the annual ministerial meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the organization where the 24 major non-Communist industrial nations coordinate economic strategy. Mr. Regan acknowledged an interest in new approaches to the debt crisis, including proposals for capping interest payments that were discussed at a recent meeting of Western central bank governors at the Federal Reserve in New York. But he said, ''We do not think these 'new approches' can provide 'universal solutions' to the debt problem.'' The best way out of the crisis, Mr. Regan said, is for indebted third-world countries to adopt belt-tightening austerity programs under the supervision of the International Monetary Fund and for the rest of the world to reduce protectionism so that the developing nations can increase their exports. Dangers Seen in Debt Crisis While the Treasury Secretary acknowledged that the Reagan Administration was concerned about the recent rise in interest rates in the United States, ministers from other Western countries appeared far more alarmed. They warned that higher rates could severely aggravate the debt crisis and slow world economic recovery. ''We are all angry over rising U. S. interest rates,'' Finance Minister Jacques Delors of France told reporters at the meeting. He described the third world's debt crisis as ''the sword of Damocles'' hanging over Western economies. ''Everyone is anxious about rising U. S. interest rates,'' the British Foreign Secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, told a news conference after today's meeting. He said that a 1 percent rise in interest rates in the United States added from $3.5 billion to $4 billion a year to the amount of interest the developing world must pay on its foreign debt. At today's meeting, Western ministers agreed to appoint Jean-Claude Paye, a senior French civil servant, to be the O.E.C.D.'s next Secretary General, succeeding Emile van Lennep, who retires in September after 15 years in the post. The choice of Mr. Paye is a victory for the Reagan Administration, which backed him against Marc Lelonde, the Canadian Finance Minister. Officials say Mr. Lelonde is unpopular with the Administration because he helped design Canada's protectionist energy policy, which discriminates against American oil companies.

946-> BEAUTY; SKIN AND EMOTIONS
One's mental state affects the body; stress can precipitate, or aggravate, skin disorders. TEENAGER reports that his acne gets much worse the week before a college exam. A young mother breaks out in hives the morning she is to leave her newborn son to go off on a three-day business trip. A middle-age woman having marital problems finds that she is plagued by itchy skin. The skin can be a sensitive barometer of life's stresses. As one's mental state changes, so does the body, and particularly its most public aspect, the skin. ''Any skin disease can be aggravated by emotion,'' says Dr. Roland S. Medansky, an Illinois dermatologist who has written several papers on the topic. ''If somebody is predisposed to it, if they have a mild case, emotions can certainly make it worse.'' Indeed, the effects of stress, anger, repressed sexual drive and unventilated feelings can be painfully visible in precipitating, or aggravating, an attack of such common maladies as acne, psoriasis, hives, eczema and herpes. ''Patients with acne or psoriasis, for example, will tell you that they're doing well just prior to an examination or a job interview or a new date and all of a sudden they get worse,'' says Dr. Medansky. ''Can you really prove this?,'' he asks. ''Probably not.'' Nevertheless, some physicians believe that relaxation techniques such as exercise, biofeedback and even working at hobbies can to some degree dissipate stress and thus help clear the skin. As Dr. Medansky sees it, there are three groups into which skin disorders fall with respect to the emotions. In the first, the skin reaction is secondary to a psychological problem. For example, people may pull out their hair or scratch themselves badly because of a severe emotional disorder. In the second, it is the skin condition that precipitates emotional problems - shingles, for example, or obvious birthmarks. The third group embodies the most subtle and least understood interplay between the skin and the emotions - acne, psoriasis, eczema and other conditions that flare up from time to time. Since skin problems, like health problems in general, tend to have a mixture of biological and emotional roots, the scientific approach of specific treatment should be augmented, many physicians agree, by the art of medicine that treats the human being as a whole. As Dr. E. Dorinda Shelley, chief of the division of dermatology at the Medical College of Ohio in Toledo, puts it: ''Physicians need to listen more carefully and much longer to their patients.'' Dr. Medansky also finds that it is best for the physician to establish a rapport with the patient so he or she feels comfortable enough to open up. In his studies, Dr. Medansky also uses psychological testing to assess the stress and anxiety levels of patients in an effort to see whether those with skin problems are more disturbed than others. Assessing the involvement of the emotions, however, is further clouded by the fact that some people are more susceptible to certain influences than others. Emotions aside, factors such as temperature, humidity, cosmetics, toiletries and clothing also come into play. With certain conditions such as acne, it may be increased touching of the face resulting from stress that brings on, or makes worse, an attack, rather than the hormonal effects of stress itself. In other cases, the relationship between the skin and the emotions appears more clear cut. In a paper published last year in the medical journal The Lancet, Dr. Shelley and her husband, Dr. Walter B. Shelley, professor of dermatology at the Medical College of Ohio, showed how a specific skin sensitivity was sparked by stress. They told of a woman who had developed a well-documented sensitivity to copper. If she was relaxed, nothing would happen when a copper penny was put on her arm. But if she became subject to stress, as a result of emotional upset or exertion, she would break out in hives right under the penny. ''You need the emotional stress and you also need the allergen,'' says Dr. Walter Shelley, to show the effects of a mild sensitivity to some material. The finding has great promise for people with other conditions, such as asthma, he says, who are sensitive to such agents as house dust but may not suffer an attack until the sensitivity is triggered by stress. Regarding the biological-emotional link with conditions such as herpes, recent research indicates that stress works to depress one's natural level of immunity thereby making people more susceptible to infection. If stress can aggravate or trigger skin problems, it would hold that banishing stress - with the help, say, of tranquilizing drugs - would do the opposite. However, a recent study by Dr. Medansky found that placebos were just as effective as Librium and Valium in treating eczema sufferers. This may have been due to the fact that, as Dr. Medansky says, ''any new treatment can cause temporary improvement.'' Oddly enough, says Dr. Dorinda Shelley, the whole topic of skin diseases becomes more acceptable to patients if they view the ailments as being caused or exacerbated by emotions. In short, patients are willing to blame their skin disease on nerves. ''It's a socially acceptable thing,'' she says, ''as is the term allergy. They can have these awful things on their skin and they'll say, 'It's due to my nerves' or 'an allergy' and that's the end of it. Whereas if they say they have something like psoriasis it's a different implication.''

948-> SEOUL SAYS NORTH KOREANS SOUGHT U.S. TALKS DURING REAGAN'S TRIP
South Korean officials said today that North Korea called for secret talks with the United States during President Reagan's recent visit to Peking, using China as an intermediary to convey the proposal. American officials said the proposal was rejected. The South Koreans said North Korea apparently hoped that such talks could prepare for a possible conference on reunification that would include the United States. American officials reiterated the basic United States position on such proposals that the two Koreas should first negotiate between themselves on reunifying the peninsula, which was divided nearly four decades ago. Word of the latest North Korean suggestion was said to have been given to South Korean officials by Secretary of State George P. Shultz when he came to Seoul earlier this week to provide details of the Reagan trip to China. It was not clear whether the North Korean proposal had been conveyed by Chinese leaders to Mr. Reagan directly or to other members of his party. Nor was it clear what, besides Mr. Reagan's presence in Peking, had motivated the North Korean Government to make a recommendation that was almost certain to be turned down. Public Relations Victory For South Korean officials, who made Mr. Shultz's information public, the disclosure was something of a public relations victory. To them, it confirmed their belief that North Korea fundamentally is not interested in peace talks with them but would rather deal solely with the United States. This kind of three-sided negotiation was suggested by North Korea to South Korea last January, but officials in Seoul rejected it, insisting first on talks between North and South. They said at the time that it was the third such proposal to be made to them by North Korea since October. But the January proposal omitted a familiar North Korean demand that the United States must first withdraw its 40,000 troops from South Korea; it said such a withdrawal could be made part of an ultimate treaty. South Korean officials say they fear that, if the Americans were included in talks with the two Koreas, the Government in Seoul could be regarded as having been reduced to a role as a United States client. In the past, there have been suggestions by the North Koreans that they would like to negotiate on the Korean question only with the United States, and they have often called South Korea an American puppet. View From Washington The Reagan Administration has backed the South Korean view that there should first be talks between North and South. But it has also made clear that it would accept expanded discussions that include both the United States and China. In January, the South Korean Minister of Unification, Son Jae Sik, suggested that his Government would also be interested at some point in what he described as an enlarged meeting, which presumably would include China as well as the United States. The Chinese have backed the North Korean proposals for a three-way meeting between the Koreas and the United States. Over the last four months there has been talk about negotiations between the two Koreas, but this has been complicated by a spate of conflicting proposals on how to get unification talks going. South Korean officials and foreign diplomats say that thus far nothing has altered the fact that North and South remain bitter enemies, unlikely to begin discussions any time soon. Peking-Seoul Relations Among the proposals that have been made over the last decade is one for a six-nation conference on Korean reunification that would bring in Japan and the Soviet Union as interested parties along with the United States, China and the two Koreas. Meanwhile, China and South Korea, while lacking formal ties, have both made clear lately that they wish to have more cordial relations, even if for now they are confined largely to sports exchanges and low-level trade. Diplomats here say they believe that, even though the discussion of this has not amounted to much, it is a way to defuse tensions. They point out that tensions increased last fall when a bomb in Rangoon, Burma, killed visiting senior South Korean Government officials. Burma blamed North Korea for the incident and broke off relations. Called Propaganda Ploy WASHINGTON, May 4 - A Reagan Administration official said today that the offer by North Korea for talks was a propaganda ploy aimed at reviving a suggestion that had been rejected by the United States in different forms. ''This is not something we would ever go for,'' a White House official said.

949-> REPUBLICANS ASSAIL O'NEILL; INCREASING HOSTILITY FEARED
House Republicans, angry over Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill's verbal attack on one of them this week and his control of television cameras on the floor, castigated the Massachusetts Democrat in a caucus today. Members of both parties expressed fears of an erosion of courtesy and respect in the chamber. According to several Republicans who attended the closed party meeting, Mr. O'Neill was characterized there as a ''cheap'' and ''mean'' politician. Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the Republican leader, later described the caucus as ''a boiling-over after getting one shafting after another,'' and he introduced a measure to allow television cameras to show the entire House chamber at any time, a key issue in the dispute between the Republicans and the Speaker. Members of both parties said they worried that increasing hostility between the Republican and Democratic leaderships could seriously impair the work of the House. MX Debate Cooled Concern over such a loss of comity led leaders of Wednesday's debate on the MX missile to agree beforehand to cool their oratory, for fear of inflaming a chamber already seething from a highly personal debate between the Speaker and a small group of junior, conservative House Republicans. Angry over the conservatives' taking advantage of cable telecasts to put forth their views, Mr. O'Neill had ordered the cameras, ordinarily trained on a speaking member, to pull back at the end of the legislative day to reveal that the chamber was virtually empty. In a debate Tuesday over that directive, the Speaker said Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia had ''challenged the Americanism'' of Democratic members who were not there to respond and called it ''the lowest thing that I have ever seen in my 32 years in the House.'' On the advice of the House parliamentarian, Mr. O'Neill was formally rebuked by the chair for the intemperance of his remarks. Many Congressmen believe the Speaker demeaned his office by going to the well of the House to respond to the Republicans. The overall fears were that the increased partisan hostility could lead to a deadlocked chamber. ''You worry about this being the opening salvo of the rest of the session, where you don't accomplish anything,'' said Representative Thomas J. Downey, a Suffolk, L.I., Democrat who led opposition to the MX missile. Representative Les Aspin, the Wisconsin Democrat who sponsored the successful compromise plan, said, ''We decided to conduct a civil debate.'' But no such restraint was shown at today's meeting of House Republicans, according to several who attended. ''Tip O'Neill is one of the cheapest, meanest politicians to occupy that office in this century,'' Representative Vin Weber of Minnesota was quoted as having said. ''I'll have to agree with you,'' Mr. Michel, the party leader, then told Mr. Weber, ''To have this man act the way this one has is unheard of.'' A few Democrats defended the Speaker today. ''The thing people like about Tip O'Neill is that he has fire in his gut,'' said Representative James M. Shannon of Massachusetts, a protege of Mr. O'Neill. Similarly Kirk O'Donnell, counsel to the Speaker, noted that Mr. O'Neill had been attacked and caricatured in television commercials and mailings. ''Have Republicans helped the comity of the House with their campaign ads and direct mail attacking the Speaker?'' he asked.

951-> I-80 ATTRACTS OFFICES TO A COMPLICATED CITE
Two decades after the first segment of Interstate 80 was pushed across the northern tier of the state, it still is difficult to assess fully how the highway has shaped the lives of those whose workplace or residential communities it has crossed. All along the road, from the high-priced office buildings and high-rise apartments in Fort Lee to the assembly plants that Japanese and German companies are building in the New Jersey Foreign Trade Zone in Mount Olive, the blacktop corridor has attracted project after project that relies for success on highway access. One of the last remaining building sites near an 80 interchange in Bergen County is now being developed as a two-building office complex with 260,000 square feet of space. The project, called River Drive Center, is on nearly 12 acres of land near the Passaic River in Elmwood Park, a mostly residential community of about 20,000 on the western border of the county. And it went ahead only after the developer and the community could agreed on its scale. The first building - an 80,000-square-foot, four-story, glass-and-cement structure with an atrium entrance and fiberoptics telecommunications capacities - was completed in June. Construction of the second building is scheduled to begin next spring. The site, a former nursery operation a short distance from Exit 61 on I-80, had interested a number of developers, for projects ranging from a shopping center to two 20- story office towers. But several things had stood in the way. For one, the interchange was a clumsy one that often caused traffic to back up. And the community objected to any proposals that seemed too large. ''It borders on a residential area,'' said Richard A. Mola, who has been Mayor of Elmwood Park for more than a decade. ''People around here were concerned they would be overshadowed by a tall structure and the traffic that went with it.'' The combination of factors caused developers to pass on the site. Then in 1979, Bernard F. Langan, president of a large engineering firm bearing his name, considered the site for an office building that would serve as headquarters for his expanding company. Mr. Langan said that after working with developers for many years on large construction projects, the time seemed right to try putting up a building on his own. He entered a joint venture with Ben Fisher, a Parsipanny developer, and purchased 8.3 acres of the Elmwood Park site. His intention was to put up a 10-story office tower on part of the land and to lease the rest. The 10-story height was thought to be important for the office tower to compete with others in nearby Saddle Brook. Mr. Langan applied for a zoning variance to exceed Elmwood Park's four-story limitation and struggled for years to see it through. In the meantime, his partner pulled out. Mr. Langan, on his own, purchased an adjoining 3.6 acres and proceeded quickly with plans for a four-story office structure that met the zoning laws. Eventually, he gave up plans for the 10-story tower and substituted a 4-story atrium building that would complement the other structure. Construction of the atrium building began last June. First, the acres of greenhouses left from the nursery had to be cleared, then a 140-foot-high chimney from the furnace used to heat the greenhouses had to be torn down. As engineers who usually worked to fulfill the wishes of a client, the officers at Langan Engineering working on this project brought together many of the ideas that they had always wanted to try. That, combined with the firm's intention to move its own offices into the building, resulted in a speculative office building that incorporated many of the extras normally found only in institutional-quality buildings intended for a single tenant. The building has curved corners, several different overhangs, a four-story atrium lobby and an elaborate plaza with a landscaped fountain. Interior appointments are generally top of the line, giving the building a feeling of well-engineered quality. Langan Engineering has taken the entire second floor. The remainder of the building is available, with rents at $18.50 per square foot plus electricity. Norman B. Baker, senior vice president for Cushman & Wakefield of New Jersey Inc., exclusive agents handling leasing for River Drive Center, described Elmwood Park as a compromise location for office tenants because it provides easy access along Route 80 to destinations and clients east and west. The state Department of Transportation plans to rebuild the interchange by 1986. Mr. Baker said he expected to draw tenants from both directions - that is, companies now in older buildings in Paterson and the surrounding area that are looking for more contemporary space, as well as those that moved from New York to areas like Fort Lee and Paramus years ago and now find it too expensive and congested. The area surrounding River Drive Center is almost all residential. Part of the municipal approval for the project required that a part of the site that Mr. Langan had planned to buy be sold to another developer, who is putting up a buffer zone of new one- and two- family houses between the office project and houses that used to face the nursery. Mayor Mola said this was fair because people who buy the new houses will do so knowing an office building will be built there, while the earlier purchasers had bought expecting the nursery to stay. THE second office building at River Drive Center will go up not far from the first. It will be situated so that one four- story glass corner of the building will jut between two elm trees, left over from the family-owned nursery, that are thought to be more than 200 years old. There are other elms in Elmwood Park, but it is not from them that the municipality derived its name. Mayor Mola said that until 1972 the borough had been known as East Paterson, after its much larger neighbor across the river. Then the community decided to separate itself from Paterson's fading image and establish its own identity. Elmwood Park was chosen because a section of the borough had been known as Elmwood and because the initials E.P. would remain the same, thus avoiding the need to change the insignia on municipal vehicles and buy new uniforms for the school band.

952-> CAMPAIGN NOTES; On Bush's Itinerary, Game 5 of the Series
Vice President Bush, who said in his debate Thursday against Geraldine A. Ferraro that he would rather talk about the World Series, will get his wish Sunday. He plans to start a six-day campaign swing in Detroit for the fifth game of the World Series. Mr. Bush, who was a first baseman for Yale in 1947 and 1948, wore a Detroit Tigers cap on a visit to the city last month. He will, however, fly from Detroit to Southern California, where loyalties lie with the San Diego Padres. Near the close of the debate with Representative Ferraro, Mr. Bush chose not to take advantage of the chance to ask her a direct question, adding, ''But I'd sure like to use the time to talk about the World Series or something of that nature.''

953-> STAGE:'COUNTRY GIRL' BY ODETS IS REVIVED
IN the new revival of ''The Country Girl,'' we get to watch three smart actors - Hal Holbrook, Christine Lahti and Jeffrey DeMunn - act their hearts out for nearly three hours. Given the high energy level of the performances and the intimacy of the theater (Off Broadway's new Chelsea Playhouse), it's both surprising and frustrating that Clifford Odets's 1950 backstage drama rarely lifts off. What's gone wrong? One's first inclination is to blame Odets. ''The Country Girl,'' written at the tail end of the playwright's career, might be described by one of its own lines: it's ''show business trying very hard to be theater.'' The story of a down-and-out alcoholic actor's Broadway comeback, the play is at its best when it goes for the jugular, at its worst when it pines after psychological depth. Were it not for its more muscular dialogue and colorful theatrical milieu, ''The Country Girl'' might be indistinguishable from Broadway's other hit alcoholic soap opera of 1950, William Inge's ''Come Back, Little Sheba.'' But if Odets's play is not first-rate, it stands near the top of the second- rate. Not for nothing has it maintained its audience appeal in the Hollywood film version (with Bing Crosby and Grace Kelly), the 1972 Broadway revival (with Jason Robards and Maureen Stapleton) and even a hit London revival of last season. Whatever's lacking in ''The Country Girl,'' it contains, at its spine, a taut tug-of-war between the two characters closest to the has-been actor Frank Elgin (Mr. Holbrook) - his long-suffering wife Georgie (Miss Lahti) and the ambitious young director of his comeback vehicle, Bernie Dodd (Mr. DeMunn). That drama is missing in the current production not because Odets didn't provide it but because the director, Richard Thomsen, hasn't mined it. The author titled his play after the character of Frank's wife, rather than Frank himself, because she is the enigma at its core. Is Georgie a selfless helpmate who has devoted her life to reclaiming her sad husband? Or is she, as Bernie believes, a selfish manipulator who greased the skids for Frank's slide into the gutter? In Mr. Thomsen's version, I'm afraid, we know the whole answer from the start. Miss Lahti's wife is pure mush from the moment we meet her in the shabby furnished flat that the Elgins call home. Although Georgie affects a little toughness in negotiating her husband's contract, she has an unmistakable saintly glow. Miss Lahti is constantly on the verge of tears, and Mr. Thomsen canonizes her further by repeatedly isolating her in a halo-like spotlight as subsequent scenes come to their close. So unambiguously pure are this Georgie's motives that the battle between the heroine and the young director is not only imbalanced - it doesn't make sense. As played with appropriately hotheaded intelligence by Mr. DeMunn, Bernie is immature but not a fool. And yet for two long acts we're asked to believe that he would angrily assail a heroine who, as presented here, seems transparently undeserving of such antipathy. The genuine conflict of ''The Country Girl'' is quickly reduced to a baffling, not to mention trying, contrivance. Miss Lahti nonetheless deserves credit for executing her misguided characterization extremely well. An attractive actress, she effectively disguises herself by wearing no makeup and an array of frumpy dresses. Bathetic as her Georgie seems, there's always real feeling underneath the Madonna pose. When Miss Lahti dolls herself up for the play's opening-night climax, we also find the flintiness that too often eludes her earlier on. Even with his silver hair and whisky-pickled voice, Mr. Holbrook is too fit to convey the pathos of the seedy, decaying Frank. But he attacks the role with gusto, reaching a flamboyant peak as the rehabilitated actor swings between self-pitying childish fits and new-found pride during his play's Boston tryout engagement. If the character's predicament is at best superficially gripping, it's not Mr. Holbrook's fault. Odets never does bother to explain exactly why Frank threw away his career on a 12- year bender. Jack Chandler's set aptly summons up the atmosphere of a play whose brash, vanished Broadway is not far removed from that of ''42d Street.'' But Mr. Thomsen's pacing is painfully slow for a script that, in typical Odets fashion, repeats some facts (such as the death of the Elgins' daughter) three times. In the supporting cast, the standout performance comes from Victor Raider-Wexler as a tough old-time producer who would have surely whipped a production as lax as this ''Country Girl'' into airtight shape.

954-> IN A REFORMATORY IN '66, AN M.D. TODAY
In a way, Mary Groda-Lewis says, she is glad she was arrested that day when she was 16. Eighteen years after she stood behind the barbed-wire fences of the Hillcrest School for Girls in Salem, Ore., she will receive a degree from the Albany Medical College on Thursday that will make her Dr. Mary Groda-Lewis. The boy she was with the day she was arrested drove recklessly in a stolen car, careering over a misty mountain road in Oregon. A police car gave chase, and an officer fired, shredding the tires of the youths' car. Out of control, it plunged 80 feet into a ravine. Miraculously, the couple were unhurt. Mary Groda - 16 years old, illiterate and desperately poor - was sent to a reformatory. But the reformatory, so often a stepping stone to disaster, was where life began anew for her. 'Didn't Seem Realistic' ''Somehow, in the back of my mind as I was growing up, I always thought of this as a dream,'' Mrs. Groda-Lewis said the other evening sitting on the porch of her ramshackle wooden house. ''It didn't seem realistic, because when I was growing up, men were doctors and women were nurses. It always seemed a dream.'' It also did not seem realistic, because she had preferred associating with vagrants rather than going to school, spent two years in a reform school in addition to six months in the reformatory and was the unmarried mother of two children by the time she was 21. Like many poor families in the Northwest, the Grodas - Mary's parents, six brothers and sisters, and four other youngsters whom her parents had adopted - worked every summer as seasonal farm laborers, moving from farm to farm in the fruit country of Oregon picking berries. ''I will not eat strawberries to this day,'' Mrs. Groda-Lewis said with a laugh. ''You have to break your back getting down to them. You're on your hands and knees all day long from bush to bush, with a crate behind you. They are the worst thing in the world to pick.'' When she was 10, she gave up on school. ''I started skipping school, because I didn't know what they were talking about,'' she recalled. ''We had to walk down the railroad tracks and across the fields to catch the bus to school. Farther down the tracks were the hobos. ''I used to talk to the hobos all day, share my life with the hobos. It was just unbearable in school not understanding what was going on.'' Even when the family moved farther into the mountains, and later to Portland, Mary avoided school. ''It was hard times,'' she said. ''I started drinking. I'd be out after curfew, getting in trouble.'' At 13, Mary was picked up by the police and sent to a reform school, where she spent the next two years. After her release, she took up with teen-agers looking for fast cars and good times. Attended Special Program ''I ran away with a boy named Jim,'' she said. ''He had stolen a car, white with red trim. He had good taste at least.'' Then came the police chase and the reformatory. From among 150 girls, a counselor chose 5 to attend a program for deprived teen-agers at the University of Oregon, in Eugene. ''Two teachers worked with me 16 hours a day on reading, writing and arithmetic,'' she said. ''In four months, I moved from first grade to eighth grade. You can't imagine how much of a turn on it is to have someone care about your academics.'' When she was 18, she returned to Portland and almost immediately became pregnant with her first child, Iris. To support herself, she worked as a keypunch operator in a hospital. ''I told my mother then I wanted to be a doctor,'' she said. But almost before she could begin applying to colleges, she became pregnant again, this time with her son, Christopher. A stroke almost killed her after he was born. Courses at Community College ''I had to learn to re-walk,'' she said. ''I had to learn to re-write. I had to learn to re-talk.'' She did that, and she began taking courses at a community college in 1972 while working part-time and raising her children. In a karate class two years later, she met David Lewis. They were married in 1978 and moved to Yonkers, where Mr. Lewis worked. ''I told David I wanted to be a doctor, and I didn't want to play games,'' she said. She graduated from Herbert H. Lehman College in the Bronx but was rejected by all 15 medical schools to which she applied. She tried again the next year and was invited to the Albany Medical College for an interview. ''I was sort of bowled over from the beginning,'' the dean of student affairs, Dr. Alan D. Miller, said. ''This was someone who needed a shot.'' Only when she failed three courses in her first year did she begin to doubt her dream. ''I was totally devastated,'' she said. ''I was ready to quit.'' Planning for Residency But, pushed by friends and teachers, she made up the courses over the summer. It was, she said, almost easy after that. In looking for a hospital for her residency in her specialty, family practice, Mrs. Groda-Lewis sought a city where doctors were needed. She found Youngstown, Ohio, where she will move next week to begin her three-year program. Because she received financial help from the Federal Government during medical school, she must spend four years in a part of the country where there is a shortage of doctors when she completes her residency. ''I want to do it on an Indian reservation,'' she said. ''I always felt the Indians have a lot to teach me about who I am.'' ''Then I want to settle down in a rural setting,'' she said, ''where they need me.'' Focus on Patients ''She really excels at the art of medicine,'' Barbara A. Ostanek, one of her closest friends in medical school, said. ''She has that gut intuitive sense of when a patient can be told something. She has that gift that everyone doesn't have.'' Indeed, of three awards presented to her by the school, the Neil Hellman Prize celebrated her ''outstanding sensitivity and commitment to humanistic values in her dealings with patients.'' Patients, she said, have come to fill her life. Brushing back her hair, traced with gray, she held a portrait of an old bearded man, his blue eyes gazing into the distance. ''This was an old Russian patient who died of cancer when I was in third year,'' she said. ''He had no family. His face stayed with me. It's the first portrait I've painted.'' Miss Ostanek introduced Mrs. Groda-Lewis to painting. ''In medical school, you wonder if there is an end to the tunnel,'' Miss Ostanek said. ''With painting there is an end point. You can do it any way you want. We used to stay up in my attic until 3 or 4 in the morning, just painting.'' ''There is a glow about her,'' Dr. Miller said. ''She is clearly someone whose energy and affection for people is going to give her the ability to make people feel comfortable, well-cared- for. She's going to be a physician that people are going to flock to.''

955-> STAGE: ENSEMBLE STUDIO'S MARATHON '84
The opening round of the Ensemble Studio Theater's Marathon '84, four evenings of one-act plays, ends on a crescendo with Jane Willis's ''Slam!'' This is a pungent urban dialogue, tautly directed by Shirley Kaplan and acted with vitality and humor by Rob Morrow and Evan Handler. That it comes after three formulaic one-acts makes it seem all the more impressive. Mr. Morrow and Mr. Handler are playing high-school buddies who ''bridge and tunnel'' their way from Queens in order to slam dance in Manhattan. Their time on the town is an unglamorized equivalent of ''Saturday Night Fever.'' In a men's room of a club, the two ruminate about school, the young women in their lives and the martial art of dancing. Dressed somewhat west of British punk - Mr. Handler wears a modified Mohawk, Mr. Morrow favors earrings - each thinks of the world at large as strange. When one announces his enlistment in the Marines, the other comments, ''I hate to see you as a social misfit.'' Despite their aggressive 80's manner, the two are not so far removed from young people of earlier generations, rebellious against parental pressure and worried about their problematic future. What is important to them is knowing the code, and when it comes to fads and trends they are right on top of the charts. Miss Willis has her own ear to the wall, capturing the rhythms of male bravado and adolescent behavior. There is an exactitude about her use of the vernacular, with the addition of a kind of David Mamet twist in the transcription. The grittiness of the language is expertly captured both in the direction and the performance. The actors inhabit their graffiti- scrawled setting as if it were a lair for two lion cubs, playfully stalking one another. One of the most engaging exchanges occurs after a brief moment of roughhouse, when one acknowledges, ''That was good for a minute or so,'' and the other nods his agreement. The spontaneity of ''Slam!'' is in contrast to the familiar aura of the plays that precede it. With a nod to Christopher Durang, Richard Dresser's ''At Home'' makes fun of the childishness of adults. A few funny lines do not conceal the fact that this is a one-joke comedy that would have been better as a blackout. Staged at a frenetic pace by Jerry Zaks, the sketch highlights two amusing actresses, Carolyn Mignini and Mary Catherine Wright. Gina Barnett's ''Blood Bond'' is a dialogue between a lonely child and a substitute parent. There is nothing new here, but, under the astute direction of Melodie Somers, there are sympathetic performances by Samantha Atkins as the child and Novella Nelson as a motherly housekeeper. Janice van Horne's ''Fine Line'' brings together two old school friends, grown into neurotic women. Jill Eikenberry is a steadfastly single narcissist and Roxanne Hart a married doormat. As directed by Harris Yulin, both actresses are stylish but the play is a basket of buzz words, so brittle that it breaks. The wind-up one-act is short, but, in writing, acting and directing, it is a grand ''Slam!'' The Cast MARATHON '84, Series B. Scenic design, Mark Fitzgibbons; lighting design, Karl E.

956-> BUSINESS BOOMS AT SHOOTING RANGE
AT the Nassau County Rifle and Pistol Range in Uniondale, where Long Islanders shoot for sport and self-defense, the waiting list for enrollment and training courses stretches into next year. The range, which has doubled its revenues in the last five years, is enjoying a growing popularity that is rivaled by few other recreational facilities on the Island. Indeed, the six-year-old Mitchel Park range, which cost $1.2 million to build, is the only recreational facility in the county that is not losing money, according to the Nassau County Department of Recreation. ''It's the only one of our facilities that pays for itself; every other facility we have makes a loss and is subsidized by taxpayers,'' said Anthony Panzarella, assistant commissioner for the Department of Recreation. Last year the range took in $321,804, up from $305,503 the previous year, and 1984 promises to be its most profitable year yet. One reason for the range's financial success is its relatively low-cost maintenance and its year-round operation, Mr. Panzarella said. The facility is open seven days a week, from 9 A.M. to 11 P.M. The biggest recreational money makers in the county - golf courses, ice rinks and cabana rentals - are more costly to maintain and are seasonal. Another reason for the range's success is an increased interest in firearms use that is linked to concerns for improved self-protection, according to gun owners, gun instructors and gun dealers on the Island. ''Every time a local crime is committed, like a big rape or an armed robbery, there's a rush of people registering for gun licenses and firearms courses,'' said a volunteer instructor, who asked not to be named. Though the Island offers fewer and fewer places to hunt, and recent statistics issued by the Federal Bureau of Investigation show crime to be lower nationwide, people feel less safe, whether or not they actually are less safe, he said. This view is shared by Robert Ishkanian, president of Edelman's Gun Store in Farmingdale, a supermarket-style retail outlet for firearms that claims to be the world's largest. Edelman's, which had sales of $10 million - or, 20,000 guns and related equipment - last year, is selling fewer guns to hunters than it did 10 years ago, and twice as many to private individuals who want them for self-protection, Mr. Ishkanian said. ''We have little old ladies coming in, store owners, doctors who make house calls at night, a woman who wants to stick a gun in her handbag,'' he said. ''They are all interested in protection. You can tell by the kinds of guns they buy, the kind of ammunition they buy, and the questions they ask.'' Both Nassau and Suffolk Counties have received more applications for firearms licenses in recent years. More than 5,540 Nassau residents had applied for gun licenses by September of this year, exceeding the total of 4,408 applications received in l983, according to the Nassau County Police Department. About 25,000 residents hold licenses, and more than 68,000 handguns are legally owned in the county. By comparison, 19,620 active pistol licenses have been issued in Suffolk County, and 54,297 handguns are legally owned. The Mitchel Park range is one of several facilities where Long Islanders can go for target practice, though it is the only county-run facility. In Suffolk County, individual towns run outdoor ranges in Huntington, Calverton, Brookhaven and Islip. Perhaps the main reason for the range's success is its attractiveness to first-time shooters seeking gun licenses. ''It's the cheapest way you can go about getting a license,'' said Tom Moore, who teaches the introductory ''practical handgun'' course at the range. The introductory course, by all accounts the most popular, costs $34 for 24 hours of training on .38- and .22- caliber target pistols. Students pay in addition for rounds of ammunition and targets, which the range sells at competitive prices, making 50 to 60 percent profit. Private clubs, by comparison, may charge several hundred dollars for introductory courses leading to license applications. Last year, 77,503 people visited the Nassau range. Among its regular users are 186 private gun clubs on the Island and 28 Government agencies at the county, state and Federal level. On recent afternoons, shooting enthusiasts filled each of the range's six compartments, each equipped with five ''points'' or ''bays'' for marksmen. Patricia Bryggman, a 21-year- old television technician from Plainview, was shooting round after round on a .38 pistol into a silhouette target. Walter Dahlmann and John Harte, training officers from the Sheriff's department, were supervising the voluntary target practice of several newer peace officers. Richard Martinsen, a mechanic from Lawrence, and Bert Uhl, a Valley Stream supermarket manager, were practicing on Civil War-era ''black powder'' rifles. ''Shooting is big in Nassau County,'' said George Price, assistant chief range officer. ''To appreciate it, you have to come in on a Sunday afternoon in October. That's when hunting season starts. We have up to 372 people shooting. It's a very relaxing sport.''

957-> ILLINOIS MAY FOLLOW CHICAGO IN SEEKING BAN ON LEAD IN GAS
The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency is considering seeking a ban on the sale of leaded gasoline in the state, as a health measure. The agency has scheduled seven hearings on the issue, with the first to be held Oct. 17 in Moline, Ill. The agency's interest stems from a 36-to-7 vote by the Chicago City Council last month seeking a ban on the sale of leaded gasoline in the city. Any action by the city or state must be approved by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency. In November, a bill seeking to stop leaded gas sales in Illinois is to be introduced in the State Legislature. Lead, which can accumulate in children's bodies, has been linked to neurological disturbances, learning disabilities and hyperactivity. Soil samples collected by the Chicago Board of Health from city playgrounds last month contained two to five times as much lead as the Environmental Protection Agency considers safe. 'Lead Is Insidious' ''In a heavily populated, heavily trafficked city, the impact of a ban will be tremendous,'' said Alderman Danny Davis, one of the ordinance's sponsors. ''Lead is insidious.'' But the producers of lead additives, which help high-compression engines run more efficiently and powerfully, argue that there is no persuasive evidence that lead in gasoline has caused health problems. They contend that reducing the lead content in gasoline would unnecessarily work against consumers. The Illinois Gasoline Dealers' Association is considering a lawsuit to stop the proposed ban, saying it violates Federal regulations prohibiting states and cities from governing fuel content. A prohibition would have to be included in the state Environmental Protection Agency's air pollution control plan. That must then be approved by the Federal E.P.A., which officials say could take 14 to 16 months. Children Show Problems Gail Christopher is a nutritionist who screens children for lead poisoning in a day-care center at the Robert Taylor Homes, one of several housing projects beside the usually clogged Dan Ryan Expressway. She said some children she had seen with small amounts of lead in their bodies had begun to show reduced attention spans and poor learning skills. ''These children,'' she said, ''are vulnerable, very vulnerable.'' The Cook County Commissioners are studying an ordinance that would extend the Chicago ban countywide. But Cook County Commissioner Harold L. Tyrrell says he is uncertain that the ban would reduce atmospheric lead significantly. ''A weakness of government is that when you have an emotional issue you'll deal with it in an emotional way,'' he said. ''Instead of helping children, you pass an ordinance that does n't work.'' Some critics of the ordinance say a ban that stops at the city limits will be ineffective and may put owners of gas stations just inside the Chicago border out of business. ''The cars from the suburbs will buy gas out here,'' said Robert Jacobs, executive director of the Illinois Gasoline Dealers' Association. ''The city will lose millions in sales tax.'' Market May Be Cornered William Klass owns one of three gas stations at an intersection at the city limits on the far Southwest Side. His station is in Chicago; the two across the street are not. ''We're going to have a 15 percent drop in business,'' he predicted. ''I can't believe they're going to do this to us.'' Virtually all cars built in recent years are required to use unleaded gasoline because they have catalytic converters to remove pollutants from engine exhausts. Lead renders the converters useless. But there is still substantial demand for leaded gasoline, which is cheaper than unleaded gasoline. The Federal environmental agency has proposed removing 90 percent of the lead until leaded gasoline contains only a tenth of a gram per gallon in 1986. Still, Shirley Mitchell, regional air planning chief for the agency, said she preferred a ban. ''It virtually eliminates lead,'' she said, ''and that's better than limiting it.''

958-> DANCE VIEW; CUNNINGHAM'S 'EVENTS' ARE AUDACIOUS AND CONTROVERSIAL
The ''Events'' that the Merce Cunningham Dance Company recently presented at the Joyce Theater were once again both satisfying and perplexing. That is how ''Events'' have been in the past. That is surely how they will continue to be in the future. Even though it is now 20 years since Mr. Cunningham created his first ''Event,'' these 90-minute collages of movements taken from works in the Cunningham repertory remain controversial. The very concept of ''Events'' is audacious. Mr. Cunningham is not simply offering a string of excerpts in the manner of a balletic divertissement. Rather, he recombines movement sequences so that they form a whole new self-sufficient entity. That these entities are almost invariably pleasant to behold suggests that Mr. Cunningham is blessed with such a strong sense of design that he can make a harmonious whole out of scraps of movement which, if arranged by a less gifted choreographer, could easily turn into nothing but a jumble. One does not have to know the dances from which the sequences in ''Events'' derive, for the rearrangements of steps are so complex as to make everything seem new. The times one can identify the source of certain steps may even be times when one becomes perplexed, since steps that have one sort of effect in one dance may have a quite different effect in ''Events.'' For instance, the dragging and tugging movements that can be absolutely horrifying in ''Winterbranch'' may look merely strenuous, and in no way sinister, when they recur in ''Events'' divorced from the decor and music for ''Winterbranch.'' That this should be so illustrates one of the philosophical points Mr. Cunningham is trying to make with ''Events.'' Fascinated by the sheer diversity of existence and aware that everything is always changing, Mr. Cunningham often tries to demonstrate that our response to a movement may be determined by more than the purely kinetic qualities of that movement; it may also be affected by the context in which the movement occurs - or by our own state of mind at a given moment. Change the context of a movement and that movement may appear to change its significance. Thus it is quite possible that each viewer present may react quite differently to the same ''Event.'' However, having witnessed ''Events'' for a decade, I find that although the intensity of my responses to individual ''Events'' may vary, ''Events'' nevertheless prompt in me the same general kinds of responses. Moreover, the range of my responses to ''Events'' is curiously narrower than the range of my responses to the works in Mr. Cunningham's repertory. ''Events'' satisfy me because they appear to incarnate in choreographic terms the very process of creation itself. Dancers come and go, assemble and disperse, and their groupings crystallize, then melt away. Watching ''Events'' is akin to watching the life cycles of stars and planets, of galaxies and whole universes. But these theatrical universes are usually devoid of catastrophe. Although everything in them may be in a state of perpetual metamorphosis, there are no collisions or disasters. Since our own real world has become all too disaster-prone, ''Events'' can be said to offer us serene, and even implicitly utopian, visions. Yet, even when they satisfy, I can still find them slightly bland. ''Events'' often seem to smooth out and homogenize sequences which, in the dances from which they come, have a much more distinct kinetic personality. Therefore it is probably not surprising that many of the ''Events'' I have enjoyed most have been ones that have made me aware of something other than movement alone. On occasion, this ''something other'' may be music. The movement sequences in ''Events'' are divorced from the scores that accompany the dances from which the sequences derive. Often, new scores are devised at each performance by members of the Cunningham company's musical staff and the sounds they produce are apt to be innocuous electronic chirps and twitters. However, there have been some musically astonishing ''Events.'' When, in 1979, the Cunningham company became the first dance group to appear in Camera Mart/Stage One, a former movie sound stage, John Cage on opening night roamed through the auditorium making thumping noises on the risers on which the audience sat. By so doing he seemed to be testing, and then blessing, the new theater. Two remarkable singers - Meredith Monk in 1975 and Demetrios Statos in 1978 - made ''Events'' exciting with their vocal swoops, slides, trills, wails and unexpected shifts of register. On these occasions, dancing was united with glossolalia. But, most often, it is the space in which an ''Event'' occurs that constitutes the ''something other'' that helps make it special. ''Events'' look particularly impressive in nonproscenium spaces. In fact, Mr. Cunningham gave the first ''Event'' back in 1964 in order to comply with a request to dance in a hall in Vienna which lacked a stage and was, by conventional standards, totally unsuitable for a theatrical performance. Whereas the frame of an ordinary proscenium theater may distance and neutralize the action in ''Events,'' nonproscenium spaces can make the ''Events'' appear to be engaged in dialogue with their environment. At various times, Mr. Cunningham has offered ''Events'' in his own studio, with the audience seated on two sides of the dancers. Among the most visually beautiful of these ''Events'' were those in which he left both the studio's wall of mirrors and its wall of windows uncovered. Thus, as one watched the dancing, one could gaze out upon the Manhattan skyline. One could also, in a sense, see the same dance twice by following its progress both in the actions of the dancers moving across the studio floor and in their reflections in the mirrors. And there were strange moments when the studio lighting somehow made the reflected images look more real - or, at least, more vivid - than the flesh-and-blood performers. One of the most memorable of all ''Events'' - one that is still talked about in hushed tones by many dancegoers - was the one staged last year in the Seventh Regiment Armory on Park Avenue. Spectators could either sit on two sides of a specially constructed dance floor or gaze down upon the action from a balcony. Crates were stacked about the armory, cars and trucks were parked at one side of the space and through windows high in the hall one could see the light of day gradually fade away into darkness with the passage of time. This cavernous room, which resembled a railroad terminal in its dimensions, suddenly seemed a site for momentous happenings and, by dancing there, the Cunningham company first acknowledged, then magically transfigured, the everyday world. If few ''Events'' have been quite so marvelous, most have had their own real pleasures. Yet, unless they are enhanced in some way, ''Events'' tend to afford the same kinds of pleasures, despite the fact that they are always choreographically different. Thus it can be argued that other, and perhaps more deeply satisfying, pleasures are to be found in repertory. As for the Cunningham company, it is always a pleasure to watch, in ''Events'' and repertory alike.

961-> SANDINISTAS' OPPONENTS TELL OF OBSTACLES TO TRAVEL
Miriam Arg"uello was planning to travel to Costa Rica for a wedding this week, but when she arrived to pick up her passport from immigration officials, she said she was told it had inadvertantly been sent to a remote part of the country. Juan Ramon Aviles said that he wanted to make a business trip, but that the authorities told him he would be granted an exit visa only after a newly-discovered irregularity about his date of birth was resolved. Enrique Bolanos Geyer made it all the way to the Managua airport, but as he passed through document control, he said, an official examined his passport in private and then announced that it was missing a page and therefore was not valid. Mr. Bolanos said it was intact when he presented it. Mrs. Arg"uello, Mr. Aviles and Mr. Bolanos are leaders of anti-Sandinista political and business groups. They and about a dozen other opposition figures say that for the last three weeks, since the national election that the Sandinista Front won overwhelmingly, they have found an array of obstacles in their way as they try to go out of the country. No New Policy Announced The Sandinista Government has not announced any new policy on travel by opposition figures, but one appears to be in effect. Senior Government officials did not respond to requests for interviews on the subject. Lieut. Miguel Necochea, spokesman for the Interior Ministry, said Friday night that the Government had no list of people to be prevented from leaving the country. ''We have no policy of denying visas to anyone,'' Lieutenant Nicochea said. As far as could be determined, all of the opposition leaders currently unable to travel have ties to the Democratic Coordinator, a coalition of political parties, labor unions and business groups that incurred the wrath of the Sandinista Front when it refused to take part in the recent electoral campaign. The coalition nominated Arturo Jose Cruz, an economist, for President, but then refused to register his name on the ground the Government was not allowing political rivals enough freedom. At times in the past the Government has temporarily restricted travel for some opposition leaders, but no such restrictions are known to have been imposed in the last year. Under emergency powers adopted after the outbreak of civil strife three years ago the Government has some powers to restrict travel by Nicaraguan citizens, but it has not invoked them. A Tradition of Travel Travel among Central American countries is common, and many businesses rely on commerce within the isthmus. In addition, Nicaraguan opposition leaders, like the Sandinistas themselves, often travel in search of international support for their political positions. Some of those who have been unable to leave Nicaragua said they suspected that the Government's motive was to prevent them from denouncing the Sandinistas in foreign countries. Others speculated that because the Government fears an imminent invasion from the United States, it may want to be sure opposition leaders are in the country when it comes and are not able to escape its consequences. ''Perhaps they would use us as hostages if anything were to happen in the country,'' suggested Mr. Aviles, a lawyer who works for the Superior Council of Private Enterprise, Nicaragua's main business federation. Business Group Leaders Several leaders of the council, which is known as Cosep, are among those who have had trouble leaving the country. Mr. Bolanos, who now carries his mutilated passport as a conversation piece, is the group's president. His brother Nicolas, president of the Union of Nicaraguan Coffee Growers, which is affiliated with Cosep, said he had also been unable to leave for a planned trip to visit a daughter in New Orleans. ''A military man at the immigration office told me my application was incomplete, but he wouldn't answer questions about what was missing,'' Nicolas Bolanos said today. ''They made me fill out a new form and told me to come back Nov. 28.'' Francisco Javier Calderon, executive secretary of another Cosep-affiliated group, the National Council of Professionals, told a similar story. He was planning a trip through nearby countries to meet with sympathetic political and civic groups. As is the custom in Nicaragua, he submitted his passport and other required documentation to the authorities 15 days before he was to leave. 'They Said to Come Back' ''They told me to pick up the passport on Nov. 16,'' Mr. Calderon said. ''When I got there, they said to come back three days later. When I arrived the second time, a Sub-Lieut. Carlos Granera came out and told me that my passport had accidentally been sent to Special Zone I and could not be found.'' Special Zone I is the northern part of isolated Zelaya Province on the Atlantic coast of Nicaragua. Sub-Lieutenant Granera, reached by telephone, said he was not authorized to give any information about Government policy on travel for opposition figures. But one of his aides, Sub-Lieut. Ruth Zepeda, said the agency ''is not preventing anyone from leaving.'' In at least one case, an opposition leader was able to win an exit visa that was apparently being denied to him after he appealed personally to Interior Minister Tomas Borge. The leader, Pedro Joaquin Chamorro Barrios, an editor of the opposition newsaper La Prensa, said he was on his way to Japan last week when authorities at the airport told him his multiple-exit visa was no longer valid. Mr. Chamorro missed his plane. But later, backed by a Japanese diplomat, he spoke with Mr. Borge, obtained the visa, and was finally able to leave. One of the first activists to encounter trouble was Mario Rapaccioli, leader of a faction of the Conservative Party, who was turned back at the airport Nov. 12 after an immigration officer found a page of his passport disfigured. Since then at least a dozen applications by opposition leaders for new passports, passport renewals or exit visas have been delayed. Mr. Rapaccioli, one of the most outspoken anti-Sandinistas remaining in Nicaragua, said in an interview that his passport was in perfect condition when he submitted it at the airport. Immigration officers at the Managua airport work in opaque booths that do not allow passengers any view of what they are doing with the travelers' documents. No Response Received Several other opposition leaders, such as Luis Rivas Leiva of the Social Democratic Party, Erick Ramirez of the Social Christians and Jose Espinoza of the Confederation for Trade Union Unity, said they had received no responses to requests for visas, new passports or passport renewals. ''Under their emergency powers, they have the right to keep people from leaving,'' said Mr. Aviles. ''I wish they would just publish a list and tell us which people are forbidden to leave and for how long, so we don't go through this charade. The immigration office is a good distance from where I work, and gasoline is expensive in this country.''

962-> THE REGION ; Report to CuomoUrges CuttingThe Income Tax
The best way to make business executives really love New York, says a panel appointed by Governor Cuomo, is to cut the state's personal income tax. That advice, contained in a report submitted to Mr. Cuomo yesterday, was expected to kick off a debate in the Legislature over how to streamline taxes and disburse what appears to be a growing surplus. ''According to recent surveys, business executives in New York judge the personal income tax the greatest single burden imposed by the state,'' said the report by the Governor's Council on Fiscal and Economic Priorities. The income tax, with a maximum rate of 10 percent, makes it difficult for New York corporations to attract executives and high-salaried managers and technicians when other states tax at lower rates or have no personal income tax, the panel reported. By contrast, it said, New York corporate taxes are comparable to the national average and slightly lower than those in neighboring states. The report, prepared by a Council subcommittee headed by James D. Robinson 3d, the chairman of Shearson/American Express, and Felix G. Rohatyn, a partner in Lazard Fre res & Company, suggested reducing income taxes by cutting the maximum rate from 10 percent to 9 percent and ''balancing'' cuts for different income levels through changes in the standard deduction and personal exemptions. Governor Cuomo said the panel made ''a compelling case for the reduction of New York's income tax burden as an important element in our economic development strategy.'' With the Governor estimating that the surplus for the current fiscal year will be more than $200 million (and Republicans predicting almost $700 million), some form of tax relief is expected to be passed by the 1985 session of the Legislature. But since Mr. Cuomo will be up for re-election the following year, determining the size and nature of the tax cuts - as well as who gets the credit - is likely to preoccupy lawmakers in the months to come.

963-> TROOPERS IN FIGHT ON RETIRING
TRENTON THE New Jersey State Police are embroiled in an internal dispute over mandatory retirement that is pitting younger troopers and officers against older executives. The dispute, which is hurting morale and has drawn strong charges from both groups, had its genesis in a 1983 United States Supreme Court decision involving a case brought on behalf of a Wyoming game warden. He had objected to a state regulation requiring retirement at age 55. The Court's ruling extended the 1967 Age Discrimination in Employment Act, a Federal measure, to cover the game warden and, by extension, all state law-enforcement and public-safety agencies. The Court ruled that Wyoming had to show that age was a ''Bona Fide Occupational Qualification'' (B.F.O.Q.) under the Federal law before it could force the warden to retire. (Ironically, although the ruling placed all state mandatory retirement plans for uniformed services under the Federal law, it did not touch Federal law-enforcement agencies, and so Border Patrol officers, as well as agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Secret Service, still must retire at 55.) Most states decided to fight the 1967 act, asserting that the the B.F.O.Q. applied to their age retirement rules. For example, Wyoming, in the game warden case, won a District Court ruling that its age regulation met the B.F.O.Q. test. In addition, Massachusetts won a decision upholding its age-50 retirement rule for state troopers, Baltimore obtained a decision that its age-55 retirement regulation for firefighters was valid and last week Pennsylvania's age-60 retirement for its State Police also was declared a B.F.O.Q. However, New Jersey's Attorney General, Irwin I. Kimmelman, ruled in April 1983 - six weeks after the Supreme Court decision - that mandatory retirement for law-enforcement and firefighting personnel under 70 was ''invalid and unenforceable.'' Two New Jersey Congressmen - Matthew J. Rinaldo, Republican of the Seventh District (covering parts of Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth and Union Counties), and William J. Hughes, Democrat of the Second District (covering parts of Cumberland, Salem, Cape May, Atlantic and Ocean Counties) - introduced a bill that sought to get around the effect of the Supreme Court ruling by establishing the right of local authorities to fix retirement ages for police and fire forces. Col. Clinton L. Pagano, Superintendent of the State Police, submitted written testimony to a House committee in support of the bill. ''The very term 'police force,' '' he testified, ''connotes strength, and strength is synonymous with youth in our society.'' But while these steps were taken by New Jersey officials, no attempt to defend the state's age-55 retirement was begun. In 1984, 19 State Police officers resigned, an usually high number, according to Trooper Thomas Iskrzycki. He is president of the State Troopers Fraternal Association and chairman of the National Troopers Coalition, representing 30,000 troopers across the country. Trooper Iskrzycki said that, since the Attorney General's ruling, 42 State Police executives had stayed on the job past age 55, bottling up advancement and forcing troopers to remain on patrol duty too long. ''After 10 years of seeing dead bodies, covering accidents and getting hit on the head by drunks,'' he said, ''many troopers snap out and become nasty and rotten.'' Unless something is done to create move ment in the upper echelon of the 2,200- member police organization, Trooper Iskrzycki said, the public may one day see ''old, toothless troopers patrolling the state highway on wheelchairs with sirens and flashing lights.'' Trooper Iskrzycki also said that the 5 percent raises he helped win as the troopers' bargaining agent over the years had enlarged the gap between the salaries of the troopers and staff officers, since the same 5 percent was applied across the board. ''When I got out of the State Police Academy in 1965,'' he said, ''I was paid $6,499 a year and the colonel was making $18,000. Now a trooper coming out of the academy gets $20,800; lieutenants, $41,000; captains, $51,000; majors, $62,000, and the colonel up to $69,900.'' All these ranges will increase retroactive to July, when the latest round of raises take effect. ''We have the highest-paid brass in the United States,'' Trooper Iskrzycki said, adding that there is 1 supervisor for every 1.3 troopers. Trooper Iskrzycki succeeded earlier this year in having a bill introduced that would reinstate the age-55 retirement regulation and cap pension benefits after 30 years. The measure, he said, would remove some of the incentive for staff officers to try to remain on their jobs longer. The bill has been passed by the Assembly and is scheduled to come up tomorrow for a hearing before the Senate Revenue, Finance and Appropriations Committee. The measure has inspired State Police executives to form their own lobbying organization - State Police Against Age Discrimination Inc., headed by Maj. Louis E. Grossi - ''to defend ourselves against the prejudicial and bigoted statements of some persons involved in forcing us to retire.'' In a statement, Major Grossi and the affected officers say there is no agreement on the age at which a police officer becomes unfit to serve the public. ''Seventeen percent of all police departments have no mandatory retirement, and 43 percent use age 65,'' he said. ''Congress called for bona fide occupantional requirements to make sure that all police departments were physically and mentally fit to perform their duties. If this criteria is accepted, there is no need to retire police officers according to their age.'' The initial State Police retirement policy in effect from 1921 to 1965 mandated retirement at 55, but said that retirees could stay on until they had 25 years of service so that they could earn paid medical benefits with their retirement. As a result, more than two dozen troopers were able to stay on up to age 60. In 1965, the system was amended to allow troopers to stay on until 65, with the approval of the Superintendent and concurrence of the Attorney General. The executive officers contend that the changes reflect increasing life expectancy and a realization of the value of keeping experienced, mature officers in their jobs. ''It would appear,'' Major Grossi said, ''that in an era of government retrenchment the State of New Jersey would be wise in allowing members of the division to voluntarily remain past 55 years of age, thereby insuring more for the taxpayer's money, while simultaneously minimizing the drain of talented police executives to private industry.''

964-> 2D BONN AIDE, TIED TO PAYOFF, RESIGNS HIS JOB
The Speaker of the West German Parliament resigned today after being implicated in a political payoff scandal. The official, Rainer Barzel, 60 years old, has been accused of accepting half a million dollars from the Flick holding company in exchange for giving up the leadership of the Christian Democratic Party in 1973 in favor of Helmut Kohl, now the Chancellor. On Wednesday, Mr. Barzel denied before a parliamentary subcommittee investigating the Flick affair that he had accepted a payoff, insisting that he had been properly paid as a legal consultant. But his testimony disappointed Chancellor Kohl and other party leaders, and they pressed for the Speaker's resignation. Kohl to Testify Nov. 7 Mr. Kohl, who will appear before the investigating panel on Nov. 7, was also on Flick's payment lists, which were subpoenaed by the Bonn prosecutor and subsequently disclosed to the press. According to press accounts, payments to Mr. Kohl from 1973 to 1980 totaled 665,000 marks, or $221,000 at the current exchange rate. ''What I have been accused of I have already refuted,'' Mr. Kohl told a television interviewer today. He said a campaign was under way to weaken the governing coalition. Mr. Barzel's resignation made him the second casualty of the Flick payoff scandal, which has sullied the reputations of the three major parties. Four months ago, the Minister for Economic Affairs, Otto Lambsdorff, resigned and was then indicted on charges of accepting bribes from Flick. Few West German politicians believe that the reported payments to Mr. Barzel were decisive in influencing the course of events in 1973, a year after his Christian Democratic Party was defeated by the Social Democrats in an election. Instead, politicians interpreted Flick's largesse as part of an effort to influence the Government at the highest level. The Barzel affair poses no immediate threat to the governing center-right coalition of Chancellor Kohl, but Government strategists fear that fresh revelations and probable indictments could corrode support. The coalition is made up of Christian Democrats and Free Democrats. State elections are scheduled next spring in West Berlin, the Saarland and North Rhine-Westphalia, and reduced support for the governing parties in Bonn could enhance the chances of the Green Party, an antinuclear, proenvironment group, and of the Social Democrats, who might again be tempted to try to form a coalition after national elections due in 1987. The resignation of Mr. Barzel was disclosed today by Alfred Dregger, floor leader of the Christian Democrats' parliamentary group. He told party leaders that the Speaker felt ''the political and pyschological pressure on him has become unbearable.'' ''Parliament must get back to business,'' Mr. Dregger said. ''Aware of his responsibility, Mr. Barzel would like to contribute to this and asks that another Speaker be elected.'' Jenninger May Be Successor A Government official said a likely successor was Philip Jenninger, a Cabinet member who deals with East Germany. Mr. Barzel's position was undermined today when G"unter Max Paefgen, a member of the Flick board, testified that Mr. Barzel had informed the company in 1973 that he was going to work for a Frankfurt law firm. Flick's directors then decided to channel business to the firm, Mr. Paefgen said. The feeling among Christian Democrats, according to well-placed politicians, was that the Speaker had to go to prevent the scandal from further tarnishing Chancellor Kohl. ''I think we have to take this very seriously,'' an aide to Mr. Kohl said. ''It is not a danger to democracy, but it is a challenge to democracy.'' Otto Schily, a Green deputy and a member of the Flick subcommittee, told a gathering his party's legislators, ''We must now all turn our attention to the case of Chancellor Kohl.'' A lawyer, Mr. Schily made a name for himself in the 1970's by defending left-wing clients accused of terrorism. The newspaper S"uddeutsche Zeitung of Munich said Flick had paid out 25 million marks ($8.3 million) to politicians and parties between 1969 and 1980, including 15 million marks to the Christian Democrats, 6.5 million to the Free Democrats and 4.3 million to the Social Democrats. The Flick subcommittee was originally convened to examine charges that the company had bribed Cabinet ministers in Social Democratic governments to obtain $175 million in tax waivers. It was this case that led to the indictment of Mr. Lambsdorff, who served under the Social Democrats before his Free Democratic Party threw its allegiance behind the Christian Democrats in 1982. The reported payoffs to Mr. Barzel apparently were not connected to the tax matter. Mr. Kohl sought last spring to prevent a snowballing number of prosecutions by proposing an amnesty for politicians and businessmen who illegally deducted party contributions from income taxes. This triggered a rebellion among his Free Democratic allies, and the bill was withdrawn. As a result, some 1,800 investigations involving 3,000 people have continued, and could produce a rash of embarrassing indictments.

965-> WEST BANK ARABS SQUEEZED BY 2 ECONOMIES
-Occupied West Bank - Trapped between Israel's 1,000 percent inflation and the shrinking job market in Jordan and the Persian Gulf, the Arabs of the West Bank and Gaza Strip are facing a serious economic squeeze. Israeli officials are increasingly concerned that widespread unemployoen could politicize middle-class Arabs who up to now have tended to abjure political activism. Almost half the labor force in the occupied territories - more than 100,000 people - piles into cars and small buses every morning and drives into Israel to work, primarily at manual labor. Thousands of others with families in the West Bank and Gaza have white-collar jobs in various Arab countries, sending home several hundred million dollars a year. ''The West Bank and Gaza had become suppliers of labor to two very different sources and are now being caught between them,'' said Gad Gilbar, a professor of Middle East economics at the University of Haifa. ''The first is Jordan and the Arab oil-producing states, where economic development and the demand for foreign labor has slowed down, and the second is Israel, with its high rate of inflation and potential for large-scale unemployment. We are now seeing the first signs of open unemployment in Israel. If this continues,'' Professor Gilbar added, ''the labor force in the West Bank and Gaza Strip will be greatly affected, since thousands of them work in Israel, and for many households this is their only source of income.'' The West Bank and Gaza are unusual economic entities. Individually, many of their citizens have prospered during 17 years of Israeli rule but communally, they have been economically deprived. Industrial development in the territories has been deliberately stunted by the Government, writes Meron Benvenisti in his classic study of Israeli policy in the West Bank, so as to increase dependence on Israeli markets, prevent competition with Israeli producers and, most important, to head off the establishment of an economic base that might one day serve as the framework for a Palestinian state. This approach to the territories was workable as long as the employment opportunities provided by Israel, Jordan and the Arab oil-producing states absorbed the labor that could not be sustained by local agriculture and small-scale commerce. Personal prosperity and the steady rise in the standard of living helped take the edge off the occupation for middle-class Palestinians and accounted, in part, for the relatively docile manner in which they accepted Israeli rule. Cautious CustomersIf it can be said that the Government can't afford a lot of unemployment in Israel, then it is even more true in the West Bank and Gaza,'' said the manager of West Bank operations for an Israeli banking chain. ''This is not England or France, you know, where you have unemployment and people just live with it.'' Adds Zafer el-Masri, head of the Nablus Chamber of Commerce: ''If there is a lot of unemployment, then it won't just be students throwing stones. It will create a lot of opportunities for extremism.'' Already there are signs of economic retrenchment. Land prices in Gaza are said to have fallen by one-third. College graduates, who found it difficult to find jobs in the best of times, say things have never been worse. Merchants report that their customers are being cautious. Most of their potential buyers earn their salaries in shekels, which have lost buying power in Israel's relentless inflation. To protect themselves, Palestinians rush with their shekel paychecks to local money-changers to convert them into Jordanian dinars bearing the portrait of King Hussein. The dinar is legal tender in the West Bank. Money-changers say that even a few Israelis have been exchanging shekels for dinars when American dollars are unavailable. ''People's purchasing power is declining, so sales are declining,'' says Hanna Nasser, Deputy Mayor of Bethlehem and owner of a small textile plant. ''I have 14 looms that used to go three shifts a day. Now only four looms are operating for one shift. Last week, I put out the word that I needed a new driver at a salary of 120 dinars ($310) a month. I got 83 applicants.'' The economic predicament of the territories will undoubtedly be on the agenda when Yasir Arafat convenes the Palestine National Council in Amman this week. Brig. Gen. A. Beckenstein, the deputy Israeli coordinator for Government operations in the West Bank and Gaza, says his office is keeping a careful watch on the job situation so that large-scale unemployment can be quickly headed off with Israeli-financed public works projects. Israel's new Prime Minister, Shimon Peres, has given Palestinians in Nablus permission for a project to start a local bank. He has also expressed approval for a plan by a group of American Jews and Arabs to invest in industry in the West Bank. But these measures have met with harsh criticism from some Likud members of the National Unity Coalition, who say that in hard times all money should be channeled into Jewish projects. If the predicted economic downturn hits as hard as some experts predict, the Government will be faced with the difficult choice of either allowing Palestinians to develop their own economic infrastructure or of taking scarce resources away from Jewish settlements to maintain employment in the Arab population. ''We know from the history of Iran, Turkey and South America,'' said Professor Gilbar, ''that people become most revolutionary not when they are very poor but when they had economic prosperity and then one day it vanished.''

966-> BROOKLYN PARISHIONERS MOURN CHURCH'S RUIN
Members of the Janes United Methodist Church gathered yesterday to celebrate the 125th anniversary of their congregation. They crowded into their parsonage on Stuyvesant Street in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, but their hearts were a block away, where the church they had planned to honor was still smoldering from the fire that consumed it late Saturday night. Weeks ago, the congregation had chosen to commemorate the day by singing the hymn ''How Firm a Foundation.'' Yesterday, the irony of the words caused many to pause in tears as they prayed. ''When through fiery trials I call you to go,'' they sang, their voices tired and cracking, ''my grace is sufficient to turn your trials to blessings.'' People began arriving at the church within minutes after the fire started at 10 P.M. Some had heard the news on television and some had seen the flames spitting into the sky. They congregated on the sidewalk, some with coats draped over pajamas, watching as the pews and the altar and the organ were swallowed by fire. ''The first part that went up was the sanctuary,'' said the pastor, the Rev. Robert O. Simpson. ''After being pastor for 11 years, I loved that building dearly. I stayed there until about 2:30.'' The three-alarm fire was labeled suspicious, and fire officials are investigating. Flames engulfed the building at 174 Reid Avenue within minutes and, at their height, shot across the street, touching two apartment buildings, one of which was evacuated. Three firefighters suffered minor injuries before the blaze was brought under control shortly before midnight. ''The fire took so quickly,'' said Arthur Reed, a member of the church since 1955. ''All we could do was stand there and watch.'' Yesterday, many parishioners began the day with a visit to the skeleton of the neo-Gothic structure, whose spires still rise high above the singed bricks and charred rubble. Huddled under umbrellas, they stared at the huge archways that had welcomed brides and babies wrapped in christening gowns. ''I was married in that church 30 years ago,'' said Marjorie Couze. ''It was Saturday, Nov. 20, 1954. Boy, it was teeming rain that day. But, oh, that church was beautiful. The choir loft was covered with flowers. We have pictures but they're all faded.'' Like many of the parishioners, Mrs. Couze, who lives in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, heard of the fire from friends who called early in the morning. ''I dressed quickly and drove right down,'' she said. ''I just could not control myself. I thought of my mother, God rest her soul - this church meant so much to her - and I thought of my wedding.'' Rebuilding the Church Determined not to diminish the spirit of the church that had been a home not only to worshipers but to scout troops, civic groups and food programs, parishioners gathered for prayer and celebration at the parsonage. About 200 of the church's 800 members filled the parlor on the second floor, and many more spilled onto the stairs and the landing. They listened as the Rev. Dr. Wilson T. Boots, the United Methodist District Superintendent, delivered a sermon about building and knitting a community. Citing passages from Isaiah, Dr. Boots talked about creating faith on the foundation of ancient ruins. ''The theme of the service continued to be celebration,'' he said. ''In Isaiah it says, 'And your streets shall be rebuilt,' and today in that room you could just see people planning the rebuilding already. You could just sense the depth and power of faith among the people. '' ''It was not a service of sadness,'' said Natalie Cave, ''It was a message of inspiration.'' 'Remember When . . .' After the service, the congregants gathered in the dining room on the first floor and, over cups of coffee and freshly baked lemon pound cake, shared memories of the red brick church. All around the room, conversations began with ''Remember when . . .'' and ''How about the time that . . .'' Emma St. Bernard has been a church member for 34 years. She was married in the church, and years later she brought her two children for prayers every Sunday. ''I can still remember carrying them up the stairs in my arms the day they were christened,'' said Mrs. St. Bernard, a trustee of the church. ''When I got there last night I just cried seeing the altar that I stood before when I took my marriage vows just, just tumble.'' Mary Culler said she could not help standing on the corner in front of the brick skeleton and staring. ''It was a beacon,'' she said, clasping the hand of her husband, John. ''So many activities, so many children. It was a beautiful, beautiful church. I don't know why things like this happen. Sometimes it's the way of the Lord to test your strength and faith.'' New Carpeting and Pews Although she moved to Crown Heights several years ago, Alberta Bryant said she still donned her best hat and coat every Sunday and returned to Bedford-Stuyvesant to the Janes church. She recalled the bake sales and raffles the church held to raise money to repair the grand German organ, and spoke proudly of the new red carpeting and wooden pews that had recently been installed. But more than the building and the precious artifacts that were lost to the blaze, Mrs. Bryant talked about the people of the church. ''See this group here,'' she said, gesturing around the room. ''They are like this all the time, joined together. We're a very quiet congregation, we're private people. But we share deep love for this church. I feel like part of my family died, like part of me is gone with the church.'' ''This is a church that has touched many souls,'' said Dr. Carline Harris, a trustee of the church who has already begun to organize a rebuilding fund. ''Even though the brick and the mortar are gone, we are committed to the Lord and we know that He will help us to rebuild.'' A Brotherhood Breakfast Standing in the dining room, Mr. Simpson greeted people who meandered between the church and the parsonage. There were hugs and handshakes and offers of help. ''The brotherhood breakfast is still on for next Sunday,'' said one man. ''We'll just set it up over here on the first floor,'' said Mr. Simpson. ''We're just going to keep right on going.'' But many times during the day, people who could no longer fight back tears leaned on the shoulders of friends and cried. Even as she spoke of rebuilding the church, Dr. Harris wiped her eyes. ''I know that we have to be strong and we are,'' she said. ''But right now, it is still very painful.''

967-> ECONOMIC SCENE; DISSONANCE ON DEFICITS
THE key issue of the 1984 political campaign has been the budget deficit and what to do about it. Virtually everyone except a handful of economists - some supply-siders on the right and some traditional Keynesians on the left - condemns the deficit as much too large and calls for actions after the election to shrink it. But the question is whether anything much will actually be done to reduce the deficit, no matter who is elected. Well-placed observers in Washington, including both Republicans and Democrats, have grown dubious that, if President Reagan is re-elected, as they assume he will be, he will move decisively to close the deficit gap following an electoral victory. Mr. Reagan is not in love with the deficit, and he would like it to disappear. But he believes that this can be done if the economy just keeps growing, with revenues rising faster than Government expenditures. He refuses to credit the warnings of his own economic advisers and certainly not those of his critics who insist that economic growth will not cause the deficit to vanish. ''There is no credible evidence that we can 'grow our way' out of the deficit,'' Walter W. Heller and George L. Perry, two of Walter F. Mondale's key economic advisers, say in a joint analysis. ''To do so would call for a combination of high growth rates and low interest rates that goes beyond the bounds of either experience or sensible expectations.'' But Mr. Reagan will have none of this. Insiders report that the President is in a very upbeat mood. ''If you come to him with 18 pieces of bad news and one piece of good news, he'll say, 'Good! Just look at that!' '' said one adviser. Another reports: ''He thinks the business cycle is a thing of the past.'' Wall Street obviously is not thinking that way. Despite the general assumption that Mr. Reagan is going to be re-elected, the stock market has been sliding downward in recent weeks, though yesterday the Dow industrial average was up 15.90 points. Much of the market's concern is about the deficit. ''If fiscal action is not taken, the stimulus from the fiscal side will very likely be more than offset by higher interest rates,'' William N. Griggs and Leonard J. Santow, investment counselors, say in a paper. Some officials in the Reagan Administration use even stronger terms, warning of ''a disaster'' if strong action is not taken to narrow the fiscal gap. Some fear that a recession may overtake the Administration before it is prepared to move, and send the deficit soaring to $300 billion to $400 billion. They are afraid falling profits could drive foreign capital out of the country, putting extreme pressure on interest rates and breeding financial catastrophes in debt-ridden third world countries. Some are afraid that the pressures on the Fed to accommodate climbing deficits would be irresistible - and would regenerate inflation. But while the financial experts on Wall Street and in Washington are growing wary about the outlook, the general public appears ready to re-elect Mr. Reagan, primarily because of its approval of the performance of the economy under his stewardship and because they expect further economic benefits to flow from ''four more years.'' Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a sometime professor at Harvard, regards this public attitude as a case of ''cognitive dissonance'' - a state in which there is a radical difference between what one perceives and what one expects to follow from that perception. The New York Democrat explains the term by citing the example of a white mouse that pushes a lever expecting to get a lump of cheese and gets an electric shock instead. ''The mouse winds up with his feet straight up in the air,'' he says. The severity of the shock is proportional to the intensity of the dissonance. Accordingly, Senator Moynihan suggests that a severe shock will hit the public when it discovers that its expectation that Mr. Reagan's re-election will mean not growth and shrinking deficits but bigger deficits, slow growth, a falling dollar, debt defaults and, in due course, rising unemployment. The stock market, however, seems less likely to suffer from cognitive dissonance. For the past month it has been acting, as theory predicts it should, to eliminate dissonance by lowering its expectations. Mr. Reagan's advisers believe that the campaign has made it virtually impossible for him to move strongly after the election to slash expenditures, whether military or civilian, or to raise taxes. Some insist he would like to broaden the tax base, eliminating virtually all deductions while cutting tax rates steeply. But Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan has spoken of this reform as being ''revenue neutral.'' That may be the politically most difficult job of all - raising the taxes of some while cutting those of others. The old adage that there can be no tax reform without tax reduction, aimed at mustering enough political support, may or may not be right. It is also possible, as in wartime, to change the tax system while raising everyone's taxes, in the name of equity and widely shared sacrifices. But Mr. Reagan, Congress and the electorate do not have the appetite now for a heroic effort to raise taxes or slash expenditures to shrink the deficit. Analysis of the post-election economic outlook should start with that assumption. We will continue the analysis in another column.

969-> AROUND THE NATION; Steel Workers' Minister Defies Sheriff on Church
Proclaiming ''everyone is welcome,'' including the sheriff, a dissident minister unlocked his steel-mill town church for services today in defiance of his bishop and a judge. The Rev. D. Douglas Roth, a member of a group that takes militant action on behalf of the unemployed, and 100 members of his Trinity Lutheran Church prayed for the bishop who suspended and defrocked Mr. Roth, the judge who found him in contempt and the sheriff ordered to arrest him. ''Tell the sheriff he is free to come and go,'' Mr. Roth said. ''I will continue to serve my calling.'' He remained at large this afternoon. Sheriff Eugene Coon of Allegheny County could not be reached for comment. Mr. Roth, 33 years old, is a leader of the Denominational Ministry Strategy, Lutheran and Episcopal ministers allied with militant steelworkers who contend that United States Steel and the Mellon Bank are abandoning the Monongahela and Ohio River valleys. Mr. Roth barricaded his church Nov. 4, after a judge issued an order barring him from acting as the church pastor. The order was issued at the request of Bishop Kenneth May, head of the Western Pennylvania-West Virginia Lutheran Synod of America, which suspended and then defrocked Mr. Roth in October after 71 of his 190 congregants complained about his activities.

970-> Schiro Tops Course Mark Cathy Schiro, a 17-year-old senior at Dover High School in New
Hampshire, set a course record in the 5,000 meters and led a group of eight female qualifiers to the national championships yesterday at the Kinney Northeast Regional meet at Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx. Leading the male qualifiers was John Trautmann, a junior at Monroe-Woodbury in Central Valley, N.Y., who ran 15 minutes 25.7 seconds over the 5,000-meter course. The national championships, to be held in Balboa Park in San Diego on Dec. 8, will bring together 32 boys and 32 girls. Miss Schiro clocked 16:46 on a bright, brisk morning, breaking the record of 17:04.7. Stacy Prey of Brighton High School in Rochester finished second. Finishing in third was Eileen Ellig of Rutland, Vt., in 17:56.7. Trautmann, the New York State Federation champion, finished ahead of the New Jersey champion, Andy Martin, a senior at North Hunterdon in Annandale. The other boys qualifiers to the national meet were Bill Crowley, a junior at Seekonk, Mass.; Bill Babcock, North Hunterdon, N.J.; Richard Black, Southington, Conn.; Michael Pieroni, Rogers, R.I.; Neil Donahue, Monsignor Farrell, Staten Island, N.Y., and Jack Cuvo, Easton, Pa. The other girls' qualifiers were Kathy Olsen, Waterford, Conn.; Jen Van Horn, Wayne, N.J.; Jeanine Radice, St. Joseph's by the Sea, Staten Island, N.Y.; Gina Braz, Peabody, Mass., and Natalie Cartwright, Mascenic, Durham, N.H.

971-> AROUND THE NATION; Ford Workers in Canada Vote to Accept Contract
About 14,200 workers at Ford Motor Company of Canada voted overwhelmingly today to ratify a three-year contract, heading off a general strike against the company's nine Ontario plants, union spokesmen said. Eighty-two percent of the union members voting to accept the proposed pact, which was reached Thursday between bargainers for Ford and the United Automobile Workers, union representatives said. ''I'm very satisfied with an over 80 percent vote,'' said Robert White, director of the union in Canada. ''I think it's excellent.'' Mr. White said the tentative contract was almost identical to a pact accepted by 36,000 workers at General Motors of Canada last week after a 13-day strike.

973-> THE REGION; New Appeal Filed In Stouffer Fire
Prosecutors have made a new request for a retrial of Luis Marin, the busboy whose murder conviction in the 1980 Stouffer's Inn fire, which killed 26 people, was overturned by the trial judge. The appeal was filed in the Court of Appeals last Friday. In the papers, the Westchester County District Attorney, Carl A. Vergari, asked that a new judge handle the case. The trial judge, Lawrence N. Martin Jr. of Westchester County Court, reversed the conviction of the 28-year-old Mr. Marin in April 1982 because of insufficient evidence. Last May, the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court upheld his decision.

975-> Bridge:U.S. and Polish Teams Win At World Team Olympiad
The two- week World Team Olympiad has ended here in victories for the United States and Poland, achieved in markedly different fashions. In the women's division, the American team struggled throughout Friday against a strong British team and were somewhat lucky to squeeze out a victory by a 10-point margin. The winners were Kathy Wei, Judi Radin, Jacqui Mitchell, Gail Moss, all of New York; Carol Sanders of Nashville, and Betty Ann Kennedy of Shreveport, La. At the same time, in the open division, the Poles had surprisingly little difficulty in overcoming France, the defending champions, Saturday night. At the midpoint they led by 111 points, and the remainder of the match was a virtual formality. The final margin was 79 points in favor of Poland. The winners were Piotr Gawrys, Henryk Wolny, Kryzysztof Martens, Tomasz Przybora, Jacek Romanski and Piotr Tuszynski, who are all amateur bridge players with full-time professional occupations. French Take Third Trick The initial surge that put Poland on the road to victory was considerably aided by the diagramed deal. In one room Romanski and Tuszynski saved in five hearts against a contract of four spades. They were beaten two tricks, for a penalty of 500, since the third round of diamonds promoted a trump trick for the defense. It seemed likely that this would be a phantom save, since four spades can be beaten. West must lead a club, and the defense must find a ruff in that suit. The Polish North-South did reach four spades as shown in the diagram, and the French West did lead the club jack putting the defense on the right road. East put up the ace and had something to think about when Gawrys as South smoothly dropped the queen. The Losing Conclusion East was Henri Szwarc, who, in a long and distinguished career, has won many titles and solved many problems. He did not solve this one, however. Concluding that his partner had led the jack from J-10-9-4 he shifted to the heart king and the contract could not be defeated. Had he returned a club, his partner would have had the chance to underlead his heart ace later and secure the decisive club ruff. The Poles therefore scored 790 and gained 7 international match points when they could have lost 10. They were on the road to victory.

976-> AROUND THE NATION; Scouts Order New Tests For Dioxin at Camp Site
The Boy Scouts have arranged for tests at a Virginia Army post where 32,000 Boy Scouts camped in 1981 near dioxin contamination. In addition, an official said today, the Scouts still planned their jamboree there in 1985. ''We don't think there are any serious problems,'' said J. L. Tarr, chief executive of the Boy Scouts of America. ''It's been more than three and a half years and we don't have any record.'' Mr. Tarr said an independent laboratory would test the site Tuesday. The Army said soil tests in 1983 at the site, Fort A. P. Hill in central Virginia, found 200 parts per billion of toxic dioxin in a storage building and 3 parts per billion around it. The report was given to the Scout organization Friday. Dr. Barry Rumack of the Rocky Mountain Poison Control Center in Denver said more than 1 part per billion was unsafe. Army officials say the building was used to store Silvex, a weed-killer containing dioxin. Dioxin, a byproduct in the manufacture of herbicides, is one of the most hazardous man-made substances. It is known to cause cancer and other problems in animals.

977-> A WALL HONORING NOT ONLY VIETNAM VETERANS
The Vietnam Veterans Memorial that New York City is planning for lower Manhattan is an admirable gesture. But why just for veterans? Why not a memorial for the entire Vietnam generation? The design - a plain wall of glass brick etched, inside, with veterans' words written from Vietnam and letters sent to them from home - is too narrow a view of that war. Ultimately, such a monument is doomed to be a forgotten place. The test of a good monument is whether it means something in a hundred years. Washington, after all, has given Vietnam veterans a shrine. Its inspiration lies in its ambiguity, for it encourages one to ponder the enormous cost of human life without addressing the issue of whether the cost was justified. Veterans, regardless of their support or loathing of their war, have rightly embraced the memorial as their own. It is difficult to imagine that a second memorial will upstage the first. New York should go beyond Washington's achievement and put its mind to a broader, different statement. It is often overlooked that between 1964 and 1973, only 2.5 million men out of an eligible 26 million ever fought in Vietnam. To make New York's monument, the city's only tangible public memorialization of the war, a tribute to a fraction of the generation perpetuates old wounds rather than advancing reconciliation. Throughout those years, elements of the generation were pitted one against another. Veterans were set against resisters in the streets. Prisoners of war were set against self-exiles in Canada. Even conscientious objectors in jail were set against conscientious objectors who avoided jail, just as starched officers on the battlefield were set against the pot-smoking ''grunts.'' Why must that same rancorous division, deliberately promoted by the nation's political leadership, now be cut into glass for all time?A great moral chart was devised during the Vietnam years, with hot arguments about what a young American should do when faced with an undeclared war in a primitive, faraway place where American security was scarcely involved. Perhaps the veterans were the ultimate losers in that impossible situation and so deserve special tribute now. But the impossible choice scarred all 26 million eligible men in many complicated ways, whether they will all admit it or not. Those who resisted the war, those who by hook or crook avoided the unpleasantness, and quite a few women as well, were deeply alienated by the Vietnam experience. The Vietnam generation, we must hope, will always be different. The sacrifice of the soldiers was not the only sacrifice. The victims were not only the dead and the wounded. In thinking about a Vietnam memorial, we may draw a parallel with Civil War statues, for they raise the question of whether they promoted reconciliation or romanticized the nation's division. Most of those statues honor the respective causes as just and noble, but they have little meaning today, except to arouse a longing for antebellum chivalry in a few esoteric Southern circles. The Vietnam War was also internecine, and what is needed is not a public park that says, by implication, that the soldier's sacrifice was more poignant or pointless, more romantic or tragic, more noble or more brutalizing than the lot of his brother. In that wall then, alongside the best of the veterans' poems and letters, why should not the sentiments of the resister and the exile and the perpetual graduate student be represented, as well as a few key documents and a few relics that defined the dilemma of the whole generation? Why not honor the moral as well as the physical courage of the generation? Interspersed among the heartfelt letters of all elements of the generation might be such relics as the Tonkin Gulf Resolution, a sharpened bamboo stake, a Westmoreland troop request, a Zippo lighter, a stone from the Hue Citadel, a lottery number, a remnant of a fuselage, a sign from the ''Hanoi Hilton'' (a P.O.W. camp), a Medal of Honor citation, a shroud from a Buddhist monk's robe, a marijuana pipe, a national service ribbon, a leaflet from the protest of 500,000, Jimmy Carter's pardon declaration. If there is to be a panorama for meditation on the nature of Vietnam, let it encompass the whole national experience. B

978-> American Sterilizer Accepts Tender Bid
The American Sterilizer Company, a producer of equipment, instruments and supplies used in hospitals, said yesterday that it had agreed to be acquired for $22.50 a share, or $230 million, by an investment group that includes management. American Sterilizer, which said in September that it was exploring such a transaction, said the buyer would be Amsco Holdings Inc., a newly created company that will be owned by the investment banking firms of Kelso & Company and First Boston Inc. and by senior management and key employees of American Sterilizer. On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, American Sterilizer advanced $1.25, to $22.25. Leslie M. Corley, a Kelso spokesman, said the proposed acquisition would include an Employee Stock Ownership Plan, in which employees are sold a percentage of the company's equity. He said the employee- held equity stake would eventually amount to ''significantly over 20 percent.'' American Sterilizer said Amsco's tender offer had been approved by its board, which is recommending that shareholders agree to the deal. First Boston will manage the offer, which is to begin by Friday, American Sterilizer said, and a majority of shares must be tendered by shareholders for the deal to go through. It said that the Bristol-Myers Company, the toiletry and medical products concern, had agreed to finance $30 million of the deal, and that Bristol-Myers had an option to purchase Amsco's surgical division for $55 million following completion of the deal. Should it exercise the option, Bristol- Myers may redeem $10 million of its notes toward the deal. First Boston will provide another $29 million of financing, American Sterilizer said. American Sterilizer said it had granted Amsco the option to purchase shares that have been authorized, but not issued. The shares amount to 18.5 percent of American Sterilizer's outstanding stock, it said.

979-> TURNER'S CABLE MUSIC CHANNEL STARTS TOMORROW
At noon tomorrow, Ted Turner, the flamboyant television entrepreneur, will begin a new round of competition in the volatile cable-TV business with the arrival of his Cable Music Channel in an estimated 2.5 million homes around the country. The 24-hour music-video channel represents the first full-fledged competitor to MTV Music Television, the round-the-clock rock-music cable service that many industry analysts regard as one of the most exciting new forces in television. Mr. Turner's channel has already prompted MTV to announce a second music video channel, called VH-1, which is scheduled to begin operations on Jan. 1. To distinguish itself from MTV, Cable Music Channel will depart from its competitor in its format. While MTV has ''video jockeys'' who introduce the video clips and offer news about the music business, Mr. Turner's channel will have disc jockeys introducing videos off-camera. ''We will have less talk and more music. It's an old radio trick,'' said Mr. Turner. ''People watch music television for music, not to see somebody jabbering away.'' Mr. Turner will also run half as many commercials as MTV - about four minutes each hour. Country-Music Performers In its program selection, Cable Music Channel will present recording artists who get little or no play on MTV - country-music performers such as Willie Nelson and Dolly Parton, and pop singers such as Julio Iglesias, Frank Sinatra and Diana Ross. However, Scott Sassa, vice president and general manager for Cable Music Channel, said that about 80 percent of the service's selections will duplicate MTV. The new MTV channel, VH-1, will aim more specifically at an older audience - aged 25 to 54 - than the current service, said Robert W. Pittman, executive vice president of MTV Networks. ''We will have a coalition of soft rock, soft rhythm and blues, more popular country music and the soft side of the top 40,'' he said. ''Only in the last category will there be some duplication.'' To achieve success with his new channel, Mr. Turner may have an uphill fight, in the view of cable experts. He faces an entrenched, powerful and now profitable opponent available to 22 million households with cable. He is also seeking a wider audience than MTV, which appeals primarily to teen-agers and young adults. Unless he can attract a substantial number of those younger viewers - which are for the most part not reached by conventional television - analysts say he may have trouble attracting enough advertising revenue. 'Calculated Gamble' ''MTV has a running head start,'' said Edward Atorino, an analyst at the investment firm of Smith Barney. ''I wonder if Mr. Turner is starting too far behind. MTV has become almost a generic term, and I don't think he is offering anything that is that different. He is taking a calculated gamble and I am doubtful there is enough to go around.'' Mr. Turner, who also owns the 24- hour Cable News Network and WTBS, a national cable-entertainment channel, is undeterred by the obstacles. ''Video is here to stay and we want to be in it,'' he said in an interview yesterday. Indeed, reports have recently circulated in the cable industry that Mr. Turner's company, Turner Broadcasting System Inc., has been negotiating to buy MTV's parent company, MTV Networks Inc., two-thirds of which is owned by Warner Amex Cable Communications, a joint venture of Warner Communications Inc. and the American Express Company. When asked about the reports, Mr. Turner declined to comment. Mr. Turner said he views Cable Music Channel as a healthy alternative to MTV. ''We think we will get a lot of young people and some older people too,'' he said. ''We think when given the opportunity they will turn from the violence and sadism of MTV.'' Mr. Turner said he objected primarily to MTV's video clips of heavy-metal rock groups, citing specifically a video called ''We're Not Going to Take It'' by Twisted Sister, in which a boy throws his father out his apartment window after the father asks the son to turn down the radio. 'Strict Standards' One MTV executive who requested anonymity called Mr. Turner's accusation ''a baloney issue. We have strict standards.'' Unlike MTV, which charges cable operators a fee of about 10 to 15 cents for each subscriber, Cable Music Channel will be offered free for five years. The new MTV channel, VH-1, will also be free. While his lack of fees may give Mr. Turner an advantage over MTV, he concedes that MTV's clout with the record companies could be some disadvantage. Over the past several months, MTV has agreed to pay five major record companies - CBS, MCA, RCA, Geffen and Polygram - about $4.6 million in return for exclusive use of selected videos for a period of six months before they appear on any competing cable channel. Among the artists included in these agreements are Paul McCartney, Steve Perry, Elton John and Culture Club - all of whom would fit in with Mr. Turner's format. Mr. Turner said, ''I don't like their exclusivity. But we'll get started and see how it goes. We'll get adequate material.'' With the addition of the two new video services, there will now be five national cable-music channels available, including The Nashville Network, a country music channel, and Black Entertainment Television, which primarily offers black performers. ''I think this is analagous to radio,'' said Mr. Turner. ''Certainly there is room for three channels, and maybe five.'' Mr. Pittman is not so sure. ''I don't think there is room for two reaching the same audience,'' he said. ''Music is a newcomer to television and ranks down the list of interests. People would really rather watch a movie. It's tough enough for one channel to compete against that.''

980-> THE CITY; UNSCHEDULED TRIP FOR SUBWAY RIDERS
The Transit Authority said yesterday that a subway motorman took about 80 passengers on an unscheduled ride Monday evening after they had refused to get off a train being taken out of service. The motorman acted correctly, the authority said, when he switched lines and took the riders several miles off their route. He was compelled to clear the rail for trains backed up behind him, the man's supervisor said. The supervisor, Alfred Broderick, chief transportation officer for subways, said he had not yet interviewed the conductor, who one rider said had cursed the passengers over the loudspeaker while the train went off course. Mr. Broderick said the motorman had denied this and had contended that it was the passengers who swore at the crew. The incident began Monday at 5:45 P.M. at the West 34th Street station in Manhattan when a southbound D train was ordered out of service because of a problem with its door indicator lights. Passengers were let off at the Second Avenue station on the F line.

983-> Cancer and Contraceptives: Study Confirms Lack of Link
Additional studies confirm a preliminary 1983 report that oral contraceptives do not cause breast cancer, the national Centers for Disease Control reported today. The Federal agency said further analysis of the data from a cancer and steroid hormone study showed that use of ''high progestogen'' oral contraceptives before age 25 does not increase a woman's risk of developing breast cancer before age 37. In addition, use of oral contraceptives before first full-term pregnancy does not increase a woman's risk of breast cancer before age 45, the agency said. These conclusions, the Centers for Disease Control reported, were the same as those shown in the earlier report that ''suggested that there is no association between oral contraceptive use and breast cancer.''

984-> AROUND THE WORLD; Marcos Daughter Calls The Palace a 'Snake Pit'
A daughter of President Ferdinand E. Marcos who represents her family's district in the National Assembly today called the presidential palace ''a snake pit'' and said abuses had been committed by people close to her family. But Imee Marcos Manotoc, 29 years old, said it was difficult for her father to end the abuses, saying, ''It is not easy to fire all these people.'' She denied reports that he is seriously ill, saying he suffers only from asthma. Mrs. Manotoc told a small group of reporters that it was too early to judge if her father's martial-law experiment had failed. ''History will judge whether Western democracy is suitable to our society and will put the Marcos regime in perspective,'' she said, adding that Filipinos should not seek Western models to solve their problems. She acknowledged there were political detainees in the Philippines and said she had interceded for a couple of them. She blamed the country's problems on the International Monetary Fund. ''A good case can be made that these I.M.F. prescriptions got us into trouble in the first place,'' she said.

Slightly more than half of the women passed the exam. About 51 percent of the nearly 20,000 applicants taking the exam were members of minority groups or women. The exam was created by the Educational Testing Service in Princeton, N.J., under an agreement reached between the county and the Justice Department. The department had accused the county of discrimination in its police hiring policies.

About 2,000 protesters, led by members of the family of Benigno S.

The march and a rally that followed were reactions to steep increases in the cost of living and education caused by devaluation of the peso. The protest brought together militant and moderate opposition groups that had differed sharply over the May 14 elections to Parliament. Some boycotted the election and others voted. Also taking part were students led by Leandro Alejandro, who said enrollment in colleges and universities this term was down by 50 percent because of the economic situation.

988-> AROUND THE WORLD; Portugal to Hold Rebel Incommunicado 20 Days
Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho, a Portuguese revolutionary leader arrested in a Government drive on suspected urban guerrillas, will be kept incommunicado for 20 days, his wife said today. The 47-year-old lieutenant colonel, twice a candidate for President, is being held in prison near Lisbon. He was among 42 people seized since Tuesday in a drive against a group calling itself the Popular Forces of April 25. The date refers to the 1974 armed forces revolution that restored democracy in Portugal. Colonel Carvalho was operational commander of the armed forces coup and later one of three people heading the Communist-dominated Government after the revolution. Associates deny he is connected with the Popular Forces group, which has said it was responsibile for a series of bombings in the last four years.

990-> 'Geography Illiteracy' Is Assailed by 2 Groups
Test results that show about 20 percent of American students cannot find the United States on a world map means the nation is producing ''widespread geography illiteracy,'' two education groups said today. A report by the National Council for Geographic Education and the Association of American Geographers, both private groups, also said that among students in eight industrialized nations tested in geography, young Americans ranked fourth. Bob Aangeenbru, executive director of the geographers' association, said the report cites 1983 tests in geography, science and math that The Dallas Times-Herald administered to 12-year- olds in eight nations. The tests, developed for the newspaper by four prominent educators, were given to sixth graders in the Dallas area and in Australia, Canada, Britain, France, Japan, Sweden and Switzlerand. The Swedish students received the top scores in the geography test. American students ranked fourth. Mr. Aangeenbrug said that the results of the tests demonstrates a ''widespread geography illiteracy'' in the United States. More than 20 percent of the American students could not locate the United States on a world map, the report said. The report also said that in a recent college-level survey of global understanding by the Educational Testing Service of 3,000 American undergraduates, the median score was 42.9 out of a possible 101. ''Certainly, there are many reasons for this illiteracy,'' Mr. Aangeenbrug said. ''But the main reason is simply that geography is just not taught in this country.''

992-> CREDIT MARKETS; LONG-TERM BONDS FALL A POINT
Long-term bond prices, which have been fluctuating widely day to day, fell about a point yesterday in lackluster trading. By late in the day, prices of Treasury securities due in more than 10 years were lower by about a point. There were smaller losses for shorter-term issues. Among recent issues, the 13 1/4 percent bonds due in 2014 were offered at 98 10/32, down about a point, to yield 13.48 percent. As recently as May 30, the bellwether bond traded at 94 22/32, to yield 14 percent, while on Monday it traded for about 99 7/8, to yield 13.27 percent. Among other recent issues, the 13 7/8 percent notes due in 1989 were offered at 101 5/8, down about 5/8 point, to yield 13.38 percent. Treasury Bill Rates Rates on Treasury bills rose modestly, except for issues due in three months or less, which are in demand among cautious investors seeking liquid investments that would not be hurt by fighting in the Middle East or a banking crisis. The rate on three-month bills fell to 9.72 percent, from 9.76 percent, while rates rose about a tenth of a percentage point for longer-term issues. In advance of today's auction of new one-year Treasury bills, the outstanding one-year issue was bid at 10.80 percent. ''The lack of meaningful interest by investors was the main reason for the weakness in prices,'' said Maria F. Ramirez, a financial economist at A. G. Becker Paribas Inc. In addition to the weaker-than-desired investor demand, securities dealers said buying by speculators has dropped sharply the past two days. Overnight Bank Rate Rises Some traders may have been discouraged, they said, by an increase in the overnight rate for bank loans to an estimated 10.85 percent yesterday, with a 12 percent rate in late afternoon trading. After averaging 10.30 percent in the week ended May 30, the overnight funds rate has averaged about 10.7 percent in the latest week. Because yesterday was the last day of a two-week bank accounting period, when the rate for Federal funds often moves erratically, analysts said the higher rate was not evidence that the Federal Reserve has decided to make reserves more available to the banking system. Higher yields than those on Treasury issues were available on the $152.7 million issue of collateralized mortgage bonds of the American Southwest Financial Corporation, a Phoenix-based company created by home builders. The bonds are backed by mortgage pass-through securities of the Government National Mortgage Association and conventional home mortgages. Like previous issues of collateralized mortgage bonds, interest is paid twice a year, while principal payments are applied to bonds with the shortest maturity. When the shortest-term bonds are retired, principal payments are applied to the bonds with the next longest maturity. 13 Percent Bonds at 99 5/8 Underwriters led by the First Boston Corporation offered 13 percent bonds with a final maturity in 1990 and an estimated average maturity of 2.4 years at a price of 99 5/8, to yield 13.19 percent. They also offered 13 1/2 percent bonds due in 1993 with a 5.4- year average maturity at 97 5/8, to yield 14.15 percent. The 13 1/2 percent bonds due in 1996 with an 8.3-year average maturity were offered at 95 29/32, to yield 14.36 percent, while the 13 1/2 percent issue due in 2014 with a 20.7-year average maturity were offered at 84 6/32, to yield 14.74 percent. The yield on the 2.4-year American Southwest bonds was higher by half a percentage point than the Treasury issues. The 5.4-year issue offered an additional 75 basis points, rising to 90 basis points for the 8.3-year bonds and to 125 basis points for the 20.7-year bonds. A basis point equals one-hundredth of a percentage point. Utility Registers Offering Elsewhere in the corporate market, the Puget Sound Power and Light Company, based in Bellevue, Wash., filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the sale of a $75 million issue of extendable bonds. The underwriters are led by Salomon Brothers. The issue would be the first of its kind by an electric utility in the corporate bond market, and should allow the company to raise funds at an initial interest rate lower than for fixed- rate, long-term bonds. For utilites rated Baa-2, such as Puget Sound, investment bankers estimated long- term bonds at about 15 3/4 percent. Extendable bonds are issues with a fixed interest rate for a few years. When the rate is adjusted at stated intervals, investors may redeem their notes at par. New to Corporate Market While extendable issues by electric utilities are new to the corporate market, they are well known in the tax-exempt sector. Most recently, a $160 million financing by the Union Electric Company, St. Louis, was arranged through the Missouri State Environmental Improvement and Energy Resources Authority. The 8 5/8 percent bonds have a final maturity of 2014, and are offered by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets at a price of 99 1/2, to yield 8.81 percent to June 1, 1987. Beginning in 1987, and annually thereafter, investors may redeem their bonds at a price of par, or continue to hold the issue at an interest rate to be announced. To assure investors that funds will be available, $80 million of the bonds are backed by a Citibank letter of credit and rated Aaa/AAx, while $80 million of bonds are backed by a Chemical Bank letter of credit and rated Aaa/AA. Despite the slight difference in rating, both issues are offered at the same price.

994-> BRIDGE
Bridge:Montreal Expert Achieved The Ultimate in Last Bows If he could choose, any bridge expert would like to have a long career and end it on a high note with a victory in the last tournament. Among those who have achieved this, nobody has ever done so more dramatically than the late Sam Gold, long known in Montreal as Mr. Bridge. He was playing with his regular partner, Aaron Goodman, in a men's pair event. Going into the final round, Gold and Goodman trailed the leaders by 20 points, although they did not know it. With 24 the maximum on the round, their chance of victory would normally have been minuscule. But chance decreed that they would play the leaders, Joe Silver and Harold Goldstein, and every point was doubly important. Silver reported the proceedings for the Canadian magazine Melange de Bridge. How the First Deal Went On the first deal, a hypermodern convention backfired. A weak no- trump opening was doubled, and the opener was required to redouble. The bidding ended, and Gold and Goodman took seven tricks in defense for 400 and a top score. On the second deal, Silver and Goldstein did too much bidding on a competitive hand. Playing at the six- level, they suffered a 700-point penalty: another zero. The third deal is shown in the diagram. East-West reached a two-heart contract, which would have made an overtrick. But Gold, braving unfavorable vulnerability, balanced with three diamonds. West thought he had the right hand to try for a 200 penalty, to recover some of the ground lost on the previous two deals. South found a heavenly dummy, with every card pulling its weight. The double made it fairly easy to play West for the trump jack, and that gave North-South 670. It was only a small improvement for East-West - half a match point instead of the usual zero. So Gold took the gold. And Silver had to be content with the silver. The Westchester Summer Tournament begins today at the Y.W.C.A., 515 North Street, White Plains, with the following schedule: Today - Men's pairs and women's pairs, 1:30 P.M.; mixed pairs, 8:30 P.M.

997-> IN ISRAEL, EVEN SHARON'S WORST ENEMIES AREN'T FRIENDS OF TIME
As his libel case against Time magazine unfolds in a courtroom in the United States, some of Ariel Sharon's countrymen find themselves caught between two impulses. On one hand, Mr. Sharon's opponents in Israel - and they are many - would not mind seeing Time defeat him in court because they feel this would leave standing unchallenged the verdict of the Israeli commission of inquiry that he was indirectly responsible for the massacre of Palestinian civilians by Christian Phalangists in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in Lebanon. On the other hand, there is an equally pervasive sentiment here that Time has been unfair to Mr. Sharon and indirectly to Israel. Many of Mr. Sharon's worst enemies, not to mention his supporters, would love to see the famous general slay the dragon of American journalism right in its own backyard. ''There is a feeling among many people that this trial is the right cause, against the right medium, but not necessarily by the right man,'' said Ehud Olmert, a Likud Member of Parliament who has testified against Time. ''But even Sharon's worst enemies say they would rather face the political consequences of his success than his defeat because ultimately every Israeli believes that what Time said was not accurate.'' There is still enormous bitterness among Israelis over what they perceive to have been biased coverage of their 1982 invasion of Lebanon. Letters to the editor run regularly in the Israeli press complaining about the American reporting two years ago. The Sharon trial is seen by many Israelis as their chance to get even. 'Slanders' Against Israel ''Success of Sharon at the trial will refute many slanders against the State of Israel and the people of Israel,'' Justice Minister Moshe Nissim, a member of the Likud bloc, told the Israeli radio the other day. There are 20,000 subscribers here to Time's international edition. For some Israelis, the magazine has come to embody all the evils and all the perceived shortcomings of Western news coverage of Israel - even though its own reporting may have been sound. ''Time is so disliked here that it has the capacity to make people who despise Sharon want him to win,'' said Zeev Chafetz, a former head of the Israeli Government Press Office and the author of a book attacking American reporting on the Middle East. Mr. Chafetz cited what he described as Time's frequently negative, and even incorrect, portrayals of former Prime Minister Menachem Begin and what he called the magazine's often indulgent attitude toward the Palestine Liberation Organization as reasons its coverage is so unpopular here. Mr. Sharon sued Time Inc. for libel after it reported in February 1983 that he discussed with Christian Phalangist militia leaders, shortly before their massacre, the need to avenge the assassination of Lebanon's President- elect, Bashir Gemayel. Time said it had based its story in part on a secret appendix to the report of the Kahan Commission Inquiry, the Israeli investigation of the massacre. Several Israeli politicians - from Mr. Olmert on the right to Yossi Sarid on the left - have read the classified Appendix B and have said publicly that it does not mention the point attributed to it by Time. Those assertions have reinforced the Israeli public's perception that on this specific issue Time was wrong and Sharon right. All the Israeli newspapers print daily reports on the proceedings in the Manhattan courtroom, reports that tend to be in line with each paper's attitude about Mr. Sharon. On Dec. 6, both the left of center Haaretz and the right of center Maariv described the testimony of Time's Jerusalem correspondent, David Halevy, concerning the huge Aug. 12, 1982, Israeli air strikes on Beirut. Haaretz described the scene this way: ''Deathly silence prevailed this morning in the courtroom when in a monotone Halevy described in detail what he saw. The jurors listened transfixed to Halevy's story and the feeling among observers was that this was David Halevy's day.'' Maariv described the very same testimony, saying: ''The atmosphere in the court was one of exhaustion when Time correspondent Halevy continued giving evidence and described the period of heavy bombing of Beirut. Three of the ten members of the jury fell asleep and even the judge, Abraham Sofaer, yawned just before the noon break.'' Paying Sharon's Expenses The trial has spawned its own controversy here over the fact that the national unity Government led by Prime Minister Shimon Peres paid for the flights of Mr. Sharon and his wife to New York and for their hotel expenses since the trial began. The Cabinet is treating Mr. Sharon as though he were on official business in connection with his role as Minister of Industry and Trade. Cabinet sources say the truth of the matter is that neither Mr. Peres, the Labor Party leader, nor Yitzhak Shamir, the Likud leader, wanted to challenge Mr. Sharon when he asked to go to New York for the trial and official business, which has already lasted five weeks. Mr. Peres did not want to risk exploding his fragile national unity Cabinet over the matter and Mr. Shamir did not want to antagonize Mr. Sharon or give him ammunition to use in what is expected to be an eventual showdown between the two men over the Likud leadership. ''Sharon is so much of an aggressive bully, people don't want to fight with him,'' Yosef Goell, a leading political commentator, said. ''It is too unpleasant.'' That does not apply to Mr. Sharon's staunchest critics, who believe that his trial has served only to dredge up the worst of Israel's past - solely for Mr. Sharon's personal gain and at the people's expense. ''Sharon has claimed that the State of Israel is on trial but he did not ask the country, or the Government,'' Police Minister Haim Bar-Lev, a member of the Labor Party, said in an interview with Haaretz.

999-> CURRENCY MARKETS ; Dollar Mostly Higher While Gold Prices Drop
The dollar was mostly higher yesterday as currency traders looked for clues on the course of interest rates in the United States. Gold prices retreated. The Canadian dollar recovered slightly, but continued to hover near its all-time low. In Montreal, the Canadian dollar nudged up to 76.88 cents in United States currency, from 76.85 cents Tuesday. The record low of 77.79 cents was set on June 29, 1982. Gold closed at $392.25 an ounce ounce in late trading at the Republic National Bank in New York, down $2.25 from the late bid Tuesday. Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar continued to be supported by a rise in interest rates in the United States and worries about the threat posed to world oil supplies by the war between Iran and Iraq. High interest rates in the United States have made returns attractive on dollar-denominated investments, drawing funds from other countries. The dollar began the trading day by rising to 231.10 Japanese yen in Tokyo, up from 229.25 yen on Tuesday. By day's end in the United States, the dollar stood at 231.075 yen, up from 230.325 late Tuesday. In London, the dollar fell against the British pound as sterling rose to $1.4005, from $1.39655 on Tuesday. But later in New York, sterling rose to $1.3960, from 1.3930 late Tuesday. Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Tuesday, included: 2.6755 West German marks, unchanged; 2.2387 Swiss francs, up from 2.2295; 8.2675 French francs, up from 8.2325; 3.0315 Dutch guilders, up from 3.0195; 1,666.25 Italian lire, up from 1,662.00, and 1.30055 Canadian dollars, up from 1.29965. Late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates Tuesday, included: 2.6895 marks, up from 2.6855; 2.2305 Swiss francs, down from 2.2325; 8.2750 French francs, up from 8.270, and 1.30095 Canadian dollars, down from 1.30155. Gold closed in Hong Kong at $393.22 an ounce, down from $394.74 on Tuesday. Bullion retreated from a 12-week high of $394 an ounce Tuesday in both Zurich and London, slipping to $391.50 in Zurich and $391.25 in London. Later on the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery fell $2, to close at $392.70 a troy ounce.

1000-> Dining Out Guide: Ice Cream and Sherbet Desserts
Following is a summary of reviews of restaurants that have appeared in The New York Times. Stars are followed by the date of original publication. Prices are current, and only weekend hours are given. DARBAR, 44 West 56th Street (432-7227) vv (Nov. 25, 1983). One of the city's most visually appealing and exotic restaurants, with woven wall hangings and dramatic hammered-copper plaques. Everything is designed to help the diner concentrate on the Indian food. After spicy fare, such desserts as kulfi ice cream, like frozen halvah, and mango ice cream, with the true taste of mangoes, offer refreshment. A la carte, $9.50 to $16.75. Fridays, noon to 3 and 5:30 to 11:30 P.M.; Saturdays, brunch, noon to 3 and 5:30 to 11:30 P.M., and Sundays, brunch, noon to 3 and 5:30 to 11 P.M. DELICES LA COTE BASQUE AT OLYMPIC TOWER, 1 Olympic Tower, Fifth Avenue and 51st Street (935-2220) v (Nov. 27, 1981). A modern version of the covered-street concept that inspired Milan's Galleria, the Olympic Tower setting is enhanced by a waterfall and tall boxed trees. On the street level, Delices operates a retail pastry shop, a convivial bar and Le Cafe, a terrace area with bright tablecloths and an attractive menu offering breakfast, light lunches and snacks, and specials at $7 to $14. Downstairs is La Cascade, a full-fledged restaurant that looks out on a waterfall. Many dishes in La Cascade are also served at Le Cafe, among them an irresistible frozen parfait of mocha ice cream in espresso coffee with whipped cream. Le Cafe, Fridays, 8 A.M. to 10:30 P.M.; Saturdays, 9 A.M. to 8 P.M. LA GAULOISE, 502 Avenue of the Americas, at 13th Street (691-1363) vv (Nov. 21, 1980). With its mirrored panels, dark-wood trim, Art Deco lighting fixtures and capacious banquettes, this charming restaurant offers polished service and some excellent food. Stars on the dessert menu include either an ice cream bombe, mellow with praline, or any of the seasonal fruit sherbets. A la carte, $12 to $18. Fridays, noon to 3 and 5:45 to 11:30 P.M.; Saturday, brunch, noon to 3 P.M. and 5:45 to 11:30 P.M., and Sundays, noon to 4 and 5:45 to 11 P.M. HUBERT'S, 102 East 22d Street (673-3711) vv (Nov. 13, 1981). Each culinary detail is given the most careful thought and execution, and everything looks, tastes and is homemade. The culinary style is new American in the best sense of the term, borrowing freely from European cooking traditions combined with native influences. Cases in point can be found in the dessert department, where there is a Mexican chocolate ice cream, almond praline ice cream and vanilla enclosing mango sherbet and raspberry puree. A blood- orange sherbet is served with the spark of mint. Prix-fixe, $38.50. Fridays, noon to 3 and 6 to 10:30 P.M.; Saturdays, 6 to 10:30. QUILTED GIRAFFE, 955 Second Avenue, at 51st Street (753-5355) vvvv (Jan. 20, 1984). Two dining rooms, the downstairs in a French Art Deco style with beautifully appointed tables and masses of flowers, the upstairs a romantic French moderne. Choosing from Barry Wine's engaging menu is so difficult that it is best to go with a large party, or order the menu degustation. However, there is no question about the greatest indulgence on the dessert menu, which carries a $10 supplement: the grand dessert, selected by the captain to complement dinners, includes chocolaty waffles with rich homemade vanilla ice cream and strips of candied orange peel, a pecan square with coffee ice cream, ginger custard with fresh fruits, chocolate chip cookies and chocolate mousse. Another special, Mocha Fantasy ($7.50), is a hot chocolate souffle with a scoop of coffee ice cream inside. On the regular menu is an apple and apricot strudel baked to order and topped with cinnamon ice cream. Prix-fixe dinner, $60. Fridays, 5:45 to 10:15 P.M. RESTAURANT RAPHAEL, 33 West 54th Street (582-8993) v (June 4, 1982). A tiny and luxurious outpost with a chateau atmosphere, where the menu has a nouvelle cuisine bent. The more successful dishes include warm foie gras of duck, sauteed salmon and tender steamed rack of lamb scented with thyme. For dessert, it would be hard to surpass grapefruit sherbet for freshness and coolness. There is also a parfait with passion fruit and cassis sauce. A la carte, $19.50 to $27. Fridays, noon to 2 and 6 to 9:30 P.M. SPARKS STEAKHOUSE, 210 East 46th Street (687-4855) v (May 11, 1984). An old-fashioned type steakhouse where the likes of clams and oysters on the half-shell, a spectacular veal chop and crunchy, crisp hash browns could be followed with the restaurant's tartuffo. Chocolate coating on a ball of chocolate and vanilla ice cream, the center stuffed with a candied cherry and toasted almonds, it is an exceptional rendition of that simple dessert. A la carte, $14.95 to $23.95. Fridays, noon to 11:30; Saturdays, 5 to 11:30 P.M. TUCANO, 333 East 60th Street (308-5353) vv (Aug. 6, 1982). There is a festive, distinctively Brazilian stylishness about Tucano, the posh and pleasant restaurant that adjoins Club A, the private disco club. Polished dark wood, mirrors and striped-velvet upholstery add to the handsome effect, and illumination comes from lighting fixtures shaped like the fruit that used to be piled on Carmen Miranda's hats. The menu is nouvelle cuisine to the core, and most of the dishes are light, delicate and attractively turned out. Among desserts is an unusual iced melon sabayon with port sauce. A la carte prix-fixe at $42. Fridays and Saturdays, 7 to 11:30 P.M. What the stars mean, page C20. * Revisited in the last two years and rating is still valid * * Not reviewed within the last five years

1001-> I.M.F. Plan Denounced
Foreign Minister Arturo Tolentino said today that the conditions placed on a loan package by the International Monetary Fund would drive the Philippines deeper into debt. Mr. Tolentino called the conditions a new kind of ''colonialism'' that makes it almost impossible for nations to pay their debts. His attack came as President Ferdinand E. Marcos's Government was conducting negotiations with the I.M.F. and foreign banks on a $4 billion rescue package.

1003-> ART: LINSKY COLLECITON OF PAINTINGS AND OBJECTS OPENS AT MET
The opening this week of the new Jack and Belle Linsky Galleries at the Metropolitan Museum celebrates yet another remarkable acquisition in bulk for this capacious institution: 373 objects - including old-master paintings, French furniture, bronzes, porcelains, enamels, goldsmiths' work and jewelry. They were donated in 1982 by Belle Linsky, who, with her late husband, Jack, built a modest stationery business into a multimillion-dollar corporation that included Swingline Inc., a manufacturer of staplers. Buying by eye, with little or no professional advice, the discerning Linskys made many marvelous purchases - and their share of bad ones, too - pressing hard for what they wanted. Over the course of 40 years, they developed what is essentially a cabinet collection of small and beautiful objects, by such names as Rubens, Carlo Crivelli, Giovanni di Paolo, Andrea del Sarto and Lucas Cranach in painting; Andre-Charles Boulle, Jean-Francois Oeben, Charles Cressent and David Roentgen in furniture, and Meissen, Mennecy, Capodimonte and Nymphenburg in porcelains, a major area of the Linsky holdings. The Met has created for this largesse a handsome if stuffy installation, in the form of an intimate setting suggesting a regally appointed private home. The works are deployed through seven roomlike galleries, whose formal design scheme (including damask-covered walls) was hatched by the interior decorators Henri Samuel and Harold Eberhart, to fit a plan evolved by Olga Raggio, chairman of European sculpture and decorative arts at the museum, and other curators. The installation was paid for by ''a substantial grant'' from the museum's Dillon Fund, established by its former chairman, Douglas Dillon. Whether it ought to be a separate installation, however, is another question. No doubt about it, there are some breathtaking objects here. They include, among 47 paintings by Italian, Flemish and French masters, the earliest known work by Rubens, his sensitively modeled ''Portrait of a Man,'' from 1597, painted on copper; a ''Madonna and Child'' (1472) on gold ground with tooling (considerably restored), by the Venetian Carlo Crivelli; a superb little ''Adoration of the Magi,'' circa 1460, by the Sienese Giovanni di Paolo, and a tiny but compelling panel, ''Marriage Feast at Cana,'' circa 1504, by the Flemish artist Juan de Flandes. An eloquently exalted account of humanity is given in another ''Adoration of the Magi,'' attributed to the 16th-century Fleming Gerard David. And a panel painting, ''Presentation in the Temple,'' represents the most important work yet to surface by an unknown 15th- century Italian, who has been formally styled ''Master of the Linsky Presentation in the Temple.'' One of the liveliest entries among the small group of medieval objects is a little 12th-century German brass of a monk scribe sitting backward on a dragon, its tail supporting the book in which he writes. Standouts in a group of 35 small bronze sculptures and utensils from the Renaissance and Baroque periods include a raunchy- looking ''Satyr,'' circa 1510-20, by the Italian sculptor nicknamed Antico; a stirring relief plaque, ''Christ Bearing the Cross,'' from Florence, dated about the middle of the 17th century, and an odd but delightful German portrayal of two nude women wrestling, also from the mid-17th century. Some dates and attributions in the jewelry and goldsmith's work have been downgraded since the Linsky gift was announced two years ago, most notably for what a viewer was heard to describe as ''the two killer chotchkas'' of the collection. One is a ewer, whose bowl of smoky crystal was made in Prague in the 17th century, but whose mounts, of enameled gold set with diamonds, are now attributed to 19th-century craftsmen in London. Never mind; it's still a handsome piece. The other, a kitschy extravaganza of a footed cup, in gold paved with jewels, was purportedly commissioned by the King of Sicily in 1595 (so states its Latin inscription). But it is now recognized as a 19th-century European concoction. Other attractions in this group include a beautiful little gold-mounted carnelian cup, once owned by Louis XIV; some 19th- century pendants in which large pearls form human torsos, and a very elaborate gold chinoiserie clock by the 18th-century English jeweler James Cox in the form of a chariot carrying a grande dame and her dog. Choice works of French 18th-century furniture are a Louis XVI sofa with a single seat facing outward at either end, by Claude I Sene; a marble-top commode from Versailles marquetried with Italian comedy scenes by David Roentgen, and a much more imperious commode, veneered in tortoise shell and brass with elaborate gilt-bronze mounts, by Andre-Charles Boulle. Among the embarrassment of porcelain riches is a rare Russian group of two dozen figures made in the 1780's at the Imperial Porcelain Manufactory in St. Petersburg, depicting Russian national types. The Linsky donation represents another rich chapter in the Met's long history of relationships with collectors - relationships without which, needless to say, neither it nor most other American museums would have developed. Strong collectors who have worked hard to assemble their holdings naturally want to see their names in lights, so to speak, at the mighty Met. But in accepting the Linsky donation, the Met has brought under its wing, as it did with the Robert Lehman collection, yet another enclave of restricted holdings - restricted in that, contractually, they must be kept together in perpetuity and cannot be integrated with the museum's general chronological survey of art history. It has been argued that the Linsky collection should have such a cameo presentation because of its very intimate and ''personal'' quality. And the museum has taken care to place the Linsky galleries near ''cognate'' material: European decorative arts and the Wrightsman rooms of French furniture. Yet, in the case of many of these works, separating them from the historical contexts in which they would normally be placed diminishes their educational value. The Carlo Crivelli painting, for instance, is the center of an altarpiece of which two lateral panels are on view upstairs in the Met's Italian galleries. Wouldn't it be more advantageous to viewers if it were seen in this context? Or to give, say, the marvelous ''Portrait of a Member of the vom Rhein Family,'' by the scarcely known 16th-century German painter Conrad Faber von Creuznach, the benefit of placement among its German peers? Not to belittle these rare and beautiful objects, nor the Linsky commitment to the museum, we are entitled to wonder why the powerful Metropolitan continues to take donated collections with the proviso that they be housed in separate galleries. Also of interest this week: Alison Saar and Rod Rhodes (Monique Knowlton Gallery, 153 Mercer Street): Playing sophisticatedly at folk art, Alison Saar, a young artist from Los Angeles, deals with wild dogs, conjure men and street operators. She represents them in voodoo- ish wall icons, fetish figures and larger floor pieces deliberately made of ordinary materials - sticks, rags, plaster and found objects. Despite their dej a vu derivation, she brings to them her own touch, particularly the wall plaques, poignant little shrines to neighborhood saints and sinners. Take ''Venus,'' for example, a nude cut out of tin with protruding breasts but modestly holding a fan over her pubic area and backed by a clumsy wooden shell, or ''Street Smart,'' a bare-chested black man with blue lips and moveable eyes, his head topped by a green hat, all cut out of tin and votively framed in junky brass strips. Grim dolls are also in evidence, among them ''Stoic Valentine,'' an unhappy-looking girl carved in wood, holding up the skirt of her weathered gray tin dress as if about to curtsy, and ''Wild Chile,'' a small, fetishy wooden figure with a hinged opening in its chest, witchy black hair and tin stigmata on its face and torso. Her larger floor pieces lack the inspired deviltry of the smaller ones. Still, this is a bright debut. Mysterious mini-architectural spaces are the province of Rod Rhodes, who shows three strange white interiors boxed in Plexiglas, all versions of a generic theme titled ''House of the Deer.'' In one, looking through various openings, the viewer encounters doorways piled with ritualistic rubble - pots and deer antlers - and gets tantalizing glimpses of empty rooms, one with a baroque relief wall piece topped by a deer's head, another with a series of television monitors and a blown-up image of a deer's head projected on a wall. In quite a different mood is the deep, white, chilling maw of an ultramodern prison. Suspended from a catwalk is a huge, double- sided television monitor, bearing imagery that could reflect the fantasies of inmates. Maybe metaphors for the rational self and its archetypal yearnings, these tiny structures play cleverly on the imagination. (Both through July 13.)

1004-> AROUND THE NATION; Court Told Coast Mayor Received Illegal Funds
Mayor Roger Hedgecock, beginning his new administration in court facing felony conspiracy and perjury charges, was accused today of setting up a brokerage concern to hide illegal campaign contributions. Albert O'Brien, the former president of J. David Mercantile, testified at the Republican Mayor's trial that the concern was a virtual front for Mayor Hedgecock's campaign activity. The subsidiary ''was set up as a precinct organization and a laundry,'' Mr. O'Brien said, speaking of trying to hide the source of money. ''When I complained, I was told that that was the way Nancy Hoover wanted it.'' Mrs. Hoover was one of the principals in J. David & Company, an investment firm that went into bankruptcy last February, leaving $60 million in investors' funds missing.

1005-> BANACH TWINS GRAPPLE WITH THEIR PROBLEMS
It happened during the first-round qualifying here last month for the United States Olympic freestyle wrestling team. Lou Banach banged heads with Greg Gibson in their 220-pound match. Banach came away with a bleeding 2-inch gash above his right eye. He bandaged the wound himself during a timeout, and the match resumed. Banach led by 4-0 with 48 seconds left. Rather than risk losing by taking the offensive, he chose to keep butting heads with Gibson. This made perfect sense to Lou Banach but not to his twin brother, Ed, who had claimed the 198-pound title and was standing at the edge of the mat watching Lou. Ed threw up his arms and declared to the rafters: ''Great! Great! Now he's trying to butt heads some more. What does he want? To get hurt again? I do not believe it.'' Love and Estrangement This has been the story line of the Banachs' relationship the last 24 years: love and estrangement. They were survivors of a wrenching childhood in New Jersey, who came to the University of Iowa and flowered as wrestlers. But in the same wrestling room where they stropped their skills to national championship sharpness, they also fought each other with their fists. One particular melee disturbed practice for 10 minutes. Dan Gable, the Iowa coach and the Olympic wrestling coach, explained: ''It was the way they grew up. It's not as if they grew up pampered. Not in their whole lives were they pampered. If they wanted something, they had to fight for it - and that included the other brother.'' After Lou Banach defeated the top-seeded Gibson and went on to win the 220-pound title, Ed was the first to shake his brother's hand and clap his shoulder coming off the mat. ''Lou's headstrong,'' Ed said later. ''He doesn't listen to people. If it makes good sense to him, he'll do it. If not, he won't. He wanted to butt heads, so he butted heads.'' Said Lou: ''I heard yelling at me, sure. As usual, he didn't make much sense. Sometimes he forgets I know how to wrestle. He gets emotionally extended. But he cares so much that I can forget that.'' Lou Banach Clinches Berth After Iowa City, the Banachs entered the final round of freestyle trials this week in Allendale, Mich., top ranked at their weights. Each needed two victories against the No. 1 challenger in his division to clinch his first Olypmic berth. Lou made the team, taking two of three matches Wednesday at 220 from Dan Severn of Mesa, Ariz. Ed must wait until Saturday to wrestle for the 198-pound berth. The brothers each won national championships for Iowa in 1983 - Ed at 190 and Lou at heavyweight. It was the third national title for Ed, the second for Lou. They spent the last season learning the nuances of freestyle wrestling, the international style that is more wide open than the college one. Ed married a dental hygiene student at Iowa and earns money by working part-time as a self-described athletic department gofer. Lou, single, is a second lieutenant in the Army who is on temporary assignment here in order to train for the Olympics. Another brother, Steve, also is in the Army and wrestled for Iowa, but was eliminated in the first round of the qualifying here. One Is 'More Gung-Ho' Ed, whom Gable calls ''more gung-ho'' than Lou about wrestling, has traveled and competed in more freestyle tournaments than Lou. But Lou, according to Gable, didn't need as much competition because ''he just seems to pick things up easier.'' Nothing says more about the differences between the twins than their views of wrestling. Ed is devoted to the sport, so much that one of his former practice partners at Iowa says, ''It's life and death with him.'' Ed says, ''It's kind of neat, molding your body, getting into condition, trying to beat somebody else with what you've molded.'' Lou crowds his life with more than wrestling: He has written a soon-to-be-published book on Iowa wrestling titled ''The New Breed,'' and he reads and writes poetry. He says he will retire after the Olympics. ''I've ridden that horse for 14 years,'' he said, meaning wrestling. ''It's time to switch to another.'' Family Breakup After Fire The Banachs are fraternal twins, born 5 minutes apart, with Ed being the first born. When they were 2 years old, an electrical fire in the predawn darkness destroyed their home in Sussex County in New Jersey and, in some ways, their family as well. The family - 14 children and Warclaw and Genevieve Banach - made it to the safety of the front yard, but it was the last time the family would be together. Warclaw, a Polish immigrant who had met his German wife while escaping from a Nazi prisoner of war camp in World War II, abandoned the family. Most of the Banach children never saw him again, including Ed and Lou. He died in 1978. Mrs. Banach suffered a nervous breakdown, and for many years has lived in a nursing home. The children were scattered to foster homes, with Ed and Lou were deliberately kept together because they were twins. Within a year, Ed and Lou were given up by one couple, but taken in by another one, which also had taken another brother, Steve, who was 5. Ed and Lou were 4. The couple, Alan and Stephanie Tooley, had been married eight years and had given up on having children. They lived in a ranch house on an acre in Montague, N.J. Roughhousing Was Norm The boys, the Tooleys said, roughhoused with one another everywhere in the home. Alan Tooley, a railroad brakeman at the time, said: ''They had an adjustment problem. They were defiant, rebellious kids, and they blamed us for a lot of things that had happened to them. It took them a while to get over that.'' Stephanie, whom the boys affectionately nicknamed Sarge for her strictness, took care of the discipline, knowing the easy mark her husband presented. The Tooleys eventually adopted the three boys, who were granted their wish to keep the Banach surname. Said Stephanie: ''They were proud of the name. They didn't want it changed, and we respected that. What's in a name, anyway, was what we felt. Love is what you've got to have. Love is where it's at.'' 3 on Wrestling Scholarships Steve and the twins starred in football and wrestling in high school in Port Jervis, N.Y., after the family moved there. All three went to college on wrestling scholarships - Steve to Clemson (and later Iowa) and Ed to Lou to Iowa. Again, emotional storms broke. Lou quit the team and came back; the brothers tried various living arrangements with each other, only to split up; there were the occasional wrestling room fisticuffs. Lou was usually at the center of these blowouts. Twice, he said, he broke Ed's nose with a punch. ''I'm not proud of that,'' he said. ''I tend to get in a delirium sometimes. Stevie and Eddie keep their feelings inside, and I don't. Maybe I know more boxing than they do - or maybe they don't know enough. ''But I don't know what I'd do without them. I can't imagine life without them. I love my brothers. I'm very positive about that.''

1006-> USA Today Accused of Using Inaccurate Weather Forecast
USA Today used two-day-old weather conditions and passed them off as forecasts in its new international edition last week, the president of a private weather service testified today in a suit in Federal District Court. Joel Myers, president of Accu- Weather Inc., also testified that the newspaper twice represented in its foreign edition forecasts for the previous day as actual temperatures. Attorneys for the Gannett Company, publisher of USA Today, said the newspaper had stopped representing forecasts as actual temperatures. Accu-Weather, based in State College, supplies the information contained on the weather page of USA Today's domestic edition. The private weather service has filed a lawsuit against Gannett, charging that the use of inaccurate information has damaged Accu-Weather's reputation.

1010-> S.J. Popeil, Gadget Developer
Samuel J. Popeil, former head of the company that developed and manufactured such household gadgets as the Veg-O-Matic and Pocket Fisherman, which are advertised on late-night television, died Sunday at the age of 69. Mr. Popeil, who began as a product demonstrator at 17 and became chairman and chief executive officer of Popeil Bros. Inc., died in a hospital in Miami, where he had lived for four years, according to his son, Ron, who lives in the Chicago area. Several of Mr. Popeil's uncles were demonstrators who set up tables in department stores and hawked potato peelers and cheese slicers. At 17 he substituted for one. ''It was an ordeal,'' he recalled later. ''I had never spoken before an audience. The first day I cut my finger pretty badly.'' Mr. Popeil kept the job, growing to love it. He trained his younger brother, Raymond, and they founded Popeil Bros. in New York in 1939, moving the company to Chicago in 1941. The company trained demonstrators to sell vegetable slicers in department stores. The company entered television in the early days, buying off-hour advertising spots for as little as $7.50 a minute. By the 1960's and early 1970's, Popeil products saturated the market with ads for the Veg-O-Matic, Pocket Fisherman and Dial-O-Matic. The company developed its own products. Mr. Popeil said the idea for the collapsible Pocket Fisherman came to him after a boy with a fishing pole almost poked his eye out. The company sold two million Pocket Fishermen at $19.95 in 1973, the first full year the item was available. Ron Popeil eventually split off from the company and formed a competing company, Ronco, which has filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal bankruptcy code. Mr. Popeil suffered a severe heart attack in 1978, and in 1979 Popeil Bros. was sold. The survivors, in addition to his wife, Eloise, and son include two daughters. Services were held Wednesday in Asbury Park, N.J.

1011-> TV WEEKEND;
Stroke, a disease that afflicts more than a half-million North Americans each year, was long considered an inevitable ailment of old age that sequestered its victims in a closetlike world with little hope of rehabilitation. But ''Bring Back My Bonnie,'' on Channel 13 at 8 P.M. tomorrow, brings a ray of encouragement into the lives of stroke victims and of the relatives, friends and others who care for them. The sometimes heartening but occasionally depressing hourlong presentation, one of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's ''Nature of Things'' series, seeks to heighten public awareness of the plight of stroke sufferers and to show how they can be rehabilitated and returned to some measure of the life they once led. But it also points out that there is still little community or governmental support for adequate care or rehabilitation facilities. Videotapes of therapeutic methods used on patients in several Canadian medical and volunteer organizations are shown in vivid fashion. For those who have contact with stroke patients, ''Bring Back My Bonnie,'' named after one of the victims shown, can be most enlightening. And it is encouraging to note that it is expertly narrated by the actress Patricia Neal who, as many filmgoers are aware, was a victim of stroke.

1014-> TRANSCRIPT OF SPEECH BY REP. FERRARO ACCEPTING NOMINATION
Following is a transcript of Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro's speech last night accepting the Democratic Vice-Presidential nomination at the national convention, as recorded by The New York Times: Ladies and gentlemen of the convention - ladies and gentlemen of the convention - ladies and gentlemen of the convention, my name is Geraldine Ferraro, I stand before you to proclaim tonight: America is a land where dreams can come true for all of us. As I stand before the American people and think of the honor this great convention has bestowed upon me, I recall the words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who made America stronger by making America more free. He said: ''Occasionally in life there are moments which cannot be completely explained by words. Their meaning can only be articulated by the inaudible language of the heart.'' Tonight is such a moment for me. My heart is filled with pride. My fellow citizens, I proudly accept your nomination for Vice President of the United States. And - you're wonderful. And - And - And I am proud to run with a man who will be one of the great Presidents of this century, Walter F. Mondale. Tonight the daughter of a woman whose highest goal was a future for her children talks to our nation's oldest party about a future for us all. Tonight, the daughter of working Americans tells all Americans that the future is within our reach - if we're willing to reach for it. Tonight, the daughter of an immigrant from Italy has been chosen - has been chosen to run for President in the new land my father came to love. The Dream and the Promise Our faith that we can shape a better future is what the American dream is all about. The promise of our country is that the rules are fair. If you work hard and play by the rules, you can earn your share of America's blessings. Those are the beliefs I learned from my parents. And those are the values I taught my students as a teacher in the public schools of New York City. At night, I went to law school. I became an Assistant District Attorney, and I put my share of criminals behind bars. I believe: If you obey the law, you should be protected. But if you break the law, you must pay for your crime. When I first ran for Congress, all the political experts said a Democrat could not win in my home district in Queens. I put my faith in the people and the values that we shared. Together, we proved the political experts wrong. In this campaign, Fritz Mondale and I have put our faith in the people. And we are going to prove the experts wrong again. We are going to win. We are going to win, because Americans across this country believe in the same basic dream. Last week, I visited Elmore, Minn., the small town where - Yay Elmore! - The small town where Fritz Mondale was raised. And soon Fritz and Joan will visit our family in Queens. Nine hundred people live in Elmore. In Queens there are 2,000 people on one block. You would think we'd be different, but we're not. Pride and the American Family Children walk to school in Elmore past grain elevators; in Queens, they pass by subways stops. But, no matter where they live, their future depends on education - and their parents are willing to do their part to make those schools as good as they can be. In Elmore, there are family farms; in Queens, small businesses. But the men and women who run them all take pride in supporting their families through hard work and initiative. On the Fourth of July in Elmore, they hang flags out on Main Street; in Queens, they fly them over Grand Avenue. But all of us love our country, and stand ready to defend the freedom that it represents. Americans want to live by the same set of rules. But under this Administration, the rules are rigged against too many of our people. It isn't right that every year, the share of taxes paid by individual citizens is going up, while the share paid by large corporations is getting smaller and smaller. The rules say: Everyone in our society should contribute their fair share. It isn't right that this year Ronald Reagan will hand the American people a bill for interest on the national debt larger than the entire cost of the Federal Government under John F. Kennedy. Our parents left us a growing economy. The rules say: We must not leave our kids a mountain of debt. It isn't right that a woman should get paid 59 cents on the dollar for the same work as a man. If you play by the rules, you deserve a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. It isn't right that if trends continue, by the year 2000 nearly all of the poor people in America will be women and children. The rules - the rules of a decent society say, when you distribute sacrifice in times of austerity, you don't put women and children first. Keeping Faith With the Elderly It isn't right that young people today fear they won't get the Social Security they paid for, and that older Americans fear they will lose what they have already earned. Social Security is a contract between the last generation and the next, and the rules say: You don't break contracts. We are going to keep faith with older Americans. We hammered out a fair compromise in the Congress to save Social Security. Every group sacrificed to keep the system sound. It is time Ronald Reagan stopped scaring our senior citizens. It isn't right that young couples question whether to bring children into a world of 50,000 nuclear warheads. That isn't the vision for which Americans have struggled for more than two centuries. And our future doesn't have to be that way. Change is in the air, just as surely as when John Kennedy beckoned America to a New Frontier; when Sally Ride rocketed into space; and when Reverend Jesse Jackson, ran for the office of President of the United States. By choosing a woman to run for our nation's second highest office, you send a powerful signal to all Americans. There are no doors we cannot unlock. We will place no limit on achievement. If we can do this, we can do anything. Tonight, we reclaim our dream. We're going to make the rules of American life work fairly for all Americans again. To an Administration that would have us debate all over again whether the Voting Rights Act should be renewed and whether segregated schools should be tax exempt, we say, Mr. President: Those debates are over. On the issue of civil rights voting rights and affirmative action for minorities, we must not go backwards. We must and we will move forward to open the doors of opportunity. Women's Role and Their Rights To those who understand that our countrycannot prosper unless we draw on the talentsof all Americans, we say: We will pass theequal rights amendment. The issue is not what America can do for women, but what women can do for America. To the Americans who will lead our country into the 21st century, we say: We will not have a Supreme Court that turns the clock back to the 19th century. To those concerned about the strength of American and family values as I am I say we are going to restore those values; love, caring, partnership by including and not excluding those whose beliefs differ from our own because our own faith is strong we will fight to preserve the freedom of faith for others. To those working Americans who fear that banks, utilities, and large special interests have a lock on the White House we say: Join us; let's elect a people's President; and let's have a government by and for the American people again. To an Administration that would savage student loans in education at the dawn of a new technological age, we say: You fit the classic definition of a cynic: You know the price of everything, but the value of nothing. To our students and their parents, we say: We will insist on the highest standards of excellence because the jobs of the future require skilled minds. To young Americans who may be called to our country's service, we say: We know your generation will proudly answer our country's call, as each generation before you. This past year we remembered the bravery and sacrifice of Americans at Normandy. And we finally paid tribute, as we should have done years ago, to that unknown soldier who represents all the brave young Americans who died in Vietnam. A Profile of a President Let no one doubt we will defend America's security and the cause of freedom around the world. But we want a President who tells us what America is fighting for, not just what we are fighting against. We want a President who will defend human rights - not just where it is convenient - but wherever freedom is at risk - from Chile to Afghanistan from Poland to South Africa. To those who would want this Administration's confusion in the Middle-East as it is tilted first toward one and then another of Israel's long-time enemies and wonder will America stand by her friends and sister democracies? We say America knows who her friends are in the Middle-East and around the world. America will stand with Israel always. Finally, we want a President who will keep America strong, but use that strength to keep America, and the world, at peace. A nuclear freeze is not a slogan: it is a tool for survival in the nuclear age. If we leave our children nothing else, let us leave them this earth as we found it - whole and green and full of life. I know in my heart that Walter Mondale will be that President. Cherishing 'the Gift of Life' A wise man once said, ''Every one of us is given the gift of life, and what a strange gift it is. If it is preserved jealously and selfishly, it impoverishes and saddens. But if it is spent for others, it enriches and beautifies.'' My fellow Americans: We can debate policies and programs. But in the end what separates the two parties in this election campaign is whether we use the gift of life - for others or only ourselves. Tonight, my husband, John, and our three children are in this hall with me. To my daughters, Donna and Laura, and my son, John Jr., I say: My mother did not break faith with me and I will not break faith with you. To all the children of America, I say: The generation before ours kept faith with us, and like them, we will pass on to you a stronger, more just America. Thank you very much.

1016-> PRODUCER PRICES STEADY; INDUSTRY OUTPUT UP
Despite expectations that the economy's stubbornly good health would aggravate inflation, an important measure of prices held steady in June for the third consecutive month, the Labor Department reported today. The department said its Producer Price Index for finished goods, reflecting the prices that industry charges retailers, showed no change in June and has risen only 2.2 percent over the past year. Another price index, for raw materials, fell last month by 1 percent, its third consecutive drop. In further indications of the economy's overall strength, the Government said industrial production rose five-tenths of 1 percent and retail sales eight-tenths of 1 percent, both exceeding their gains in May. (Page 45.) ''Our goal for the American people is a strong growth economy with stable prices,'' President Reagan told a delegation of visiting Republican women in commenting on the three reports. ''And this morning it looks like we hit the jackpot, made a triple play.'' ''I was surprised,'' said Robert A. Gough, an economist at Data Resources Inc., repeating a refrain that economists have been voicing month after month about reports that keep defying their predictions of resurgent inflation and slower growth. Rarely has the economy looked so healthy. The overall unemployment rate dropped last month to 7 percent, while wages, which in previous recoveries increased strongly, have been climbing little faster than the overall inflation rate of about 4 percent. The gross national product, meanwhile, grew in the second quarter at a rate of 5.7 percent. With 9.7 percent growth in the first quarter, the economy could realize a second consecutive year of an unusually robust 6 percent growth. In fact, in only one important area - housing, which has been hurt by rising interest rates - do most economists see any real decline. 'Something Significant Happening' ''I think there's something significant happening,'' said Sam Nakagama of Nakagama & Wallace, a forecasting firm in New York. He added that he now foresees no more than 4 percent inflation for the next 18 months. Economists and critics of the Reagan Administration continually forecast serious setbacks eventually. Many expect a sharp decline in the value of the dollar and higher interest rates that, they assert, the economy will eventually have to pay as the Government continues to borrow to finance its record budget deficits. Some also contend that inflation must revive eventually because, in both jobs and industrial capacity, the economy is approaching the limits of its ability to increase production to meet rising demand. The Federal Reserve has been concerned that such pressures will reignite inflation. And next Monday and Tuesday, the central bank's policymaking Federal Open Market Committee will meet to decide whether the pressures are severe enough to provoke a new increase in interest rates. Economists have also begun to warn of the emergence of a new economic phenomenon: persistently falling prices, or deflation, especially for raw materials that developing countries sell to earn the revenues they need to make payments on their loans. ''Declining prices can mean declining income, so some people are getting hurt,'' said Richard D. Rippe, an economist at Dean Witter Reynolds. Tied to Recession or Depression In the industrial sector, falling prices historically have been associated with recession or depression, so such declines can be worrisome. The recent declines are curious because other signs have pointed to sustained expansion. Falling prices are also hurting some areas of the American economy, especially farming. The Producer Price Index for crude foods and feed fell 2.3 percent in June, its third consecutive drop. Smaller declines were reported for intermediate food products and for the foods component of the finished goods index. The foods component fell six-tenths of 1 percent last month, its third straight decline. Beef and veal prices fell 3 percent last month and have fallen 6.8 percent over the past 12 months. Some food prices that have been rising for the past year recorded steep declines last month, especially those for fish and eggs. Prices of many non-food goods covered by the finished goods index have also been falling. Gasoline dropped two-tenths of 1 percent in June, and has fallen 4.5 percent over a year. Prices of cosmetics, clothing, most jewelry and automobiles all fell last month, after rising slightly for a year. Price increases have been most pronounced in luggage, electrical lamps and light bulbs. The Labor Department's index of prices that industry pays for crude or raw-material goods has declined for four of the six months this year. Cattle prices have dropped 3 percent over a year, and the decline persisted last month with a drop of 2.4 percent. Prices of poultry and hay, which had been rising for a year, fell in June. Scrap metal - iron and steel, copper and aluminum - fell last month. Only the third index of producer prices, one that tracks the semifinished intermediate goods that industry converts to finished products, showed an increase last month. It rose four-tenths of 1 percent, its fifth consecutive rise and the sharpest since an increase of five-tenths of 1 percent in March.

1018-> THE BUSINESS OF COMPOSING
David Hamilton is the music critic of The Nation and the author of ''The Listener's Guide to Great Instrumentalists.'' STRAVINSKY Selected Correspondence. Volume Two. Edited by Robert Craft. Illustrated. 544 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $30. A STRAVINSKY SCRAPBOOK 1940-1971. By Robert Craft. Illustrated. 179 pp. New York: Thames and Hudson/W. W. Norton & Company. $24.95. HIS music defines Igor Stravinsky as a man of vitality, wit and invention, of protean stylistic variety and religiously committed craftsmanship. Alongside that Stravinsky, many have also come to know and enjoy the expertly packaged literary persona of his elder years - the epigrammatic logophile with a sharp word at the ready for every celebrity who ever passed through his crowded life. Now the publication of his correspondence is revealing a third Stravinsky - the opportunistic businessman and careerist of the 1920's and 30's, his hard nose ever to the grindstone. In this second volume, Stravinsky's correspondents include the impresario Sergei Diaghilev, the conductor Pierre Monteux, the painters Leon Bakst and Francis Picabia, the eurythmist Emile Jaques-Dalcroze, the composers Florent Schmitt, Alfredo Casella, Manuel de Falla and Lord Berners. To them, as to his publishers, lawyers and relatives, Stravinsky writes - or telegraphs - tersely and unsmilingly of itineraries, contracts, lawsuits and fees (especially fees), organizes commissions for new works, promotes concert engagements, cultivates (and exploits) allies. The picture is not always attractive. Can this really be Stravinsky writing to Schmitt in 1911? ''When will your work of genius Salome finally appear so that I can spend happy hours playing it from beginning to end a la folie ?'' The image this conjures up, of Stravinsky repeatedly plowing through Schmitt's overripe ballet score at the piano (it's too early for recordings), is moderately hilarious, highly improbable and somewhat distasteful. Nor is flattery his most egregious sin. In the course of protracted litigation about the 1919 Suite From ''The Firebird'' - when, as the injured publisher puts it, ''you sold our company the copyright for a work that no longer belonged to you'' - Stravinsky assumes the posture of Pontius Pilate: ''You ask me what attitude I intend to assume; I have very little to say in response, because I play no role in this affair.'' Tedious exchanges about efforts to ''expropriate'' Stravinsky's Polish assets are only partly offset by the evidence of his generosity towards a financially incompetent brother-in-law. Everybody is made to be useful - even the future Lord Berners is commissioned to badger Diaghilev for Stravinsky's overdue fees. Now and then something direct and personal emerges. After years of quibbling with Diaghilev over money, Stravinsky suddenly announces in 1926 that he is taking confession for the first time in 20 years: ''I ask this of you also, dear Serge . . . to forgive me the transgressions of all of these years that have passed without repentance before God.'' (Diaghilev replies, ''I read your letter through my own tears.'') In some letters of the late 30's to the violinist Samuel Dushkin, Stravinsky becomes downright chatty - though at the same time clearly intent on breaking off their concert-giving association, now unprofitable to him. Not inaccurately, these books are described as Stravinsky's correspondence rather than his letters: something like three-fourths of the letters here are to Stravinsky rather than from him. (You have to consult Robert Craft's preface to the first volume to learn the principal reason for the numerous gaps - that Stravinsky rarely kept copies of his own letters.) In some of these exchanges, he is entirely absent. (To the pretentiously effusive Jaques-Dalcroze, one likes to think Stravinsky never replied.) Letters from the anguished Nijinsky, the witty Bakst (on the subject of a proposed modern-dress version of ''Antony and Cleopatra''), the laconic Berners and the gossipy Nicolas Nabokov make very good reading, but the purchaser of Stravinsky's correspondence is likely to be disappointed at finding so little directly from the hand of the man whose name is at the top of the book's spine. There's certainly ample measure of the other chap on the spine, however. Mr. Craft is the most obtrusive of editors. Some sections of this book are really narratives by Mr. Craft summarizing and excerpting correspondence. ''Letters to Pierre Boulez'' is a polemical chronicle of relations between the two composers, intended to demonstrate the Frenchman's incorrigible perfidy. Mr. Craft is a specialist in the irrelevant footnote: Dangling from the middle of the correspondence with the English musical scholar Edwin Evans is a story about the dance-band leader Jack Hylton and his arrangement of music from Stravinsky's opera ''Mavra,'' complete with a photograph. An interesting story - but who will ever remember to look for it in this place? At the same time, tantalizing allusions remain unexplained. When Diaghilev mentions projects involving the playwright Maurice Maeterlinck (1912) and the liturgical scholar Ivan Mestrovic (1914), something from Mr. Craft about the former - even an admission of ignorance - would be reassuring. (The latter is surely the abortive spectacle ''Liturgie.'') And there are oversights. The chapter devoted to the ''Firebird'' affair omits a central document, Stravinsky's 1927 deposition in the case, published in an earlier Craft compendium, ''Stravinsky in Pictures and Documents.'' For all the editor's unparalleled knowledge about and unquestioned devotion to Stravinsky, his work often falls short of customary scholarly standards of objectivity and consistency. The book concludes with nearly 100 pages of exceedingly miscellaneous appendixes, including Mr. Craft's scathing review of the Stravinsky centenary exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in Paris, his meticulous discussions of musical sketches and chronology, corrections of faulty editions, examinations of biographical curiosities and documentation of the ghosting of Stravinsky's first two books. Much of this will be fascinating to the experts, but the lay reader should not approach the Stravinsky correspondence expecting major revelations about ''inspiration'' or ''the creative process'' or even the private characteristics of a man of genius. In these pages, when speaking in his own words, the composer seems much like ordinary men, most clearly distinguished from the rest of us by the sheer intensity with which he pursues the practical aspects of his career. From the family photo albums, Mr. Craft has compiled ''A Stravinsky Scrapbook.'' An earlier iconography set forth the composer's long association with the woman who became his second wife; this one does much the same for his relationship with Mr. Craft, to the extent of reproducing in facsimile dozens of inscriptions and birthday greetings from the composer to his Boswell. The composer, his wife and Mr. Craft are mighty photogenic people, and some of the music facsimiles are fascinating - but doubts about the method (or madness) of the publication of these parts of the Stravinsky literary estate persist. Is a picture book really the appropriate place to print such an important, if arcane, biographical document as Stravinsky's ''medical diaries''?B

1019-> TOWER'S COSTLY GAMBLE TO SELL RECORDS
MORE than 40 years ago, when Tommy Dorsey and Glenn Miller were the rage and 78's the style, 16-year old Russ Solomon scared up $250 to start a makeshift record shop in the back of his father's Tower Drugstore, next to Sacramento's Tower Theater. Demand was high and, since overhead was virtually nonexistent, the high school entrepreneur kept beefing up inventory, tripling his floor space in just a couple of years. Music tastes and record sizes are different today, of course, but Mr. Solomon has stuck with the approach that he stumbled on in high school. Since 1960, when he finally moved his first store to a stand-alone location across the street, his record supermarkets have grown into a chain of nearly 40 outlets, with shelf after shelf of records and tapes. This ''deep catalogue'' approach has been rather attention-getting in many American communities. ''Solomon has the highest profile in any town he comes into with his record stores,'' says an executive with Musicland, the nation's largest chain of record stores, among them the Sam Goody outlets. Now Mr. Solomon, who is 59, has brought his act to Manhattan. And his first outlet here, in the old Silk Building at East Fourth Street and Broadway, is once again high profile - even for the Big Apple. ''It took $2 million to fix up the store, more than $2 million to set up the inventory, and it took courage,'' Mr. Solomon said. The courage, apparently, was in supplementing big inventory with marketing pizazz. The one-year-old Tower Records in the East Village - billed as America's largest record store - is an architect-designed creation of gleaming chrome and flashing neon set against walls of deep rose and gray. This superdome of records, cassettes and video paraphernalia stretches airily over 25,000 square feet on three floors and a mezzanine - and there is a bargain Annex down the street that sells out-of-print or overproduced classical records. High above the customers in the main store, 15 large video monitors flash the latest music video hits while the Tower's own disk jockey, seated in a glass-enclosed booth in the center, directs jazz and rock and classical music to five ''sound environments'' - different areas of the store. On weekends celebrities, invited by Tower to make guest appearances, mingle with the crowds. Casts from Broadway shows; Robert Rauschenberg, the artist; Hall & Oates, the rock group; Lou Reed, the pop star, Vladimir Horowitz, the pianist - all have frequented the place, helping to boost sales. Mr. Solomon, in effect, has added entertainment to his bag of sales tools. That's new for MTS Inc., as the Tower empire is formally called, and it is also new for record stores in general - making Tower Records in lower Manhattan a pacesetter and a center of considerable industry attention. Two similar Tower stores are to open on the Upper West Side and in Washington in the fall. ''Their success defies all logic of what is going on in the industry,'' says Ben Karol, owner of the King Karol record stores. ''Solomon has a unique concept: you come to be entertained and you wind up buying some merchandise.'' On an average day, Tower Records attracts some 6,000 customers, the company says - businessmen and punkettes, students and music critics and pop stars. Some come to purchase specific records. Others flip at random through 425,000 LP's and tapes, 30,000 45's and 7,000 video disks - all in easy reach in bins and stacks. One Wall Street analyst said he has spent $20,000 buying records and tapes at Tower Records since it opened last summer. But many others don't buy anything; they just go for the kicks - to listen to the music, to watch the latest hit movie in the basement video department, or to strike up an acquaintance. Time will judge the profitability of Mr. Solomon's new marketing method. The lower Manhattan store's first year coincided with a period of recovery in the record industry from a severe slump. But the industry is still beset by high operating costs, increasing consolidation, and changing technology that might one day make records and tapes obsolete. And in New York - the most competitive record and cassette market in the United States - Mr. Karol of King Karol says he has seen 300 retail record stores rise and fall in his 35 years in the business. Even some well-known record chains, including Sam Goody, Record Factory and Barnes & Noble, have closed Manhattan outlets in the last few months. At least one owner of a record outlet has put part of the blame for his demise on the competition from Tower Records. ''It is like a steamroller,'' said Franz D. Jolowicz, who closed his 27-year-old Discophile record shop last month. But the survivors say they have their own strong formula for profits and success, be that heavy advertising, big inventories, close supervision of stock, knowledgeable sales staffs or middle-of-the-road pricing. They acknowledge, however, that they are watching the Tower marketing splash. And, while they do not say it outright, chances are they also are weighing whether in-store entertainment is an approach worth emulating - or simply a fad. MEANTIME, MTS Inc. claims it is making money in New York, although that is hard to verify. The chain is privately owned by Mr. Solomon and therefore doesn't have to release sales and earnings figures. Nevertheless, Mr. Solomon said sales will rise 25 percent this year from the 1983 level, when revenue was ''in excess of $100 million.'' And he asserted that MTS turns a profit - he won't say how much - from its 35 record and video stores in the United States, 4 in Japan, 7 book stores, a graphics store and 3 tiny clothing stores. A big chunk of the revenue apparently comes from the new Tower Records in Manhattan. Matthew Koenig, the store's 36-year-old jeans-clad manager, claims that his outlet sells at least 5,000 records and tapes daily. Those items that do not sell within a month are tagged for return. Indeed, Tower apparently does not run much risk with its ''deep catalogue'' policy. Distributors allow the company to return up to 20 percent of unsold records, and Mr. Solomon said returns at his stores average no more than 14 percent. Tower does buy out- of-print classical records on a final sale basis, but Mr. Solomon said the risk is minimal. ''We're buying about 10,000 of these records at $1.50 each,'' he said. ''Is $15,000 a huge risk?'' For a returnable record, Tower pays a wholesale price of about $5.25 for units that list at $8.98, and it sells them at retail for between $5.99 and $7.99. The wholesale prices are not out of line with what Sam Goody, King Karol and other large record stores pay, but sheer volume puts it in a better position to take advantage of volume-related deals. ''I would not be surprised to hear that Tower received lengthier terms of payment or special discounts,'' said David Nives, sales manager of Rounder Distribution, which distributes over 200 independent labels in New York. ''Everyone can theoretically take advantage of them, but the fact that Tower has more outlets makes it easier for them.'' Despite the purchasing power, Tower Records's retail prices are not the lowest in town; indeed, the MTS stores in New York and elsewhere do not go in much for discounting. J&R Records, for one, consistently undersells the New York outlet. Yet, Tower's two-step approach to the business - draw the people in with glitz and glitter and hook them as customers with a seemingly inexhaustible inventory - has kept business brisk enough to persuade Mr. Solomon to open another Manhattan store. The second Manhattan store promises more of the same. It will be even ''flashier, with more pizazz,'' said Mr. Koenig. In addition to the flashing lights - which are also showing up in other Tower stores across the country - the new Manhattan outlet will sport a waterfall and a chandelier made up of video monitors. The store is to be near Lincoln Center, an area that industry executives say is underserved. ''It's incredible that there's been no established record chain in New York that has a store on the Upper West Side,'' said Fred Goodman, an editor with Billboard, the record industry's trade magazine. Although Mr. Goodman wonders whether the new shop will drain off sales from the downtown store, Mr. Koenig is unworried. ''New York is large enough and the stores are far enough apart that I don't think my figures will go down,'' he said. The new store, although smaller than its downtown sister, will aim to have an equally broad inventory. That could mean a bonanza for distributors. The downtown store alone stocks the biggest inventory of any record store in America, the company claims.''Other stores don't have the space or the capital to stock this much inventory,'' said Rounder's Mr. Nives. Although records still comprise 90 percent of Tower's revenues, analysts view the company as operating in a broader arena. ''Their concept is big home entertainment and I think it is a successful concept,'' said Mark Piely, a research anaylst at F. Eberstadt & Company. MTS Inc. has had setbacks, however. Mr. Solomon said he has done well with a chain of bookstores and graphics stores, but he admits to ''insignificant'' success with three tiny clothing stores called ''The Look.'' Moreover, a chain of Tower poster stores that made most of its money selling drug paraphernalia lost money when the sale of such items became illegal in many states. Indeed, video is Mr. Solomon's latest enthusiasm. Music videos - those three- or four-minute clips originally created as television promotions for records - have turned into big sellers across the country. Nearly all Tower stores stock some music videos and other tapes. The new stores, including the flashy one to be opened in Washington this fall, will also have space for video. Still, for now, sales of all video tapes constitute only about 8 percent of total revenues. Mr. Solomon wants that percentage appreciably increased. ''The whole future of the record industry is very definitely involved with video,'' he said. Last month, MTS opened Tower Video on New York's Upper West Side, in the same building that will house its new record store. The outlet is intended to be the company's video showcase and, like the record stores, stands out for its glare and glitter. Pink neon signs flash over the entranceway, while inside some 13 television monitors run selections from the store's stock of titles. Tower Video already is winning customers. Gina Roose, a 29-year-old film editor and long-standing customer of Tower Records, was buying a copy of the film Moby Dick as a present one recent Thursday. ''I went to several other big video places but they said it didn't exist,'' she said. ''Tower had it even on opening day last week.''

1023-> THEATER REVIEW; 'HAY FEVER' GONE HAYWIRE
'HAY FEVER,'' playing at the Arena Players Repertory Theater, was Sir No"el Coward's first foray into the world of elegant high comedy. Through the following years, Coward's best works continued in this vein, with plays such as ''Private Lives,'' ''Blythe Spirit'' and ''Present Laughter.'' In this production of ''Hay Fever,'' the director, David Dubin, has mistakenly placed this production on a fine line between slapstick and farce. He has missed the tenor of elegance and archness for which Coward is cherished. The story is of the incredibly self- centered Bliss family and one weekend in which each of the four of them has invited a guest to spend a few days in the country. The guests are rudely treated, not through malice, but because no one in the family has any concern for anyone else's comfort. The Bliss family treats emotions like scenes from a cranky British melodrama, and love is a game they play that gives them individually and collectively a great deal of amusement. Their guests, on the other hand, are serious people who are bewildered and even frightened by the Blisses' eccentricities. Mr. Dubin has assembled some of the Arena's most accomplished players, but although they put obvious energy and effort into their roles, the wry sophistication in this light comedy eludes them. Nancy Vitulli, with her magnificently expressive face, is far too intense an actress to play the frothy, fatuous 19-year-old Sorel Bliss. Jeff Romano comes across as ill-tempered and childlike rather than petulant as the son, and Don Frame appears to have no grasp of the character of the father, David Bliss. The mother, Judith Bliss, a retired semiprofessional actress, is played by Blanche Brodie. Although Miss Brodie fares no better at fulfilling Coward's intentions than anyone else does, she has perfected the ability of Mrs. Bliss to act as though surrounded by mirrors. The actors who play the guests give performances that are as awkward and self-conscious as those who play the Blisses. Allen McRae is arch-eyebrowed rigidness as the handsome diplomat, Peggy O'Toole is a frozen smile as the bewildered Jackie, and Timothy F. Smith just seems out of place as the star-struck Sandy. Subtlety and sophistication are not the forte of the Arena Players, and this haywire, feverish production clearly displays this company's weaknesses rather than its many strengths. The Arena Players Repertory Theater is in East Farmingdale, where ''Hay Fever'' completes its run today with two performances, at 3 and 7:30 P.M.

1025-> UPPER VOLTA, AT FETE, VOWS TO DO BETTER AS BOURKINA FASSO
The military leaders of Bourkina Fasso, formerly Upper Volta, celebrated their first year in power today with a pledge to break with their West African country's colonial past and to better feed its population, among the world's poorest. The former French colony, which changed its name Friday, also gave itself a new national anthem and flag. Its leader, Capt. Thomas Sankara, said his seven million countrymen were involved in a major revolution. Captain Sankara, a 34-year-old paratrooper, said his ruling National Revolutionary Council would strive to eliminate all traces of what he called petty bourgeois ideology. In a speech on the anniversary of the coup that brought him to power, he said the revolution was open to all, including those who had fought against it through ignorance. This was seen here as a reference to jailed top officials of former Governments whose sentences were reduced or quashed under a special decree marking the anniversary. Ex-President Is Freed Another decree freed from house arrest the country's first President after independence, Maurice Yameogo, and 10 former Government ministers. But Captain Sankara said the revolution would deal harshly with those who used violence to oppose it. ''We have been patient, very patient, but if violence is the only means they understand, the N.R.C. will apply it to them with all harshness,'' he declared. Several plots to topple the regime have been uncovered, and seven people were executed by firing squad after the latest reported attempt six weeks ago. Late last month, the deputy chief of staff of the armed forces was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt. Captain Sankara said top priority in his revolution would be given to agricultural and livestock production in an effort to achieve self-sufficiency in food and to bridge the gap between the rural poor and the relatively better-off urban populations. This semidesert country, with an annual per capita income of $210, ranks among the world's 10 poorest.

1026-> U.S. Skeet Shooter Takes Gold Medal
Matthew Dryke of the United States won the the gold medal in the Olympic skeet competition with a record- tying 198-point performance. Ole Riber Rasmussen of Denmark won the silver medal in a shoot-off with Luca Scribani Rossi of Italy, who won the bronze. Both ended the competition with 196 points, but in the shoot-off, Rasmussen was perfect, knocking down all 25 of his targets. Scribani missed on his first and 17th attempts to end with 23. The medal was America's third gold in shooting, tying China for the most golds won during the week-long competition. Dryke, of Columbus, Ga., the world champion and world-record holder, missed only two targets during the eight-round competition, and his score of 198 tied the existing Olympic mark. Dryke said that the large and enthusiastic crowd did not distract him during his last round because of his experience as a trick shooter. ''I suppose that helps,'' Dryke said. ''When I do my trick shooting, there are a lot of people hooting and hollering.'' The triumph completed a natural progression for Dryke, who was a national junior champ in 1976, then went on to claim six national titles, the 1983 World Championship and a gold medal at the Pan American Games. ''If there are two factors in this victory, I would say one is experience and the other is knowing the range,'' he said. ''Winning the world championship built up my confidence, and I wanted to show the Europeans that my world record was not a fluke.'' Dryke is the only man ever to hit 200 out of 200 targets during an international competition. Another notable finish in the event was that of Nuria Ortiz of Mexico, one of two women competitors. She settled down after a shaky first day and hit 124 of the 125 targets during the final two days. Miss Ortiz, who lives in California but competes for Mexico, said that she competed in the nearly all-male competition to attempt to keep the sport of women's skeet shooting flourishing. uf30

1027-> IN SHORT
FICTION ON THE THIRD DAY. By Michael Delahaye. (Macmillan, $15.95.) Confronted by an American President's demand that Israel hand back the West Bank, the Israeli Government produces evidence of a stupendous archeological find - the first-century skeleton of a crucified man in his 30's lying in an ossuary inscribed ''Jesus the Nazirite.'' Soon the Vatican has joined Washington and the Palestine Liberation Organization in a mission to purloin the bones. Michael Delahaye presses the plot to a heart-racing conclusion. But ''On the Third Day'' is something more than a summer read. It is also a political novel of some insight. Career politicians, those ''self-serving apparatchiks,'' are dangerous not simply because they lack integrity, an aging Ben-Gurion-like figure tells Israel's prime minister, but because they lack ''the quality that distinguishes the statesman from the politician: vision - the ability to think in decades, not days; to look beyond the cluttered foreground to the distant horizon, the mountain peaks ahead, not the puddle at your feet.'' In ''On the Third Day,'' in fact, Mr. Delahaye, a former BBC reporter, has written a novel about political vision. It is that vision that determines the outcome of the novel's bone-snatching scheme, and also determines the future of Israel and the Roman Catholic Church. Indeed, it is a tribute to the book that its politics do not interfere with the suspense and that its elements of suspense do not detract from its political insight. The book has flaws - all the Americans are editorial-page cartoons and the love interest is laughable - but even so it is not too much to say that ''On the Third Day'' is everything a novel should be. - D. G. Myers * DON BUENO. By Zulfikar Ghose. (Holt, Kinehart and Winston, $16.95.) In his latest novel, Zulfikar Ghose adds a psychological twist to Santayana's warning that those who forget history are doomed to repeat its mistakes. In ''Don Bueno,'' Mr. Ghose's ninth novel, those ignorant of their history altogether are condemned to re-enact it with brutal inevitability. Exploring the perils of the unexamined life, the novel unravels the pasts of four generations of fathers and sons. Born out of wedlock, each is abandoned by the father he will later confront. In the process, each will inherit his town's mantle of ''Don Bueno,'' an ironic epithet disguising a lifetime of cruelty and self-deception. Mr. Ghose sets this cyclical tale in the Amazon, in its decaying river towns and the Indian villages dotting its interior. Although set in South America, the fictional territory is Conrad's. As in ''Heart of Darkness,'' landscape serves as a mirror of each character's interior life, a kind of psychic undergrowth entangling his present. Mr. Ghose intertwines portraits of the jungle's other outsiders: fugitives, con men, prostitutes and thieves. Structured in flashbacks, the novel, like memory, weaves the past forward. It opens when Napoleon Calderon, a ruthless extortionist, meets and, unwittingly, is murdered by his son, Cesar, around whom the novel ultimately revolves. Abandoning his pregnant mistress, Cesar flees into self- imposed exile in the town of San Clemente de los Andes. There, he adopts the orphaned Sofia over whom, years later, he and his own son, Simon, will clash. Before this, both men embark on their separate but equally dark odysseys: an underground world of holy men and hit men. While ''Don Bueno'' teems with scenes of mysterious initiation rites, none possess surreal grandeur. Too often Mr. Ghose's psychological drama becomes a glorified potboiler. Like his willfully unreflective fathers and sons, the author confuses action with depth. - Alexandra Johnson * BLOOD GROUP O. By David Brierley (Summit, $9.95.) What happens when the main characters of this novel - Cody, the narrator, a C.I.A.-trained Englishwoman turned freelance international spy, and Crevecoeur, a chief inspector in the French intelligence service - each gains damaging secrets about the other? Gentle blackmail. Wielding all his suave, Gallic tough-guy know-how, Crevecoeur maneuvers Cody into taking on a case he hasn't time for, since he's arranging security for an international summit meeting. The daughter of a wealthy diamond broker has been kidnapped, for motives that aren't yet clear; Cody's mission is to recover the girl. Her search takes her through a maze of shady organizations. There is French intelligence, constantly sprouting new agencies, each riddled with leaks and informers, each spying on the other; there are Paris's rival mobs - Corsicos and Marsiales; finally there is Blood Group O, an international terrorist group whose goal is to eliminate fascist elements in society. Cody traces the kidnapped girl to their hideout. Why are they holding her? Why have they just amassed submachine guns and ammunition? Why are they stationed close to the airport where the world's leaders will soon arrive for the summit meeting Crevecoeur is guarding? This novel is packed with smashing action scenes - an underwater escape, a motorcycle-helicopter chase, a car plunging into a lake - but Cody finds enough breathing time to solve the mystery of Blood Group O. The C.I.A. taught her well: ''The reason the human species advanced out of the jungle is not because of physical responses but mental activity,'' she advises us. ''Survivors are the ones whose brains work.'' This tough- minded woman is a perfect heroine, and David Brierley's novel is superb entertainment. - Richard Smith * THE MOVIE SET. By June Flaum Singer. (M. Evans, $16.95.) The twist to this variation on the ''four college friends review their lives'' plot is that the money that moves the story along comes from Middle Western shopping centers and malls. Mall development and finance comprise the most engaging parts of the story. It begins in Columbus, Ohio, in 1964, when Buffy, the narrator who tells the readers regularly that she looks just like the young Vivien Leigh, starts college and meets her pals - beautiful and conniving Suzannah, rich and secretive Cassie, ambitious and self-doubting Cleo and Buffy's placid sister Suellen who got there ahead of her. The parts of the novel set in Ohio actually work quite well; there are, for example, some droll campus scenes, the appearance of Buffy's true love, the ambitious Todd King, and their often amusing courtship as he pinches pennies and lays plans for their financial empire. But as he is rich before he is 30, there are several hundred pages left for getting the whole gang to Hollywood. Once there, Todd finances and refinances the studio in which Suzannah, after stepping over many bodies, has become the star. Also on board are Cleo's ambitious husband, the director, and Cassie's estranged husband who is the male star. The apparently obligatory sexual kinkiness strains even minds pummeled to numbness by best sellers. Let's see, Cassie's husband is a sadist and possibly a murderer who regularly rapes little girls; Suzannah's girlhood friend Poppy beats her drug-crazed and rather stupid rock singer husband into fame and glory. She gets revenge on Suzannah and the crowd by arranging for Todd to be infected with syphilis, which prompts Buffy to abort a subsequent pregnancy and start an affair. Just folks? - Eden Ross Lipson * LOVE, INFIDELITY AND DRINKING TO FORGET. By Elizabeth Gundy. (Dial, $15.95.) In ''Bliss'' and ''Cat on a Leash,'' Elizabeth Gundy gloriously showed off her talents as a novelist - and her familiarity with the landscape of the heart. But something seems to have gone a bit awry in ''Love, Infidelity and Drinking to Forget.'' Things begin promisingly enough - Sara, a painter of book jackets for historical romances, and Daniel, the owner of an antiques store in New York, have decided to give up the comforts of rent control and Bloomingdale's for a life of pure air and uncomplicated pleasures in a remote region of Canada. Daniel, at least, considers himself well-equipped to handle anything inimical the provinces have to offer; after all, he has his books on Taoism, Buddhism and, most important, his 24-volume ''Home Handyman Encyclopedia.'' Sara has her pedigree cats, Patches and Alice, and a less than rockbound faith in her husband's capabilities. Right from the start, there is trouble in the promised land, which ironically enough is called New Jerusalem. Sara and Daniel's farm burns to the ground, and the innocents abroad are left to depend on the considerable kindness of redneck strangers. But even with the colorful characters who so generously populate its pages, the novel is frequently as difficult to plow through as the Canadian snow. In spite of the couple's palpable struggles and pain - Miss Gundy chronicles the death of their infant son with aching beauty - one is frequently as bored with the doings in the backwoods and backwaters as Sara is. ''As she'd come to know what Daniel's route would be in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, here she knew the steps of his pilgrimage through the K-Mart; in the museum, he'd immerse himself first in antiquities, whereas here he'd start in hardware, followed by athletic equipment, toys, hamsters, and parakeets.'' Are Sara and Daniel slogging through frigid winters and summers of black flies to make a grand statement? The statement is lost on this reader. - Joanne Kaufman NONFICTION LADIES-IN-WAITING: From the Tudors to the Present Day. By Anne Somerset (Knopf, $18.95.) For centuries the role of lady-in-waiting to the Queen was the only acceptable career a wellborn Englishwoman could hope for. The English court offered excitement, riches, escape from the provinces, even a semblance of power - or at least proximity to power. Anne Somerset's gossipy ''Ladies-in-Waiting'' provides a wealth of juicy anecdotal material about five centuries of court life from Henry VIII to Elizabeth II. The positions of Lady of the Bedchamber, Lady of the Privy Chamber or Mistress of the Sweet Coffers - eagerly sought by the great ladies of the realm - were no sinecures. Elizabeth I's attendants washed her underwear, emptied her chamber pots and held a handkerchief before her face ''when she list to spit'' at the dinner table. Until fairly recently, ladies- in-waiting had to spend months at court, away from their families. Each monarch, of course, dictated the tone of his or her court. The court of Queen Anne was so debauched that she was unable to turn up a quorum of virgins to stage a ''masque of maids.'' Queen Charlotte's court was characterized by an odious formality. The novelist Fanny Burney, who served Charlotte as Keeper of the Robes, complained, ''I was lost to all private comfort, dead to all domestic endearment . . . and fatigued with laborious watchfulness.'' The public - and male courtiers in particular - persisted in seeing these women as backstage manipulators and were quick to make scapegoats of them when things went wrong. But in fact, as Miss Somerset, the author of ''The Life and Times of William IV,'' makes clear, the influence of the ladies-in-waiting was vastly overestimated. Although they may have had a favor or two to hand out, they were more often pawns than power brokers. By the time the author gets to the contemporary court, our appetite for court gossip is too sharply whetted to be satisfied by her bland encomiums of ''the utterly dependable women whose loyalty is beyond question and who have dedicated their lives to (the Queen's) service.'' - Brett Harvey * CONGRESSMAN SAM RAYBURN. By Anthony Champagne. (Rutgers University, $19.95.) When Sam Rayburn (1882-1961), Democrat of the Fourth District of Texas, was sent to Congress from the Red River Valley in 1913, Henry Adams was still alive and living on Lafayette Park. The evolution of Washington from the backwater of which Adams so despaired to the center of world politics has been much chronicled. So has Rayburn's career there. But Anthony Champagne's ''Congressman Sam Rayburn'' is not about the operations of the national Democratic leader in tailor-made suits who at his retirement in 1961 had been Speaker of the House of Representatives longer than any one else ever has. It is about Mr. Sam at home, the drawling citizen-legislator and his ''five- (and later seven-) county network of family ties, friendships, and associations'' - the volunteer-built political base and the constituent services Rayburn and it delivered. There is nothing really extraordinary about how Rayburn worked his home district and worked for it to insure his political longevity. However, he did it extraordinarily well - from the regulation congratulatory notes to new mothers and the building of Federal dams to the innovations of farm-to- market roads and rural electrification. Mr. Champagne, an associate professor in the School of Social Sciences at the University of Texas, Dallas, argues that it was precisely because, unlike Washington (and most of the rest of America), rural northeast Texas didn't change much that Rayburn had the stability and security to be a leader in a national party that sometimes - as in the matter of civil rights legislation or of a Catholic Presidential candiadte - required him to work for ends his home state didn't like at all. Mr. Champagne speaks of ''an interesting pattern of reciprocal causation.'' Rayburn's version would have been pithier. ''To get along you have to go along,'' the congenial Mr. Sam often said. - Caroline Rand Herron * THE HISTORY OF ANCIENT ISRAEL. By Michael Grant. (Scribners, $19.95.) Michael Grant's literate ''History of Ancient Israel'' covers the period from the establishment of the neolithic city of Jericho (sometime after 8300 B.C.) to the heroic, suicidal last stand of the Jews against the Romans at Masada in A.D. 73. The prolific Mr. Grant is the author of ''The Etruscans,'' ''History of Rome,'' ''From Alexander to Cleopatra'' and many other books on the ancient Mediterranean. He knows by now how to tackle a big subject, and for this book, as always, he has drawn on a wealth of historical texts as well as archeological finds and theological and linguistic studies. The result is intelligent and entertaining, but one wishes for more, especially about recent archeological discoveries, which are the most valuable source of new information about the ancient Near East. Two brief paragraphs and an occasional mention are all readers get on the fabulous finds at Ebla (in modern- day Syria). Dating from the third millennium B.C., these finds include tablets with tantalizng references to places named Sinai and Jerusalem and people called Esau, Ishmael, David, Saul and Israel. Mr. Grant dismisses these personal names with the cursory comment ''None . . . are identifiable with the later biblical personages.'' The Bible, of course, is the primary source for this period. And Mr. Grant's summaries of the Old Testament texts are lively and fresh. Sometimes they verge on the irreverent. Of Ben Sira, the author of Ecclesiastes, Mr. Grant writes, ''He offers a lot of detailed ethical and practical advice, highly conservative, and not unmixed with expediency and self-interest. He is sorry the poor are so poor, but there is nothing to be done about it. . . . Beating is a good thing, especially for daughters and servants.'' - Katherine Bouton * THE COLD AND THE DARK: The World After Nuclear War. By Paul R. Ehrlich, Carl Sagan, Donald Kennedy and Walter Orr Roberts. (Norton, $12.95.) Everybody knows that nuclear war is bad for your health. ''The Cold and the Dark'' reveals just how bad. Its authors - Paul R. Ehrlich, Carl Sagan, Donald Kennedy and Walter Orr Roberts - are respected scientists who specialize in civilian rather than military matters. They expand on a novel theory proposed last fall at an international Conference on the the Long-Term Worldwide Biological Consequences of Nuclear War held in Washington. The theory, currently undergoing wide scrutiny to determine its validity, argues that even a limited exchange of nuclear weapons would so blot out the sun with smoke and soot that life on earth would be all but extinguished in the ensuing cold and dark. So what? So everything. Aside from questions of civil defense and human survival, the threat of ''nuclear winter'' undermines military strategy and doctrines of targeting and communications - and thus the concept of deterrence that has dominated superpower relations for a third of a century. Now an aggressor might lose as much as a victim, even an unarmed one. The book is a record of the conference and includes papers, dialogues and postconference reflections. Its focus is mostly on questions of science - how great the destruction of the atmospheric ozone layer would be, how high the soot from fires would rise, how many fires would have to be ignited to trigger a nuclear winter. The question that only the Department of Defense can answer is why it took a group of civilian scientists to drag these issues into the open. The book, technical in the main, is a remarkable testament to the power of free scientific inquiry. - William J. Broad * ARCHETYPES AND ANCESTORS: Palaeontology in Victorian London, 1850-1875. By Adrian Desmond. (University of Chicago, $22.50.) Richard Owen (1804-1892), the superintendent of the Natural History Department of the British Museum, was an esteemed paleontologist. Because of his resistance to the theory of evolution, however, his reputation has long been under a cloud. In ''Archetypes and Ancestors,'' Adrian Desmond, the author of ''The Hotblooded Dinosaurs'' and ''The Ape's Reflexion,'' makes a witty and informative case for thinking better of Owen. Darwin's ''The Origin of Species'' appeared in 1859, but it was impossible for Owen, a Christian Platonist, to accept the idea of the transmutation of apes into humans. Owen held that Providence worked in nature by means of an ''Archetype,'' a kind of divine blueprint behind the variations of vertebrate life - a doomed idea but one that allowed him to avoid out- and-out evolutionism. Mr. Desmond shows how ideological differences among scientists affected not only the concepts of paleontology but also the facts. He discusses the positions of Lamarck and Victorian scientists and says the era's underlying goal was ''to professionalize science and put it at the disposal of the mercantile classes.'' Christians, agnostics and atheists joined in this hope for a new order, and many of them jousted with Owen. Most historians have given T. H. Huxley (1825-1895) exaggerated credit for being a modern evolutionist, but Mr. Desmond shows that Huxley dithered a long time before coming out on the evolutionists' side. Huxley, who represented the younger generation, flamboyantly discredited many of Owen's conclusions, and his best-selling books popularized evolution. Owen was left behind. But Mr. Desmond retrieves him and argues that his resistance to evolutionary theories was honorable. - Margaret Peters Laurie Anderson in Book Form The performance artist Laurie Anderson clearly must always be on the alert for weird stories, news items, odd phrases or song lyrics, any small gestures or flourishes that seem, in some way or another, illustrative. Illustrative, that is, of her off- angle, bemused feelings about herself, her work and, in particular, American society. By all reports, she conveyed those feelings expressively and amusingly in her acclaimed performance piece ''United States.'' Now, using photographs of the stage show, specially designed graphics and what is presumably the text of the original work, she has tried to repeat that success in a book - UNITED STATES (Harper & Row, Cloth, $29.95. Paper, $19.95). There are suggestive recurring motifs here - the terrors of plane travel, losing one's way while driving alone at night, the alienating effects of contemporary jargon. The photographs and other illustrations are striking and stylish. Nonetheless, the book resembles nothing so much as a record jacket - although it has a certain esthetic unity about it, it only suggests the full experience that a recording, or better yet the performers in concert, could provide. What the critics praised above all in Miss Anderson's performance were her theatrical flair and the witty, innovative way in which she used audio and video equipment. Without these powerful assists, her writing loses much of its resonance. ''United States'' - the book - makes one think Miss Anderson in performance must be a quirky, entertaining phenomenon. But I suspect it will not contribute much to what thus far has been her steadily growing reputation. - Sara Laschever

1032-> STORM OVER NORTH CAROLINA LOSES ITS FORCE AS IT MOVES INLAND
After smashing into the coast early this morning with 100-mile-an-hour winds that ripped the roofs from buildings and demolished a 100,000-gallon city water tower, Hurricane Diana continued to spread torrential rain and high winds inland. By late afternoon weather forecasters said the storm, which had threatened a wide stretch of the North Carolina shore more than 30 hours before it struck land just after 1 A.M. today, was slowly losing its power. In an advisory issued at 6 P.M., the National Weather Service downgraded Diana from a hurricane to a tropical storm. Its winds had fallen to 50 miles an hour, far below the 75 mile-an-hour threshold for a hurricane. The storm was expected to spread rain squalls on a northeastward loop across North Carolina before passing back out to sea this weekend near Virginia Beach, Va. Governor Asks U.S. Aid Gov. James B. Hunt Jr. of North Carolina toured the battered barrier islands near here today. He asked President Reagan to expedite Federal disaster assistance for the two coastal counties hardest hit by the hurricane. Although a man died trying to secure his house as the storm approached and another was killed in an automobile accident about the time the hurricane came ashore, no deaths or injuries were directly related to the storm. The storm left property damage of untold millions, widespread power failures, and swollen rivers and creeks that overflowed their banks, making many highways impassable. The Weather Service said that as of 3 P.M., the Wilmington area had received 16 inches of rain over 58 hours. Hundreds of trees were toppled, many blocking roads, and erosion along some beaches was severe. Sand was pushed across highways. In some instances, it drifted against buildings like snow against a chalet. Some of the worst damage was on the barrier islands and in the beachfront communities at either side of Cape Fear. The North Carolina State Patrol said the most extensive damage was at Long Beach. There, the roof blew off the city hall, water four feet deep flooded streets, and an airport hangar collapsed on three planes. Damage there was estimated at more than $20 million. At Carolina Beach, officials said today that they would have to bring in two 5,000-gallon water tanker trucks because the winds had toppled the city's water tower. At Kure Beach, several mobile homes were demolished. 1954 Storm Is Recalled ''I think we weathered it real well,'' said Fire Chief Harold Hegler of Kure Beach, on the Atlantic about 17 miles south of Wilmington. Although the Weather Service said it was the worst storm in the Cape Fear area since Hurricane Hazel, which killed 11 people and demolished beachfront areas near Wilmington in 1954, Mr. Hegler found little basis for comparison. ''The difference between this storm and Hazel is that there were still buildings standing this morning along the beach,'' said Mr. Hegler. On the beach a block behind the fire station where Mr. Hegler labored today, the roof had been blown from a motel, and several homes were badly damaged. Broken electric cables dangled from poles bent by the wind and snaked across the roadway. Feint, but Not a Strike Nearby, the broken and splintered stump of the Kure Beach pier, which had extended 800 feet into the sea, was battered by waves six feet high and winds gusting at more than 60 miles an hour. It was the second time the storm had struck the pier. Part of the structure was demolished Tuesday when the storm first approached the coast here. It then veered back to sea. ''To tell you the truth, I was scared to death last night,'' said Bud Nelms, a tavern owner. ''I haven't been that frightened since I was in Korea.'' But he and many others expressed relief today that the storm appeared over. In downtown Wilmington, 70-mile- an-hour gusts and pounding rain flooded streets and cut off electrical power to more than 40,000 homes. Television stations were briefly blacked out. Telephone service was temporarily crippled. Some Ignored Warnings The storm's sudden reversal late Wednesday came as a surprise to some who, despite warnings, had returned to their homes in low-lying coastal or beachfront areas. At Holden Beach, in Brunswick County west of Wilmington, officials had to use buses to evacuate residents who had returned home Wednesday, believing the danger had passed. Tuesday and Wednesday more than 13,000 people moved into evacuation centers in five coastal communities near Wilmington. When the storm began to move west another 13,000 in sought shelter in South Carolina evacuation centers.

1033-> WEAPON'S QUALITY CONCERNS MILITARY
Top Pentagon armament buyers told a special Congressional panel on military procurement today that more attention needed to be paid to workmanship and quality control on weapons. ''It was something of a self-confession that they haven't done as much as they should have,'' said Senator Dan Quayle, Republican of Indiana, the chairman of the panel. At the first hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee's study group on military procurement, which was set up earlier this year to review issues such as the cost of spare parts and competition, the chiefs of materiel and logistics from three military services said contractors must bear the cost of shoddy construction. ''We aren't going to pay a single cent,'' Adm. Steven A. White, chief of Navy materiel, said regarding the poor workmanship recently discovered at the Hughes Aircraft Company in Tucson, Ariz. Hughes builds the Navy's AIM-54C Phoenix air-to-air missile, the Air Force's AGM-65D Maverick air-to- ground missile and the Army's EGM-71 TOW-2 antitank missile. Acceptance Halted The Pentagon has halted acceptance of each of the weapons pending improvement of the Tucson plant's quality control program. ''I don't anticipate any added cost'' for the missiles, said Gen. Lawrence A. Skantze, commander of the Air Force Systems Command. The officers said that Hughes officials would present a revamped quality control plan on Friday. Mr. Quayle described the study group's objective as ''getting the Armed Services Committee into oversight activity on procurement.'' On the issue of the pricing of spare parts, Gen. James P. Mullins, commander of the Air Force Logistics Command, said. ''Many of the allegations of reckless expenditures for common-use bit parts have not been well- founded.'' For example, he said, ''The $30 machine screws needed for the F-4 were not run-of-the-mill, galvanized steel fasteners available at the corner hardware store.'' At the Pentagon today, Maj. Gen. Dewey K. K. Lowe of the Air Force, replying to charges of overpricing on transport aircraft components, said the service had paid ''reasonable prices'' for the parts. Documents released this week by the Project on Military Procurement, a private watchdog group in Washington, indicated that a small rechargeable flashlight carried aboard C-5 transports was costing the Air Force $170.98 each. General Lowe described the flashlight as ''an emergency lighting system that will operate in the severest conditions imaginable.'' Microchips Being Tested WASHINGTON, Sept 13 - A top Pentagon official said today that nearly half the 4,700 types of improperly tested microchips made by Texas Instruments and sold to Defense Department contractors had now been cleared for use in military equipment. Richard DeLauer, assistant secretary for defense research and marketing, said there have been no failures of the chips so far. He predicted that none would occur. The Pentagon last week halted acceptance from more than 80 contractors of weapons' components containing the suspect chips. That action came after the International Business Machines Corporation said it might have purchased as many as 15 million of the improperty tested chips over the past eight years. Mr. DeLauer said the problem with the chips was one of inadequate testing rather than quality or workmanship. But he added that I.B.M. was partly to blame for not having made its own inspection of the tiny electronic components after buying them from Texas Instruments.

1034-> TRACK AND FIELD; LEWIS CAPTURES 100-METER TITLE BY 2 YARDS
Carl Lewis streaked to an impressive victory in the 100-meter dash tonight, winning the first of the four gold medals that he is seeking in the Olympic Games. The 23-year-old from Willingboro, N.J., who has a reputation for slow starts, was faster than usual off the blocks tonight but still had to come from behind to win in 9.99 seconds. He fell short of the world record of 9.93 by Calvin Smith in 1983 and the Olympic mark of 9.95 by Jim Hines in 1968, both set at high altitude. Lewis's margin of victory was two- tenths of a second, or about 2 yards, over the silver medalist, Sam Graddy, also of the United States. Graddy finished in 10.19. Wearing the red of the American team, Lewis bolted from the starting line as sunset was falling over the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. With his long legs seeming to churn effortlessly, the partisan crowd roaring thunderously, Lewis passed Graddy, the leader, and most of the others in eight-man field, at about 60 meters and pulled away. Ben Johnson of Canada, at 10.22 seconds, nipped Ron Brown for the bronze medal, ending hopes for an American sweep. After he passed the finish line, Lewis coasted for about 50 meters, jumping with his hands in the air as the crowd of 75,562 roared. He was handed a large American flag by one of the spectators, reportedly by Clyde Duncan, assistant track coach of the University of Washington and Lewis's former sprint coach at the University of Houston. Lewis jogged an additional 100 meters, waving it proudly. A few minutes after Lewis's victory, Al Joyner of East St. Louis, Ill., was declared the winner of the triple jump with a leap of 56 feet 7 1/2 inches. Mike Conley of Chicago won the silver at 56-4 1/2 and Keith Connor of Britain the bronze at 55-4 1/4. Things did not go quite so well for Joyner's younger sister, Jackie. She was narrowly beaten by Glynis Nunn of Australia for the gold medal in the women's heptathlon, 6,390 points to 6,387. Sabine Everts of West Germany won the bronze with 6,363. Miss Joyner had led until the last of the seven events, the 800-meter run, in which she slowed up after about 400 meters because of a pulled left hamstring. Lewis won on the second day of track and field competition, a day that had begun appropriately with a film tribute - shown on the Coliseum video screen - to his hero, Jesse Owens, the American who won four gold medals in the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. That is the feat that Lewis hopes to duplicate. Next on his schedule: the long-jump qualifying Sunday. After that, to win three more golds by next Saturday, he will have to take part in the long-jump final, four rounds of the 200-meter dash and three races in the 400-meter relay. ''As far as I'm concerned, 60 percent of it is over,'' Lewis said in a statement released to journalists. ''This is by far the toughest event for me because so much can happen. That's why I get so emotional when I win the 100, because it is the most difficult of the four in which I'm competing. ''If I'm behind in the 100, I don't get worried until the 80-meter mark. I got a good start tonight, but some of the others got out faster. Once I started to come on at about 50 meters, I relaxed and felt very confident.'' Earlier, Edwin Moses qualified for Sunday's final in the 400-meter hurdles by winning his 104th consective victory. Evelyn Ashford, the world record- holder in the women's 100-meter dash, won twice today, both times without seming to have to work very hard. She qualfied for Sunday's semifinals along with American teammtes, Jeanette Bolding and Alice Brown. Miss Brown won her second heat tonight by a comfortable margin but Miss Bolding had to settle for second place in the quarterfinals, losing to Grace Jackson of Jamaica. Moses, moving closer to the gold medal that he says he has dreamed of winning, turned in a performance that has become typical for him: He leaped off the starting block, cocked his head with chin held high and took off, never looking down as he bounded over the hurdles. At about 200 meters, he ran past the rest of the field, then finished in 48.51 seconds, about 20 yards ahead of of his closest pursuer, Tranel Hawkins, an American teammate from Moses's former hometown, Dayton, Ohio. A few minutes later, Danny Harris of the United States won the second semifinal heat in 48.92 seconds. The top four in each semifinal advanced. In the women's 800-meter run, Kim Gallagher and Ruth Wysocki of the United States qualified for Monday's final. A strong field qualified today for the men's semifinals in that 800 event, which will be held Sunday. The men's semifinalists included Joaquim Cruz of Brazil, Sebastian Coe and Steve Ovett of Britain, John Marshall, Johnny Gray and Earl Jones of the United States, and Kenya's Billy Konchellah and Edwin Koech. In the men's 400-meter run, the three American entrants, Alonzo Babers, Sunder Nix and Antonio McKay, won their qualifying heats to move into the quarterfinals on Sunday. In the women's 400, Chandra Cheeseborough, Lillie Leatherwood, and Valerie Brisco-Hooks of the United States all qualified for Sunday's semifinals. The biggest surprise came in the javelin throw, in which Duncan Atwood, America's second-ranked thrower who won the trials in June, barely advanced, qualifying 12th and last with a throw of 260 feet 4 inches. Tom Petranoff of the United States led all qualifiers for the final Sunday night with a throw of 282 feet. ''Practice was going well this week, in fact super,'' Atwood said. ''Then when I was warming up this morning I pulled a groin. After that I just didn't have anything.'' Also disappointed was the other American javelin thrower, Steven Roller, with a throw of 247 feet 8 inches.

1035-> A.T.& T. Adding To '800' Service
The American Telephone and Telegraph Company said it was preparing to extend its toll-free ''800'' service across the Atlantic Ocean to France. If approved, the service would allow American companies to offer customers in France an opportunity to reach them without charge to the caller. A.T.& T.'s plan to offer what it calls ''International 800 Service'' to France was disclosed in a filing with the Federal Communications Commission. The filing asks the agency's permission to submit proposed rates for the service shortly and then to have them take effect on 45 days' notice.

1036-> THE EVENING HOURS
THEY stood under the huge oils of Edwin Booth as Hamlet and Cardinal Richelieu, drinking whisky, eating tiny quiches and meatballs and remembering how it was at Lawrenceville way back in 1975. A reunion party of that private school near Princeton, N.J., was called a ''small but significant affair'' by its host, Peter Cromarty of the class of '75. The classmates chatting in the paneled enclaves of the Players in Gramercy Park seemed happy to be ''seeing people we haven't seen since graduation,'' Richard Grassey said. Nor was the party the other evening limited to graduates. According to another member of the class, Charles Wilfong, ''Once a member of a class at Lawrenceville, you're always a member,'' even if you were expelled. And the reason for the party? ''The creation of a reunion gift committee to set up a strategy for building a participation base,'' Mr. Wilfong said. Did he mean fund raising? ''Why yes,'' he replied. ''IGOT the Gielgud donated,'' Milton Goldman said. ''Of course I pressured everybody into doing things, but I'm proud that I got the Gielgud.'' Mr. Goldman, an actors' agent, stood among a display of drawings, cartoons, doodles and collages by such people as Sir John Gielgud, Chistopher Plummer, Jason Robards, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Lillian Gish, Tom Stoppard and Olivia de Havilland, waiting for them to be auctioned for the benefit of the New Dramatists. Mr. Goldman is chairman of the New Dramatists, an organization that financially supports unknown playwrights. Prospective buyers had convened for cocktails and hors d'oeuvres at Dunhill on Fifth Avenue Monday night for the third annual sale of ''celebrity doodles.'' For the occasion, Dunhill, which gave the party, flew John Heddle, former British National Auctioneer Champion, over from London to conduct the sale. Mr. Heddle, an elegant man, kept referring to Turnbull & Asser shirts worn by bidders, even as Dunhill people winced over the mention of the competition. He was introduced as ''a member of Parliament in Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative Government.'' He promised to ''bully and cajole'' prospective buyers. Indeed he did, raising more than $10,000, but nothing from the actress Geraldine Fitzgerald, who refrained from buying because, ''I simply couldn't decide.'' TEA with Proust was part of a late afternoon of whispers and chamomile, of madeleines and cucumber sandwiches and occasional gasps of gentle excitement. The occasion was a re-creation Tuesday of a tea and recital in a French salon, the sort of thing of which Marcel Proust would have approved, according to Howard Adams. Mr. Adams had brought along a ''small contingent of the faithful'' for tea. Mr. Adams is president of the Proust Club, which he said ''is not really an organization but an occasional gathering of the faithful.'' The faithful had been asked to the Versailles Room at the Carlyle to hear the actor Jeremy Irons, who plays Charles Swann in the film ''Swann in Love,'' read from Proust's work of the same name. Other Proust lovers such as Mike Nichols, Steve Martin and Jean Marsh were there. They seemed quite pleased to listen to Mr. Irons read his four pages as they sipped tea from Villeroy & Boch patterned china and heard the film's director, Volker Schl"ondorff, say ''at least now you can say that you've read Proust.'' ''ICOULDN'T wait to come to this,'' said the composer Sheldon Harnick. ''When I first came to New York I heard Mabel Mercer. I was so taken with her because she was able to make you feel that you were hearing a lyric for the first time.'' Mr. Harnick and two dozen other people had been invited by Don Smith to his East Side apartment Tuesday for what Mr. Smith called ''the American premiere'' of an hourlong British Broadcasting Corporation film of the late Mabel Mercer entitled ''Miss Mercer in Mayfair,'' made in 1977. The film of performances by Miss Mercer, who died April 20, has never been shown out of Britain. Mr. Smith, who represented the singer, wanted to ''show it to my friends.'' So he invited them in for desserts and Champagne, ''which Mabel liked,'' he said, and they watched a tape of the film on a television set in his living room. Mr. Smith said that before her death he had booked Miss Mercer into the St. Regis next February for what would have been her 85th birthday performance. ''Now?'' he said. ''I'm going to keep the date. We'll have a party for her there anyway.''

1037-> Late Selloff Hits Stocks; Dow Closes Down 14.80
Stock prices dropped yesterday in heavier trading, despite a cut in the prime rate by a major bank and the news that an agreement has been reached in the General Motors strike. The Dow Jones industrial average was on a seesaw, closing down 14.80 points, to 1,201.74, after being ahead almost 12 points at 11:30 A.M. The overall market did considerably better than the Dow average, with declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange only outscoring those that rose by 832 to 731. The early advance was fueled by the announcement of a three-year contract settlement between the General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers union, which reduced concern that the recently intensifying slowdown in the economy may eventually result in a recession, and by Morgan Guaranty Trust's decision to cut its prime rate to 12 3/4 percent, from 13 percent. Report of Sales by Salomon Analysts said that the market's late weakness resulted from investors' disappointment that other major banks did not follow Morgan's lead, and by reports that Salomon Brothers Inc. had instituted a major sell program for several of its institutional clients. The investment firm declined to comment on the reports. A Labor Department report that consumer prices rose five-tenths of 1 percent in August, or more than expected, also hurt equities. Turnover on the Big Board expanded to 120.6 million shares, from 92 million shares the day before, as institutional participation swelled. Bernard Spilko, a managing director of Julius Baer Securities Inc., said that, despite today's market performance, ''Equities should post strong gains over the near-term, if interest rates show more signs of easing.'' The two other major market indicators finished lower, with the Big Board's composite index off 0.84, to 95.67, while Standard & Poor's 500- stock index dropped 1.80, to 165.67. For the week, the Dow average dropped 35.78 points, after soaring 30.14 points in the preceding week. Turnover on the exchange this week expanded to 529.5 million shares from 501.8 million shares the week before. Northwest Industries Up 10 3/4 Northwest Industries was the standout performer yesterday, climbing 10 3/4 points, to 61, in heavy trading, buoyed by the news late Thursday that it had agreed to a $1 billion leverged buyout offer from an investor group. The large capitalization issues were the major losers, led by Merck, which dropped 2 1/2, to 82, and International Business Machines, off 1 3/4, to 124 1/4. Losses of a point or more were posted by Minnesota Mining, International Paper and Procter & Gamble. An exception was Kodak, which gained 1 1/4, to 73 1/4, after reporting it is shipping an improved disk film. Teledyne was the biggest loser in the list, dropping 10, to 282, following a loss of 7 3/4 points on Thursday. Analysts blamed profit takers. Gold Issues Strong The gold mining issues ended with impressive gains, helped by the belief that the dollar is topping out against other currencies.

1039-> U.S. WARNS NICARAGUA ON AIRPORT
An acquisition of advanced combat aircraft by Nicaragua would disrupt the balance of power in Central America and increase the threat Nicaragua poses in the region, the State Department said today. The department spokesman, John Hughes, made his comment a day after the Nicaraguan Government confirmed Reagan Administration assertions that a major military airport was being built northeast of Managua and that combat aircraft would be delivered once the installation is completed in 1985. On Thursday Nicaraguan officials led reporters on a tour of the airport, at Punta Huete, 13 miles from Managua. Mr. Hughes said the construction of the airport as well as the improvements and lengthening of several other military airfields ''would not appear directed, at least potentially, against Nicaragua's armed opposition as much as against Nicaragua's neighbors.'' He added that the acquisition of high- performance combat aircraft ''would alter the balance of power in the region.'' Aware of U.S. Position He said the Soviet Union and Cuba were well aware of the United States position on the subject. The Administration has said that some 50 Nicaraguan pilots have received training in Bulgaria in flying MIG jet fighters. There have also been reports from defectors that MIG's are being stored in Cuba for delivery to Nicaragua after the Nicaraguan elections, scheduled for November. Another official said recently that Cuban workers had been building the airport on a round-the-clock basis. President Reagan has estimated that 10,000 Cubans are aiding the Sandinistas in a variety of capacities. According to Nicaraguan officials, the main runway would be 4,400 yards and an alternate runway is planned for 3,900 yards. American officials said either one could easily accommodate MIG jets.

1040-> GENERAL MOTORS AND UNION REACH TENTATIVE ACCORD
The United Automobile Workers and the General Motors Corporation reached agreement early today on a tentative three-year contract providing wage increases, added pension benefits and job security. In another major settlement that includes new provisions to protect the jobs of workers threatened by layoffs, the United Mine Workers and the Bituminous Coal Operators Association agreed today on a 40-month contract. (Page 10.) The General Motors settlement, at the end of a 16-hour bargaining session, came six days after the union began selective strikes that shut down over half of the manufacturer's car and truck production, idling about 110,000 workers. The pact covers 350,000 workers. Each Side Silent on Details Neither the company nor the union would release details of the settlement, but sources here said it included a first-year pay raise averaging about about 2.5 percent, with lump-sum payments of about 2.5 percent in the following two years. The job security program, which the union made its No. 1 priority this year, provides a new $1 billion fund to pay workers displaced from their jobs until other jobs are found for them or, in some cases, they are retrained. The company also extended certain ''commitments'' to continue production in this country. ''We view the agreement as an excellent settlement,'' said Owen F. Bieber, the president of the union, at an early- morning news conference. ''I believe it is indeed an historic settlement.'' G.M. Official Is 'Delighted' Alfred S. Warren Jr., the company's vice president for industrial relations, said he was ''delighted'' with the contract. ''We come out of these negotiations in a better competitive position than we went in,'' he said. Wall Street analysts generally said that at least the contract would not put the company at any greater disadvantage in the worldwide market. (Page 10.) Although union leaders have said the settlement at General Motors sets a pattern for the automobile industry, Peter J. Pestillo, the Ford Motor Company's vice president for labor relations, has said his company will not ''walk in lockstep'' with G.M. Negotiations at Ford are not expected to begin until the General Motors contract is ratified. The Chrysler Corporation's contract does not expire until a year from now. Profit-Sharing to Be RetainedThe profit-sharing provisions of the previous contract, which will yield each General Motors worker about $1,000 this year, were said to have been retained, along with the cost of living adjustments that protect workers against inflation. Pension payments would increase to $1,205 a month by the third year of the contract, from the current maximum of $935. The scope of the contract represents a return to normal for the union, which gave $3.5 billion in wage and benefit concessions to General Motors and Ford in the industry's slump in 1982. With the pact in hand, the union immediately directed its locals to end their strikes at 17 G.M. facilities. Although the picket signs went down quickly, a company spokesman said normal operations could not be resumed until Monday, at the earliest. The effects of the strikes at 15 assembly plants had rippled into the company's parts-producing operations. The company spokesman said it might be days before normal production resumed. The agreement is expected to be approved by the union's 26-member international executive board Tuesday and will be submitted to the 300-member G.M. council meeting in St. Louis Wednesday. If approved there, the contract will be submitted to the workers for ratification. A 'Ballpark' Settlement ''This is an expensive settlement, but not a record-setting one,'' said an industry executive familiar with labor negotiations. ''It is sort of a ballpark automotive settlement, maybe a little less.'' Union officals predicted ratification, but said they would have to work hard to sell the package to workers. ''I think it's going to be fairly tough,'' said Stanley Marshall, director of the union's Region 1C in Flint. He said the staggered pay increase in the first year, under which skilled tradesmen are to receive raises of 41 cents an hour, or 3.5 percent, as against 9 cents an hour, or 1 percent, for floor sweepers and other lower-ranking workers, could cause resentment. ''We also have to see about this job security program,'' he added. ''A billion sounds like a lot of money, but spread over six years, will it be enough?'' The fund was General Motors's response to the union's insistence on a way to secure the jobs of its members, 250,000 of whom were laid off from the three major American automobile makers in the depths of the sales slump in the early 1980's. Keeping or Dropping Workers The provisions of the contract indicate that G.M. declined to keep people working whose places had been taken by automation or by shifts of production to other sources, but provided the equivalent in income maintenance. According to sources close to the matter, workers being paid from the fund will have to accept whatever work is available, regardless of their classification. The U.A.W. has negotiated income maintenance plans in the past, but for workers idled by the up-and-down nature of the industry, not for those displaced by changes sweeping the industry. The company apparently yielded little to union efforts to limit purchases from outside sources, providing money, instead, for workers affected by such actions. The selective local strikes also represented a new tactic that avoided the criticism and cost that a nationwide strike would have aroused and permitted an end to the walkout before the new contract was ratified. Mr. Warren said no single matter had delayed the bargainers for six days after the strike deadline. ''It was a very involved negotiation, very complicated in terms of tryingto grant security and still remain competitive,'' he said. Hostile Reaction in Jersey LINDEN, N.J., Sept. 21 (AP) - Nearly 1,000 automobile workers hissed and booed today after they were ordered at a rally to return to work Monday at the General Motors assembly plant here. Members of Local 595 of the United Automobile Workers walked out at midnight Sept. 14 over local contract issues, and many said they were disappointed now. ''We got the short end of the stick,'' said Ron Bigelow, an executive board member of Local 595.

1041-> CAMPAIGN NOTES ; Reagan Schedules Visit To Upstate New York
President Reagan will campaign in New York State and Tennessee next week, appearing before groups of the elderly, Italian-Americans and Polish-Americans, touring high-technology facilities and paying an 81st birthday tribute to Roy Acuff, the country singer. Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, said today that the President would fly to Buffalo on Wednesday to attend the dedication ceremony for Santa Maria Towers, a residential facility for the elderly sponsored by the Roman Catholic diocese of Buffalo. Mr. Reagan is also scheduled to attend a lunch at D'Youville College sponsored by the Italian-American Society and the St. Stanislaw Society. Later in the day, Mr. Reagan plans to travel to Broome County, where he is to tour the systems technology division of the International Business Machnes Corporation. On Thursday, Mr. Reagan will fly to Nashville for a meeting with high-technology officials. Mr. Reagan is to meet with Mr. Acuff in his home and then attend a birthday salute for the long-time star of the Grand Old Opry in the Roy Acuff Theater.

1042-> MORGAN GUARANTY TRIMS PRIME RATE
E. Gerald Corrigan has been named president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Page 39. The Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, the nation's fifth-largest bank, reduced its prime lending rate yesterday to 12 3/4 percent, from 13 percent. It was the first decline in this key lending rate since February 1983, when the rate was reduced to 10 1/2 percent, from 11 percent. No other major bank followed Morgan's move, but a number of others are expected to do so soon. ''It will spread,'' said Alan C. Lerner, senior vice president and economist of the Bankers Trust Company. Mr. Lerner based his prediction on the assumption, which is widely shared, that the Federal Reserve System has eased its reins on the supply of money to the economy. In Washington, the Administration - whose re-election chances could be helped by a decline in interest rates - urged other banks to follow Morgan's move. ''We see it as a hopeful sign,'' said Marlin Fitzwater, a White House spokesman. ''We hope that other banks will follow and that it will be the first of more reductions.'' Scott Widmeyer, deputy press secretary for the Mondale campaign, said Mr. Mondale had no statement on the bank's action. Many Rates Linked to Prime Many other interest rates are linked to the prime rate. Its biggest impact is on small and medium-sized companies, whose interest rates are almost always tied to the prime. In recent years, the prime has taken on more direct significance for individuals because banks are increasingly linking rates charged on personal loans to the prime as well. Rates on many foreign loans are also based on the prime and, if the reduction becomes widespread, it could ease the pressure on the financially troubled countries of Latin America. Morgan, as is its practice, did not explain its move. But bank analysts believe, along with Mr. Lerner, that Morgan is responding to indications that the Federal Reserve has been injecting more money into the economy. This usually causes interest rates to decline, as they have been. Since the end of August, rates on Treasury bills have dropped by about a third of a percentage point, to 10.25 percent, from 10.62 percent. Similarly, the cost to banks of issuing large certificates of deposit with three- month maturities has declined to 11.15 percent, from 11.55 percent at the end of August. In addition, the financial markets have become increasingly confident that the Federal Reserve will continue its easier monetary policy because of the recent slowing of the extremely rapid economic growth experienced in the first half or this year. When Fed Moves Rates Generally, the Federal Reserve worries that excessive economic growth will lead to inflation. Consequently, when business expansion seems stronger than can be maintained without causing inflation, the Federal Reserve tighten the supply of money to the economy. That pushes interest rates upward. ''Most banks will follow on Monday'' and reduce their prime rates, said J. Richard Fredericks, a bank stock analyst and partner in the San Francisco firm of Montgomery Securities. Mr. Fredericks added that, based on the lower cost of funds to the banks, the reduction in the prime ''was justified, but just barely.'' Morgan's move, he continued, reflected the low level of loan demand at the major New York banks and represented an attempt by Morgan to increase its business. Some economists predicted yesterday that other banks might not take any action until they could reduce their rates by half a percentage point, to 12 1/2 percent, skipping the intermediate step of 12 3/4 percent. Philip Braverman, chief economist at Briggs, Schaedele & Company, a securities trading subsidiary of the Irving Trust Company, described Morgan's action as a ''pre-emptive strike'' intended to discourage other banks from cutting their prime rates a half-point. Action Called Premature ''It was a premature move meant to stop other banks from moving the prime by a half,'' Mr. Braverman said. One medium-sized bank, the Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company of Buffalo, went that step yesterday. ''There's been a reduction in our cost of funds, and we'd like to help our customers in western New York,'' said Robert G. Wilmers, the bank's chairman and chief executive. He also cited the recent slowdown in economic growth as a factor in the bank's reduction of its prime by a half point, to 12 1/2 percent. Smaller banks elsewhere in the country followed Morgan to 12 3/4 percent. They included the Mitsui Manufacturers Bank in Los Angeles and the Southwest Bank of St. Louis. Some analysts, however, predicted that most of the other major banks, to bolster lagging profits, would wait as long as possible before lowering their prime. ''We're trying to squeeze out every penny for earnings that we can,'' said a leading New York banker who asked not to be identified. Morgan's action came on the heels of other positive economic developments. These included a Government report that indicated economic growth was slowing to an annual rate of 3.6 percent in this year's third quarter from what had been considered an unsustainable level of 7.1 percent in the second quarter. Other favorable news was a tentative labor agreement between the General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers union; the agreement was widely considered not to be inflationary. Although the quarter-point reduction in the prime rate was meager - the last move that small was in February 1982, when it rose to 16 1/2 percent, from 16 1/4 percent - it was seen as a psychologically important move, especially because it came just before the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank that open in Washington next Monday.

1043-> FARMERS WELCOME REAGAN'S LOAN PLAN BUT ASK FOR MORE AID
Farmers seem generally receptive to President Reagan's initiative this week to keep more debt-ridden farmers from being forced off the land, although they say it is more of a ''first step'' than a final solution to the nagging financial problems of the agricultural sector. On Tuesday, Mr. Reagan announced a package of Federal loan guarantees, interest subsidies and other steps to ease financial pressures on farmers caught between low crop prices and high costs and interest rates. In interviews as the President traveled Thursday to Iowa, the heart of the corn belt, several farm leaders said they sensed the winds of politics as well as those that sweep the prairies every harvest time. Despite the President's denial, they saw election-year politics behind Mr. Reagan's plan and a similar program announced recently by Walter F. Mondale, his Democratic opponent. With a few exceptions, farmers' reactions were partisan. But they all acknowledged the convincing power an incumbent President has compared to a challenger's paper proposals. Finances Motivate Voters ''Farmers are all different,'' said Varel Bailey, president of the National Corn Growers Association, ''but the one thing every farmer takes into that voting booth is his wallet.'' Mr. Bailey, whose organization has 14,000 corn farmers in 16 states, said, ''It's positive the Administration recognizes the agricultural financial crisis out here, though we're not sure it understands the magnitude.'' ''It's a very good plan,'' said Howard Ward, a Kansas wheat farmer, who estimates a third of his area's farmers are in serious financial trouble, a third are marginally successful and a third are prospering. Mr. Ward was particularly pleased with Mr. Reagan's incentives for private lenders to forgive part of the debts rather than what he saw as Mr. Mondale's move toward greater government involvement. But Mr. Ward had doubts about a plan to forgive interest payments for five years on a quarter of each loan in danger of default. ''If there's no adjustment in the interest rate,'' said Mr. Ward, ''that just means it's the same debt five years older at the same interest rate. What's the point?'' Plans Called Drop in Bucket David Ostendorf, Middle West coordinator for Rural America, a rural advocacy group, said neither party's plans addressed the scale of the farm financial crisis. ''The President says loan guarantees of $630 million,'' said Mr. Ostendorf, ''And Mondale says $750 million. It's a drop in the bucket, political gobbledegook. The farm debt in Iowa alone is $17 billion. Nationally, it's $215 billion.'' Mr. Ostendorf said neither party realized the situation's seriousness. He added, ''I'd like to show the candidates the stricken families, the dying communities, local food programs feeding farmers, the lines at mental health clinics. By the end of 1985 11,000 more farms, 60,000 people, will be lost in Iowa alone. Where do they go? Both parties are playing politics with peoples' lives.'' ''I recognize,'' said Dick Steffen, a lifelong Democrat who farms near Cedar Rapids, Iowa, ''that some people need temporary debt deferral. But if that's all these guys propose, it'll just amass more debt. We don't need Band- Aids. We need stronger crop prices and lower interest rates.'' ''Agriculture could flourish again around 7 or 8 percent interest,'' said Mr. Ward, who noted that 22 percent of the nation's work force was tied somehow to agriculture. ''These people can't spend if they aren't earning.'' 'Hayseed Vote' Seen as Target Merle Hansen, president of the North American Farm Alliance, a coalition of liberal farm groups, called the President's package ''a real clumsy political gimmick to harvest the hayseed vote.'' But he and Mr. Steffen detected more political interest toward and among farmers this year. One bankrupt farmer, Darrell Ringer of Quinter, Kan., is even running for a House seat against Pat Roberts, a Republican incumbent. Mr. Ringer, who has declared bankruptcy due to $300,000 in farm debts, felt farmers would not be ''hoodwinked by the President's pre-election Christmas present.''

1045-> FOLLOW-UP ON THE NEWS; Cat Slayer
Someone, it appeared, had an intense grudge against cats in Indianapolis. In less than two months nearly 100 had been clubbed to death at night on the city's East Side. Spay- Neuter Services Inc., a voluntary animal group, put up a $100 reward in February for the arrest and conviction of the culprit. Within days, donors from Vermont to California raised the reward fund to $2,000. A suspect, 25-year-old Aaron Parks, has been arrested. He is to be tried Oct. 25 on a charge of cruelty to animals. Michael Robak, deputy prosecutor of Marion County, says three witnesses will testify that they saw Mr. Parks killing cats. If convicted, he faces a maximum of six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. The witnesses stand to share the reward, now $3,000. ''With the reward,'' says Velda R. Boenitz, president of Spay-Neuter Services, ''I believe we had almost entire neighborhoods out in the middle of the night, watching.''

1047-> Sting Moves to Finals
The Chicago Sting moved into the final round of the North American Soccer League playoffs by defeating the Vancouver Whitecaps, 4-3, tonight in the third game of the semifinal series. The Sting will have the home-field advantage against the Toronto Blizzard in the two-of-three Soccer Bowl series, which begins Monday. Vancouver scored first tonight in record time. Bob Lenarduzzi headed one in at the 46-second mark, the quickest goal in N.A.S.L. history. The Sting tied the game 15 minutes later on a header by Manny Rojas. The Sting's Pato Margetic then scored two goals in less than three minutes, at 36:54 and 39:26, giving Chicago a 3-1 lead at halftime. Karl-Heinz Granitza, who had two assists in the first half, increased Chicago's lead to 4-1 with a goal at 65:55. But Vancouver came back with two goals, at 71:36 by Chuck Stock and at 77:39 by Ralph Mazzucco, to cut the margin to 4-3. The first Soccer Bowl game will be played Monday in Chicago's Comiskey Park and the second Wednesday in Toronto. A third game, if necessary, will be played in Comiskey Park on Oct. 7.

1049-> Your Money; Appointing A Conservator
A CONSERVATOR is appointed by a court to manage the affairs of an adult who has not been declared judicially incompetent, but who is considered unable to manage his or her finances or property. The office has drawn attention recently because the publicized financial activities of John A. Zaccaro, husband of Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro, the Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate, focused on his role as a conservator. In addition, last week the top judges of New York State decided to establish formal guidelines for a conservatorship. Although each state has its own statutes concerning conservators, there are general principles regarding the system by which they are appointed. For the conservator concept has developed out of an older process under which a person is declared to be ''incompetent,'' with all of the stigma that that word carries, and an individual or individuals are assigned by a court to act as guardian. In contrast, the conservatee, or incapacitated person, is typically unable to care for his property or for others dependent on him for support because of such factors as advanced age, illness, infirmity, mental weakness, alcohol abuse or addiction to drugs - and someone else is selected to take charge of that person's well-being. ''Conservator is a good term, since it says what he or she is supposed to do: preserve the assets and provide for care,'' said Peter J. Strauss, partner of the New York law firm of Strauss & Wolf. ''The conservatorship procedure is somewhat less expensive than the incompetency proceeding and involves no loss of legal rights.'' The process for appointing a conservator in New York is governed by Article 77 of the Mental Hygiene Law and is similar to that used elsewhere. Someone - it can be a relative, friend, physician or other interested party - initiates the proceeding by petitioning the court to appoint a conservator. A judge then determines if an appointment is warranted and, if it is deemed to be, chooses the conservator. In most instances, relatives are named as conservators, providing there is no conflict of interest or apparent lack of ability. But at other times, another person, who is not required to be a lawyer, is appointed as the fiduciary - and this is where political influence and favoritism are often determining factors in some states. Why is a conservatorship frequently such a desirable appointment? The answer is the fees. In New York, they are fixed by the courts, whose practice is to allow the same commission as an executor would get. That commission is 5 percent on the first $100,000 of the conservatee's assets, with the rate declining in percentage point steps to 2 percent for the excess over $5 million. This conservator, in turn, must normally post a security bond, typically equal to the value of the conservatee's assets and twice his annual income. The conservator also has to file an annual accounting of receipts and disbursements, which, in New York, is reviewed by another person known as a referee. In addition, the fee, which is payable only once, in not awarded in one payment, but is instead split during the term of the conservatorship. Specialists in this field say there are a number of ways to avoid the appointment of a conservator and its accompanying court proceedings. The most common technique is through the use of a general power of attorney - which delegates authority to another to perform certain acts on your behalf - specifically containing appropriate language dealing with its validity during incompetency or incapacity. This document may be called a durable power of attorney. Another, more complex, device is the creation of a living, or inter vivos, trust, naming a trustee to manage and distribute your assets in keeping with your instructions. A category of living trust that would go into effect only when the individual who established the trust is unable to manage his or her affairs is called a standby trust. This trust is not funded at the outset, but can declare that in the event of incapacity, as certified by a physician, the property of the individual who established the trust is transferred, to be managed according to previously stated terms and conditions. Whether it involves the naming of a conservator or the drafting of a power of attorney or living trust, the services of a lawyer are useful. For incapacity could strike anyone and an incapacitated person's assets might be quickly dissipated unless protected. As Mr. Strauss said: ''The problems of life are much more difficult than the problems of death. To me, the biggest tax is the cost of health care.''

1050-> 49-6 Rout For Norwich
Norwich University struck for four first-quarter touchdowns in roaring to a 49-6 victory in the 50th renewal of its rivalry with the Coast Guard Academy. The Norwich defensive back Steve Cavallo intercepted the first two passes from the quarterback Kurt Cox deep in Coast Guard territory and the Cadets converted both turnovers into touchdowns on runs of 1 and 31 yards by the tailback Winnfield Brooks. Norwich also scored on its next two possessions on drives of 45 and 84 yards to open a 28-0 lead. The Norwich quarterback Mike Gallagher, passing for over 200 yards for the third straight game, hit the wide receiver Beau Almodobar for third-quarter touchdowns of 54 and 43 yards and the freshman tailback Todd Williams ran 3 yards in the fourth quarter to close out the scoring. Almodobar broke the school reception record with eight catches for 197 yards.

1051-> TROPICAL STORM MOVES BACK INLAND AS FORECASTERS WATCH FOR BUILDUP
Tropical Storm Isidore, fed by warm waters from both the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean, moved off Florida's west coast today and traveled northeast back across the state, leaving one dead and a trail of beach- eating high tides in its wake. ''The whole state is all caught up in the circulation of Isidore,'' said Andy Stern of the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, near Miami. One man was electrocuted Thursday night by a downed power line in Oviedo in central Florida. Another man, in Orlando, was injured when his plane flipped as he tried to land in high winds. Isidore, with top sustained winds of 50 miles an hour, had swept northwest across the state toward the Gulf of Mexico early today but by morning had slowly changed course to the northeast. At midnight, Isidore's ''broad center of circulation'' was located just off the Georgia coast, 50 miles south-southeast of Savannah, near latitude 31.2 north and longitude 80.8 west. It was moving northeast at 10 miles an hour and was expected to move over the Atlantic parallel to the Georgia and South Carolina coasts tonight and Saturday, the weather service said. ''We would not be surprised at all to see it strengthen some'' as it turns toward the Atlantic, said a forecaster, Bob Case. ''I wouldn't use the term 'likely,' but the potential to strengthen increases as a storm gets offshore. ''It all depends how far away the center of circulation gets from the coast.'' Gale warnings were posted from Cape Canaveral north to Little River Inlet, S.C. Small craft in the gale areas were advised to remain in port. The weather service said Isidore could bring up to 5 inches of rain and severe thunderstorms to north Florida and southeast Georgia. Tampa, on the Gulf of Mexico, and Jacksonville and Daytona Beach near the Atlantic had reported about 4 inches by this morning. Motorists in northeast Florida were advised to use caution. Wind-driven waves were breaking over the seawall at Jacksonville Beach at midday, said Jack Schnabel, weather service meteorologist. Jacksonville and nearby St. Augustine had already reported some street flooding as the storm approached, and about 10,000 Jacksonville Electric Authority residents temporarily lost power this morning. Near Orlando, Randi William Nichols, 21, was electrocuted Thursday evening as he got into his truck, evidently unaware that a power line, ''probably knocked down by branches'' in high winds, fell onto the bumper of his pickup, said Oviedo police records clerk Maggie Metcalf. Meanwhile, tropical storm Hortense, with highest sustained winds of 45 miles an hour, was making ''small looping movements'' in the Atlantic about 200 miles southeast of Bermuda, forecasters said at 10:30 P.M. Hortense's center was near latitude 30.3 north, longitude 62.6 west. Little change in strength was expected by Saturday night. While Florida was being whipped by a tropical storm, a travelers advisory was issued for the northern and central Colorado mountains as snow continued to fall over eastern Colorado and extreme western Kansas. Evergreen, Colo., had seven inches of snow, while Empire and Golden reported five inches. The heavy, wet snow pulled down power lines and left more than 9,000 residents of suburban Denver without electricity. Incoming flights at Stapleton International Airport were reduced from 60 to 40 an hour. In Boulder, a Public Service Company spokesman, Dave Carlson said some ''pretty significant problems'' were reported due to downed power lines, and between 2,000 and 4,000 customers were without electricity. Temperatures hovered below freezing in parts of northeastern Colorado and southwestern Wyoming as cold Canadian winds blew across the Plains and upper Middle West. Freeze warnings were posted for Michigan's Upper Peninsula and northwestern Kansas, and frost warnings for Lower Michigan, northern and central Illinois and southern and central Wisconsin.

If there's one thing the violinist Eugene Fodor wants more than anything in the world, it's for the musical public to forget about his past. Not his entire past - until a decade ago, when he won the silver medal at the Tchaikovsky Competition, in Moscow, he had been living a charmed life. He was 24 then, and he had been performing publicly since he was 9, touring from age 12, and playing with major orchestras since he was 16. There were lessons with Ivan Galamian and Josef Gingold, a scholarship to Juilliard, and master classes with Jascha Heifetz. And by the time he entered the Tchaikovsky, he had already won 10 smaller-scale violin competitions and had even taken the top prize at a local piano contest. Yet, within a year of his victory in Moscow, Mr. Fodor's luck began running out, and his career became a classic example of unfulfilled promise. Mainly, he had an image problem, and everything he did made it worse. His publicists, anxious to capitalize on his western roots, cast him as a horse-riding outdoorsman bound for glory in the classical music world. The personality magazines loved it; the music press found it cloying hype. Mr. Fodor's early interviews didn't help much, either. When he wasn't talking about jogging or horses, he spoke brashly of his own prowess and of his disregard for critics. Meanwhile, some of his recordings, many of his concerts and virtually all of his television appearances focused on the flashy, superficially virtuosic end of his repertory, and confirmed the impressions of those who considered him little more than a shallow competition whiz kid. ''But none of that was what I was really about,'' insists Mr. Fodor, who hopes that his Carnegie Hall recital, Friday evening, will help lay some of those old ghosts to rest. For the violinist, now older, wiser and a lot more reflective, this concert is a chance to show that he's neither flippant, frivolous, flashy or overly theatrical. And in aid of his quest to restore his reputation, he has chosen a program much meatier than those his detractors remember him for - sonatas by Mozart, Brahms, Prokofiev and John Corigliano, with a bit of Tchaikovsky and Wieniawski at the end, for old times' sake. His aim, actually, is not so much to unveil a new Eugene Fodor, but to let the public see the violinist that's been lurking behind the cowboy image all these years. Even so, he has been devoting a good deal of time, lately, to looking anew at his life as a touring virtuoso, and to reordering his priorities. ''Until last season, I was playing 90 to 100 concerts a year. But I've cut that to between 50 and 70, and taken a kind of sabbatical, because I've felt the need to sit back and reevaluate my life and music,'' he told a visitor recently. ''I wanted to be sure that the existence I was living was what I really wanted. Not that I had any doubts about being a musician - music is the focus of my life, the most important thing in it. But I needed to think about what I am, what I do best, and which areas I need to work the hardest in. And all that self-analysis helped me pull everything together. ''I realized, first of all, that I needed more time to learn new music, particularly contemporary pieces. I knew that I would have to work harder at building my interpretations, and at grasping the true meaning and essence of each piece I play. And I wanted to try and structure my repertory and programs in a way that allows me to feel I'm doing justice to the music I love. That comes with a certain maturity, I guess. And running around the world playing 100 concerts a year is not really the way to understand your growth or expand your repertory.'' Mr. Fodor has also, naturally, thought long and hard about the reasons his career took the course it did. And although he's reluctant to blame anyone else for his problems, he maintains that he has always been thoroughly serious about his art. ''Having all that instant recognition, and all those invitations to play with the world's great orchestras can make you feel very busy and very much in demand,'' he admitted. ''Not that I took any of it for granted, but maybe I was a bit brash. And the publicity did focus on non-musical things. There was the catchiness, or the good copy, of being from Turkey Creek, Colo., and living on a ranch where I had grown up around horses. ''But just because I was photographed on horseback didn't mean I wasn't practicing five hours a day. All the time, I was getting up at 7 in the morning and playing Bartok, but the interviews and publicity didn't reflect that. I wanted to be judged on the merits of my playing, not on what I do with my personal life. I have to admit, I didn't do all that much to curb that: I didn't push it, but I didn't fight it, either. ''And I don't think you can blame me for walking the line between a public image and the priorities of the music establishment. Some artists can balance the two very easily, and I always thought that whatever the image was, my playing would speak for itself. It does, to a certain extent. But there are people who don't always get to hear you play, and who know you through what they read. Now it's apparent that there are aspects of my image that the musical establishment can't take seriously, although I've always been able to please the public, and that's very important to me. ''In fact,'' he added, ''there was a degree to which my interest in sports and in the outdoors brought me a lot of attention from a segment of the public that doesn't normally attend classical music concerts. I had them arriving in throngs. So my thought, at the time, was 'Boy, let's keep this ball rolling.' I thought that by keeping that alive, I was doing my duty as a kind of ambassador of the arts. I suppose that's something I would have done differently. I wouldn't have viewed it as a cause of mine to popularize classical music.'' Another of Mr. Fodor's belated realizations is that he should have maintained firmer control of his repertory. But there, too, early successes proved too seductive to resist. For one thing, there was the lure of the television talk show circuit - hardly the forum for Bach's unaccompanied sonatas, but suitable for dazzling encores. And then there were concertos that started out as calling cards and soon became albatrosses. Paganini's First Concerto was one: He hadn't touched the work until 1972, the year he won the Paganini Competition. ''When I started playing the Paganini concerto in public,'' he recalled, ''it worked nicely. Audiences were giving me standing ovations after the first movement; and, I have to admit, there was a kinetic joy in knocking off those double harmonics, pizzicato passages and rapid runs in tenths, and hearing audible gasps. But then word got out that I played the piece well, and conductors kept asking for it. I guess I should have stuck to my guns and said, 'No - I want to play Beethoven, Brahms or Mozart.' But their interest was very flattering, and as I said, I like to please people.'' If Mr. Fodor has his wish, all those dilemmas will remain behind him, and he'll be able to surmount the problems and prejudices of the last 10 years. Things do seem to be looking brighter for him: His new managers, he says, are able to persuade orchestra managers and conductors that he has been misunderstood in the past, and now doors that were closed to him are opening. In the last couple of years, for instance, he has undertaken tours with European orchestras playing Beethoven and Brahms rather than Paganini and Tchaikovksy, and he is getting ready to play recitals in London, Paris and other musical centers he has missed since the mid-1970's. He is also about to revive his recording career, which has lain dormant since 1979, with a handful of new disks that will take in both standard and contemporary works. ''You know,'' he said, ''the problem of an image and the intricacies of a career are not unique to me. I'm sure many other artists have gone through lots of agonizing hours. Some can handle it more easily than others. But I'm an honest musician, that's the important thing. In the past, I probably wasn't being myself as much as I am now, and now I'm living a quieter, happier life. The image - well, that was something you could take to the box office. It wasn't manufactured, though: I do run four miles a day, and I do think horses are beautiful, esthetic animals. ''I'm sorry if that alienated people, or made them feel I wasn't serious about music. But I am, and I'm falling more in love all the time with music, the arts, and the creative infinity that the violin is capable of expressing. I feel I'm lucky to be playing an instrument that is truly one of the most noble ever devised, and which has expressive possibilities without limit. And it's that feeling I'm trying to keep fresh in my mind and in my soul.''

1054-> EDITORS' NOTE
Under this heading, The Times amplifies articles or rectifies what the editors consider significant lapses of fairness, balance or perspective. The main front-page headline yesterday, on the terrorist car bombing in Lebanon, said, ''23 Die, Including 2 Americans.'' It was based on a Beirut dispatch that began, ''A suicide car bomber raced through a hail of gunfire today and devastated the United States Embassy here, killing at least 23 people and wounding scores.'' The count of dead and wounded came from the Beirut state radio, which quoted the Lebanese police. Yesterday the figures were called into question by a variety of sources in Lebanon, whose own numbers ranged widely. (Details appear today on pages 1 and 4.) The Times's policy, except when reporting what its correspondents have seen or heard first hand, is to specify sources. For accuracy, the toll in Beirut should have been attributed to the police, and the headline should have said ''23 Reported Dead.''

1055-> 'STRANGER THAN PARADISE,' A TRIO ON THE ROAD
Jim Jarmusch's ''Stranger Than Paradise'' looks as if it had been left on the windowsill too long. Shot in 16- millimeter black-and-white, and now blown up to 35 millimeter, its images appear to have been aged by the sun and by general neglect until they've faded into a uniform shade of gray. When, occasionally, there's a splotch of comparatively pure black or white, the effect is disorienting until you recognize what Mr. Jarmusch is up to - that is, discovering the ludicrously sublime in the supremely tacky. The film, a prize-winner at this year's Cannes festival, is something quite special. ''Stranger Than Paradise'' will be shown at the New York Film Festival at Alice Tully Hall tonight at 9 o'clock and tomorrow at 4:30 P.M., and will open its regular commercial engagement at the Cinema Studio 2 on Monday. Among other things, it is one of the most original, wonderfully oddball, independent American films to turn up at the Lincoln Center festival in years, or at least since the showing of Eagle Pennell's ''Last Night at the Alamo'' last year. The two films otherwise don't have much in common except their tiny budgets and each director's rare appreciation for the ridiculous. ''Last Night at the Alamo'' is a gregarious sort of comedy, full of oversize emotions and good humor. By comparision, ''Stranger Than Paradise'' is inhibited, its visual manners almost as lazy as those of Rainer Werner Fassbinder's ''Katzelmacher,'' in which the camera often seems just too tired to follow a character as he walks off- screen, knowing full well that if it waits long enough, the character will walk back on. ''Stranger Than Paradise'' is a ''Marty'' that Jean-Paul Sartre might have appreciated, about hanging out, not in hell but in a permanent purgatory. This world sometimes looks like an eerily underpopulated New York City, a rundown but genteel working- class section of Cleveland or that scrubby part of the east coast of Florida that has yet to be transformed into a vacation paradise, where the motels always have vacancies, even at the height of the season, and where the swimming pools are filled with weeds, not water. Though Mr. Jarmusch's screenplay does contain a number of subsidiary roles, it's virtually a three-character piece. They are Willie (John Lurie), a 30ish, horse-faced fellow who, though Hungarian-born, has been in this country 10 years and has no trace of any accent; his pal Eddie (Richard Edson), who looks like a condensed version of Willie, even down - or up - to the cheap fedoras they seldom remove, even to sleep, and Eva (Eszter Balint), Willie's pretty, 16- year-old cousin from Budapest who is forced to spend 10 days at Willie's grimy little New York room before going on to live with an elderly aunt in Cleveland. Until the arrival of Eva, Willie appears to be perfectly content with his life on the outer fringes of capitalism. He has no visible means of support, and appears to make ends meet by playing the horses and occasionally cheating at cards. At first the presence of the taciturn, pony-tailed Eva seems a rude intrusion to Willie, especially when she asks why TV dinners are called TV dinners or what a quarterback does when his team is on defense. She's a drag until she casually shoplifts food and cigarettes for them, at which point Willie begins to see her as a kindred spirit. He gets so carried away by what passes for affection in his life that he even buys her a present. When she opens the shopping bag and takes out the dress, her brow furrows. ''Well?'' says Willie. ''I think it's kind of ugly,'' says Eva. They speak the same language. ''Stranger Than Paradise'' is about the curious, unspoken alliance of Willie, Eva and Eddie and their adventures in New York, Cleveland and, finally, Florida. They are as lost but also as quietly gallant in the American paradise as the three German misfits who seek their fortunes in Wisconsin in Werner Herzog's ''Stroszek.'' The film has no big scenes, and it takes a while to get the hang of it, but once you do, it's as funny as it is wise. Mr. Jarmusch isolates the film's series of tiny vignettes by extended blackouts that, at the beginning, seem to be an affectation, but then come to be the visual equivalent of the dead space that surrounds each character. The quality of Mr. Jarmusch's humor is not easily described. It's there in the spare dialogue, as when Willie and Eddie, in a blinding snowstorm, are driving through Cleveland to find Eva, and Eddie asks, quite sincerely, if Cleveland looks like Budapest. ''Of course not,'' says Willie. Later, when they are leaving Cleveland, Eddie muses, ''You know, it's kind of funny. You're some place new, and everything looks just the same.'' Wherever they go, the world of Willie, Eva and Eddie does look just the same. The Florida they find is not unlike a large vacant lot in Cleveland, though without the snow. Their adventures, however, are very particular, and the film ends on a note that slides without effort, like a piece of music, from the hilarious to the funny to the haunting. The three lead performers are extremely good, never for a second betraying the film's consistently deadpan style. In a couple of short scenes, Cecillia Stark, as the elderly aunt in Cleveland, nearly walks off with the picture, but ''Stranger Than Paradise'' is too much of an integrated piece of work for any one performer to steal it. Mention must also be made of Tom Dicillo's camera work, which is as funny and self-assured as the performances and Mr. Jarmusch's realization of his initial concept. Here is one festival movie that should hang around for a good, long while. The Cast STRANGER THAN PARADISE, directed and written by Jim Jarmusch; director of photography, Tom Dicillo; edited by Mr. Jarmusch and Melody London; music by John Lurie; produced by Sara Driver; a Samuel Goldwyn Company Presentation.

1057-> DECISION DEFERRED ON POWER CONTRACT
THE county's Public Utility Service Agency had approved it and County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke said last week, 'I'm going to vote for it.' Then, apparently, he changed his mind. Support had ebbed among county legislators for the controversial proposal: a distribution agreement to import cheap hydroelectric power over lines owned by Consolidated Edison. Two legislative committees, including three key Republican leaders, had passed a joint resolution asking the Board of Acquisition and Contract to hold up final county approval of the draft contract. Mr. O'Rourke then agreed last Tuesday, as chairman of the Acquisition Board, to defer consideration of the proposal for the second time in two weeks. The two other members of the board are Chairman Andrew A. Albanese of the Board of Legislators and Mr. O'Rourke's Commissioner of Public Works, Frank C. Bohlander. Members of the Community Affairs and Budget and Appropriations Committees had requested answers to questions about how thecounty could withdraw from the five-year agreement and asked if 'nonpreference' electrical power, as well as 'preference' power, were covered by it. The resolution, which was received and filed by the full Board, also 'condemns Con Edison for its apparent lack of good faith and lack of earnestness' in negotiating the agreement with the agency. Claire Palermo, a spokesman for Mr. O'Rourke, said that the County Executive's decision ot postpone a vote was to give him time to anser the Legislators' questions. Mr. O'Rourke said he belives that the draft agreement adquately covers the possibility that thecounty could receive nonpreference power, which is low-cost electricity from any source other than the New York Power Authority's Niagara and St. Lawrence Projects. In the 26th paragraph of the 28-paragraph draft, the document says, 'If nonpreference power should become available to the agency, the parties will endeavor to arrive at a mutually acceptable agreemtn with respect to such power.' One critic of the agreement, Lesiglator Paul J. Feiner, Democrat of Hastings-on-Hudson, said, 'I feel it definitely doesn't commit Con Ed to accepting nonpreference power. There's only a definitionof nonpreference power.' Edward M. Gibbs, the county's executive officer, said in an interview last week that at present 'there is no nonpreference power available at lower cost - nuclear or anything else.' The first preference power, which public utilities can buy but investorowned utilities such as Con Ed may not, will become available when contracts expire next June. The Public Utility Service Agency was authorized by voters in March 1982 to buy power at lower rates than those of Con Ed, whicha re among the highest inthe country and tied to the cost of oil. As for 'opting out' of the agreement, Mr. Gibbs said, 'It's not even an issue,' because Con Edi 'is the only game in town.' Neither the county nor its Utility Agency owns power lines for distribution of electricity to consumers. However, Mr. Gibbs indicated that a county threat to condemn the Con Ed lines could result in the utility's termination of the contract. The draft agreement sets up procedures for the Utility Agency to rent Con Ed linesbut doers not include specific amounts of rent to be paid or savings to be realized from Con Ed purchaseof upstate hydropower. One estimate of savings, $4 month by 1990 in an average Con Ed bill, was made by George Berry, a former president of the State Power Authority and the Utility Agency's consultant. A Sept. 26 joint meeting of the Board of Legislators' Budget and Community Affairs and Committees was told by Michael C. Finnegan, a county official, that an average monthly residential bill was $67. At that meeting, Edward J. Brady, the Republican majority leader on the Board, said, 'I don't think that Con Ed has been fair with the people of Westchester or with the Administration. I don't think they've dealt in good faith. I think it's reprehensible. I'm not, on the other hand, foolish enough to think we can take over Con Edison. We've been through that.' This was a reference to a 1979 referendum inwhich the voters turned down such an idea by a wide margin. 'Maybe it'll take state legislation to make them be fair,' Mr. Brady said. Then, last week, the Board, in a 14-0 vote, apssed a resolution offered by Mr. Brady that asks the State Legislature and Public Service Commission to set policy giving the county's Utility Agency 'the same rate that the New York State Power Authority is charged by Con Ed' for distribution of power. Both Mr. Brady and Mr. Gibbs have said such savings could amount to about 20 percent if Con Ed were forced to 'wheel' power to residential consumers at the same costs the Power Authority does to municipalities and school districts. Last week, Mr. Brady said, 'When it came to setting up the Utility Agency, Con Ed had representatives sitting at our meetings, and I though we were putting together a piece of legislation we could live with. But what I see coming out of this is minuscule.' A Con Ed spokesman, Thomas A. Bush, said last week, 'The idea that we're not negotiating in good faith just is not true. There were more than 30 changes made in the agreement in the lastyear, and we gave them the working they wanted. We were told by the negotiating team that it was a good agreement.' 'Where were all these Legislators when all this was going on?' Mr. Bush asked. 'This didn't come up overnight.' Any distribution agreement would have to be approved by Con Edison's board of trustees, the state's Public Service Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, once the county approved it. Mr. Bush said Con Ed had agreed with Mr. Berry that a $4 monthly savings could result from importation of preference power but that the basic question was how much of that power would become available to Westchester. The county is expected to be one of several dozen municipalities competing for it. Mr. Berry said, 'The basic problem is that the Power Authority has a small block of power that amounts to about 6 percent of the statewide load.' He said that amount was 1,325 megawatts. Up to about 1,000 megawatts is consumed at present in Con Edison's Westchester area, according to Mr. Bush. Con Edison serves all of the county except the towns of Pound Ridge, Lewisboro, Somers, North Salem, and partsof Yorktown and Bedford, which are served by the New York State Electric & Gas Corporation. Another objection to the draft agreement, put forward by Legislator Audrey G. Hochberg, a Scarsdale Democrat, is that savings should be made proportionate to the size of individuals bills istead of being applied equally to large users of electricity and small. Mr. berry said the intent of the formula was to apply the $4 equally to large and small users, thus giving the largest benefits to the user of least electricity. 'On the basis of kilowatt usage, the guy who wastes it is getting a major part of the benefit,' he said, referring to the Hochberg proposal.

1058-> U.S. LEAVES ROOM FOR SHIFT ON UNESCO
The United States delegate to Unesco delivered an address today that contained words of praise for the organization's much- criticized Director General and hints that the United States might be willing to remain a member of the body if ''genuine reform'' is achieved. ''Hope is very much alive that Unesco can respond to the constructive criticism, which has come from all over the globe,'' said Jean Gerard, the United States delegate. ''When all is said and done,'' she said, ''and the matter is reduced to its simplest terms, improvement, if it is sufficiently wide-ranging and profound, could resolve most of the problems facing the organization today.'' Responding to M'Bow Report Mrs. Gerard's statement, read to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization's executive board, was a response to a report to the board by Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow of Senegal, the organization's Director General. The board meeting was the first since the United States announced its decision to withdraw from Unesco at the end of this year. In his report, read to the board on Wednesday, Mr. M'Bow, who is fighting to preserve his position in the face of opposition from Western governments and other critics, said he would seek outside advice to improve management and establish a working group to examine Unesco programs with an eye toward eliminating duplication. ''The time has come,'' he said, ''to look for ways to make Unesco programs as efficient as possible.'' In her address today, Mrs. Gerard, a frequent critic of Mr. M'Bow's stewardship at Unesco, called his report ''encouraging.'' American and other Western diplomats in Paris cautioned that Mrs. Gerard's statement did not mark a reversal of the American decision to withdraw and that Mr. M'Bow's statement was only the first step in a long process that would determine whether the United States will remain in the organization. 'Only an Opening' ''A promise of intent is good,'' Mrs. Gerard said in an interview after her address, ''but it's only an opening. But it's still good; I don't want to downgrade it.'' An American diplomat said Mr. M'Bow's speech was ''the first sign of openness to change, but that's not change.'' The diplomat, who said the American withdrawal by the end of the year was still the most likely outcome, noted that Mr. M'Bow had not addressed one of the United States' main difficulties with Unesco, the ''politicization'' of its activities. This was a reference to the American view, shared by other Western countries, that the organization has shown hostility to freedom of expression and market economics and has taken unnecessarily provocative positions on international issues. A British diplomat said both Mr. M'Bow's statement and Mrs. Gerard's reflected ''a great deal of open-mindedness.'' Many delegates to Unesco had feared a bitter confrontation over American withdrawal and sweeping British proposals to change the organization. ''They are relieved,'' the British diplomat said. No Predictions Offered But the diplomat declined to predict whether the excecutive board meeting would lead to sufficient changes to satisfy either Britain or the United States. ''What do I feel will happen in a week's time?'' he said. ''Come back and ask me then.'' The United States has not specified what changes would be required to keep it in the organization. But in March, the United States and 23 other industrialized countries presented Mr. M'Bow with a list of proposed changes in the organization, including a downgrading of the more politically controversial projects and the possibility of a weighted voting system that would give more influence to countries that contribute the largest share of Unesco's budget. The United States is Unesco's largest contributor, providing 25 percent of its budget. And among the organization's 161 members, five countries - the United States, the Soviet Union, Japan, West German and France - account for 62 percent of the budget. The scheme to weight voting by contribution is unlikely to be approved, but Mr. M'Bow's statement indicated he was seeking to placate the larger contributors. Even the Soviet Union, which harshly criticized the United States' intention to leave and generally supports Mr. M'Bow, has called for new budgetary policies. Proposals by Britain Another detailed set of proposals in line with American objectives have been put forward by Britain. These called for reducing the staff of the organization's central office in Paris and decentralizing its activities. The British plan also proposes fewer studies and more action-oriented projects for the developing countries, fewer meetings and fewer documents, and more attention Western notions of ''universally recognized human rights'' in the organization's programs. ''We have a long way to go,'' Mrs. Gerard said today, ''and there is no guarantee that progress will be sufficient. But at least we are now talking about the future, about the real issues, in a way which offers some promise.''

1059-> PRICES REGISTER SHARP DECLINE
Prices fell sharply in the credit markets yesterday, as traders reacted negatively to reports indicating that economic growth remained strong in April. Trading was very light. Highly pessimistic remarks by Henry Kaufman, the chief economist of Salomon Brothers Inc., about the future course of interest rates thickened the gloom. The decline in prices and rise in interest rates was felt for all maturities, with the most pronounced price declines coming in the long-term market. Yesterday's rise in yields showed how far the bond markets have retreated in the last year. Long-Term Bond ''The market is celebrating the one- year anniversary of the trough in the long bond, which a year ago was auctioned at 10 1/4 percent,'' said Raymond W. Stone, manager of money market economics at Merrill Lynch. At the close, the price of the Government's long-term bond, the 12 percent of 2013, had declined by nearly a point and a half, to 91 20/32, for a yield of 13.10 percent. Short-term Treasury bill rates were also up sharply. The rate on three-month bills rose by 12 basis points, or hundredths of a point, to 9.89. Meanwhile, six-month bill rates rose by 19 basis points, to 10.22 percent. One-year bill rates rose by a similar amount, to 10.38 percent. After failing to respond positively to Thursday's money supply news - the Federal Reserve reported that the nation's basic money supply dropped by an unexpectedly large $3.6 billion - participants were in a selling mood from the outset of trading. The day's news did little to promote any optimism. ''The market was harassed by the April employment report, which was suggestive of a quite strong economy,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb Inc. Larger-Than-Expected Rise The report showed a larger-than- expected increase in both hours worked and overall manufacturing employment. ''You could almost refer to this as black Friday,'' said John Paulus, chief economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. ''The employment report convinced even the doubters that the economy is proceeding with a full head of steam.'' Mitchell Held, a money market economist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, said that ''the strong rise in the average workweek means you are setting yourself up for extremely strong industrial production and personal income numbers for April. ''We don't think the Fed is likely to tighten further on the basis of the April numbers alone,'' he added, ''but they won't ease either.'' In his remarks, Salomon's Mr. Kaufman said interest rates could move ''spectacularly higher'' by the end of next year, unless there was a cut in the Federal budget of $60 billion to $75 billion over the next 12 months. ''The bond market is basically saying it won't finance a 12-digit budget deficit and a booming economic expansion,'' said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities. ''At one time I thought we would see 14 percent long Government bonds by next January. Now I think it will happen this summer.'' Reflecting continued strong credit demand, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said yesterday that commercial and industrial loans on the books of American banks rose by $395 million in the week ending April 25, to $231.48 billion. Analysts Still Apprehensive Despite the rise in yields yesterday, most analysts remained apprehensive - in the face of continued weak retail demand - about the prospects for next week's auction of $16.5 billion of Treasury notes and bonds. In when-issued trading yesterday, the Government's new 30-year bond to be auctioned next week was bid at 13.15 percent, while the 10-year note closed at 13.07 percent. ''I think we will see support for the refundings,'' said Richard Greene, president of Money Market Services Inc., an economic news and analysis firm in Belmont, Calif., ''but that won't mean much in the long run. With the economy growing, there is nothing on the horizon to suggest that rates will be moving down.''

1060-> FAILURE? IT'S A ROUSING SUCCESS...
Four years later, Reaganomics has altered the economic landscape. Inflation is at its lowest rate in more than a decade with no sign of an upturn. There are millions of new jobs in a growing private sector. (In 10 years, all of Europe hasn't come close to generating the six million jobs our Jack Kemp is a Republican Representative from New York. economy produced in just 18 months.) Factories are using capacity that once lay idle, and new business investment is flourishing, adding still more capacity. Real (as against inflation-induced) wages are growing for the first time in years, while productivity is rising. The income tax bite out of every worker's paycheck has been cut by one-fourth and, under the tax-indexing law that takes effect next year, should never again increase because of inflation. Interest rates, though still high, have dropped by more than a third. Building construction is vigorous. The dollar is again the world's strongest currency. And most Americans believe their future is bright. What about the Federal Government's large deficit? The reversal of this country's economic climate from 1980 to 1984 is enough to disprove the theory that large deficits in themselves cause either inflation or recession. Moreover, the deficit is even now shrinking as a result of economic recovery, and in any case growth is the absolute precondition for dealing with the problem. But the test on which the ''supply- side'' aspects of Reaganomics stands or falls is whether the 25 percent across-the-board income tax cuts reduce the tax burden on the poor. Candidate Reagan made this claim four years ago, and it is the true test of ''fairness.'' The answer is unambiguous: it has reduced the burden on those least able to pay while increasing the aggregate taxes paid by those most able to afford them. In the first year of the tax cuts, 1982, Federal income revenues collected from those earning up to $25,000 amounted to 12 percent less in Federal income taxes than the year before. Conversely, the wealthiest, those earning a million dollars or more, paid a total of 41 percent more in 1982 than 1981. Moreover, upper income taxpayers generally carried a greater share of the entire Federal tax bill in 1982. The share of all taxes paid by workers earning $40,000 or more increased nearly 3 percent, and of course the share of those earning less than $40,000 declined by the same amount. There have been many attempts to explain this away, but the same pattern has emerged every time steeply progressive tax rates have been cut across the board. When that happens, upper-income earners tend to shift resources from leisure, consumption and tax-avoidance to work, savings and taxable investments. Meanwhile, tax incentives encourage people at every level to produce more and move into higher earning categories. Over a period of time, therefore, higher-income groups will carry more of the tax burden, lower-income groups less. To be sure, the delay in putting supply-side policy into action permitted a final recession before recovery began. But further reforms must follow the path of broad-based, incentive-producing tax reduction and simplification charted in Mr. Reagan's first term. We should drop the top rate from 50 to no more than 25 or 30 percent. We should at least double the present $1,000 per person exemption. We should protect wages against the double taxation imposed by Social Security taxes and the Federal income tax. And we should certainly remove the 1.4 million persons earning below the official poverty line from the Federal income tax rolls. We must also stabilize the dollar to eliminate the threat to the United States' world trade and keep the recovery going. Today's Democratic leaders are trying to prove that good news is bad, growth is greed and the world will end promptly on Nov. 7. Reaganomics has helped working people. Our goal is full employment without inflation. And we will not stop until every single American fully shares our new-found prosperity. B

1061-> DISPUTE ON ACCORD IN STRIP-MINE SIUT
A dispute within the Reagan Administration is delaying the settlement of a long-contested strip-mining lawsuit that would roll back a number of deregulatory policies. The Secretary of the Interior, William P. Clark, was to have signed the sweeping out-of-court settlement Wednesday, according to lawyers familiar with the case. But officials in the Justice Department have so far blocked the agreement, which involves a detailed admission of the Government's failure to enforce one of the major environmental laws. Negotiations were continuing this weekend at the Justice Department, where opposition to the settlement was reportedly being led by Roger Marzulla, an acting deputy assistant attorney general in the lands and natural resources division. Mr. Marzulla was once a legal associate of Mr. Clark's predecessor as Interior Secretary, James G. Watt. The proposed settlement of the five- year-old environmentalists' lawsuit is viewed in the Interior Department as a sharp recision of many Watt policies. Mr. Clark was reportedly willing - some officials said he was eager - to agree to the settlement as ''necessary catchup ball,'' beginning under its terms a belated effort to collect millions of dollars in unpaid and ignored fines levied against violators of a 1977 law requiring strip mine operators to reclaim damaged land. Possibly $150 Million in Fines Sensitive to the impression that Mr. Clark was being blocked by what one departmental offical called ''a clone of Watt,'' an aide to the Secretary said today, ''Anybody who knows Judge Clark knows that when he has made up his mind to do something, it generally gets done - if there is a notion that he is not running this and is being rolled over, it will be evident next week that that is not the case.'' Mr. Marzulla did not respond to a request for comment on his reported role in blocking the strip-mine settlement. Instead, he instructed the Justice Department press office to say that he would have no comment. In a review this year of what they called a ''snafu'' within the Interior Department, Congressional auditors estimated that the uncollected penalties against strip-mine violators might total $150 million. The magnitude of the never-paid fines, uncovered originally in the course of the lawsuit, has given the litigation the working name of ''the megabucks case.'' Its settlement would rescind key parts of Mr. Watt's deregulation of the strip-mining industry. Under Mr. Watt's 1982 ''reorganization'' of the Office of Surface Mining, for example, its office of penalty assessments was simply abolished. The nonpayment of fines was a continuing problem since the strip-mining agency's creation in 1977, but under Secretary Watt's staff and program reductions in the early 1980's the inaction came increasingly under court and Congressional criticism. Settlement 'Long Overdue' Mindful of this, Secretary Clark was said to have ''reminded all concerned in the department that he believes there is urgency in this settlement because it is long overdue.'' Should the proposed settlement fail to win approval, one result is likely to be a stern final order from Federal District Judge Barrington D. Parker, who has been presiding over the five-year trial, and possibly a request by the plaintiffs for a contempt-of-court citation against Secretary Clark. Judge Parker's rulings so far have unmistakably favored the plaintiffs and have included harsh judgments of the department's previous position in court that it had ''absolute discretion'' to collect the fines or not collect them. Allegations against the Office of Surface Mining have included charges of mismanagement and incompetency. At a Congressional hearing last June, officials said that the agency, hoping to replace old-fashioned file cards, had spent millions of dollars on various computer systems that never worked and on contracts with private collection agencies that yielded virtually no returns. The lawsuit's settlement would be the second court-imposed reform this month at the beleaguered strip-mining agency. Monday, in a separate lawsuit, another Federal judge ordered the office to reverse scores of other Watt-era regulatory decisions challenged as too weak by the National Wildlife Federation and six other environmental groups, and held by the court to be ''an abdication of authority'' to control the effects of strip mining. Search for Offenders In the legal settlement being considered now, the Interior Department would agree to begin enforcement of some 1,700 never-prosecuted ''cease and desist'' orders against repeated violators of the reclamation law. The department would search out elusive ''ruin and run'' offenders, many of whom have retired in wealth, determine their net worth and then seek to seize their personal assets to cover the unpaid fines and interest, plus collection costs. Under the settlement, the agency would also deny strip-mine permits to individual reclamation scofflaws, regardless of their corporate cover, as required but admittedly never done under the 1977 Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. The hidden violators were to be identified by personal name, or by aliases, in a new, computerized name file which was to be closely monitored on terminals of the environmental plaintiffs, Save Our Cumberland Mountains and the Council of the Southern Mountains.

1062-> ABORTION ISSUE THREATENS TO BECOME A PROFOUNDLY DIVISIVE
The issue of abortion has become so prominent in this year's Presidential campaign that many people on both sides of the question believe that it will not go away whatever the outcome of the election, and that the resulting conflict could be bitterly disruptive. Members of the ''right-to-life'' movement have been comparing the issue to slavery in the last century and to racial discrimination in the South prior to enactment of Federal civil rights laws in the 1960's. Their opponents compare it to the drive early in this century that led to the Prohibition amendment to the Constitution, which after a period of strife had to be repealed. Whatever the comparisons, they contain forebodings of social division. In the past, most seekers and holders of public office have tried to avoid the abortion debate as a difficult and sensitive one that could be politically damaging no matter what position they took. And in the decade since the Supreme Court overturned state laws against abortion in Roe v. Wade , the issue was only a marginal concern in Presidential campaigns. This year, it has been at the center of the controversy over religion in politics. The question was argued at length in the Presidential and Vice Presidential debates last week. President Reagan, who supports a constitutional amendment that would ban abortions, came close to calling abortion murder. Asked if he considered it that, he replied that under a California law a person who physically abuses a pregnant woman to the extent that it causes the death of the fetus can be charged with murder. ''Now isn't it strange,'' he continued, ''that the same woman could have taken the life of her unborn child and it was abortion and not murder, but if somebody else does it, that's murder?'' Vice President Bush, asked to explain how he changed his former position in favor of using public funds for abortions in the event of incest or rape, said: ''There has been - I have to make a confession - an evolution in my position. There's been 15 million abortions since 1973, and I don't take that lightly.'' Walter F. Mondale and Geraldine A. Ferraro, the Democratic nominees, said, as they have in the past, that abortion is a private matter and they do not want the Government intruding in the private lives of citizens. Mrs. Ferraro said that as a ''devout Catholic'' she has fully accepted her church's position on the issue for herself, but as a public official could not impose it on others. Mr. Mondale, connecting the abortion issue to that of religion in politics, asked, ''Does every woman in America have to present herself before some judge picked by Jerry Falwell to clear her personal judgment?'' He was alluding to a section in the Republican platform which calls for ''the appointment of judges at all levels who respect traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human life.'' There is no evidence of any promise that the Rev. Mr. Falwell, founder of Moral Majority, would be allowed to pick Supreme Court Justices. Mr. Falwell has been reported to have expressed the hope in a public address that ''in Ronald Reagan's next five year's in office we will get at least two more appointments to the Supreme Court'' that would provide a 5-to-4 margin against legalized abortions. Mr. Bush called the references to Mr. Falwell a ''canard.'' Minorities and MajoritiesThe right-to-life movement is an intense, dedicated minority. Many of its leaders accused the justices of the Supreme Court, and those public officials who oppose a legal ban on abortions, of murder. There seems to be some justification to complaints by Roman Catholic and fundamentalist Protestant clergy that there has been no strong organization or voice in the middle, that would condemn on moral grounds the widespread use of abortion as another birth control device. The mainline Protestant churches generally oppose abortion but consider it a matter of personal choice, and have preferred to pursue such social issues as poverty and nuclear arms control. The result has been an antiabortion crusade that has defeated candidates at various levels of government. But it has not been able to command the majority needed to enact either a constitutional amendment or a law that would overturn the Supreme Court's 1973 ruling. United in purpose but divided on means, the movement was increasingly frustrated until this year. What has brought the issue to the national level has been President Reagan's statements of sympathy with the beliefs of and support for the religious right, which has antiabortion as a major goal, and the decision of John J. O'Connor, the Archbishop of New York, and Bernard F. Law, the Archbishop of Boston, to elevate the issue above other social concerns. In the past, the movement was largely secular but with roots in the churches. Now it is directely connected with religious denominations. ''The morality of abortion is now a truly national issue,'' ''Lifeletter,'' one of the many publications of the antiabortion movement, proclaimed last week. At the same time, a major opponent,the National Abortion Rights League, said that it had scored enough victories in Congressional primary elections this year to insure even rounder defeat of antiabortion bills on Capitol Hill next year than in the past. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court increased security after a death threat was reported against Associate Justice Harry Blackmun, who wrote the opinion in the 1973 case that legalized abortion. The letter reportedly was sent by Army of God, a group that has said it is responsible for attacks on abortion clinics. In view of the resurgence of religious conservatives in politics, the issue is expected to continue boiling under any Adminstration. Yet moderates on both sides see grounds for at least reducing the pressures for antiabortion law so stringent that, according to Senator Daniel P. Moynihan of New York, it ''would not be obeyed by half this country, would be fiercly divisive and would appear to be the imposition of one set of views on other people.'' What has been feeding pressures for such a law, such moderates say, is the large number of abortions, at least 1.5 million a year. If it can be substantially reduced through education, wider use of birth control, more liberal adoption procedures and social programs to help women through pregnancy, pressures for a drastic ban might subside, they say. There is disagreement there, too, they add, but it is the area that for the time being provides the most hope for a civil way out of the dilemma.

1063-> U.S. LOSES RULING IN NICARAGUA CASE
Text of ruling is on page A9. THE HAGUE, May 10 - The International Court of Justice ruled unanimously today that the United States should immediately halt any attempts to blockade or mine Nicaraguan ports. The World Court, granting Nicaragua's request for a preliminary restraining order to protect its sovereign rights, also asserted by a vote of 14 to 1 that Nicaragua's political independence ''should be fully respected and should not be jeopardized by any military or paramilitary activities.'' (Reacting to the interim ruling, the Unites States said it found nothing it could not accept in the decision, including the call for an end to the mining of Nicaraguan harbors. American officials have said the mining ended in late March and will not be resumed. Page A8.) In issuing its decision, the 15-member panel rejected the United States' request that it dismiss the Nicaraguan application on jurisdictional grounds. But the Court said it had not decided on the merit of the American jurisdictional arguments in terms of Nicaragua's overall case, in which the Sandinista Government is seeking to have the United States declared an aggressor state, liable to pay damages. The recommendations made by the Court today are not binding. As a legal arm of the United Nations, the World Court advises the United Nations Security Council of its decisions. In theory, later requests for enforcement may be made to the Security Council, but it has never taken any action to press a World Court decision. Both sides in the dispute listened in silence as Taslim Olawale Elias of Nigeria, the president of the Court, read the decision aloud. The Americans and the Nicaraguans argued the preliminary phase of Nicaragua's request two weeks ago. Later Nicaragua's chief representative here, Carlos Arg"uello Gomez, said, ''We think this is extremely important and that it's going to back up all the peace efforts that are going on in the area.'' Then he added, ''If the United States does not accept the decision, it becomes an outlaw government.'' The question of the American attitude toward the matter before the World Court was first raised on April 6, as disclosures were being made in Congress about United States Government involvement in the mining of Nicaraguan ports. The State Department announced then that United States acceptance of the World Court's judgment in matters concerning Central America was being suspended for two years. Its explanation was that Nicaragua was preparing to misuse the Court. Three days later the Nicaraguans filed their request for ''provisional measures,'' a procedure that has come before the Court nine times since World War II. Over that period the United States is the only defendant country that has appeared in court to oppose such measures. The Court's ruling - technically, it ''indicates'' rather than ''orders'' the parties in a dispute - proceeded from its rejection of the United States' challenge to its jurisdiction at the current stage of the case. The Americans had argued two central points in urging the panel to dismiss the Nicaraguan application: that the United States had suspended its agreement giving the Court the right to rule concerning Central America, and that Nicaragua itself had no right to plead because it never filed the instruments of ratification required to officially accept the Court's judgment. In explaining the Court's attitude on jurisdiction in the present phase, Judge Stephen M. Schwebel, the American member of the panel, said the Court believed that all Nicaragua had to do was to establish the likelihood of a legal basis on which the Court's jurisdiction might be founded. In deciding whether it has ''jurisdiction to indicate provisional measures,'' Judge Schwebel said, ''the Court gives the applicant the benefit of the doubt.'' According to the judge, the panel gave Nicaragua ''the benefit of a great many doubts.'' Judge Schwebel's vote against his own Government on the mining issue was an unusual act in a court where political considerations, in the view of some of the member judges, are often apparent. Other judges have voted against their own governments in the past, but Judge Schwebel's decision to go against the substance of his Government's position in an important case of great political resonance was notable. In the past, Italian, British and French judges have also voted against the arguments of their respective Governments. Pending its final ruling, the Court voted unanimously that ''the United States of America should immediately cease and refrain from any action restricting, blocking or endangering access to or from Nicaraguan ports, and in particular, the laying of mines.'' Then, by a vote of 14 to 1, with Judge Schwebel dissenting, the Court stated: ''The right to sovereignty and to political independence possessed by the Republic of Nicaragua, like any other state of the region or of the world, should be fully respected and should not in any way be jeopardized by any military and paramilitary activities which are prohibited by the principles of international law, in particular the principle that states should refrain in their international relations from the threat or the use of force against the territorial integrity or the political independence of any state, and the principle concerning the duty not to intervene in matters within the domestic jurisdiction of a state, principles embodied in the United Nations Charter and the Charter of the Organization of American States.'' The procedure took a month from the day on which it was begun. Traditionally the Court has handled requests for ''provisional measures'' on an urgent basis, giving them precedence over other cases it may be hearing.

1064-> AROUND THE NATION; Hearings Set for Voting In Oregon Guru Dispute
The Oregon Secretary of State has scheduled residency hearings Oct. 23 for people seeking to vote in Wasco County, where longtime residents fear a government takeover by followers of the Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. The Rajneeshee have recruited homeless people from around the country to move to the sect's city near here, Rajneeshpuram, whose population has swelled in recent weeks from 2,000 people to about 7,000. Last week the Wasco County Clerk, Sue A. Proffitt, told a group of street people now living at Rajneeshpuram, that she would reject all new voter registrations in the county pending individual hearings. Mrs. Proffitt, who said she was acting on the advice of Secretary of State Norma Paulus, stressed that the blanket rejection would affect all prospective voters. A group of people in nearby Albany had said they planned to come to Wasco County on Electon Day to counter new Rajneeshee voters.

1066-> Voters Under 39 in Poll Favor Reagan Strongly
The nation's postwar baby boom generation overwhelmingly prefers President Reagan over his Democratic rivals, a nationwide poll showed today. The Los Angeles Times Poll, published today, showed those under 39 years old backed Mr. Reagan's re- election bid by an even wider edge than Americans over 39. The nationwide telephone poll of 2,700 people, conducted April 28 to May 3, showed Mr. Reagan the favorite by 58 percent to 37 percent over Walter F. Mondale and by 55 percent to 39 percent over Gary Hart. The poll, which has a margin of error plus or minus 3 points, said Mr. Reagan's margin in the postwar generation was more than twice that among the over-39 generation. The Times classified people from 18 to 39 as baby boomers.

1067-> DEVELOPERS NOW OFFER BUS SERVICE
Alan S. Moore, the general manager of the Galaxy Towers condominiums overlooking the Hudson River in Guttenberg, N.J., keeps bus tickets in his safe. ''To me, they're just like money,'' he said. Mr. Moore's appreciation of the value of bus tickets is based on more than a fondness for that mode of transportation. Every day, nearly 300 residents of the Galaxy Towers - about one of every seven people who live there - board private buses bound for New York City with tickets purchased from Mr. Moore. At $125 for a book of 50 tickets, the buses involve a considerable amount of money and, for Mr. Moore, added responsibility. ''We even have an accountant who keeps track of sales,'' he said. Mr. Moore is not alone. Throughout the metropolitan region, particularly in areas near New York City like Guttenberg that are not well served by established transportation routes and in some sections of Westchester County and Connecticut, developers are finding private transportation systems to be increasingly important in attracting tenants to residential and commercial developments. Moreover, with many public transportation agencies facing budget constrictions, developers say that providing a private system - or paying the local public transit system a subsidy to extend its operations - is sometimes the only way that mass transit services can be brought in at all. In most cases, at places like Galaxy Towers and Admiral's Walk in Edgewater, N.J., another condominium development on the Hudson that has its own bus system, the private transportation networks are operated on a break- even basis. But many developers are spending considerable sums beyond the break-even point to insure that residents, visitors and employees are able to travel easily to commercial and residential parks off the beaten track. Hartz Mountain Industries, for example, the developer of Harmon Meadow, an office park in Secaucus, N.J., pays N.J. Transit a floating subsidy to extend a bus route about five miles to the park. The subsidy system, which is believed to be the first of its kind in New Jersey, was initiated by the developer last year and is now being pursued by N.J. Transit at other developments. Hartz Mountain's subsidy, which decreases as ridership increases, averages about $8,000 a month, with a ceiling of $17,500. ''We're looking more and more to work with private companies who may wish to take a contract with us or have some subsidized service,'' said Anthony L. Grazioso, the spokesman for N.J. Transit. ''Particularly where private sector bus companies provide no service, or do not wish to get involved.'' In Washington, the American Public Transit Association, a lobbying group that represents the interests of public transit systems, has taken up the same theme as Mr. Grazioso, but with a tougher tone. ''If these real estate developers want service out in the boondocks, fine,'' said Albert Engelken, the spokesman for the association. ''But they should have to bear some part of the cost.'' Mr. Engelken said that declines in public funds for many transit systems around the country have forced tight-fisted approaches to creating new routes or expanding old ones, though he added that direct subsidy programs like N.J. Transit's were still rare. There are believed to be none in operation in New York or Connecticut. Perhaps the biggest transportation package being assembled by a private developer in the metropolitan area today is in Norwalk, Conn., where Albert D. Phelps Jr. has pledged to spend up to $10 million on transportation improvements at the Merritt 7 corporate park, just off the Merritt Parkway at Route 7. The park, which is to have nearly 4 million square feet of office space on a 50-acre site, had a lot of what Mr. Phelps described as transportation ''potential.'' The improvements planned there include widening Route 7 from two lanes to four for a mile near the park, building a train station on the Danbury Line of the Metro-North Commuter Railroad and building or improving seven bridges. Mr. Phelps has also initiated private helicopter service from the park, private limousine service for visiting executives and a car rental service. He said the train station had proven to be the biggest headache because of the layers of regulatory approval required, primarily from the Connecticut Department of Transportation and Metro-North. ''It'll only take about six months to build,'' Mr. Phelps said of the station, which is to be completed by the end of the year. ''But it took five years to get approval from the various government agencies.'' Building the station is expected to cost between $400,000 and $500,000. In Westchester, developers say the transportation picture is complicated by most of the existing transportation systems following a north-south axis to accommodate commuting into and out of New York City. A second complication is that much of the commercial real estate activity in Westchester results from small businesses growing larger and moving to new locations, often across the county. For the employees of those businesses, the result may be a harrowing new commute. For the companies, however, many of which are being wooed by commercial developers into newly built office parks, poor transportation can result in improved bargaining leverage. Last year, for example, an insurance company in East Yonkers was negotiating a move to an office park in West Yonkers being developed by the Robert Martin Company, a major Westchester developer. The insurance company held out for a transportation package that included private bus service to employees who were forced to make a difficult cross-Yonkers commute. It was the first time that Robert Martin used a private transportation service, although it had recommended such services to many of its clients. ''Any builder here has to be very concerned with transportation,'' said Margaret M. Schneider, a vice president at Robert Martin. In Westchester, she said with a sentiment that would no doubt find an echo in many places, ''a nice setting is wonderful, but a nice setting close to mass transit is just fabulous.'' Some commercial real estate brokers, however, argue that much of the concern over transportation in the suburban areas may be psychological; it arises, they say, from New Yorkers who are accustomed to trains and mass transit. ''People who come from New York have trains locked into their minds,'' said Paul King Jr., a vice president in charge of commercial real estate at William Pitt, a Stamford-based agency that has assisted in relocating several large companies. For the first few months after a company moves to a new location in Westchester or Connecticut, Mr. King said, the company's executives may feel a need to offer some transportation service. ''After that, it loses its emphasis,'' he said. ''Most people have cars around here.'' Perspectives about how much transportation service should be provided also vary from company to company. When the Aetna Life and Casualty Company began moving its employee benefits division last year from Hartford to Middletown, Conn., 17 miles away, it hired a full- time transportation coordinator to help the 4,500 employees in the division adjust to their new commute. The coordinator used a computer data base to help people find van or car- pool partners. The Union Carbide Corporation, which moved its corporate headquarters from New York to Danbury, Conn., between 1980 and 1983, also provided numerous services, including what a spokesman called a ''heavily subsidized'' bus service to help ease the shift in commuting patterns. But according to Donald A. Diebold, manager of Union Carbide's transportation services, the company made early efforts to shift commuters into a company-operated van pool program while also encouraging them to move closer to Danbury. The subsidized bus line was terminated last year. The attitude was more casual at the American Cyanamid Company, a large chemical manufacturer, when it moved from New York City to Wayne, N.J., in 1962. ''Most employees solved their own problems,'' said Joseph C. Calitri, who was with the company then and now is its director of public affairs. Mr. Calitri said a bus route had been established by a local contractor to operate a line from Manhattan to American Cyanamid's headquarters. ''But mostly, people just found their own way,'' he said.

1068-> ABOUT LONG ISLAND
-DOZEN years ago, I laughed when they told me to sit down and play the computer. This was at the office, where they had just installed a system that overnight sent our trusty old manual typewriters, those wonderful heavy machines with a clunk that attested to the weightiness of what you were writing, to the limbo where they are floating along with cuneiform styluses and quill pens. I had no confidence in the newfangled technology with a language of its own that seemed to require a year at Berlitz. I never did like a machine that could think faster than I could, I proclaimed. The proclamation never saw print, because there was no way around writing with the new machines. And what has all this to do with home life on the Island? Well you may ask. Six years later I have one in my house, along with many others who have installed them in the den, if not for their own purposes, then for the sake of their children. These days, keeping up with the Joneses has gone beyond lawn competitions and car- cleaning orgies. Advertising and the perennial urges of modishness dictate possession of a home computer. What overcame my initial squeamishness was sheer necessity and habit. I had to use it at work, and eventually the luxury of time-saving and the avoidance of the drudgery of pulling out a sheet of paper, throwing it away, inserting another and starting from the top seduced me into a state of laziness that made a return to the typewriter as unthinkable as it would be to keep carrier pigeons instead of using the telephone. The computer does nothing you could not do without it, but it does it faster and with less exertion, and once you succumb to it, like the automobile and blender, it assumes an indispensability that may not have been there at the beginning. I use my computer almost exclusively for writing, as an advanced typewriter. When friends visit and poke at it, the knowledgeable ones inquire about capacity and such things as bytes and boots. I explain that I know no more about the interior of my computer than I know about what goes on under the hood of my car. I merely know how to drive each of them. I have expanded my learning to the point where I think I know how to get the most of what I want out of my machine, but I am still scared off by some of the instruction books. They are heavy with diagrams and complex type that enable you to get the computer to do things that I will not understand when they do them. My sons early on discovered some primitive games on the computer, and when they are home, they spend hours having an X or a series of X's leap over a series of horizontal and vertical lines while the computer emits squawks and whistles as though it were on the ice at a hockey game. Perhaps the battle of space will be won on the playing fields of the home computer, but you couldn't prove it to me. A young friend of mine, a high school student over in Great Neck, has been making a living - well, not quite a living, but enough money to meet his recreational needs - out of his computer. He rewrites material, such as letters and other papers, that people need in apple-pie order. I guess he could do his income tax on it, too, if he put his mind to it. He explained to me that he can hook up with the telephone and avail himself of dozens of services that will put information on his home screen, for a fee that can be hefty by the hour. But he has a system that allows him to query the source quickly and to hang up. The information he gets helps him do his history and science papers. It's very nice, but we used to have such a source that allowed us to get out, meet people and browse around in a lot of other information that caught our eye. This was called the public library. Another friend was telling me the other day how some kids he knew had devised a system for playing monopoly on their computer. You could buy the Boardwalk or Park Place, or go to jail, by hitting the right key, absolutely the same game as played on the dining room table. My friend, a bit of a computer expert, said he was enthusiastic about doing it all electronically. Then the thought overwhelmed him that it was really more comfortable at the big table, with a drink or some candy on the table and moving the pieces around the board, as the game was originally designed to be played. Not long ago, I undertook to transcribe the names from our little home telephone directory into a filing system that came with the computer. It took hours, many hours, to put them in and brought home to me the fact that, like many of man's most beautiful and impressive achievements such as the Pyramids, the Taj Mahal and the Great Wall of China, the smooth simplicity of the computer also has its roots in slavish labor. The results are pleasing to those who come later, but it is a chore to put the ingredients in, a chore that may be back-breakingly boring. The filing system does work, and now I can press a few buttons and have my computer print labels from the list addressed to those to whom I want to send greeting cards,whether at Christmas, Jewish New Year's or Chinese New Year's. I have thought of programing it for envelopes wishing people a quick recovery, congratulations on their new baby or condolences on a death, but there is no need for such mass application, barring an epidemic of either disease or fertility. Thanks to the computer, we have this year been spending ridiculous sums on stamps and greeting cards, some of them addressed to people I am certain we don't know but who found themselves somehow on our list. I recently received at least two cards acknowledging Jewish New Year's greetings from people whose names drew a complete blank. This was the holiday season's opener; who knows what Christmas will lead to? I couldn't begin to tell you whether to buy a home computer. My family and I are getting much use from ours, but still I would not want you to believe it is the genie in the bottle you have been looking for all your life. Your basic computer is your own brain, and that is where everything you do with another computer must start. Even the term ''word processor'' is somewhat misleading. Word processing is done in your head, where your thoughts and the way in which you want to express them are arranged. The machine merely puts them down as you instruct it to do. I don't know about you, but I have entered the New Age with a bit of caution, but I have entered it, one hand touching wood and the other on the ''delete'' key. So far, my life seems no better or worse because of it (outside of those computer mix-ups that send me other people's bills and summonses on parking violations in places I never drove, but that's another story). To paraphrase the man on the moon, it's a small step for mankind, a giant step for me.

1069-> SCOUTING ; Electronic Data
What did Ty Cobb bat in 1907? How many football games did Yale win in 1898? Who won the Kentucky Derby in 1885? The answers to these questions and tons of other sports data, most of which is currently available in printed form, is expected to be available in late summer or early fall to subscribers to a new electronic sports-information service. For the past two years, Sports Information Data Base Inc. has been researching 60 sports and expects to be ready to go into business later this year. The public company, with a staff of 32 editors that is expected to grow to 60 in a few months, will have a computer in Lebanon, N.H., able to provide data to subscribers, expected initially to be newspapers, magazines and radio and television stations, about amateur and professional American sports teams and leagues. International events, such as the Olympic Games and the Pan American Games, will also be included. About 250 million electronic characters have been introduced into the computer, the equivalent of more than six sets of the Encyclopedia Britannica, according to Kevin Demarrais, a company spokesman. The character load is expected to increase at a rate of 100 million characters a year as additional data is compiled daily. Portable computer terminals, which will give access to the stored information, will be given subscribers. The terminals will also be provided to most major colleges, who will be asked to provide daily sports data on all their sports events. The idea for the sports data base was conceived four years ago by W. Michael Gillespie, who is the chairman and chief executive officer.

1071-> 5 SCORES BY BYARS LEAD OHIO STATE
Keith Byars's fifth touchdown of the game, a 3-yard sweep with 36 seconds to play, gave Ohio State a 45-38 victory over Illinois today after it had trailed by 24-0 in the Big Ten Conference game. Byars, who has 16 touchdowns this season, broke Archie Griffin's school record with 274 rushing yards. Griffin had 246 against Iowa in 1973. Byars, who had 464 yards rushing in his last two games, has 1,076 for the season. Byars matched another school mark with his 30 points. Pete Johnson scored 30 against North Carolina in 1975. Ohio State (5-1, 3-1) moved into a share of the Big Ten lead with Michigan and Iowa. Illinois (4-3, 3-2) stunned the Ohio Stadium sellout crowd of 89,937 with three touchdown passes by Jack Trudeau in the first 16 minutes on way to a 24-0 lead. Then Mike Tomczak led Ohio State to three touchdowns in the last 4 minutes 13 seconds of the half. He pitched 16 yards to the split end Cris Carter in between scoring runs of 16 and 4 yards by Byars. Byars's third touchdown, a 4-yard run, put Ohio State ahead for the first time at 28-24 early in the third quarter. He ran 67 yards for a 35-27 lead. Trudeau tied at 35-35, throwing 9 yards to the running back Ray Wilson and running for the 2-point conversion with 1:09 left in the third quarter. Ohio State's Rich Spangler made a 46-yard field goal for a 38-35 lead with 10:21 remaining. Chris White tied at 38-38 with his third field goal from 16 yards with 3:18 to play. Iowa 40, Purdue 3 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind., (AP) - Chuck Long passed for 369 yards and four touchdowns, including three to Robert Smith, to help Iowa deal Purdue its first loss in the Big Ten. Both teams are now 3-1 in the conference and 4-2 over all. Smith, who had caught only one touchdown pass going into the game, had scoring receptions of 51 yards in the first quarter and 31 and 38 yards in the third quarter. Long passed for 221 yards in the first half alone. He completed 17 of 21 passes before leaving the game late in the third period. Iowa held Purdue to a net 66 yards rushing and interecepted three passes. The Purdue coach Leon Burtnett said his team ''played attrociously. That's the only way I can put it. Michigan 31 Northwestern 0 ANN ARBOR, Mich., (AP) - Rick Rogers rushed for 144 yards and Russell Rein, a sophomore playing in place of the injured Jim Harbaugh, threw for a touchdown in his first collegiate start. Rogers, hampered by injuries that restricted him to only 20 carries in three games, rushed 17 times for 108 yards in the first half as Michigan (4-2, 3-1) scored on its first four possessions to take a 24-0 lead. The tailback Jamie Morris returned the second-half kickoff 80 yards to the 20 and scored from the 5 four plays later to make the score 31-0. Michigan St. 13, Indiana 6 EAST LANSING, Mich. (UPI) - Carl Butler ran 61 yards for a touchdown the second half to help rally Michigan State (3-3, 2-2) in the Big Ten game. Indiana fell to 0-6, 0-4. The Spartans, upset winners over Michigan last Saturday, appeared listless during the first 40 minutes, falling behind by 6-0 on field goals of 26 and 30 yards by Mark Rogers. Minnesota 17, Wisconsin 14 MADISON, Wis. (UPI) - Ricky Foggie, a freshman quarterback, ran the option for 153 yards on 24 carries and two touchdowns, and Chip Lohmiller made a 26-yard field goal with 6:27 remaining to help Minnesota to the upset victory in the Big Ten game. It was the second consecutive conference triumph for Minnesota (3-3, 2-2), which had lost 19 consecutive league games until defeating Indiana, 33-24, last Saturday. Foggie ran 36 and 43 yards for touchdowns for Minnesota (3-3, 2-2). Wisconsin fell to 3-3, 1-3. ''About five years ago, someone told me you can't run the option in the Big Ten,'' said the Minnsota coach Lou Holtz.''Maybe we can't, but we feel it's what we need to help us right now.'' Nebraska 33, Missouri 23 LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) - Doug DuBose rushed for 162 yards and a touchdown, and Marc Munford returned an inteception 57 yards for a touchdown as Nebraska won its 23d consecutive Big Eight Conference game. Munford, a sophomore linebacker, intercepted a Warren Seitz pass and scored with 11 minutes 41 seconds to play in the third quarter, giving Nebraska (5-1, 2-0) a 23-10 lead. Nebraska scored its first rushing touchdown in nine quarters when the Jeff Smith ran 21 yards in the first quarter. Kansas St. 24, Kansas 7 MANHATTAN, Kan. (AP) - Stan Weber led scoring drives of 77, 80 and 59 yards, and Kansas State (2-5, 1-1) controlled the ball for 11:44 of the 15- minute third quarter in the Big Eight Conference game. Air Force 21, Notre Dame 7 SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) - The halfback Jody Simmons rushed 24 times for 141 yards and a touchdown and he set up another score for Air Force. He scored on a 5-yard run in the first quarter and went 11 yards to set up a 1-yard touchdown run by Johnny Smith in the second quarter to put the Falcons ahead to stay when they passed for 2 points and a 14-7 lead. The triumph was the third in three seasons over Notre Dame (3-3) by the Falcons (5-2). The Irish had won the first 11 games in the series. Early in the fourth quarter following a series of turnovers, Notre Dame was at the Air Force 49, needing a yard for a first down, and failed to make it on two tries resulting in boos.

1073-> SPORTS WORLD SPECIALS; Saving the Worm
Fishing has long been regarded as an especially civilized sport, but not to those who shrink from putting a worm on a hook. It is an altogether squeamish business, and no picnic for the worm. Indeed, according to research in West Germany, worms actually feel pain when their little bodies are pierced by a steel barb. Now Don Crowley, a fisherman from Westport, Conn., has come to the rescue of squeamish anglers with an idea designed to prolong worms' lives and render their last moments more bearable - using glue to stick them to the hook. Crowley, who got the idea after reading about the German research on the suffering of impaled worms, might have kept it to himself had it not been for one thing: he is a sales representative for Krazy Glue, and when he brought the idea to the company, it decided to exploit it. As a result, it is now promoting the product as an ideal addition to the tackle box, and Crowley is the chief booster. Although he concedes he has no hard data to prove his point, he is convinced that glued-on worms catch more fish than their impaled relatives. ''What do you think would look better to a fish,'' he asks, ''a dead worm dangling from a hook, or the live bait you wanted all along, wriggling away?'' That may be true, but his suggestion raises a key question: do you glue the worm to the hook or the hook to the worm? Crowley has the answer: put a single drop of glue on the hook and then affix the worm. It bonds instantly, he says.

1075-> Script Ohio ($76) Wins EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., Oct. 18 - Script Ohio, a 37-1 shot,
overcame a poor start to storm from last place and catch the even- money favorite, Spend a Buck, to win the $500,000 Young America Stakes for 2-year-olds tonight at Meadowlands Race Track. He paid $76 for $2 to win. The winner, a son of Roberto and the Never Bend mare Grandma Lind, is owned by John Galbreath's Darby Dan Farm and trained by John Veitch. He covered the mile and a sixteenth in the mediocre time of 1:45 under Eddie Maple. Spend a Buck was second, three-quarters of a length behind the winner and a neck in front of Tank's Prospect, with Rhoman Rule finishing fourth in a field of 11. Script Ohio was making only his third career start. He won his debut at Belmont Park Sept. 13 then finished third, beaten 18 1/2 lengths by Chief's Crown, 12 days ago in the Cowdin Stakes. The Young America was the seventh Grade I race for 2-year-olds this year. Script Ohio will race next in the Champagne Stakes at Aqueduct Oct. 27.

1076-> TEXANS SEEM UNCERTAIN OVER CENTRAL AMERICA
A television commercial for Bob Krueger, a candidate for the Democratic senatorial nomination, shows a voter musing over his choices. An off-camera voice says Mr. Krueger was once ambassador at large for Mexican affairs and is an expert on Latin America. ''That's important, real important,'' says the voice, as the voter marks his ballot for Mr. Krueger. The issue of Central America, of the Administration's handling of the matter, is starting to bubble to the surface in Texas as the May 5 primary election approaches. The territory south of the Rio Grande is still a distant and murky place to many voters, but the Krueger campaign operates on the conviction that public concern is growing. ''It's an edge-of-the-plate issue now,'' said George Shipley, Mr. Krueger's poll taker here in the state capital. ''But it's on the plate.'' Clearer Lines Expected Moreover, Mr. Shipley believes that Central America will continue to grow in importance, as the lines between Democratic and Republican candidates become more clearly drawn. ''President Reagan will certainly be called upon to defend his policies in the state of Texas,'' he said. ''I really do believe that Democrats and Republicans are not going to support interventionist policies for too long. There's a time fuse on this thing, and it's not only the money, it's the lack of results. The President may be mining more harbors than Nicaragua. He may be mining his own.'' Texas is not a typical state in which to assess the impact of the Central America issue, for it shares a long border with Mexico and close economic and cultural ties with the entire region. But the mood here described by Mr. Shipley mirrors the findings of the latest New York Times/CBS poll. Forty-three percent disapproved of Mr. Reagan's handling of Central America, as opposed to 30 percent who approved. Moreover, almost half the electorate expressed fears that the President might drag the United States into war in that region. Financing Blocked in Congress This finding has important legislative as well as political implications. Congress will soon resume debate on a bill allocating $62 million in military aid for El Salvador and $21 million for rebels fighting the Government of Nicaragua. House Democrats blocked the measure before the Easter recess, and Mr. Reagan has voiced hope that public pressure will dislodge the funds. Moreover, reports that the Central Intelligence Agency directed mining of Nicaraguan harbors have raised the question of how closely Congress can or should monitor the agency's secret operations. Many voters in Texas seem troubled about the Central America issue. In dozens of interviews here last week, probably the most common view expressed was ambivalence. While many Texans seem reluctant to spend much United States money or any lives to counteract leftist insurgencies in the region, few want to see any more countries fall under Communist control, ''I kind of vacillate between thinking we're involved too much and involved not enough,'' said Sandy Simpkins, a lawyer in Waco. ''Then I don't know what to think. I've worried that we've never really gotten the straight line from anybody, and I'm afraid we'll get drawn into something. It's so difficult to know who is the good guy.'' The Bad Versus the Bad ''If we were responsible for the mining of the harbors, that sounds like an extreme move,'' said Kip Antene, a salesman who supports Mr. Reagan. ''On the other hand, Nicaragua is in the hands of extremists, and maybe that's the only thing they understand. It sure looks like we're supporting a bad group of people against another bad group of people.'' Because so many voters, and their representatives in Congress, are uncertain about American involvement in the region, many of the Reagan Administration's proposals for increased aid have been trimmed or sidetracked. But these Administration efforts remind some voters of the way the United States became enmeshed in Southeast Asia. ''We should either get it done or get out; we shouldn't go in halfway,'' said Ray Lesko, a data processor for an insurance company. ''No more Vietnams,'' added his wife, Kay, a computer programmer. ''It's one of those things where you're damned if you do and damned if you don't,'' said Red Edmonds, a feed salesman. ''It's like swatting a wasp's nest with a toothpick. The odds are pretty good you'll get stung.'' At the same time, Mr. Reagan's determination to oppose Communist expansionism in Central America has garnered strong support among many voters here, who feel a renewed pride in their country and in their President. 'In Your Own Backyard' ''Lebanon was too far from home, but this is like someone fighting in your own backyard,'' said Eliseo Cotto Jr., who sells plumbing supplies. ''Reagan's shown that we can't be pushed around. I was always proud of the fact that we were the strongest nation on earth, and when Carter was President that kind of went to pot.'' ''I wish we could walk away,'' said Bob Stokes, an insurance broker and part-time minister. ''But could we stick our head in the sand and let the Communists take over?'' Given these conflicting signals, many politicians from Texas are uncertain how to approach the question of increased aid. Representative Charles W. Stenholm, a conservative Democrat from West Texas, says his constituents do not like foreign aid or the mining of the Nicaraguan harbors. ''But you'd hate to vote against the aid and have another country fall,'' he said. ''That's the bottom line. It's not an easy vote.''

1077-> PUBLISHING: A MAUGHAM COLLECTION
MANY books and collections by W. Somerset Maugham were published in his lifetime, but Maugham also wrote many newspaper and magazine articles that were never reprinted in books. Next January, Clarkson N. Potter will publish 66 of them in a Maugham collection titled, ''A Traveller in Romance: Uncollected Writings, 1901-1964.'' The volume is edited by John Whitehead, an editor in England for Muller, Blonde and White, which will publish the collection next month. Mr. Whitehead says in his introduction that the collection, which includes playlets, short stories and essays, reflects most of Maugham's principal interests. One article, ''My South Sea Island,'' has, he said, ''twice been the subject of a separate pirate printing by a press in Chicago, in 1936 and 1965, and copies of these scarce pamphlets have fetched high prices at auction.'' The collection includes 12 articles that Maugham published in American magazines during World War II. In one of the articles, titled ''Reading and Writing and You,'' Maugham wrote: ''It is an unfortunate delusion which many people suffer from, that if a book is entertaining it is perhaps a waste of time to read it. That is not so. Reading should be enjoyable and, if you start a book and find you do not enjoy it, my advice to you is to drop it, even if all the critics in the land assure you that it is a masterpiece. And don't forget that escape literature may be very good literature. One of the greatest books that has been produced in this country is 'Huckleberry Finn,' and if that isn't escape literature I can't imagine what it is.'' Mr. Whitehead does not claim that any of these articles is a literary masterpiece. But, he writes, ''out of this rich harvest of minor work emerges a sympathetic portrait of the artist which may be nearer a true likeness of Maugham than any biographer has so far achieved.'' Avon Books Planning Southern Writing Program No serious reader needs to be reminded that many fine writers are Southerners - so many, in fact, that Avon Books is planning a Southern Writing Program beginning late next year. The program will include fiction and nonfiction, original works as well as reprints from hard-cover houses, regional presses and university presses. Books will be published in trade paperback in uniform cover designs. ''We receive an increasing number of manuscripts from Southern regional and university presses, as well as from agents and writers themselves,'' said Walter Meade, Avon president and publisher. ''In light of this, and of the fact that a considerable list of high quality work by Southern writers is already published in hard cover, we felt compelled to create an Avon forum which we hope will bring these books to the notice of readers everywhere.'' Accordingly, Avon will reissue some of its own books, including Margaret Mitchell's ''Gone With the Wind'' and four novels by Walker Percy: ''Lancelot,'' ''The Last Gentleman,'' ''Love in the Ruins'' and ''The Moviegoer.'' New titles will include 'The Origins of Faulkner's Art'' by Judith Sensibar, from the University of Texas Press; ''How Far She Went,'' a novel by Mary Hood, and ''Portraits of Southern Writers'' by Mark Morrow, both from the University of Georgia Press, and four novels - originally published by Charles Scribner's Sons - by Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, who won a 1939 Pulitzer Prize for ''The Yearling.'' 'Instant' Book on Election While the publishing project has been aborted between Theodore H. White and Time magazine to produce a book on the 1984 Presidential election, another project is proceeding as planned. Bantam Books will publish an ''instant hard-cover'' book about the Presidential election written by a team of Newsweek correspondents, under the direction of Peter Goldman and Tony Fuller, who wrote ''Charlie Company'' and who have been assigned exclusively to this project. The book, as yet untitled, will be an expanded outgrowth of a post-election Newsweek special issue. The manuscript is to be delivered early next year for publication next spring. Celebrating Bryant Fordham University Press will publish the fourth volume of ''The Letters of William Cullen Bryant'' on Nov. 3, Bryant's 190th birthday. To celebrate, the press plans a reception on Nov. 5 at the Century Club in midtown Manhattan. According to H. George Fletcher, the director of the press, the date and place were chosen to mark the 120th anniversary of a festival held at the Century to mark Bryant's 70th birthday. The book jacket explains that the country's leading artists and writers entertained Bryant at a ''festival'' at the Century, giving him a portfolio of pictures by 46 painters as a token of the ''sympathy'' he had ''ever manifested toward the Artists'' and the ''high rank'' he had ''ever accorded to art.'' Ralph Waldo Emerson, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, James Russell Lowell and John Greenleaf Whittier, who saluted Bryant in prose and verse, were present on that occasion. This time, Mr. Fletcher said the club is expected to exhibit most of the original art presented to Bryant on that memorable evening. 'The Sex Life of Flowers' At the American Booksellers Association convention in Washington last May, visitors to the Facts on File booth did a doubletake after seeing the jacket for a book scheduled for publication in October: ''The Sex Life of Flowers'' by Bastiaan Meeuse and Sean Morris. The meaning becomes clearer now that the publisher has affixed a sticker to the jacket that says, ''Based on the PBS Nature presentation, Sexual Encounters of the Floral Kind.''

1078-> POPE'S KOREAN MESSAGE: RECONCILIATION
Pope John Paul II preached a sermon of reconciliation today in this city in which the Government crushed a student uprising four years ago. John Paul, addressing a silently attentive audience of about 50,000 at a mass in the city stadium, said: ''I am keenly aware of the deep wounds that pain your hearts and souls from personal experiences and from recent tragedies, which are difficult to overcome from a merely human point of view, especially for those of you from Kwangju.'' Speaking of ''the grace of reconciliation,'' he added: ''This part of Christ's saving message is particularly relevant for those who are haunted by the memory of the unfortunate events of this place. ''By accepting the consequences of our baptismal commitment, we become instruments of reconciliation and peace in the midst of dissension and hatred. In this way, as effective signs of Christ's healing power working in us, we ease the pain of injured hearts that are filled with anxiety and bitterness.'' Kwangju, a city of 800,000, was the scene of a weeklong anti-Government uprising in 1980. At least 189 people were killed as troops put down the rebellion. Pope Speaks in English The Pope's words, spoken in English, were translated by a South Korean priest and followed attentively by the crowd, in which women were predominant, dressed in ceremonial white. ''This is good and strong,'' said a missionary priest who was in Kwangju during the 1980 uprising. Another said he would cite the Pope's words in his own preaching. Priests and nuns at the mass said, on being assured anonymity, that bitterness over the military assault on student-occupied strongholds continued to run deep in the city and its surroundings. Continuing student demonstrations at the university campus caused the Government to suspend classes for the last two days. At the campus today many students were milling about or playing softball. Although students said uniformed policemen had been withdrawn to relax tension, a man who was not dressed like a professor and who appeared too old to be a student moved close while a reporter chatted with students on the steps of the music school. This ended the conversation. Later the man questioned the students. Demands for Free Press Other students said the demonstrations had focused on demands for a free press and were protests against the punitive drafting of student leaders for military service. Six such dissidents have died in military training; the Government of President Chun Doo Hwan said they were suicides. In Seoul, meanwhile, students demonstrated on several university campuses into the evening. The police, however, prevented their spilling into the streets of the capital. The protests were not directed against the Pope, but were evidently timed to take place while world attention is concentated on Seoul because of the Pope's visit. (About 1,000 student demonstrators reportedly occupied a library building at Korea University in Seoul after 5,000 were prevented from carrying their demonstration into the streets, according to The Associated Press.) A social worker in Kwangju, who was a militant four years ago, said the Pope's visit, which as a Roman Catholic she had eagerly awaited, had been a disappointment to her and her friends. Part of the reason, she said, was the tight security, with heavy police reinforcements, which prevented John Paul from hearing the people's views. As a result, she said, the Pope's visit is ''more abstract than concrete.'' On this second day of his four-day visit, John Paul also flew to Sorok Island, off the southern Korean coast, to visit the national leprosy hospital. Back in Seoul, he spoke with the foreign ambassadors based in South Korea, urging them ''to work for peace by working for a change of heart.''

1082-> FOREIGN AFFAIRS; WIN OR SEEK PEACE?
President Reagan said the ''U.S. must support the Salvadoran Government and the Nicaraguan people.'' The apparent contradiction is more than superficial. Polls show that many Americans are unclear about which side the Administration is putting its money on. It's against rebels in Salvador, for rebels whom Mr. Reagan calls ''freedom fighters'' in Nicaragua. The answer is that we aren't against guerrillas, but against Marxists. The question remains the goal of U.S. strategy. Is it to bring an end to militarization and fighting in Central America, or to produce military victories? The more the issue is aired, the more confused it becomes. Salvador's President-elect Jose Napoleon Duarte made such a good impression on Congress Tuesday that he is bound to get the next installment of $62 million in aid, which the Administration requested. But Mr. Duarte deliberately did not say that he expected to ''win'' the civil war. On the contrary, he said that he would seek to control his own military and the right-wing death squads in order to produce enough security in his country for all but extremist rebels to be willing to shift from armed to political confrontation. That will be hard, but it may not be impossible if both the right-wingers and left-wingers are convinced the U.S. wants negotiations that would leave the Central Americans to sort out their reforms. The trouble is that U.S. action in the rest of the area leaves this quite uncertain. When Mexico's President, Miguel de la Madrid, was here last week, Mr. Reagan said: ''The conflagration in Central America appears too close to ignore. Like a fire in one's neighborhood, this threat should be of concern to every nation in the hemisphere.'' But Mr. de la Madrid, whose country's security President Reagan said was his major concern, urged rejection of ''interventionist solutions of any kind.'' He warned that the ''risk of a generalized war, the scope and duration of which no one can foresee'' was growing in Central America. Shortly before he left home, he said the U.S. has ''signaled that there are not the conditions to negotiate'' with Nicaragua, whom Mr. Reagan blames for supporting the Salvadoran rebels. Nicaragua does want to negotiate, the Mexican President said. Gen. Paul F. Gorman, who commands the U.S. military in the region from headquarters in Panama, said that within 10 years Mexico would be ''the number one security problem for the U.S. unless there is some dramatic change.'' He called Mexico a ''center for subversion,'' which pursues ''a policy of accommodation, not only with their own leftist elements but with international leftist influences.'' Is U.S. policy then one of accommodation for peaceful development in the region or one of confrontation? Is the U.S. purpose to help Mexico protect its independence and its form of democracy, or to bring some ''dramatic change'' in its position? A year ago, an argument on these very questions was raging inside the Administration. Thomas Enders, then Assistant Secretary of State for Latin American Affairs, was urging an increased use of force in order to bring general negotiations that would wind up excluding both U.S. and Cuban and Soviet-backed military activity. Nobody ever accused Mr. Enders of being a dove. He didn't oppose active intervention. But he was pushed out of his job because he didn't believe a military victory was possible and sought conditions for a compromise. Since then, the C.I.A.-supported ''contra'' guerrillas in Nicaragua have become a force of 15,000. On the pretext of five yearlong rotating ''maneuvers,'' the U.S. is establishing a large-scale system of bases and military facilities in Honduras that cannot strengthen that country's fragile civilian Government. Now it is pressing Costa Rica, which has a longstanding policy of neutrality and no army, to build up its forces. The military side of Mr. Enders's recommendations has been put into effect, and then some. But there is still no sign of a political plan, short of ousting the Nicaraguan Government and establishing the U.S. as permanent guarantor against left-wing revolutionaries. Neither President-elect Duarte nor President de la Madrid believes this kind of victory to be possible, at least not without a full-scale war, which would be a tragedy for everybody, including the U.S. The situation is coming to have a smell of Cambodia, where Mr. Enders helped run the war, which was supposed to ''shorten'' the war in Vietnam. Instead it ended Cambodia's chance of escaping the regional conflict and brought total disaster. Mr. Duarte needs aid to establish his authority. But he also needs some solid signs that the U.S. is more concerned with keeping the East-West conflict out of Central America and curtailing the slaughter, than with establishing client regimes.

1083-> MUSIC: RECITAL BY ELMAR OLIVEIRA
ELMAR OLIVEIRA, a violinist who holds the Tchaikovsky Gold Medal, gave a recital of Handel (13th of the Opus 1 sonatas), Prokofiev (Op. 80), Suk (Four Pieces, Op. 17) and Brahms (Third Sonata) in Carnegie Hall Wednesday with the pianist Robert McDonald. Mr. Oliveira's sound is big and rich; his double-stopped passages in particular have unusual beauty and reliability of intonation. He does fiendishly difficult passagework as though it weren't. Especially in some razzle-dazzle encores, he gave a special exhilaration. Some can also play movingly in simple slow movements, but Mr. Oliveira could or would not Wednesday: Brahms's adagio in particular was wooden and straitlaced. And even some of the virtuosity had an odd feel. With Horowitz or Heifetz, one senses behind the athletics, if not depth, then charm, bizarrerie, or at least delight. But Mr. Oliveira works his technical wonders with the detached panache of a James Bond knocking off 10 armed enemy agents. It is not characterless playing by any means: There is vigor, there is vitality - but not, as far as this listener could hear, engagement. Mr. McDonald's generally fine playing had at several points less clarity than the violinst's.

1085-> WESTCCHESTER GUIDE
HOLOCAUST MISSION ''When each of us comes before the six million we will be asked what we did with our lives. One will say that he became a watchmaker, another will say that he became a tailor . . . but I will say, 'I did not forget you.' '' That is the reason Simon Wiesenthal gives for putting aside his degree in architectural engineering and devoting his life to the pursuit of Nazi war criminals. Mr. Wiesenthal will give a talk titled ''The Murders Among Us: Consequences of the Holocaust'' at 8:30 P.M. Saturday in the Fox Lane High School on Route 172 in Bedford. Head of the Jewish Documentation Center in Vienna, where he works to increase the total of 1,100 Nazis who have been captured through his efforts, his cause is carried forward in a spartan office financed by contributions from sympathizers all over the world. Best known for his part in the widely publicized capture in 1961, trial and execution of Adolph Eichmann, commandant of Treblinka, and his continuing efforts to track down Dr. Joseph Mengele of Auschwitz, believed to be in hiding in South America, Mr. Wiesenthal has compiled a list of 160,000 other Nazis that he hopes to bring to justice. During a four-year period of World War II he and his wife were prisoners, escapees and imprisoned again in concentration camps and forced labor camps near Lvov, Austria, his birthplace. They were liberated and reunited in 1945 by American troops. Until 1947 he worked for the War Crimes Section of the United States Army and the Office of Strategic Services and Counter-Intelligence Corps, gathering evidence on Nazi atrocities. This is expected to be his only appearance in the area for some time. It was arranged by the Northern Westchester Y.M.-Y.W.H.A. Tickets at $12.50, or $7.50 for students and the elderly, may be reserved by calling 241-2064. SLIDE TALK Jewish communities in Japan, Thailand, Taiwan and mainland China, where they have existed for more than 3,000 years, will be discussed in during a slide show by Warren Freedman, author of ''World Guide for the Jewish Traveler'' at 10 A.M. Thursday at the Southern Westchester Y.M.-Y.W.H.A., at 30 Oakley Avenue in Mount Vernon. Registration for the one-and-a-half-hour program costs $3.50. The telephone number is 664-0500. WAVE HILL WORKSHOP Serious amateur string players of high school age and older can join an intensive workshop of coaching, ensemble playing and a public performance at Wave Hill this weekend. Organized by the Bronx Arts Ensemble, the program will be headed by Gene Forrell, conductor of the English National Orchestra, the English Synfonia and the Alexandra Choral Society. Ensemble members scheduled as coaches are Susan Ornstein and Browning Cramer, violinists, Susan Follari, violist, and Gabriel Morales, cellist. Players will be grouped by ability and experience and music will be provided. Coaching sessions include such details as ''coming in'' with confidence, dealing with different editions, supporting a soloist, relationship with music-stand partner and understanding conductors' and players' gestures. A fee of $50 will be charged for the weekend, including lunches. Hours are 9:30 A.M. to 5:30 P.M. Saturday and 9:30 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. Sunday. Wave Hill is the former estate of Arturo Toscanini, operated by New York City's Cultural Affairs Department and located at 249th Street and Independence Avenue in Riverdale. To register or obtain more information call (212) 549-3200. SOCIAL DRAMA PLUS A movable feast of entertainment has been organized in Mount Vernon and New Rochelle by Black Singles Resources, a 300-member ''networking'' and support group founded by Dr. Mildred Brown of Mount Vernon. The play, titled ''Strings,'' is described as a humorous, one-hour, ''sociodrama.'' It will be presented at 8 P.M. Saturday in the Dole Center at 250 South Sixth Avenue in Mount Vernon, followed by a second hour of poetry readings, dance and music. At 10 P.M., the cast and audience will move to the Palace Discoth eque at 508 Main Street in New Rochelle, for refreshments, more music and a cast party. Tickets for the entire evening cost $7 and can be ordered by calling 636-6596 or 699-1388 after 6 P.M. CONCERNING CATS More than 500 cats will be judged at the County Center in White Plains when the International Cat Association Show gets under way from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. Saturday and next Sunday. Veterinarians and breeders will give brief talks on health and grooming throughout the two days and booths will feature feline Christmas presents. Animal shelters in the county will have inoculated and neutered kittens and adult cats on hand for adoption. Information on joining the International Cat Association, which has headquarters in Harlingen, Tex., Canada and Europe, will also be available. As a special feature for breeders, potential judges and interested cat fanciers, the Westchester Feline Club, sponsors of the show, have arranged a seminar on genetics from 2 to 7 P.M. Friday at the County Center. Don Shaw, breeder, judge, biologist and author of several books on color genetics, will conduct the program. Tickets at $10 can be reserved by calling 962-5479. Admission to the cat show is $3.50 for adults, $2.50 for children under 12. A WORD FOR HUNTERS The Ulster County Public Information Office in Kingston says that there are lots of wild turkeys, ringneck pheasants and ruffled grouse inhabiting its thousands of acres of forests, just in time for Thanksgiving. Hunters must be licensed through town clerk's offices, sporting goods stores or the Department of Environmental Conservation. The New York State Hunting, Trapping and Fishing Guide, available wherever licenses are sold, contains rules and regulations for taking game birds. New hunters are required by the state to receive instruction in the use of firearms, longbow and traps. Phone 331- 9300 for more information. PRINTS ON SALE Several hundred 19th- and 20th- century prints will be placed on sale by the New York Botanical Garden Library from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. Thursday and Friday. Donated by friends of the library to benefit its book repair and binding fund, the prints are executed in various techniques on subjects pertaining to natural history and horticulture. Some are original depictions of Captain Cook's voyages and similar expeditions, others are of birds, butterflies, insects, flowers and fruits. Prices, at $3 to $20, are ''a steal,'' said Jennefer Witter, a Botanical Gardens publicist. Parking on the grounds costs $2.50, but there is no admission charge. For directions and more information call (212) 220-8700.

1086-> REAGAN, AT OHIO RALLY, ATTACKS MONDALE ANEW
The campaign barrage of colored balloons floated in two directions today but otherwise President Reagan kept safely to the familiar role of the front- runner, avoiding new initiatives and repeating his standard attack on Walter F. Mondale. ''If I could find a way to dress up as his tax program, I could scare the devil out of people on Halloween,'' Mr. Reagan told a crowd of 10,000 students here at Ohio State University. The remark was part of his stump speech, and the crowd roared with laughter at this and other standard lines he has cautiously taken to repeating at each stop in these final days of the campaign. The President's performance, well received by all but fewer than 100 hecklers, exemplified his homestretch strategy of reiterating attacks on what his campaign regards as Mr. Mondale's most vulnerable isues. ''His approach to national defense is so like the previous Administration that millions of Americans have decided we simply can't afford to go down that path again,'' Mr. Reagan said, keeping with his strategists' attempt to portray the outcome of the Nov. 6 voting as all but settled in his favor. Aides Are Cautious, Too While Mr. Reagan has been carefully repeating himself on the stump, his aides have been cautious in private in discussing the future, avoiding questions about program priorities and possible White House changes if the President is re-elected. Mr. Reagan won the crowd with his emphasis on military strength and his assertion that ''America is back.'' The scene reverberated with football metaphors and the crowd's pleas for his re- election. One new touch was that today's climactic balloon barrage featured the novelty of red and white ballons tumbling down from the ceiling and intermingling with blue, helium-filled balloons floating up from the floor. Missing from Mr. Reagan's standard speech was his reference to the memory of John F. Kennedy as a Democrat he admired. The President confirmed Tuesday night that he wrote a letter in 1960 that Democrats say seemed to compare Kennedy to Karl Marx and Kennedy's economic philosophy to Nazism. The letter was to Richard M. Nixon, the Republican Presidential nominee in 1960. Letter on Kennedy Defended ''It was a good letter,'' Mr. Reagan commented today in response to a reporter's question. ''I was explaining my philosophy.'' He denied that he compared the Kennedy program to Marxism and Hitlerism. ''I didn't,'' he said. ''I just said that if we start down the road to statism it leads to socialism. No matter how well it is presented, whether it goes to the left or to the right, it eventually winds up as totalitarianism. So the idea is less government.'' In his speech today, the President ranged from his denunciations of the Federal Government as trying to ''live our lives for us'' to the contention that with his Administration ''we decided to rebuild and be strong again.'' Hecklers referred to a now-familiar campaign dispute over Mr. Reagan's knowledge of nuclear weaponry when they began chanting, ''You can't call them back.'' Critics said the President contended in 1982 that nucelar missiles could be recalled after firing, an interpretation rejected by the President. A Duel of Slogans At different points in the speech, hecklers chanted, ''It just ain't so!'' But the President used the interruption to summon cheers from his own supporters. Quite often, the words resounding in the hall amounted to a duel of slogans. ''We want peace!'' a small band of hecklers shouted from the balcony. ''Four more years!'' the pro-Reagan majority shouted more loudly. ''We were right when we stopped sending out 'S-O-S' and started saying, 'U.S.A!' '' Mr. Reagan asserted, repeating another familiar line that sparked the crowd to a roaring round of flag-waving, fist-shaking chants: ''U.S.A! U.S.A! U.S.A!'' Football and Politics The President was greeted on his arrival in St. John's Auditorium with the university band playing ''Hail to the Chief'' and the Ohio State football fight song back to back. Woody Hayes, the former football coach still revered on the campus, equated the team's need to win ''four more games'' to get to the Rose Bowl with the President's need to win ''four more years'' to retain the White House. Mr. Reagan had lunch at the campus house of his old college fraternity, Tau Kappa Epsilon, a manor-style house with leaded windows, where cheerleaders greeted him and the menu included ham sandwiches and potato chips.

1087-> TALKING PREPAYMENT; AVOIDING MORTGAGE PENALTIES
Way down among the seemingly less important provisions of many mortgage contracts is a clause allowing the lender to charge a fee if the loan is paid off within the first few years. Known as a prepayment penalty, it permits the lender to charge as much as $6,000 or $7,000 if the loan is closed out within the first year or two instead of being amortized in the normal fashion over the longer-term. The aim is to prevent a quick switch to another lender or a different type of mortgage as soon as rates fluctuate or a competitor's new offering seems like a better deal. The penalty will also frequently be invoked if the home is put back on the market and sold soon after purchase. In this case, bankers insist the goal is to insure the profitablilty of the loan - even over its brief life - by allowing them to recoup processing costs not covered by initiation or points charges. A borrower who foresees the need to refinance or sell the property within the first few years, therefore, might be better off taking a more expensive mortgage that does not include a prepayment penalty. Hal Friedman, a senior vice president at the J. Walter Thompson Company in New York City, found this out to his chagrin after spending $174,000 on a 300-year-old saltbox vacation home in Brookfield Center, Conn., in 1981. His primary residence at that time was a co-op in Manhattan. The $115,000 mortage he took out with First Federal Savings and Loan of Waterbury included a prepayment penalty active for the first five years of the loan. The formula, standard among federally chartered thrift institutions, called for the payment of the equivalent of six months' interest based on 80 percent of the original loan balance - more than $7,000. Mr. Friedman said he dismissed the clause as unimportant - partly because he did not intend to make any changes at the time, but also because the wording led him to believe the bank would never impose it. ''The contract said 'at the discretion of the lender,' '' he recalled, ''so I assumed it was just boilerplate.'' Last summer, a change in family circumstances forced him to put the house back on the market - and he was horrified to discover that the bank was indeed charging him a penalty of $7,200. He retained a lawyer and called the broker who sold him the house - to no avail. All he could get was an agreement by the bank to lower the penalty to $6,000 as a show of good faith. A national survey of mortgage practices completed in August for General Electric Mortgage Insurance Companies of Raleigh, N.C., showed that 22 percent of the lenders in the Northeast were still insisting on prepayment penalties, although not necessarily on all types of mortgages and at all times. The reason these penalties are not more widespread is partly due to consumer pressure, as well as the emergence in the last few years of state regulations limiting the practice. State-chartered thrift institutions in New Jersey, for instance, are now prohibited by state law from charging prepayment penalties. Those in New York are limited to charging such a penalty only during the first year of a mortgage loan. Federally chartered institutions in both states may do as they wish, said Robert Albaneze, vice pesident of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, the agency that regulates these particular lenders. Connecticut has no prepayment penalty restrictions. The possibility of finding such a penalty is thus still quite likely. Moreover, if one is included in the contract, it should not be taken lightly. It is increasingly likely that it will be imposed because of the current pressure on lenders to show profits. ''Prepayment penalties are almost never being waived because there is no advantage to the bank to do so,'' warned Craig Millard, president of the Englehard Group, mortgage-data publishers in New Canaan, Conn. But bankers concede that there are ways of lessening a penalty or negotiating its elimination under special circumstances. For example, a borrower might persuade the buyer of his home to use the same lender, or provide evidence of a close business relationship with the lender on other matters. Harold W. Smith, Jr. executive vice president at First Federal Savings and Loan, whose penalty came as a shock to Mr. Friedman, said his institution had a policy of hewing closely to a contract and could not arbitrarily waive its terms for one borrower and not another. But, he added, the penalty could have been waived if Mr. Friedman had persuaded the buyer to finance the house through First Federal. Mr. Friedman said he found this out too late. That kind of waiver is fairly common, however. For example, Sound Federal Savings and Loan of Mamaroneck, N. Y., among others in the area, will also waive the penalty if the seller brings in the new buyer. Thus borrowers assuming a prepayment penalty would do well to ask about such a policy in advance. OTHER ways to avoid the penalty are offering to refinance with the same lender rather than taking the loan elsewhere, and agreeing with the lender in advance that the penalty will be waived if the house is sold rather than refinanced. Another way out might be to suggest that the borrower's relationship is sufficiently strong to warrant reconsideration. ''We usually toe a pretty hard line,'' said Paul Hughes, first vice president at People's Bank of Bridgeport, Conn. ''But if the borrower is a large depositor - say he has at least $25,000 with us - or uses us regularly on a commercial basis, we might make an exception.'' People's requires a prepayment penalty for the first five years of any fixed-rate loan. The charge operates on a sliding scale - 5 percent of the loan balance for the first year, 4 percent the second, and so forth. If the desire is to refinance either to obtain a more favorable rate than was possible at the time of purchase, or to enlarge the size of the mortgage to release some cash - without triggering a prepayment penalty - it would be wise to first discuss this need with the original mortgage holder rather than rush elsewhere. Emery Otruba, vice president for mortgage origination at People's Bank of Westchester, said a penalty would not be charged if the refinancing was done with his institution. Otherwise it charges 2 percent of the principal balance, but only for the first year of a fixed-rate loan. Another method might be to leave the original mortgage in place and take out an equity loan. Mr. Albaneze, the Federal regulator, reminds borrowers that a penalty is a negotiable item with many lenders at the outset. ''Show them the competition has given them up,'' he suggested. ''Or offer to trade it for a slight difference in the rate or the points charge. It might just work.''

1090-> SURVIVING LIFE
Lisa Zeidner is the author of two novels, ''Customs'' and ''Alexandra Freed,'' and a book of poems, ''Talking Cure.'' VOICES FROM THE MOON By Andre Dubus. 126 pp. Boston: David R. Godine. $12.95. Twelve-year old Richie wants to be a priest, and it isn't easy. Temptation is the least of his problems. His parents are divorced. His sister, Carol, giddy from cocaine, is living in sin. His brother, Larry, has left a marriage haunted by sexual perversion. And now their father, Greg, is going to marry Brenda - Larry's ex-wife. When this much heartache befalls one small-town Masachusetts family, a writer risks soap opera. But Andre Dubus's ''Voices From the Moon'' is not melodramatic despite the emotional surfeit of its plot. At just 126 pages, his novel has the unsettlingly delicate power of a cool summer night. Emotions, Mr. Dubus tells us - even the most dramatic ones - are elusive as U.F.O.'s. Well-respected for his short fiction, Mr. Dubus has been working at his craft for more than 20 years and beat the New Realists to New Realism by over two decades. His characters are store managers, house-painters, amateur dancers. Their speech is simple; their lives are full of softball games, barbecues and brawls in smoke-filled bars. Unlike many writers who examine the quotidian side of American life, Mr. Dubus does not condescend to his characters. They are proud of their work, observant, and rich in feeling. ''We don't have to live great lives,'' one of these characters says; ''we just have to understand and survive the ones we've got.'' The lives they've got are full of pleasures. Greg enjoys fatherhood, the satisfaction of customers at his two ice cream stores; Richie's mother enjoys waitressing and, after work, the solitude of her tiny apartment, where she plays classical music and ''sculpted her sadness into something strong and lovely.'' It is clarity and intensity, not happiness, that these characters seek. Mr. Dubus would probably concur with Rainer Maria Rilke that ''It isn't at all important to be happy.'' Stress and change are difficult but also exhilarating. Despair and ecstasy are alike, in that both propel you outside of your daily life, make you feel as Richie does riding a horse, or in church: then ''he was so free of the world and his life in it that he could have been in another country, in another century; or not even on the earth, not mortal.'' As in much of Mr. Dubus's work, the pleasure comes less from the resolution of the plot than from the insights: Greg's observation that teen-agers gathering for a clandestine smoke and beer ''did not seem comfortable unless they were stationary in a familiar spot, like an old person, or a dog, in a house''; Richie's recognition that ''seeing your father cry was somehow like seeing your mother naked.'' Mr. Dubus is particularly astute on the nuances of domestic life. Brenda considers how ''as a woman you were left having to choose between a grown boy and a flat American male, and either was likely to drive you mad.'' Resting with Greg after taking a shower, ''she felt held by tranquility and shared solitude, as the hands of her parents had held her on the surface of water when she was a child.'' Such precise perceptions more than compensate for Mr. Dubus's occasional sentimentality. It's refreshing to read a serious contemporary writer who is willing to err in the direction of giving a character ''nether regions of her soul'' in a literary decade when directly addressing emotion of any kind - no less The Soul - is not fashionable. ''VOICES FROM THE MOON'' is not much longer than the four novellas in Mr. Dubus's last collection, ''We Don't Live Here Anymore,'' so the title ''novel'' is somewhat misleading. Since each of the novellas in that collection considered its characters and circumstances from several points of view, the book offered more of the development and detail traditionally associated with the novel. Whatever the name of the form, 126 pages is a perfect length for the kind of evanescent, intangible emotion Mr. Dubus examines so well. The single summer day in ''Voices From the Moon'' is long and complex enough for Mr. Dubus to illuminate a family's quiet revolution. B

1091-> THE NATION ; A CAREER MAN GETS POSTAL JOB
Perhaps Edward J. Rollins should have conducted his own campaign for the job of Postmaster General instead of leaving it to White House aides. Last week, the Postal Service board rejected the Administration's appeal on behalf of Mr. Rollins, director of the Reagan-Bush campaign committee, and chose Paul N. Carlin for the job. John R. McKean, the Reagan appointee who is chairman of the seven-member board, said he and his fellow governors wanted a career postal administrator such as Mr. Carlin, who is now in charge of the service's three-state Chicago region. They also wanted to move the agency ''further away than ever before'' from political considerations, he said. However, another candidate, Tom Costin, president of the National Association of Postmasters, reportedly was rejected because of his ties to Democrats. Politics or not, some White House aides said they thought Mr. Rollins might have got the job if lobbying for him had been a bit more timely. The postal board has been seeking a successor to Postmaster General William F. Bolger for a year, and Mr. Rollins's name wasn't raised until last week. If timing worked against Mr. Rollins, it will work for Mr. Carlin. By the time he takes over the service in January, some major headaches should be out of the way. An arbitration board headed by Clark Kerr, former president of the University of California, last week began 40 days of deliberation aimed at producing a wage settlement with unions representing 600,000 postal workers. About the same time the wage settlement is to be announced in December, the postal governors are expected to say when postal rates will rise and by how much.

The widow of the opposition leader Benigno S. Aquino today scorned the panel reports that blamed the Philippine military for her husband's killing, charging that President Ferdinand E.

Corazon Aquino, appearing at a news conference, said she could not believe the assassination was ''planned and executed without Mr. Marcos' foreknowledge or express approval.'' She said she would hold to the view that justice was not possible while Mr. Marcos was in power.

1093-> RELIGION AND POLITICS MIX POORLY FOR DEMOCRATS
Not since John F. Kennedy ran for President in 1960 has religion been as much a part of political discourse as it was in the 1984 campaign. Bishops, ministers, rabbis - and candidates - talked about abortion and the separation of church and state. Religion even figured in television commercials. Serious intellectual issues were often seriously discussed, but the serious political issue was votes. Appeals by both parties were carefully aimed at particular religious faiths. It seems clear now that the Republicans lost Jews but more than made up with Catholics and white Protestants, especially those white Christians who think of themselves as ''born again.'' According to the New York Times/CBS News Poll of 8,671 voters on Election Day, white Catholics - formerly safely Democratic - divided 58 percent to 41 percent for President Reagan. ''Born-again'' white Christians, who first came to wide political notice when Jimmy Carter ran as one in 1976, this time preferred the Republican candidate 81 to 19 percent. Other white Protestants voted for Mr. Reagan 69 to 30 percent. White Catholics accounted for 24 percent of the electorate; born-again Christians for 16 percent; other white Protestants for 32 percent. Among the 3 percent of the voters who were Jewish, Walter F. Mondale held a 66 to 32 percent edge. As the Rev. Andrew M. Greeley, a research associate at the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, put it: ''For all the talk about defections of Catholics from the Democratic ticket, the thing that struck me was the departure of the white Protestants.'' In a landslide like this year's, no one group determines a result. But according to the exit poll, the Republican 8.5 million-vote margin among white born-again Christians was a bit bigger than the combined Democratic margin among Jews and blacks - although blacks gave Mr. Mondale 90 percent of their approximately 9 million votes. ''Any liberal Democrat is off base with them (the born-again Christians) on values and life style issues,'' observed Lee C. Atwater, a key Southern strategist on the Republican team. Not disagreeing sharply, Robert Squier, a leading maker of Democratic television commercials, said: ''We may deal with them fairly effectively in other, statewide elections. But in good economic times we can't deal with them nationally. If we don't have an economic issue for those people, we don't seem to have any issues.'' Figuring out which issues led members of any group to vote the way they did is harder than just counting the votes, but the Times/CBS News Poll made it clear that appearances before the election were deceiving. The contest for the support of white Catholics was open and obvious. Their bishops, priests and politicians were constantly out front in open debate, usually about abortion. But on Election Day, for Catholic voters as for almost everyone else, the buoyant economy was the principal determinant. Only 8 percent of the Catholics polled checked abortion as the key issue or one of two key issues that had infuenced them; 41 percent - five times as many - checked the economy. The Catholics ranked other issues higher too: arms control, 32 percent; the budget deficit, 24 percent; national defense, 23 percent; fairness toward the poor, 18 percent. The Catholics in the sample who did rank abortion high were Reagan voters by a 71 to 28 percent margin. But the white Catholics who picked out fairness toward the poor formed a group more than twice as big and preferred Mr. Mondale by a 79 to 20 percent margin. Catholics did not swing toward the Republicans much more heavily in 1984 than in 1980. The division was 58 percent to 41 percent this time, compared with 51 to 40 percent four years ago. Even so, the Democrats have reason to worry. Whatever the rate of defection of various factions between 1980 and 1984, there is little likelihood that the Democrats can make long-range gains among white Protestants - for years the bedrock of the Republican vote. Catholics have been the core of white support for Democrats, and that core seems increasingly hollow. Abortion did seem to matter to the born-again white Christians. Eighteen percent checked abortion in the poll, and only the economy and defense were clearly more important to them. Ninety-three percent of the born-again Christians who picked abortion voted for Mr. Reagan. For this group in particular, one element of Mr. Reagan's style seemed to pay off: his general adherence to ''traditional values'' appealed to about one born-again Christian in four. There was a negative for the Republicans in the association of their party with one particular born-again Christian: the Rev. Jerry Falwell, founder of the Moral Majority. The Republicans had hoped to capitalize among Jewish voters on accusations that Mr. Mondale was soft on the Rev. Jesse Jackson's alleged anti-Semitism, but they ran up against Jewish antipathy to the Falwell connection. As Roger Stone, another strategist on the Reagan- Bush team, put it: ''Our upside potential was fantastic because of the anti-Semitism issue. We lost the focus and the issue became the separation of church and state.'' Mr. Stone argued that just as the Falwell connection hurt with Jews, it also hindered Republican progress with young people and was not much help with Catholics. ''We've got some great opportunities here,'' he observed, ''if we don't go out on some social issue jag.''

1094-> Allan Miller to Head Hebrew Arts School
Allan Miller will become president of the Hebrew Arts School on Jan. 1, succeeding Dr. Tzipora H. Jochsberger, who founded the school and directed it for 32 years. Among the school's activities is the Merkin Concert Hall at the Abraham Goodman House on West 67th Street, which counts as one of New York's major small recital halls. Mr. Miller will continue as co-artistic director of Symphony Space, the performing-arts center on Broadway. Born in 1933, Mr. Miller was a staff conductor with the Baltimore and Denver Symphonies, and is also a film and television documentarian. Among his projects was ''Bolero,'' with Zubin Mehta and the Los Angeles Philharmonic, for which he won an Academy Award. He was artistic director of the feature film, ''From Mao to Mozart,'' which also won an Academy Award. Mr. Miller has long been active in music education, and has written educational books for both children and adults.

1095-> BRIEFING; Reagan and Rockefeller
Ronald Reagan, as he himself acknowledges, has been one of the most adjustable figures in American political life, shifting over the years from the stance of an ardent New Deal Democrat and labor union activist to that of an apostle of unfettered capitalism and the Republican right wing. Perhaps it should not be surprising then that Mr. Reagan reversed his attitude toward the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in the same period. Correspondence on file in the National Archives shows that in 1959 he wrote Vice President Nixon a letter about the speeches Mr. Reagan was making on ''economic conservatism'' around the country for General Electric. ''The only adverse opinion in the last two years,'' Mr. Reagan reported, ''was an editorial in a local 'teamster union' paper, which I accept as further evidence that 'sound thinking' is on our side.'' The teamsters, unlike most of the rest of organized labor, have endorsed Mr. Reagan for re-election, a gesture he has enthusiastically welcomed. Also in the archive is a footnote on political history: an apparently heretofore unnoticed telegram that Mr. Reagan and his wife, Nancy, sent to Nixon headquarters at the 1960 Republican National Convention in Chicago at a time when some conservatives feared that Mr. Nixon might choose Nelson A. Rockefeller, then Governor of New York, as his running mate. It reads in full: ''Respectfully urge consideration Goldwater for vice president. Cannot support ticket if it includes Rockefeller.''

1096-> Advertising; Cinematic Tack for Wrangler
IF you wanted to reach the 12-to-34 set - the distracted generation - you must first find them. They are probably watching prime-time television, music television on cable or, of course, the movies. That sounds likely, doesn't it? But how would you hold the attention of such a disparate group? Well, an action-filled mini-flick - an ad in the form of a film - just might do it. You are now in possession of the up- till-now secret marketing plans of Wrangler, the casual-clothes maker that accounts for half the sales of Blue Bell Inc. Wrangler, you see, ranks second, behind Levi and ahead of Lee, in the top echelons of jeans sellers. Although the jeans market is a hefty $7 billion a year, it has not been growing lately. Wrangler makes other types of casual wear and it is out to tell the world that. The TV campaign from Dancer Fitzgerald Sample intends to let a youthful audience know of the diversity without serving up item-oriented advertising. The commercials, scheduled to begin running Nov. 19, were inspired, the agency maintains, by the movie serials of yesteryear. Indeed, they seem as if they were almost lifted out of ''Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' the hit movie of a couple of years ago that was a recreation of the atmosphere of the old-time serials. The Wrangler ads have all the elements: crocodile pits, chases through heavy foliage, rolling boulders that could crush a hero. But, while the male hero always wears a beat-up fedora, the other casual wear on him and his co-star manages to stay neat and trim. The themeline is ''Living it to the limit with Wrangler.'' The budget for the two commercials, each starring the same couple - Sam Behrens and Rosalind Ingledew - is $1 million. Dancer's average commercial production costs $70,000. Wrangler is competing in a heavily advertised category, so it was willing to make a hefty investment in production to insure that the $25 million or more spent for advertising time would make an impression. The spots will be seen on all three TV networks, on the syndicated music show ''Solid Gold'' and extensively on MTV, the cable channel that features music videos. Radio spots will have the same theme, and a less- commercial, 60-second version will be distributed by Screen Vision for showing in 2,500 movie-houses. The first wave of commercials will be a pre-Christmas burst that lasts five weeks. A print effort, which will be more item-oriented and less violent, will appear in seven women's magazines and People.

1097-> Topics ; Less Drink, More Discretion
Higher Stakes Raising the drinking age in New York State from 19 to 21 may be the most effective step in reducing drunk- driving deaths, but two other initiatives are worth noting. Under one law that went into effect last week, anyone below the age of 19 convicted of driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs will automatically lose his license for a year or until he reaches 19, whichever comes last. Drunk or drugged drivers between the ages of 19 and 21 who are convicted a second time will lose their licenses for a year or until they are 21. Drivers of any age who habitually drink before taking the wheel also face an even greater deterrent: loss of their cars. A new law aimed at drug dealers permits forfeiture of their crime-related assets on conviction, but local prosecutors hope to use it to relieve drunk drivers of their vehicles as well. Such a penalty would be particularly appropriate in cases of multiple drunk-driving convictions where license revocation has proven ineffective and where the loss of a car is not a hardship for members of the offender's family. The two laws won't end drunk driving, but for those who gamble on driving while intoxicated in New York, they will, to everyone's benefit, raise the ante.

1098-> '72 DATA SHOW F.B.I. QUESTIONED IF BURGLARS BUGGED THE WATERGATE
The Federal Bureau of Investigation questioned in 1972 whether the offices of the Democratic National Commmittee were actually bugged by the Watergate burglars, according to Justice Department documents and a new book on the case. The documents and the book, ''Secret Agenda'' by Jim Hougan, challenge one of the basic elements of the case that led to the resignation of President Nixon in 1974. The book is scheduled to be published next week by Random House. One of the documents, an F.B.I. memorandum dated Oct. 2, 1972, shows that the bureau's laboratory doubted that telephone taps found at the Watergate complex in Washington were compatible with eavesdropping receivers used by the the defendants. It also shows that bureau technicians and investigators believed a bug found on the telephone of a top Democratic party official three months after the break-in was probably not installed or used by the burglars and might have been put in place by the Democrats to strengthen the case against the Watergate defendants. Silbert Firm on Stand The Watergate prosecutor, Earl J. Silbert, who strenuously challenged the F.B.I.'s conclusions in private in 1972, said today that he remained confident the Watergate burglars bugged the Democratic headquarters. Mr. Silbert said that no one, including the two defendants who went to trial for the break-in and were convicted in 1973, James W. McCord Jr. and G. Gordon Liddy, ever questioned testimony that taps had been installed at the Democratic headquarters and that conversations had been monitored. The five other defendants pleaded guilty. ''Alfred Baldwin's testimony that he listened to telephone conversations from the D.N.C. headquarters was never contested by anyone, including the defense at trial,'' Mr. Silbert said. Alfred C. Baldwin 3d, an alleged participant in the bugging scheme who was granted immunity from prosecution in return for his cooperation with the Government, testified at the break- in trial that through the use of a tap on the telephone of Spencer Oliver, a top Democratic official, he had monitored 200 telephone calls at the Watergate from a surveillance post at the Howard Johnson motel across the street. The F.B.I. memorandum said, ''No facts known to us at present support the presence of a listening device on Oliver's telephone at time of the security check'' immediately after the break-in. In a memorandum to his superiors at the Justice Department in 1972, Mr. Silbert said that the bureau's doubts about the bugging were developed to shield the fact that its investigators failed to find the tap on the Oliver telephone until three months after the June 17 break-in. The bug on the Oliver telephone was discovered on Sept. 13, 1972. Memorandum on Bugging In a Sept. 28, 1972, memorandum to Henry E. Petersen, an Assistant Attorney General, Mr. Silbert said: 'I cannot imagine anyone planting a device in the Democratic headquarters after Watergate. It is too ludicruous.'' He added, ''I believe that the bureau 'goofed' on this one.'' Mr. Silbert, however, expressed some concern about how to handle the bureau's findings. ''Obviously,'' he wrote Mr. Petersen, ''we do not want to be put in the position of challenging such testimony of the F.B.I., particularly its lab, while at the same time relying so heavily on the F.B.I. in general and the lab in particular for other important aspects of our proof.'' The bureau memorandum and Mr. Silbert's note to Mr. Petersen were obtained from the Justice Department by Mr. Hougan through a request under the Freedom of Information Act. Mr. Silbert declined to comment on whether the Government had provided copies of the bureau memorandum to defense attorneys. The Supreme Court, in a 1963 case, ruled that as a matter of due process, prosecutors must turn over to defense attorneys potentially exculpatory evidence. Defense attorneys and journalists who followed the Watergate case closely said that the F.B.I. memorandum and the bureau's questions about the bugging were not mentioned at the trial. Mr. Hougan contends in the book that the calls on the Oliver telephone that were overheard by Mr. Baldwin were intercepted by a bug planted on a telephone in another nearby building, the Columbia Plaza Apartments, used by an elite prostitution ring. He reports that a secretary at the Democratic headquarters used the Oliver telephone to introduce visiting Democrats to one of the prostitutes. The prostitution ring, according to Mr. Hougan, involved a number of high-level political and Government leaders and was connected to a covert operation run by the Central Intelligence Agency. ''Watergate,'' Mr. Hougan concludes in his book, ''was not so much a partisan political scandal as it was, secretly, a sex scandal, the unpredictable outcome of a C.I.A. operation that, in the simplest of terms, tripped on its own shoelaces.''

1099-> Radio Cabs Needn't Be Yellow It's 5 P.M. on a weekday in midtown Manhattan, and though dozens of cabs with empty back seats are in sight, none are for hire. Every one is lit with a blinking sign, ''On radio call.''
A familiar tale? Some 2,000 taxis - about 1 in 6 - belong to radio groups, which permit them to charge a premium over the price on the meter. But that service could be provided equally well by other cars, freeing the yellow ''medallion'' taxis for street hails. For the last two years New York has encouraged medallion taxis to remove their radios. It's time for the Taxi and Limousine Commission to order them removed. Ideally, the pattern of taxi service would be determined by market forces. But New York City froze the number of taxi licenses almost a half-century ago, leaving a chronic shortage of cars that may pick up fares without advance reservation. City Hall plainly has lacked the political will to reform this system of artificial scarcity, which benefits only taxi license owners. But it has coaxed some medallion owners to give up radio service by allowing them to integrate non-medallion cabs into their radio networks. Now those who call for a premium-priced taxi may be greeted by a clean, non- medallion car, with air conditioning and shock absorbers in working order. But the transfer of radios from licensed taxis to other cars has slowed to a trickle in recent months. Owners of the surviving 2,000 radio taxis apparently find it more lucrative to work both sides of the street, responding to radio calls at rush hour and cruising for fares at less busy times. The Taxi and Limousine Commission has the authority to order these taxis to remove their radios, thus increasing the number available for street hail service. That wouldn't inconvenience the radio taxi users, who've found there is no special value to the color yellow. If the regulators want to serve consumers, they can do it in a stroke, today.

1101-> WASHINGTON AND TEXAS LOSE
The cry was trumpeted through the streets, emblazoned in headlines and worn proudly on hundreds of T-shirts and buttons during the days leading up this confrontation: ''The Trojans Are Back!!'' And indeed they are - back in the Rose Bowl, which was almost a second home during the 70's, when they played there six times - after a convincing 16-7 triumph over the top- ranked and previously unbeaten Washington Huskies today in front of 71,838 at the Coliseum. The tailback Fred Crutcher clinched the victory when he capped a 12-play, 68-yard drive with a 2-yard touchdown run on the second play of the final period. The Trojans' other points were supplied by the senior place-kicker Steve Jordan, who hit field goals of 51, 47 and 46 yards, most of them just clearing the crossbar. Jordan missed only one attempt, a 53-yarder at the end of the opening half that would have tied the school record he set earlier this season. Best Start for Huskies The Trojans, ranked 12th and 14th in the news service polls, improved to 8-1 over all and 7-0 in the Pacific-10 Conference, clinching the conference title and a Rose Bowl berth. For the Huskies, who were off to their best start (9-0 and 5-0 in the Pacific-10), the defeat crushed their hopes. ''I don't feel badly about the game,'' said Coach Don James, who guided Washington to the Rose Bowl in 1981 and 1982. ''It's hard to explain a loss like this. We climbed to the top and risked our ranking each week. But after U.S.C. got ahead, we just couldn't answer back.'' The winning touchdown came on Crutcher's 24th carry - he finished with 116 yards on 35 - and was Southern Cal's first touchdown in what was, as expected, a defensive struggle. Washington came into the game allowing an average of only 9 points an outing, second in the nation. The Huskies took a 7-6 halftime lead after their senior tailback Jacque Robinson scored on a 4-yard run near the end of the second period. But the Huskies failed to score again as an inspired Trojan defense did not allow them closer than the U.S.C. 32-yard line, from where the Huskie kicker Jeff Jaeger missed his only field-goal attempt, a 49-yarder that would have stretched their lead to 10-6. Instead, the Trojans took over and, behind some daring pass plays by the quarterback Tim Green and seven carries by Crutcher, scored the go- ahead touchdown. Green connected on passes of 23, 11, and 12 yards on the drive and finished with 161 yards, completing 13 of 28 attempts. It has been four years since the Trojans have played in the Rose Bowl, a hiatus created by probation, turmoil in the program and poor play. Their 4-6-1 record last season was the school's first losing season in 22 years. ''You have to be able to fight,'' said Ted Tollner, the Trojan coach during an emotional locker-room ceremony. ''This team knew how to fight and to ignore whoever didn't want to be with us.''

1102-> THRONG IN CENTRAL PARK MOURNS LOST LEADER
More than 2,000 Indians and Indian- Americans living in the New York area gathered in Central Park yesterday, amid heavy police protection, in a memorial service for Indira Gandhi that brought calls for unity and an end to the bloodshed that has engulfed India since the Prime Minister's assassination last week. ''It is the tradition of India not to meet hatred with hatred, but to remove it with love,'' Arun Patwarthan, India's Consul General in New York, told the quiet crowd, which included many tearful mourners. ''We should learn to forgive the assassin, we should learn that the Sikhs belong to us and that we belong to the Sikhs,'' said Mr. Patwarthan. Mrs. Gandhi was reportedly killed by two Sikh bodyguards, and speaker after speaker yesterday urged the primarily Hindu crowd not to condemn the entire religious group. But if unity was the theme of the day, India's divisions were evident just beneath the surface. Some of the people who poured into the mall in front of the Naumberg Bandshell argued over whether Mrs. Gandhi had been justified in ordering the army assault earlier this year on the Golden Temple, the Sikh shrine in Amritsar. Sikh Is Forbidden to Speak And toward the end of the ceremony, a dispute arose alongside the speakers' platform when a Sikh professor at New York University, who said he had earlier been invited to address the crowd, was forbidden by organizers to take the microphone. Organizers cited security concerns, but one stressed later that the professor, Daljit Singh Ahluwalia, ''has spoken very harshly about Mrs. Gandhi in the past.'' ''It is dispicable,'' Mr. Ahluwalia, president of the Overseas Indian Congress of North America, said as police officers hustled him into a car to ease a confrontation with some in the crowd. ''This would have been a great opporunity to show the unity of India. A few extremists spread out in the U.S. and other places have painted an ugly picture of a patriotic and peace-loving Sikh community.'' Almost no Sikhs attended the memorial service, although Sikhs reportedly make up about 10 percent of the 100,000 Indians living in the tristate area. ''I think they are scared that there will be further violence,'' said Dr. Sushil K. Suppel, a physician who was attending the rally. ''Most Sikhs feel today they may be victimized for the acts of a few.'' Violence Said to Be Abating Speakers at the service, organized by a group called People for United India and other organizations, said they saw evidence that the violence that has taken more than 1,000 lives in India since Wednesday was abating. ''I am convinced this is only an ephemeral phase,'' said Natarajan Krishnan, India's representative at the United Nations. ''The situation is being brought under control.'' Mayor Koch, speaking alongside a giant portrait of Mrs. Gandhi and a floral map of India propped up on the stage, compared the slain Prime Minister to Anwar el-Sadat, the slain Egyptian President. ''She, too, is an international martyr for peace,'' he said. Noting reports that Mrs. Gandhi had had a premonition of her death, he added: ''She said the soil of India would be enriched by her blood. We know that it is.'' The Mayor criticized Sikhs who, in other demonstrations in New York and elsewhere, ''have been dancing in celebration of her death.'' ''That is reprehensible,'' he declared. Sikhs Parade in California YUBA CITY, Calif., Nov. 4 (AP) - Thousands of Sikhs carrying placards, waving banners and chanting ''God is peace!'' marched peacefully through this small agricultural community today in an annual religious parade. The Sikhs, wearing turbans and gowns and some carrying ceremonial swords, followed a route that was altered shortly in advance by police officials fearful of disturbances in the aftermath of the assassination of Prime Minister Gandhi. The fifth annual parade in this community 90 miles northeast of San Francisco was planned long before Mrs. Gandhi's assasssination. A Sikh security guard at the parade, Bhinder Singh of Sunnyvale, said there had been ''some threats'' against the marchers. ''I have received a couple,'' he said, ''but we have no problems today.'' Security was tight, with motorcycle officers flanking the parade route and a sheriff's car with flashing lights leading the marchers. Crowd estimates varied from 8,000 to 12,000.

1104-> AMERICAN KENNEL CLUB'S CENTENNIAL IS A CELEBRATION OF DOGS
The founding fathers met in Philadelphia on Sept. 17, 1884. It was in a room not much bigger than a spacious closet, at 13th and Market streets, that these representatives agreed upon uniform rules and regulations for governing, and where they selected their first president. A number of loosely affiliated organizations became a union of one. All of this reads like a page from American history. But the men meeting in Philadelphia that night were not revolutionaries. They were delegates from various dog clubs in the United States and Canada. At that meeting, they agreed that one set of rules should apply to shows from Westminster in New York to those in Cleveland and New Brunswick. They elected Maj. James A. Taylor as the first president of the newly formed American Kennel Club, ''a club of clubs,'' the president proclaimed. From these modest beginnings, the A.K.C. has grown into a major association of approximately 10,000 dog clubs. It is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year. Its office is no longer a one-room efficiency but takes up three floors in the New York Life Insurance building at 51 Madison Avenue. The first dog registered by the A.K.C. was an English setter named Adonis. In 1981, the club reached the 25 million mark when its computer registered a Scottish terrier with the very regal name of Belair's Duke of Rock Hills. It is hoped he also answers to ''Here, boy.'' To commemorate its 100th year, the A.K.C. is sponsoring the Centennial dog show at the Philadelphia Civic Center Saturday and Sunday. More than 8,000 dogs representing 128 recognized pure breeds will participate in what is being billed as the biggest dog show in the Western Hemisphere. Preparations for this event, a club spokesman said, began almost three years ago. Fifteen hotels have agreed to accommodate owners and their dogs, and a Philadelphia school bus company will provide transportation to and from the Civic Center. ''We asked the company whether they had reservations about the dogs riding the buses,'' said Jim Crowley of the A.K.C., ''and they told us there is nothing the dogs could do that the school kids haven't done all year.'' Hotels, however, usually require a $50 deposit against any damage caused in the rooms, whether by man or beast, Crowley said. Actually, the dogs are said to be well behaved, even in one another's company. They have become accustomed to the milling at a typical show, and besides, they are trained to be obedient. If anyone steps out of line, more often than not it's an owner who thinks his dog has been denied a ribbon in what is perhaps the most subjectively judged sport. ''One of our sayings is 'You can say anything you want about my children but don't criticize my dog,' '' said William Stifel, who has been president of the A.K.C. since 1978. ''There are those who go to these events to show off the results of a breeding program,'' he said, ''and a second kind of person who is there for the competition and thrill of winning.'' Crowley said it was not unlike the Little League father syndrome. The Centennial show will include an obedience trial and the coveted beauty contest, in which the ''best in show'' will be chosen. There are seven groups of dogs numbering 128 breeds, and every dog is judged by the standard of physical perfection set for that breed. Medals and trays and ribbons are awarded, instead of huge purses such as in horse racing. Showing dogs is not usually a money- making proposition. This is also known as a benched show, which means that dogs that are not competing, being groomed, fed or exercized, will be on exhibit in their stalls so that spectators can window shop as if they were at Bloomingdale's. The Centennial is not just an anniversary, Stifel said, but a celebration of dogs, man's best friend. Stifel first began working for the A.K.C. in 1957 as a part-time typist and has moved up to the position that symbolizes ''dog's best friend.'' Stifel, however, said that he did not show dogs himself and had owned only a housedog, a Scottie who died of old age a few years ago. He also owns a cat, but this apparent sacrilege is pardonable because of his enthusiasm and effusive praise for Canis Familiaris. ''Dogs have seen man at his best and worst; his kindest and cruelest,'' Stifel said, ''and still they are loyal. A dog is happy for what he gets and never asks anything of you. Now imagine if mankind met a higher life form. We'd be asking for this and that and the other thing.'' The walls and interiors of the Kennel Club offices are like a dog lover's Louvre. Paintings and sculptures of dogs are everywhere, even on desks and tables, where photographs of wives and children are usually found. For example, Charles O'Neill, the executive vice president of the club, has a painting of a Doberman Pinscher on a table in his office. She is the offspring of one of the Doberman bitches he breeds and shows. O'Neill warms to the talk of Dobermans, a feeling not usually shared by the man and woman on the street. ''They're a wonderful dog, very smart, but they have gotten a rotten reputation,'' he said. ''On TV, they're portrayed as villains because they learn quickly and are trained to be villains. ''But they're just possessive and very protective,'' O'Neill said. ''You have to learn that they don't live with you, you live with them. And that it's their house, and they let you ride in their car.'' Well, it is said that love is blind. Actually, dogs generally have enjoyed a magnificent reputation through the ages. The postal service issued a block of four dog stamps on Sept. 7 to commemorate the Centennial. In fiction, motion pictures and on the television screen, dogs have been depicted as extremely loyal, dedicated, hard working, heroic animals. There is evidence from caves in Iraq that man and dog first met 14,000 years ago. Their presence in North America dates 10,500 years, as evidenced by findings in Idaho. Of course, this was long before Rin Tin Tin and Lassie became matinee idols and Snoopy began commenting on the human condition in Charles Schulz's ''Peanuts'' comic strip. This was before ''How 'Bout Them Dawgs,'' Goofy and Pluto, ''Lady and the Tramp,'' Old Yeller and Nipper. Nipper is one of the more familiar dogs. In the 1890's, the Englishman Francis Barraud painted his brother's terrier peering quizzically into the horn of an old phonograph and called the work ''His Master's Voice.'' Nipper and that old phonograph eventually became the trademark for the RCA Corporation. Even antisocial dogs appear to have been given the benefit of the doubt in literature. James Thurber wrote fondly about an Airedale named Muggs that his family owned. It seemed the dog spent his 11 years growling about life and regularly biting family, relatives and friends. Thurber wrote that his mother visited a ''mental healer'' in an attempt to impart harmonious vibrations to the dog. The healer told Thurber's mother to think and hold good thoughts about Muggs and how he would not bite anyone. ''Mother was holding the thought the very next morning when Muggs got the iceman,'' Thurber wrote. ''She blamed the iceman for not holding the thought.'' What most dogs - pure breeds or the mixed breeds called mutts - share is a comfortable station as a pet and perhaps added duty as a watchdog. But if dogs could talk, what would be said about show dogs? Would show dogs be considered the social elite of the species, the upper crust? Would they consider themselves too good to hobnob with good old Rover and share the same bone? Certainly, one cannot envision a show dog tracking in mud from the backyard, nipping at the letter carrier's heels, chasing the neighbor's cat or mutiliating a pair of bedroom slippers. Show dogs probably eat quiche. ''There is a small fraction of owners who might treat them like spoiled children,'' Stifel said, ''but I wouldn't call most of them spoiled. They must be kept in good physical condition and immaculate, but they are happy animals and aren't supressed in any way.'' Many show dogs, he added, can sense when their owners are preparing to show them. The traveling crate and other equipment are a giveaway. ''They know they're going to a show and they love it,'' Stifel said. The A.K.C. is in business to register dogs, approve clubs and shows and new breeds, and see that the rules and standards are followed, Stifel said. But it is also concerned about the health, care and treatment accorded every dog, Rover among them. ''We want to promote responsible ownership,'' he said. ''We want to educate people about getting the proper dog for them. We urge people who have the idea they want a dog, and then just let that dog out on the street, not to get a dog.'' They deserve better than to be treated like dogs.

1106-> PLAINEDGE DEFEATS GARDEN CITY, 21-0
Jeff Doyle completed a touchdown pass and scored another to lead Plainedge to a 21-0 shutout of Garden City yesterday, their first Conference II championship in four years. The game, played before 4,000 spectators at C. W. Post College in Greenvale, was Garden City's first loss this season. The victory was a revenge match for Plainedge (9-1), whose only loss earlier this season was to Garden City, when a last-minute scoring attempt was spoiled by an interception. In yesterday's meeting, however, the Plainedge offensive and defensive teams did not give the Trojans a chance to set up. Plainedge not only scored early, but the Red Devils' defense held the Trojans to three first downs and 23 yards total offense. Two Early Touchdowns Plainedge posted two touchdowns in the first 4 minutes of the game. On the opening kickoff, John Andriola, a junior halfback, ran the ball 87 yards to the Garden City 3-yard line. Then Darren Costa, a senior halfback, ran 3 yards to score on the first play from scrimmage. After Plainedge kicked off, Garden City controlled the ball for 2 minutes before being forced to punt. Plainedge's Jeff Doyle, a junior quarterback, completed a 75-yard pass to Brian Costello, a senior tight end, that put the Red Devils on Garden City's 7. Doyle ran 7 yards to score on the next play. He also passed to Costello for the conversion. The Red Devils scored their third touchdown 4 minutes into the second quarter, when Costello caught a 2-yard pass from Doyle. Mike McKenna, a senior, kicked the extra point to make the score 21-0 at the half. Interception Ends Threat Garden City's greatest threat came in the fourth period, following a bad snap on a Plainedge punt. Garden City took over on the Red Devils' 17- yard line, but several plays later, Costa, playing defensive halfback , intercepted a Garden City pass on the Plainedge 5-yard line to preserve the shutout. Steve Erb, a linebacker, and Joe Heller and Mat Hirsch, defensive ends, paced the Plainedge defensive unit, holding Robert Griffith, the Trojan quarterback, to four completions in 15 attempts for a total of 36 yards. Griffith played despite an injured heel, Although Garden City's Ken Egan was held to 39 yards on 9 carries, his season total of 1,025 set a school record for running backs.

1107-> RARE PLANT FOUND FLOURISHING IN PINES
ATSION ATEAM of botanists and ecologists has found entire fields of an endangered flower, the Pine Barrens gentian, near this Burlington County community. The delicate species is endemic only to New Jersey's pinelands, and until now had been found only sporadically, and then in thin patches of a few flowers each. At the other end of the spectrum, the team has been unable to discover any specimens of Nuttall's mudflower, a species that used to be found at sites along the Hudson, Delaware and James Rivers. It was last seen in New Jersey five years ago, and is now believed to be extinct. Since September, the team, as part of the New Jersey Natural Heritage Program, has been taking the state's first inventory of plants, animals and valuable ecological communities. In its searches, it has come upon copious patches of grasses and sedges that, like the gentian, were thought to have been rare and quickly vanishing. The program is 1 of 33 statewide inventories being sponsored by the Nature Conservancy, a national conservation organization. In New Jersey, it is cooperating with the Office of Natural Lands Management and the Endangered and Non-Game Species Program, both under the state's Department of Environmental Protection. It is hoped that the inventory, being financed with more than $300,000 in grants from the Nature Conservancy and private foundations, will be complete in the next two years and will inspire new preservation efforts. The discoveries of the gentian and the sedges and grasses are among the most notable of 100 occurrences of plant and animal species that have been documented so far by the team, said Thomas F. Hampton, administrator of the Natural Lands Management Office. The reasons for the local profusion of the gentian were perhaps more a cause for celebration among the team members than the discovery itself. Sara Davison, a botanist for the Nature Conservancy and chief botanical investigator for the program, said that the area, off Route 206 here, had been destroyed by intense forest fires two summers ago. As Miss Davison explained it, gentian seeds that had been buried in the forest floor were exposed by the fire, whose heat split them apart, letting them germinate. The normal forest canopy above was burned away, letting sunlight reach the plants and promoting their growth. Finally, she explained, other, hardier plants and shrubs that regularly would have usurped available soil nutrients also were destroyed. ''The fire killed off the competition,'' Miss Davison said in an interview last week. ''The plants still may be rare, but it is reassuring to know that the seeds are stored in seed banks and can become available again if conditions are favorable.'' The discovery of the gentian is even more significant in light of recent findings by the Department of Environmental Protection that some 18 percent of the state's 2,600 or so species of sedges, grasses, wildflowers, shrubs and trees are threatened or endangered, a figure said to be 80 percent higher than the national average. Earlier research by scientists at Rutgers University and other institutions found that the ecology of the Pine Barrens was fire-dependent. For example, the seeds of certain pines are liberated from cones only through the heat of a fire. The scientists say that civilization has, in effect, threatened the balance of the pinelands because, when naturally occurring fires are doused, oaks and other nonfire-dependent species can take over from pitch pine and other native Pine Barrens species. Miss Davison said that the team - another botanist, a zoologist, an ecologist and two administrators - also had documented at least three ''outstanding natural areas'' in the state. These, it is hoped, will be bought or otherwise preserved as valuable examples of significant biological communities, she said. The first is Hirst Pond, in the Atlantic County community of Galloway Township. At least 3 other such ponds, each 3 to 15 acres in surface area, have been identified in Atlantic, Cape May and Cumberland Counties. Miss Davison said that the ponds filled with rainwater and ground water only in the spring, giving rise to diversified ''self-contained'' communities of plants and animals and providing ideal habitat for the endangered Pine Barrens tree frog, carpenter frogs, migratory waterfowl and other birds. The ponds dry up by August, she said, and the elaborate and sometimes spectacular vegetation they had nurtured disappears shortly thereafter. Miss Davison said that the vernal ponds had yielded awn-petaled meadow beauties, rare purplish-blue flowers that grow only in New Jersey and the Carolinas; Boykin's lobelia, an unusual pale-blue flower also found only here and in the Carolinas, and Hirst panic grass, a rare species found hardly anywhere outside New Jersey. Other valuable biological communities rapidly disappearing in New Jersey are the freshwater tidal marshes in upper reaches of some rivers, Miss Davison said. She said that these ecologically sensitive areas had been destroyed along rivers like the Passaic, Raritan and Delaware, but that some had been found thriving along the Manumuskin River in Cumberland County at a point just southeast of Millville. There, Miss Davison said, she found the sensitive joint vetch, a rare plant found only in New Jersey and a few other places in the world. The freshwater tidal marshes are habitat for marsh wrens, sedge wrens and numerous animals and fish, she said, and it is important that these dwindling special features of nature be preserved. In northern New Jersey, one of the most prized biological communities explored by Miss Davison and others were the limestone fens in Sussex and Warren Counties. These are open marshes in meadows with at least one characteristic that sets them apart from others: they are underlain by limestone, making them more alkaline than acidic. There are only 5 of these 15-to-20- acre communities left in New Jersey, Miss Davison said, and their soils are suited for such endangered flowers as the spreading globe, a member of the buttercup family that is found only in four other states. Fens have been known to provide ideal habitat for endangered bog turtles and other wildlife species, including red and gray foxes, Miss Davison said. The bases of investigations by the Natural Heritage Program, Miss Davison said, are historical records, leads obtained from other scientists and soil maps. Although the program is in its infancy, Miss Davison said that a review of historical data and new information gathered recently showed that the team probably would be hard put to produce an inventory before at least some of the areas they had planned to explore fell to development. ''It's a terrible race,'' she said, ''and we're fortunate, at least, to have the people in the state who are so knowledgeable in their fields as part of the program.'' Over the years, the Nature Conservancy, whose office for New Jersey is in Philadelphia, has saved valuable natural areas from development by arranging direct purchases of land or by managing preserves for other organizations after negotiating purchases or management agreements for other parties. One of the areas managed by the Nature Conservancy is the South Cape May Meadows, a 180-acre tract of beach, grassy dunes and fields that until recently had been scheduled to be converted into camping grounds. ''Ultimately,'' Miss Davison said, ''I think that, based on what we've seen in the state so far, we're going to have to double the rate of our acquisitions program and substantially increase our fund-raising efforts to do it.'' TRENTON THE state's Office of Natural Lands Management, part of the Department of Environmental Protection, has published the first directory of New Jersey's 41 most valuable and unusual natural areas, 21,619 acres of state- owned preserves said to have been protected ''for posterity.'' Most of the natural areas are within state parks or wildlife management areas and some had never been identified publicly except for their appearance in the brochures of individual state parks. The areas were officially identified, then purchased or otherwise preserved by the state, between 1961 and 1978. ''These tracts of land,'' says the New Jersey Natural Areas Directory, ''are maintained to insure that people of the state can enjoy natural features of special interest and scenic beauty, to preserve the state's natural heritage and to provide areas for scientific study.'' Although new areas have not been added to the list of 41 in more than 6 years, a team of botanists and ecologists within the Office of Natural Lands Management has been working since September to identify and classify new ones. In some instances, the natural areas were chosen because of their rare or unusual plants or physical features. In other cases, they made the list because they were thought to have exemplified the habitat or biological communities of one of New Jersey's five physiographic provinces. The provinces are, from north to south, the Appalachian Ridge and Valley, the Highlands, the Piedmont, and the Inner and Outer Coastal Plains. Free copies of the directory can be obtained by writing to the Office of Natural Lands Management, CN-404, Trenton, 08625.

1108-> CAREERS; STEVENS FOCUSES ON COMPUTERS
THE Stevens Institute of Technology might be one of New Jersey's best-kept educational secrets. Overshadowed by its better known counterparts, the venerable Hoboken, N.J., engineering school is nonetheless one of the most highly respected in the country. It is particularly advanced in its use of computers. For example, Stevens says it was the first educational institution to require every freshman to buy a personal computer. The one currently in use is the Professional 350, which the students can buy for $1,950, a substantial discount, from the Digital Equipment Corporation. According to Dr. Kenneth C. Rogers, the president of Stevens, the impact of computers in education will be felt much more widely than has been expected. ''The cost of faculty is going up the fastest among our costs,'' he said during an interview last week, ''but computer technology can help here. Computers give the professor the mechanics for communicating with students that saves time.'' He explained that term papers typed on a personal computer can now be easily handed to a professor in the form of a floppy disk. Once comments are made on the disk, the ''paper'' is returned. Eventually, the same thing will be done, Dr. Rogers said, by pushing a button on computers tied to a central system, transferring written matter from one terminal to another. Using this network, a student will be able to ask a professor for help, which can be given whenever the professor reads the messages stored, thus saving professors and students time. The professor will also be able to give students more individual attention. Dr. Rogers also believes that computers will help students to become better writers. ''The idea has not been tested, but I have a strong feeling that the mechanics of good writing - paragraphing, punctuation and spelling - can be taught more readily using a computer,'' he said. ''One of the interesting things about computers is that they are totally unforgiving.'' He explained that a minor difference in punctuation in programming, such as a period used for a comma, can change meaning. He feels that the discipline the student learns in mastering a computer can also help to improve sensitivity to the written word. Computers sometimes pose security problems, but Dr. Rogers worries about something more fundamental. ''The analytical approach of writing out equations and creating models may suffer if it is too easy to use digital models on computers,'' he said. This can be insidious, he went on, because some people apparently believe that future generations of technical students could skip taking differential calculus. This develops methods and rules for solving problems involving changing quantities, and many of its formulas can now be computerized. ''It is not so much a question of using calculus to solve problems but the importance of taking calculus is to understand the concepts involved - the theoretical structure,'' he said. Another concern at Stevens is the emphasis on Ph.D.'s in engineering. Unlike many college presidents, Dr. Rogers believes that holders of doctors' degrees in engineering are ''too oriented toward study, and not toward practical applications.'' In the past, engineers in industry did not often become Ph.D.'s unless they did some teaching. He explained that traditionally the practicing engineers who have kept industry running - mechanical, civil and electrical engineers - held no more than a master's degree. He spoke of the ''enormous contributions'' made by these engineers. ''They know things from experience that some Ph.D.'s in engineering never know,'' he said. ''It is tragic,'' he continued, that now if a graduate student ''does not become a Ph.D. he is looked down upon,'' both in a corporate setting where he might be doing research, and even more in a college or university where he might be doing some research or teaching, or both. ''Fortunately, this situation is changing slightly,'' he said. Another worry has arisen for Dr. Rogers - competition within the state. New Jersey has long been famous for putting more of its students in out-of-state institutions than in its own relatively few educational centers. In recent years, emphasis has been put on helping the state university system, made up mainly of Rutgers University and its many units, along with a variety of community colleges. This new focus makes it harder for smaller, private schools like Stevens to compete, Dr. Rogers said. ''They can offer an education for much less cost to students than we can,'' he said. ''It means a very tough battle for us - public versus private institutions.'' He recalled that many large Middle Western universities began years ago as land grant colleges, with land donated by the Federal Government. As populations in middle America and the Far West grew, it became a matter of pride for states to pour tax money into their universities. ''The public schools in the West had to have public money,'' he said. ''But now it has become a battle between the public versus private institutions. In the case of New Jersey, the East now wants to emulate the West. Rutgers wants to become the Berkeley of the East.''

1110-> SPORTS PEOPLE; Clearing the Air
Don King , the boxing promoter, has been a member of the executive committee of Artists and Athletes Against Apartheid, a group that tries to discourage performers and athletes from accepting engagements in South Africa. So when it was disclosed that one of King's fighters, Greg Page , would go to South Africa to fight the World Boxing Association heavyweight champion, Gerrie Coetzee , and that King would get $1 million from the deal, the promoter came under heavy criticism from members of his own group. Now, two weeks before the scheduled bout on Dec. 1, King has responded to the criticism by resigning his executive committee post, while defending his position. In a letter to the group, King said that he had first tried to persuade Page not to accept the bout, and then, when the fighter accepted anyway, had given up his promotional rights to the fight. He said he had accepted the $1 million payment only because Coetzee had insisted on it. The fighter, he said, ''felt a strong moral obligation to me, and only through his insistence did I receive any compensation for the assignment of my rights.'' King said he had tried to explain all this to the anti- apartheid group's president, Arthur Ashe , but that Ashe ''wasn't interested.''

1113-> WOMEN SEE LITTLE PROGRESS IN HIRING BY U.N.
Six years after the General Assembly mandated that one-quarter of all professional posts in the Secretariat should be held by women, senior officials concede that the target has not been met. Emilio de Olivares, executive assistant to Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, said it was ''impossible.'' ''Where do we get the people?'' he said. But a group seeking to change the situation asserts that the problem is more serious. ''There is no commitment to do anything and that is the bottom line,'' said a member of the Ad Hoc Group on Equal Rights for Women. ''Now they feel they can live with the problem; three years ago it troubled them.'' The women in the group declined to be identified because they feared they might be penalized for their activity. ''Women are definitely at the bottom of the professional staff, that is a fact,'' said Louis Pascal-Negre, Assistant Secretary General for Personnel. Another member of the women's group said that United Nations officials, with budget austerity measures pending, were ''hoping no one will pay attention to women.'' In 1984 the proportion of women in professional posts stood at 22.6 percent, up 0.4 points since 1982. A spokesman for the women's group said that what little progress had been made was ''due primarily to recruitment at the junior levels.'' While women comprise over 50 percent of the entire staff, they held 7 percent of the senior positions - 30 out of 412 - as of last June. Officials responsible for personnel and recruitment acknowledge the problem. But they assert that they are not responsible. ''The problem of women here is a reflection of women in society,'' Mr. Negre said. ''Ask member states if they would be willing to elect a woman as Secretary General.'' Both Mr. Negre and Mr. de Olivares say that member countries simply do not supply the Secretariat with capable women and that efforts to provide equitable geographic distribution of jobs clashes with the promotion of women. ''I would love to have women of the right nationalities at the highest posts, but I cannot find them,'' Mr. de Olivares said. The women's group hopes that if Secretary General Perez de Cuellar abides by a promise to appoint a co-ordinator for women's issues, that would signal recognition of the problem. Members of the group argue that conditions for women are worse at the United Nations than in comparable national organizations because the United Nations is not subject to affirmative action and other laws affecting employment discrimination. Nor can the United Nations be sued by individuals with grievances. While 29 men were hired last year at the senior diplomatic level, not a single woman was placed. The number of women at the most senior professional levels has declined, according to official figures. Of the 38 senior employees hired last year, 3 were women. United Nations officials involved in personnel matters cite a variety of conditions that explain the lack of professional women. ''Try to find an excellent woman economist who wants to come to work for us,'' Mr. de Olivares said. ''They're getting high pay and their governments grab them.'' Both Mr. de Olivares and Mr. Negre argued that senior women had families and were less willing to move or to take hardship posts than men. ''At 35 to 40, a woman is already settled, married and has a family to raise,'' said Mr. Negre. ''So long as they're passive and wait for member states to come to them, nothing will change,'' a middle-level professional woman countered. When the United Nations needed to recruit in the third world, it was imaginative and aggressive, she said, adding that it began recruitment campaigns and spent money. ''This passive attitude that they can't find suitable candidates applies to women only,'' said one woman professional familiar with recruitment procedures.

1117-> AROUND THE WORLD; Yacht's Survivors Tell Of a Gale Off Canada
QUEEN CHARLOTTE CITY, British Columbia, June 28 (AP) - The passengers and crew of a luxury yacht that sank off the Canadian coast Wednesday formed a human chain and tried to bail out the craft in a ''screaming'' gale as 20-foot waves smashed over the deck. ''We saw she was taking on water faster than we could bail,'' said a crew member, Peter Landau of Vancouver. The 20 people aboard, Canadians and Americans, abandoned the Royal Princess before it sank. ''It was the worst conditions I've been through,'' said the yacht's captain, Frank Stoney, 47 years old, of Nanaimo, British Columbia. ''It was a very frightening thing.'' All 20 survived, and were plucked from the rafts in wire-mesh baskets lowered from helicopters. Five people were taken to a hospital overnight and were in good condition today.

1118-> DON KING, AIDE INDICTED ON TAX EVASION CHARGES
Don King, boxing's leading promoter, and an aide were indicted by a Federal grand jury in Manhattan yesterday on a total of 23 counts of income-tax evasion, filing false and fraudulent tax returns and conspiracy. Rudolph W. Giuliani, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said Mr. King and his longtime secretary, Constance Harper, the vice president of Don King Productions, had conspired to divert more than $1 million in corporate receipts to their personal use. Most of the money was paid in cash to Mr. King directly, the indictment charged. Neither of the accused could be reached for comment yesterday, but the office of Mr. King's attorney, Vincent Fuller of the Washington firm of Williams and Connolly, issued a statement on behalf of Don King Productions. The statement said in part that Mr. King and Miss Harper ''believe that they are innocent of all charges and that they will be fully exonerated when they are provided with the opportunity to defend themselves.'' ''The company and its officers,'' the statement said, ''consistently filed what they believed to be complete and accurate tax returns.'' Target of 4-Year Probe Mr. King has been the main target, according to Federal investigators, of a four-year inquiry into boxing corruption, but Mr. Giuliani said that the indictment did not indicate an industry scandal. ''It's a tax fraud,'' he said. Roanne L. Mann, the assistant United States attorney who has been directing the boxing investigation, would not comment on whether the inquiry would lead to further indictments. But she said that the current charges all involved boxing promotions, although Mr. King has also been a promoter of the Michael Jackson rock-music tour. The 53-year-old promoter and Miss Harper, 51, will be arraigned next Friday at the United States Courthouse in Foley Square. If convicted of all charges, Mr. King would face a maximum of 46 years' imprisonment and fines totaling $65,000. Miss Harper would face a maximum of 62 years and $115,000 in fines. Mr. Giuliani explained that the difference resulted from Mr. King's being charged with ''aiding and abetting'' a false return by Miss Harper for 1980, while she was charged with doing the same for him for all three years with which the indictment deals, 1978-80. The Government charges that Mr. King and Miss Harper participated together in a scheme to skim more than $1 million of the corporation's receipts, with the intent that this money would not be reported on the tax returns of either the two accused or the corporation. The indictment said that Miss Harper, as the supervisor of the day- to-day operations of Don King Productions, had helped conceal the diversion of the money from the corporation's accountants and bookkeepers. In all, the indictment said, Mr. King failed to report $422,000 in personal income for the three years and failed to pay $210,000 in taxes. The figures for Miss Harper were $195,000 and $94,000. And the corporation, of which King is the sole shareholder, failed to report $407,000 in gross receipts, the Government charged. Involved in Many Big Fights Mr. King, a former numbers-racket chief in Cleveland who once served four years in prison for manslaughter, has been a leading promoter for more than 10 years and has been involved with some of boxing's greatest fights: Muhammad Ali-George Foreman, Ali-Joe Frazier in Manila, Larry Holmes-Ali, Holmes-Gerry Cooney and both of the Sugar Ray Leonard-Roberto Duran bouts. Most of the skimming, the Government said, was done at Caesars Palace, the hotel-casino in Las Vegas, Nev., where Mr. King has promoted fights since late 1977. According to the charges, Mr. King frequently went to the casino ''cage,'' or cashier, and was given receipts to draw large amounts of money that was owed to Don King Productions because of the hotel's purchase of various fights. Most of these fights involved Holmes's defenses of the World Boxing Council's heavyweight title. According to Mr. Giuliani, Mr. King once took out an advance of $70,000, and on other occasions amounts up to $50,000. In 1980, the indictment charged, the defendants ''expanded their scheme'' to include sources of income other than Caesars Palace. It said they had diverted money from ABC, J&J Sports of San Jose, Calif., and the Met Center in Bloomington, Minn. ABC has bought television rights for many fights from Mr. King. J&J Sports is a leading packager of closed-circuit television events and worked on Mr. King's promotion of the Holmes-Ali fight of Oct. 2, 1980. The Met Center was the site of Mr. King's promotion of Holmes's defense against Scott LeDoux on July 7, 1980.

1120-> DEAD YOUTH'S LOVE OF GAME REMEMBERED
The family and friends of a teen-ager who died Wednesday night of a hockey injury gathered today to remember a young man whose life, they said, revolved around the game. ''He was always playing hockey somewhere,'' said Peter Pleines of his son, Brian, who was 16 years old. ''He loved hockey. It was all he lived for.'' Brian was struck in the head, apparently by a hockey stick, during a game last Sunday afternoon. He lapsed into unconsciousness shortly afterward and was declared legally dead after tests showed no brain activity. On Wednesday night, his teammates, all 15 or 16 years old, met at the Nassau County Community College ice rink where the accident occurred and decided to dedicate the rest of the season to Brian. ''It's kind of tough for boys this young to have to go through such a tragedy,'' said John Cowan, the manager of the team, the Oyster Bay Gulls. Mr. Cowan's 15-year-old son, Sean, who is on the team and was a friend of Brian's, recalled him as a quiet boy and ''a fast skater with a good slap shot.'' Mr. Cowan said the members of the team were stunned when they were told of Brian's death. ''They were very quiet,'' he said. ''They didn't express anger. They didn't express sorrow. They were in shock. But they all agreed Brian would want them to continue to play.'' Number Is Retired His teammates decided to retire Brian's red-and-white Gulls shirt, with the number 2, and also to have a plaque made with his name and picture for permanent display at the rink, where they practice and play games. The accident occurred in the first quarter of a game at the rink between the Gulls and the Essex County (N.J.) Chiefs. Brian, who was wearing a safety helmet, was playing center when he was struck in the head. He became dizzy and ill and was taken by his father to the Nassau County Medical Center in East Meadow. By the time Brian arrived he was unconscious and did not respond to stimuli, according to Edward Smith, a hospital spokesman. He was placed on a respirator, but tests over the last few days indicated there was no brain activity. His parents agreed that his kidneys should be removed for transplants. ''My son is dead, but a part of him might live on and help others,'' Mr. Pleines said today at his home at 24 Moss Lane here. His wife, Irene, and their other sons, 20-year-old Michael and 15-year-old Keith, were at his side. Keith, who was a teammate of Brian's, was playing goalie when Brian was injured. Mr. Pleines said Keith was shaken by the death, but planned to remain on the team. The helmet and other safety equipment that Brian wore are required by the 1,100-member Long Island Hockey Association, according to its president, Charles J. Millner. He described Brian's injury as ''one of those freak accidents that happen from time to time when we least expect them.'' Mr. Pleines said arrangements for Brian, who was a junior at Division Avenue High School, were being handled by the Dalton Funeral Home. A funeral service is to be held at 9:45 A.M. Saturday at the St. Bernard Roman Catholic Church here. At his home today, Mr. Pleines recalled that all his sons had played hockey since they were 6 years old. ''They all love the game,'' he said.

1123-> NEW YORK DAY BY DAY
Summonses and Surcharges After Dr. Glenn Bernstein of Brooklyn mailed in his $35 speeding fine, he got a letter from the Department of Motor Vehicles: If he did not pay a $10 surcharge, he would lose his license. The department apologized for not having told of the surcharge when he got his ticket, explaining that ''there was an insufficient time to reprint the summonses with the surcharge information.'' Dr. Bernstein was among ''hundreds of thousands'' in this situation, according to the department. The difference was that, after paying, he expressed his indignation in two ways: He wrote to newspapers and he moved out of New York. ''All of your blundering only convinces me more that my decision to permanently leave New York State is intelligent,'' he wrote. Here is what happened: The surcharge, imposed as a budget-balancing device in 1983, became law only three days before taking effect. The motor-vehicle people printed 500,000 notices for New York City and other areas where they handle traffic tickets. The tickets now include the surcharge information, but there was a lag in notification. They've just about finished processing the people who, not having been told of the surcharge, didn't pay it.

1125-> ABOUT REAL ESTATE; FIRE-GUTTED QUEENS HOUSING RESTORED WITH TAX AID
On the heels of a historic-district designation in Ridgewood, Queens, last year has come a housing rehabilitation that demonstrates the power of tax incentives to stimulate new investment in older neighborhoods. The rehabilitation is in Siamese- twin, three-story town houses at 1821 and 1823 Madison Street in Ridgewood that were ravaged by fire in 1980. All 12 railroad-flat apartments had to be vacated. The wrecked buildings surely would have been demolished, said Paul A. Kerzner, president of the Greater Ridgewood Restoration Corporation, without the availability of the tax credits. Market rents in Ridgewood were too low to justify the risk of an expensive rehabilitation. The Federal historic district in Ridgewood came into being last year. It is the largest in the nation, with 2,982 properties and almost 15,000 housing units. Most such districts in the city also have a city designation, but Mr. Kerzner said that Ridgewood refrained from seeking one because of property owners' fear of the City Landmarks Commission's restrictive approach to facade alterations. The state landmarks agency administers the Ridgewood district. Property owners can change facades, but they get the tax credit only if certain criteria are met. Mr. Kerzner is a 34-year-old lawyer whose family has lived in Ridgewood for four generations. When the Madison Street buildings burned, he first persuaded a builder friend to buy them for rehabilitation. But the friend died and he took title himself, convinced that once the historic designation was obtained, the project would attract another builder. It did. Daniel Regan Associates, based in New City, N.Y., has made a business of rehabilitation. Its projects have included the recycling of the Benjamin Franklin junior high school in Huntington, L.I., into 102 apartments for elderly people; the creation of 145 units of artists' housing in the former Essex and Phoenix mills in Paterson, N.J., and, currently, the rehabilitation of a former armory in White Plains into 52 apartments and a center for the elderly. With Paul Draskovic of Manhattan as the architect, Mr. Regan has created 10 apartments in the Ridgewood buildings, using the air shaft between them for a new central staircase serving both buildings. A penthouse floor nine feet high has been added to the roof, set back from the cornice and invisible from the street or even from the second floor of buildings across the street. The project opened for renting last weekend, for occupancy in January, and five apartments have been taken. Rents, running from $700 to $850 a month, are about 25 percent higher than the normal free-market rents in Ridgewood, Mr. Kerzner said. The apartments will be converted to cooperatives after a required five- year holding period. The tax credit allows the developer to deduct 25 percent of the costs of construction from his taxes in the first year. The program would be eliminated under the Treasury Department's proposed tax simplification plan. Instead of narrow floorthroughs, as in the railroad flats, each building now has a three-bedroom, one-and- half-bath unit of 1,200 square feet, renting for $850 a month; a one-bedroom unit of 770 square feet at $700 a month, and three two-bedroom duplexes at $800 to $850 a month. One of the duplexes, with 920 square feet, has entrances on the first and second floors, with a spiral staircase connecting a ground-floor study or bedroom to the second floor. The other duplexes are 920-square-foot penthouse units. The builder has provided oak floors in the entire apartment except in the bath, which has Italian tile. Each apartment has its own gas hot-water heat system. Moldings match those produced by the original builder, Gustav Mathews, who produced most of the six-family yellow-brick buildings in Ridgewood from 1908 to 1912. The front doors, which match those historically used in Ridgewood, were unavailable on the market, Mr. Kerzner said. But he kept cruising the neighborhood watching for castoff doors as well as gate work, and recovered enough to preserve the external authenticity of the restoration. Over the last year there has been a rapid increase in housing values in Ridgewood, an area with direct subway service to Manhattan by the LL and M lines. Mr. Kerzner attributed the increase in values - about 40 percent since last December - to the historic-district designation. Mr. Regan said that total development costs were running at about $60 a square foot, of which about $50 a square foot is pure construction cost. The project is eligible for tax assistance under the J-51 program. But if final costs can be held to a level that makes the project successful without J-51, the builder plans not to apply for it.

1126-> Advertising ; Ad Inserts A Concern Of Editors
A growing phenomenon in American magazine publishing circles is the so-called advertorial insert, and at a workshop at the Harvard Club yesterday it was obvious that while they may have become an important advertising revenue source, they are viewed with great suspicion by editors. John A. Dierdorff, managing editor of Business Week, said, ''Eternal vigilance is the price of editorial integrity.'' Mr. Dierdorff was one of four panelists at the workshop, entitled ''Are Advertorials Good for Magazines,'' which was sponsored by the American Society of Magazine Editors, a sister organization of the Magazine Publishers Association. Right off the bat he said he does not go along with the recently coined word advertorial, which is used to describe advertising inserts packaged to look similar to the editorial pages, usually through the use of a theme compatible with a publication's content. Mr. Dierdorff feels the word advertorial sounds too similar to the word editorial and prefers that advertorial inserts be called advertising texts. His magazine is carrying 29 special sections this year. To give an idea of how important these inserts are to a publisher, C. John Kirby, ad director of Scientific American, said yesterday that of the $17 million in ad revenues his domestic edition will pull in this year, $2.1 million will be from advertorials. The largest is a 44-page insert from Japan, which grossed $750,000. Advertisers know that generally the editorial sections of a publication have far more credibility than the advertising, so if given the opportunity, they make their advertising look as similar to the editorial product as they can, shortsightedly ignoring that they are helping to destroy the credibility they cherish in a publication. To prevent such destruction, the American Society of Magazine Editors, borrowing a leaf from the the American Business Press organization, drew up guidelines for the publication of such sections a couple of years back. The guidelines are just now being sent out to members of the M.P.A. and American Association of Advertising Agencies. They include stipulations that each page of an advertorial insert should carry the word advertisement, or a word or words to that effect, and the typeface should be entirely different from that of the publication in which it appears. The guidelines also state that inserts should not be listed in the host publication's table of contents nor should any of the publication's editors or staff be listed in the insert. One of the more important guidelines is that the section should be made available to the publication's top editor ''in ample time for the editor to monitor compliance'' with the guidelines. That ''ample time'' provision is especially important, according to Phyllis Star Wilson, editor in chief of Conde Nast's magazine, Self. She was obviously embarrassed by the first of seven inserts that have run in her relatively new magazine. From the American Dental Association, it was entitled ''Taking Care of Your Teeth'' and prepared by an outside concern called Women's Marketing and Sports. Despite assurances that she would see the section in plenty of time, Miss Wilson said she did not get to see it in time to do anything about it. And among the things she did not like was that the insert, which ran in the center of the magazine, had no advertising separating it from the editorial content, something on which she now insists. As an example of the danger of not separating advertorial from editorial copy, Mr. Dierdorff showed slides of a Kodak Summer Olympics eight- page insert that ran right in the middle of an Olympic feature in the July 30 issue of Time. It was hard to tell where one ended and the other began. Mr. Dierdorff called it an ''abomination.'' Representing the ad agency viewpoint was Paul Zuckerman, senior vice president of media planning for Doyle Dane Bernbach, who after everyone else had their say about complete separation, acknowledged that he liked inserts that looked as much like the surrounding magazine as possible. On his side of the fence that is called getting impact.

1127-> THE BETTER WAY TO COMBAT PORNOGRAPHY
To the Editor: Two letters you printed on June 7 offer examples of a curious phenomenon I have noted several times before: Those who misunderstand and underrate the importance of the free speech and press provisions of the First Amendment tend to misquote Holmes's famous dictum in Schenck v. United States (1919). He said that the First Amendment does not protect one who falsely shouts ''Fire!'' in a crowded theater. Their version leaves out ''falsely.'' More telling, however, is their invariable failure to quote another and more important Holmes dictum on the subject, from United States v. Schwimmer (1928): ''If there is any principle of the Constitution that more imperatively calls for attachment than any other it is the principle of free thought - not free thought for those who agree with us but freedom for the thought that we hate.'' The major problem with most anti-pornography legislation is that it is too open to abuse by those who would suppress ideas distasteful to them. However, constitutional scholars like the Columbia Law School's Prof. Louis Lusky have not read the First Amendment as an absolute bar against the restraint of ''non-political pornography,'' and the late Alexander Meiklejohn argued, I think correctly, that absolutely unfettered political speech is necessary for the proper operation of a democratic society, and only such speech, therefore, is at the core of the protected area. Within these important limits, as your May 27 editorial noted, the accessibility of pornography may legitimately and constitutionally be limited through legislation. Less legally troublesome and more effective, however, is the route your editorial suggests: combating ''one kind of speech with other speech, and through legal economic pressure.'' My community forced an exhibitor of pornographic movies to sell out to an exhibitor of respectable movies by peaceful picketing. He couldn't fight us in the courts because we were exercising our First Amendment rights. That, truly, is the American way. DANIEL L. FELDMAN Member of Assembly, 45th Dist. Albany, June 8, 1984

1131-> TV REVIEW; MAYPORT JAZZ FESTIVAL
ON the eve of New York's Kool Jazz Festival, WNET has gotten a little of the festival bug. Tonight at 11, Channel 13 will show ''Mayport and All That Jazz,'' performances from the 1981 Mayport festival held near Jacksonville, Fla. The final segment, featuring the alto saxophonist Phil Woods and his quartet, is the best. Mr. Woods delivers a long, aching, brilliantly paced solo on a ballad. Sometime in the middle of the piano solo, it begins to rain and then pour. Mr. Woods doesn't let anything so trivial as a few gallons of water stop him. He finishes the tune, adds a coda and holds the final note just long enough. Then, grinning through the applause, he upends his saxophone to drain it, while his bass player makes efforts to save his instrument. The show also catches Dizzy Gillespie in a jaunty, crowd-pleasing mood - singing the blues, playing some speedy trumpet and joshing the crowd into singing ''Salt Peanuts,'' but keeping things fairly superficial. Completing the program is a Florida pianist, Marcus Roberts, and a band of student musicians.

1132-> TWO DYNASTIES OF HASIDIM WED IN WESTCHESTER
For an hour Tuesday night, a half-mile stretch of the Bronx River Parkway was closed to all traffic. Nearby, at the Westchester County Center, the scene was right out of 18th-century Eastern Europe. The occasion was a 10-hour-long wedding celebration that did not end until near sunrise today, a gathering that linked two Hasidic dynasties. Under the stars, beneath a blue canopy, Tziporah Twersky of New Square, N.Y., was married to Eliezer Goldman of Jerusalem. They had met only twice before the wedding day. Over 5,000 guests from around the world came to the Art Deco auditorium, better known as a site of antique shows, wrestling matches and basketball tournaments. Daughter of 'Rebbe' The 18-year-old bride is the third daughter of the Grand Rabbi David Twersky of New Square, the spiritual leader, or ''rebbe'' as he is known, of the Skvirer sect of Hasidim. The groom, a 17 1/2-year-old rabbi, is the son of the Grand Rabbi Yacov Goldman, leader of the Zvil Hasidic sect in Israel. Guests came from Israel, England and Canada as well as from Hasidic communities in Brooklyn, Rockland and Westchester Counties. The men wore their traditional Sabbath garb of black silk caftan and sable fur hat. The women dressed in elegant but modest clothes. As is their custom, men and women were separated throughout the celebration. Throughout the night, the guests sang, prayed and danced. Some cried. The words ''mazel tov'' rang out often. The guests ate close to $30,000 worth of catered food, including 140 gallons of soup, 3,000 melon slices, 2,500 pounds of chicken and 1,200 pounds of fish. Rabbi Mark Lovinger, a caterer from the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, described it as ''an almost impossible task.'' The logistics of detouring and directing traffic were handled by a detail of seven off-duty Westchester County police officers and five White Plains police officers. Crowd control was handled by a team of 20 ''ushers,'' members of the New Square congregation, armed with walkie-talkies. ''Everyone comes to participate in what is called the rebbe's simcha - his joy and happiness,'' said Samuel Weissmandel, the administrative aide for the Village of New Square, a Hasidic community of 400 families in Rockland County. ''Since it's the daughter of our leader, and we feel attached to him spiritually, it's our occasion to rejoice,'' said Rabbi Daniel Goldstein, village clerk of New Square and head of the village girl's school. ''We feel like it's our own child marrying.'' Receiving Blessings Among Hasidic men it is considered good luck to receive the rebbe's blessing. The five grand rabbis at the wedding were mobbed throughout the night and early morning by crowds of men touching them and requesting blessings. Skvirer, one of the sects within Hasidim, was named after the rural Russian town near Kiev where the group's early leaders held court. Like many Hasidic groups, the Skvirer settled in Brooklyn after World War II; they moved to Rockland County in 1956. After the ceremony, there was dancing and singing, women in the basement of the county center and the men in the auditorium. It was not until long after midnight that the women came to the balcony to watch the bride dance with her close male relatives, separated by a white tablecloth. She never danced with her husband. Just before sunrise, the festivities ended and, with the beeping of horns, a caravan of buses and cars departed.

1135-> LONDON SIKH ASSUMES ROLE OF EXILE CHIEF
A Sikh opposition leader in exile here today named a Cabinet, set up a bank account and opened a new headquarters for the Republic of Khalistan, of which, he said, he is both the ideal and the president. The Sikh, Dr. Jagjit Singh Chohan, a medical doctor and politician who left India four years ago, held a news conference in a small parlor hung with a photograph proclaiming the martyrdom of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale at the Golden Temple of Amritsar in Punjab last Wednesday. Khalistan, which is what he would like the Indian state of Punjab to become, has issued so many blue-and- gold passports, postage stamps and Khalistan dollars - all symbolic - that ''now unluckily we have gone out of stock,'' Dr. Chohan told reporters. Dr. Chohan is not the only Sikh who has proclaimed the existence of Khalistan, nor has he been the only one to issue passports, but the killings at the temple in the battle with the Indian Army have changed everything. ''I was the closest friend of Bhindranwale,'' he said today. ''I have received his last message.'' 'It Goes On and On' An official of the Indian High Commission, the equivalent of an embassy, said that Dr. Chohan has been talking about Khalistan for years. ''It goes on and on,'' the official said, conceding that these days ''I'm sure he has more sympathizers - but one has to wait and see.'' India House, in which the High Commission is situated, has been protected by the police and barricades since a Sikh demonstration June 5, during which, the official said, all the windows were broken, attempts were made to set the building on fire and three security guards were injured. Since then, daily demonstrations, including a protest march of 15,000 Sikhs last weekend, have been peaceful. Dr. Chohan was one of the leaders of the weekend march. In a poll of Britain's large Sikh population taken last Thursday and Friday by the Harris Research Center, 72 percent said that before the storming of the Golden Temple they favored a negotiated solution in Punjab and 28 percent said they favored military action by the Sikhs. The taking of the temple left 65 percent in favor of negotiation, while the proportion favoring military action rose to 35 percent. 'Treated as a Traitor' ''If any Sikh leader or any Sikh person tries to talk to Mrs. Gandhi's Government, he will be treated as a traitor of the Sikh nation,'' said Dr. Chohan, who is 56 years old. He said he lost his right hand throwing away a grenade that had been tossed at a crowd of women and children in 1947, the year of Indian independence. Dr. Chohan, who was once deputy speaker of the Punjab state assembly, quoted angrily from newspaper reports of the shooting of women and children in Amritsar - reports that have been denied by the Indian Government - and said ''information we have got from our own sources is that more than 10,000 people have been massacred by this fascist regime of Mrs. Gandhi.'' Other reports have put the death toll at between 450 and 1,200. Dr. Chohan, whose position is that ''there will be no demand less than Khalistan,'' conceded that ''up to a week ago I was in a very small minority.'' Most Sikhs, including Mr. Bhindranwale and members of the Akali Dal party, talked of more autonomy for Sikhs in Punjab. Now with some Sikh leaders dead and most of the party leadership under arrest, Dr. Chohan said, ''everything has changed.''

1136-> MUSIC: AMOR ARTIS CHAMBER GROUP
HANDEL never composed a more nearly perfect work than ''Acis and Galatea,'' which is either an opera, a cantata, a masque or a pastoral oratorio, depending on which expert you choose to believe. Certainly he never composed a more charming or a more lovable one. Just to hear the opening lines of the first chorus, ''Oh, the pleasure of the plains!/ Happy nymphs and happy swains,'' is enough to bring a look of sappy bliss to any devoted admirer of the score. ''Acis'' is a smaller gem than ''Messiah,'' granted, and without some of the brilliant vocal facets of Handel's grander Italian operas, but it is a masterpiece in miniature, all the same. Like any masterpiece, the work can be bent in many different directions without losing its basic shape, but it began life as an extremely intimate chamber piece and that is how Johannes Somary and his Armor Artis Chamber Orchestra performed it at Alice Tully Hall Tuesday night. It would be possible and historically justifiable to give ''Acis'' with just seven instrumentalists and five singers, since the vocal quintet can double as the chorus. Handel seems to have been restricted to such modest numbers for the premiere, though in later performances he is thought to have expanded his forces. Mr. Somary employed five singers and did without a chorus, but he used nine players. The musicians played ''original'' instruments, which in this instance means recorders instead of flute and piccolo, two baroque oboes, harpsichord, two violins with what sounded like gut instead of metal strings and two cellos without pins - that is, squeezed between the players' knees in gamba style. The cellists held their bows high up on the wood, again like gambists, rather than at the frog, which contributed to a generally lighter sonority in the lower strings. Vocally, too, the performance honored Baroque tradition: important arias were given with da capo repeats, or taken from the top, as jazz musicians say. Because the pastoral style that Handel used in ''Acis'' is so fragile and artificial - that, paradoxically, is the genre's strength - no performance can come near succeeding without singers of keen intelligence and refined taste. Of Mr. Somary's quintet, the most successful on all counts were Grayson Hirst as Acis and John Ostendorf as the lovelorn Polyphemus. Mr. Hirst's finest moment was ''Love sounds th'alarm'' and while he bore down a little too archly on the unintenionally funny line ''For life is a pain,'' he did at least show some alertness to the gentle humor that pervades the score. That recognition, sad to report, was largely lacking all evening in Mr. Somary's stiff and unyielding conducting. His unvaried tempos, his tight phrasing and his refusal to allow the music to breathe seriously denatured the work's intoxicating nature. A minor drawback was the sweet- and-sour sound occasionally produced by the instrumental ensemble, which did not produce the solid, carefully pitched sonorities that can be heard from the better old-music groups on the international level. Mr. Ostendorf, blessed with the night's most famous number, ''O ruddier than the cherry,'' extracted every bit of juice from it, even though he was pressed at times by Mr. Somary's relentless beat. This aria has long been one of the keystones in the basso profundo repertory, but Mr. Ostendorf's pliable bass-baritone carried him though nicely. As the beast who devours babies for lunch and squashes rival swains with rocks, he managed to be both fearsome and pitiable. Handel's blustery Polyphemus is the most emotionally vulnerable monster to appear in opera before Fafner, and Mr. Ostendorf had him down just right. Irene Gubrud's soprano had the rich flutiness and throaty trill for ''Hush, ye pretty warbling quire!'' and she would have been an ideal Galatea if she had found it possible to find more expressive nuances in the role. When presented in concert, as it was this time, ''Acis'' may resemble an oratorio, but it ought to be treated as pure musical theater - as a seriocomic opera, in fact. Miss Gubrud sang beautifully, however, as did Stephen Oosting, a tenor who began rather tremulously as Damon, but was in firm control by the time of his sweetest number, ''Would you gain the tender creature.'' Considering the rarity of ''Acis'' performances hereabouts, the absence of program notes was inexcusable.

To the Editor: A June 15 news article discusses the illegal activities of animal rights activists but overlooks the greater harm they do. More serious than vandalizing laboratory facilities is their attempt to steal the hope that biomedical research offers to millions who suffer from life-threatening, crippling and debilitating diseases and injuries. While demanding the elimination of biomedical research with animals is not illegal, consider the available options: We can use human beings as the primary research models in finding the cause, cure and prevention of cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, AIDS, blindness, birth defects and hundreds of other diseases that plague so many. Or we can halt biomedical research in these areas altogether. It is doubtful the public will find either choice preferable to continuing responsible and humane animal research to find cures for the illnesses that afflict both humans and animals. FRANKIE L. TRULL Executive Director, Foundation for Biomedical Research Waltham, Mass., June 18, 1984

1139-> WARRANT SAID TO BE ISSUED FOR ART WORLD FIGURE
A French judge issued an ''international arrest warrant'' Tuesday for the arrest of the former director of the Cleveland Museum of Art, the French newspaper Le Monde reported yesterday. The judge, Jean-Pierre Michau, of the Tribunal of Paris, charged the former director, Sherman E. Lee, with ''complicity in exporting contraband,'' according to Le Monde. French officials in the United States yesterday said that they knew only what they had read in the newspaper, and repeated efforts to reach Mr. Michau and other French officials at their offices in Paris were unsuccessful. The case involves a painting by the 17th-century painter Nicolas Poussin, called ''The Holy Family on the Steps.'' In January 1981, a man identified by Le Monde as Philippe Bertin-Mourot took the painting from France to the United States, and sold it in April 1981 to the museum through Mr. Lee, who was then director of the Cleveland Museum of Art. Mr. Lee, reached yesterday at his home in Chapel Hill, N.C., said that he had once offered to buy the painting on behalf of the museum from Mr. Bertin-Mourot for $2.2 million, but said that was not the final sale price, which he declined to give. Lacked a License After the Cleveland Museum purchased the painting in April 1981, the Louvre criticized Mr. Lee for having bought the painting and announced that they would begin legal proceedings against either him or the museum. In newspaper stories at the time, Mr. Lee acknowledged that when he bought the painting he knew that it had left France without a license, but he contended that it was not necessary under French law. The painting has been on display in the museum almost uninterruptedly since it was purchased, according to Evan H. Turner, who took over as the museum's director in July 1983, after Mr. Lee retired. Hubert Landais, the Director of French Museums, said yesterday in a telephone interview from Paris that he had read in Le Monde about the judge's ruling, but had not spoken with him. ''For us the position is clear,'' Mr. Landais said. ''The painting was in France. Mr. Sherman Lee was not involved in exporting the painting, but he bought it knowing that it was not in accord with French Customs and American Customs.'' Mr. Landais said that he was not necessarily interested in bringing the painting back to France, but rather in protecting the legal process that subjects paintings leaving France to a review to determine whether they will get an export license. Under French law, he said, a painting may be denied export and bought by the French Government to protect its cultural heritage. 'An Enormous Problem' Mr. Landais said he thought that the arrest warrant against Mr. Lee would be a precedent that would discourage other art dealers and collectors from leaving the country with paintings illegally. ''It's an enormous problem for us,'' he said. At his home yesterday in Chapel Hill, Mr. Lee said that he had heard nothing from France about the arrest warrant, and angrily defended himself against the charges. ''We have gone through this inside and out, and are absolutely convinced that we have a firm legal and moral position,'' he said. ''Just because the French Government has done this unilaterally doesn't mean that we should react.'' Dr. Turner said yesterday that the museum had heard nothing from the French Government. He added that the painting had been purchased only after extensive consultation with French and American lawyers. ''My belief,'' he said, ''is that the museum trustees, as well as the director, were within their legal and ethical rights to buy the painting because there was an exception in the French law which permitted the painting to be exported.'' Exceptions to Law Cited In explanation of the law, Dr. Turner said that while some paintings being exported from France had to be offered for review for granting of an export license, French legislation enacted in 1941 provided exceptions to the rule. Two court cases in France had proved to the Cleveland museum's satisfaction, Dr. Turner said, that their purchase of the art fell into this bound. John Russell, a spokesman for the Department of Justice, said that while there has been earlier communication between the French and United States Governments on this case, the Justice Department had not yet been informed by France of Judge Michau's warrant of arrest. ''It's rather new to us,'' he said. Phillip White, a Justice Department lawyer, said that by ''international arrest warrant,'' he understood a legal procedure by which a foreign government alerts Interpol, the international anticrime organization, that it was seeking a fugitive. Normally, Interpol will then send ''red notices'' to various countries, guaranteeing that the original country will seek extradition of the individual if he is arrested, Mr. White said. The United States, however, does not recognize ''red notices,'' Mr. White said. Instead, it recognizes only an official diplomatic request for extradition of an individual. Lawrence Ryan, a spokesman for the United States Customs Service, said that the agency was involved in the case, but he would not say whether it had received any word from France about Judge Michau's order. Mr. Ryan said, however, that a United States arrest warrant had been issued against Mr. Bertin-Mourot, who is charged with intentionally making a false statement to United States Customs. In the Le Monde article, Mr. Bertin-Mourot is identified as a Frenchman living in Canada, who is the director of French and Swiss companies. The article did not identify the companies.

1140-> How Much for Your Vote?
So Ronald Reagan will settle for being the candidate of high deficits if he can paint Walter Mondale as the candidate of high taxes. The President may be right to think that this would leave him with the better TV commercials this fall. But if that's to be the essence of this year's debate, the American voter will be twice cheated: of a choice about the proper levels of social and military spending, and of the right to judge which party is more likely to break the destructive cycles of boom and bust. Mr. Mondale made bold to state that taxes will have to be increased even if defense and other major budget items are held in check. But he let the inattentive conclude that mostly the rich will feel the pain, which is simply not so. If the Mondale message is to make any sense, it has to be that all Americans will be better off paying somewhat higher taxes soon for the sake of avoiding another steep inflation or deep recession, and for balanced growth the world over. Even more audaciously, Mr. Reagan pronounced himself dead set against raising taxes just days after signing a tax increase that's part of his own ''down payment'' on the deficit. Now he says he's banking on a commission's 2,478 ideas for cutting waste in programs he's been managing for three years. And if that doesn't erase the $200 billion deficit, he'll ''look at'' cutting Medicare, veterans' benefits, farm subsidies. But his only pre-election pledges are to raise Social Security payouts if the cost of living doesn't automatically require them, and to start new subsidies for parochial and private school tuitions. If the Reagan rhetoric is to make sense, it will have to concede that the projected deficits are intol- erable for four more years, then either identify the middle-class subsidies to be cut or confess that more taxes will have to pay the Pentagon's bills. Without such candor, the candidates offer only an undignified competition to buy November's vote. Mr. Reagan's responsibility for a sober economic debate is the greater, precisely because he's able to run on so much happy economic news. There's plenty of credit to be claimed for carrying through with deregulation and for having created a political climate that, in a recession, deprived organized labor of significant bargaining power. Why not then confess the nation's good luck in temporarily escaping from the energy noose? And instead of denouncing high interest rates, why not instruct the public in how its higher monthly installments finance the deficit, draw in an excess of foreign money, make imports cheaper and in all these ways delay the price increases that the boom would otherwise produce? Instead, Mr. Reagan invites the very Democratic demagoguery he deplores by trotting out his tired ''balanced budget'' amendment. The Republican senators who hope to lead the nation just a few years hence have already shown they know better than to shrink from the hard economic decisions ahead. Mr. Mondale and other leading Democrats are ready to share the burden of asking the voters to face up to realities. The deficits are bad for the world and bad for America. As two Congresses have now shown, they can be reduced only by a politically shrewd combination of tax increases and cuts in defense and social spending. What a chance for leadership.

1143-> SCOUTING; Lee's Stuff
Bill Lee, the Spaceman of baseball whose adventures and misadventures with the Boston Red Sox and the Montreal Expos often overshadowed his talents as a pitcher, has produced a book. ''The Wrong Stuff,'' written with Dick Lally and published by Viking Press, details Lee's life on and off major league playing fields. It recounts, among other things, the time he was hit by a cab while jogging, the time he fell from the second floor of a Montreal building that he was scaling at 6 A.M., his life playing semipro baseball in Canada since being released by Montreal two years ago and his well-publicized experiences with marijuana. Among all this, the book also makes room for Lee's comments on the art of pitching a baseball. ''The book tells the truth about my life,'' he said yesterday from his home in Moncton, New Brunswick, where he continues to pitch with the Moncton Mets, for whom he has a 6-1 record this season. ''The title describes my situation, a left-hander on a right-handed planet. Strange things have happened to me, many because I've always played for fun, not money. ''I miss not playing baseball regularly, but I've found other things. Now my wife, our three kids and I stop off near a fishing bridge and have a picnic. Or I teach the boys cribbage, a good game for kids who don't like to count. ''But if any major league teams need me in September, I'm available. I'm hitting .351 with five home runs.'' Otherwise, he said, life in New Brunswick is low-key and peaceful. ''We don't watch much television,'' he said. ''They're behind the times up here. They still get the news with Walter Cronkite.''

1144-> IS IT NAT MOORE? NORTH MOORE? OR NO MOORE?
What's in an N? Confusion and neighborhood pride when it's an N as in N. Moore Street. For years, this short stretch in lower Manhattan was known to just about everybody as North Moore. But recently a number of city maps and documents identified it as Nathaniel Moore. The Board of Estimate even approved resolutions using the name Nathaniel. This mysterious name was tracked, with varying success, through the records of Trinity Church, Columbia College and the City Planning Department. But, starting with a phone call to Puffy's Tavern, the name's ties to the street began to unravel. In the end, Nathaniel Moore - who emerged briefly from more than a century of obscurity - retreated to the shadows of history. North Moore it seemed to be. 'In Deference to the Community' Speaking for the planning agency, Martha Ritter offered the first clue as to how the name Nathaniel had cropped up officially. She said it was used ''in deference to the community'' even though ''a quick check of the records has failed to authenticate the name.'' Before Nathaniel Moore's fall from grace, Hal Bromm, a member of the local community board, said, ''The reason we call it Nathaniel Moore Street is because its correct name is Nathaniel Moore Street.'' ''It was never North Moore Street,'' said Kathryn Freed, chairman of the community board. ''It was always N. Moore and everybody just assumed that meant North.'' That led to James Stratton, the owner of Puffy's and head of the board's traffic and transportation committee. ''My memory of it goes back to 1975 when we were organizing the neighborhood,'' he recalled. ''Somebody brought up the point that N was not for North, it was for Nathaniel.'' ''We've been calling it Nat Moore or No Moore,'' he said, ''depending on how we feel about it. We're not quite sure who Nat Moore was.'' The only Nathaniel Moore who stood out in early New York history was the president of Columbia College from 1842 to 1849. ''His administration was, for the most part, uneventful, marked only by the continuing struggle for money and the establishment of the first Greek-letter fraternities,'' wrote Alice H. Bonnell, former curator of Columbiana at Columbia University. On top of that lackluster assessment, Nathaniel was only 7 years old when Moore Street was named by the Trinity vestry on Feb. 15, 1790. Could he possibly have been so precocious as to merit this commemoration? And, Now, Benjamin Moore ''I don't even know who Nathaniel Moore was,'' said Phyllis Barr, the Trinity archivist. ''The only Moore I have is Benjamin.'' Now, Benjamin was Episcopal Bishop of New York, rector of Trinity Church, president of Kings College and - in its reincarnation - Columbia College. He was the father of Clement Clarke ('' 'Twas the Night Before Christmas'') Moore. And he was 41 years old when the street was named. As for North, that distinguishes one Moore from another. N. Moore runs perpendicular to the Hudson River; plain Moore Street, farther downtown at the tip of Manhattan, used to run to the East River, but has been truncated in recent years. 'North Moore Has It' Faced with this news, Paul Goldstein, district manager of the community board, conceded, ''I think North Moore has it.'' ''If there's better evidence, we'll sit here with egg on our faces,'' Mr. Stratton said. ''But the board won't consider itself discredited to be shown the truth.'' One remaining mystery was whether there would be any legal difficulties arising from the fact that the Board of Estimate had used the name Nathaniel Moore in disposing of city- owned land to Shearson Lehman/ American Express. Hadley W. Gold, the first assistant corporation counsel, shook his head and laughed at the question. ''It's just a housekeeping aberration,'' he said. ''N means North where I come from.''

1146-> NEW YORK DAY BY DAY; Calling for Equine EKG's At Central Park
As temperatures climbed toward the mid-90's yesterday and before New York City's carriage horses were ordered off the streets, two perspiring veterinarians in white coats hooked up an 11-year-old horse named Cassanova to a pay phone at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 59th Street. Cassanova was not making a phone call. Electrodes were connected to Cassanova's legs, then to the telephone receiver. Drs. Robert Cohen and Michael Miller, whose Brooklyn company is called Cardiopet, were giving him an electrocardiogram - free, except for the dime it took to make the call. In about 45 seconds, the reading came out in Room 1516 at the St. Moritz Hotel, which Cardiopet had taken over for the demonstration. ''This horse is in great shape,'' Dr. Cohen said. ''This is a future race horse.'' The next horse up to the phone was Rocky, who spent the first three years of his life pulling a plow on an Amish farm in Pennsylvania. For the last eight years, he has pulled a carriage filled with tourists around Central Park. Rocky was also pronounced in good health. Drs. Cohen and Miller say they have given telephone electrocardiograms to animals in all sizes and shapes - from elephants to birds.

1147-> JAZZ:JOHN HICKS AND SEXTET
The jazz pianist John Hicks has a big band that is rehearsing and biding its time until an opportunity to get in front of an audience comes up. Meanwhile, Mr. Hicks can usually be heard as an accompanist to singers, as a piano soloist or as the leader of a trio. But this week at the Village Vanguard, through tomorrow, he is offering a suggestive sample of what may be expected from his big band in the form of a sextet drawn from the band. The group is made up of Carter Jefferson, tenor saxophone; Bobby Watson, alto saxophone, and Wallace Rooney, trumpet, with Ray Drummond, bass; Idris Muhammad, drums, and Mr. Hicks on piano. Individually and as an ensemble, these are distinctive and colorful musicians. Mr. Watson is an alto saxophonist who has his roots in the warm and singing tradition of Benny Carter. On this he has built an enlivening attack that makes his solos soar, and he blends with Mr. Jefferson's tenor in some swirling passages. Mr. Rooney's richly brassy tone ranges from staccato sprinkles to luxurious, glowing lines, while Mr. Hicks's orchestral approach to the piano supports and surrounds the other musicians with romantic settings, sidelong accents or solid chords. The flexibility with which Mr. Hicks may use his full band is indicated in the way he breaks up his sextet, mixing in piano solos and trio presentations involving Mr. Drummond, Mr. Muhammad and his own piano, along with the full sextet. A further variation was brought up one night when Elise Wood, a flutist who performs in a duo with Mr. Hicks, joined the sextet and played in a broad rugged manner that put her on an equal footing with the three horns.

1149-> J. David Case Bail Remains
A Federal magistrate has rejected a request by J. David Dominelli of the bankrupt J. David & Company investment house to have his $5 million bail reduced so that he could leave the Federal jail in San Diego. United States Magistrate Roger C. McKee on Thursday turned down the bid by Nicholas DePento, an attorney, to reduce bail to $250,000 or eliminate it and allow Mr. Dominelli to go free if he promised to appear at future hearings concerning the failed company. Mr. Dominelli, who is 43 years old, was jailed last April on charges of bankruptcy fraud, contempt of court and giving false statements to a grand jury investigating the collapse of the high-flying firm. The magistrate said he needed more than Mr. Dominelli's word that he would not try to flee the area. Mr. Dominelli was arrested in Miami after he fled to the Carribean nation of Montserrat, where he contended he was trying to recover the estimated $112.8 million in investors' funds that disappeared when J. David collapsed.

1152-> WHEN THE RENT CHECK DOESN'T COVER THE RENT
To the Editor: Your July 5 news article ''Thousands in City Are Collecting Double Welfare Payments for Rent'' creates the impression that rent allowances are being used for anything but rent. In fact, recipients don't receive anywhere near enough money to cover rent payments and thus fall behind. The proof: The maximum rent allowance established by the Department of Social Services as of Jan. 1, 1974, gave a family of four up to $218 per month. This allowance remained the same until Jan. 1, 1984, when it was raised to $270, an increase of 23 percent. During these same 10 years, rents in rent-controlled apartments went up by 7 percent per year; rents in rent-stabilized apartments increased at an even higher rate. The allowance for food, utilities, clothing, etc., was also frozen in 1974 and not increased until 1983, when it went up by only 12 percent for a family of four. In these 10 years, the general cost of living went up by 100 percent. These facts should be emphasized, not the fraud aspect. I suppose it is much too easy to beat up on poor people. GERALD SCHWARTZ New York, July 5, 1984 The writer is an attorney for the Family Location and Legal Service of the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services.

Miss Roche, originally from Korea, is the adopted daughter of British parents. Their son, Jeremy, also is an outfielder on the team, which is managed by John Fader. Brussels will meet the champion of Canada Aug. 21 in Williamsport, Pa., but there is a problem posed by the fact that there are no facilities for girls in the stadium cabin complex that houses World Series teams. Jack Keener, a Little League spokesman, said Miss Roche would stay in a nearby hotel, along with Fader's wife and daughter.

1156-> SOVIET MILLIONAIRE'S PATH TO THE FIRING SQUAD
A man whose recent execution has become a symbol of the drive against corruption is being portrayed here as a pathologically greedy former taxi driver who played the system for profit and prestige until the system caught up with him. The Government newspaper Izvestia, in an article published this week, described the rise and fall of Yuri K. Sokolov, the director of Gastronom 1, Moscow's best food store, who was reported last month to have been executed for corruption. The prominently displayed account Wednesday also depicted a system in which corrupt practices are winked at. It described Mr. Sokolov as someone who had accepted bribes in his office ''with a small smile'' and had buried some of the 1.5 million rubles, or $2 million, that he amassed in a canister in the garden of his summer home. The paper did not mention some of Mr. Sokolov's high-level contacts, which were said to have included astronauts and the family of Leonid I. Brezhnev, the late Soviet leader. Drive Against Corruption The announcement of Mr. Sokolov's execution was seen as a sign that the current Soviet leadership was eager to maintain at least the appearance of continuing the drive against corruption that was started by Yuri V. Andropov, Mr. Brezhnev's successor. Some Russians have reacted with disapproval to the execution, saying Mr. Sokolov was singled out for practices that are widespread and are likely to continue. Western diplomats say Mr. Sokolov's very success in cultivating the highest Kremlin connections probably led to his downfall when a new leadership sought symbolic targets for its crackdown. According to Izvestia, Mr. Sokolov was an inveterate liar who even in his written confession gave a wrong year of birth - the paper said it should have been 1925 - and exaggerated his military service. The newspaper confirmed reports that he had started out as a taxi driver. From that job, which got him into trouble with the law three times for what Izvestia called ''venal crimes,'' Mr. Sokolov ''rose to retailing,'' the paper said. Chandeliers and Faded Elegance Within less than four years, Izvestia said, he worked his way up through the hierarchy of the city's Food Store Administration - shops and businesses in the Soviet Union are Government-run - to take over the prestigious Gastronom 1 at 14 Gorky Street, on a downtown thoroughfare. Occupying the marble premises of a gourmet shop of czarist times, it is an establishment of chandeliers, frescoes and faded elegance and is still known by the name of its prerevolutionary owner, Yeliseyev. With annual gross sales of 94 million rubles, or $125 million, Gastronom 1 carries delicacies unobtainable in Moscow's sparsely stocked neighborhood groceries and is also known to cater to the Soviet elite. Like some of the better food stores in Moscow, Gastronom 1 has a telephone order department that accepts orders and helps reduce waiting in line at counters. Mr. Sokolov's appointment as manager, Izvestia said, was made possible only because the city's Food Store Administration was staffed ''with irresponsible, dishonest people who themselves were breaking the law.'' ''It stands to reason,'' the newspaper said, ''that some of these have already been brought to justice and that others are under investigation.'' The newspaper did not describe the services Mr. Sokolov rendered in return for bribes, or the people who benefited from his services.

1157-> SMALL DONORS HELP FRESH AIR FUND NEAR ITS GOAL
The money comes in certified checks, in anonymous bags of coins left at the front desk, as a quarter taped to a note. It comes from corporations, church groups, Boy Scouts and nuns. The Fresh Air Fund has raised more than $1.8 million this year in its annual appeal for contributions. Officials of the fund, which allows disadvantaged city children to escape to the green hills of the countryside, say they are About $150,000 away from their goal of $2 million. One of those helping the fund, 11- year-old Tyra Freyer of Scarsdale, N.Y., sent $10 of her birthday money after her grandfather suggested she help other children go to camp as she does. ''The kids that live in the hot city must want to go to camp,'' she said over the phone from Camp Waldon in Maine. ''It's fun for me. It also must be fun for them.'' Memories of Russia When 90-year-old Hymann Nearon was growing up in the Russian city of Odessa by the Black Sea, he yearned to spend a couple of weeks in the country. This year - now a resident of Kingston, N.Y. - he helped give some children that chance. ''Enclosed you will find $100 for your noble fund,'' Mr. Nearon wrote. ''It will take a couple of kids, black or white, out of the smoked-up big city to the fresh air, of fields and of the woodlands, to play with new friends.'' Donations like Tyra's and Mr. Nearon's are among 35,000 gifts the fund has received this year. According to its executive director, Jenny Morganthau, about 75 percent of the fund's contributions come from individuals, who donate an average of $44. ''One of our strengths is that we have so many people that give and have been giving for years,'' Miss Morgenthau said. ''We have more small donors than most people.'' A former Fresh Air child in Chelsea, Vt., Anna Bures has become one of those donors. In a letter with her $25 donation, she wrote about her experiences in the program and how she remains in touch with the family that was her host 36 year ago. ''I remember one summer I could not go because I had two brothers to care for,'' she wrote. ''How I cried! Well, the whole town of Chelsea offered to take them so I could go. I did.'' Many Involved Another strength Miss Morganthau cited was the large number of people the fund has involved. ''Once Avis gave us a bus to use at camp,'' she said. ''When we took delivery of the bus, a man walked by and said: 'The Fresh Air Fund? I was a former Fresh Air child.' '' It is Miss Morganthau's second summer with the fund, but she said she was already finding that people often approach her outside the office and offer to donate to the fund. ''At a cocktail party, people will come to me with checks and offer donations,'' she said. Most Contributions Small Making up almost two thirds of last year's budget were such contributions - from the quarters taped to glowing letters to the thousands of dollars given by city foundations and corporations. Some 6 percent came from a grant by the Greater New York Fund. The Fresh Air Fund also receives income from investments, special programs and the Department of Agriculture for its summer food program. While some nonprofit organizations spend a great bulk of their funds on administration, more than 75 percent of the money collected by the fund goes directly into paying for the programs themselves.

Walter F. Burke, 75,Space Industry Leader ST. LOUIS, May 4 (UPI) - Walter F. Burke, who led the Mercury and Gemini space programs at the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, died Tuesday in the crash of his light plane at Ukiah, Calif., the company reported Wednesday. He was 75 years old. Mr. Burke lived in Rancho Costa, Calif., with his wife, Muriel Hutton Burke. He retired in 1973 as president of the McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Company in Huntington Beach, Calif. He joined the McDonnell Aircraft Corporation in St. Louis in 1945. In 1960, he was named vice president and general manager of Project Mercury, the nation's first manned space program. In 1962 he was promoted to vice president and general manager for spacecraft and missiles. From that post, he guided Project Gemini, the space program that followed Mercury. McDonnell Douglas built the single- seat Mercury and two-seat Gemini space capsules at its St. Louis plant. Mr. Burke was appointed president of McDonnell Astronautics in 1966, and became president of McDonnell Douglas Astronautics when the McDonnell and Douglas aircraft corporations merged in 1968. He is survived by his wife and a daughter, Patricia Walta Burke Schlimpert, who lives in southern California.

1161-> FERRARO'S DAYS TEST AGENTS
For the Secret Service agents protecting Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro, life is unpredictable. Most candidates for high office, even on their days off, unflinchingly accept iron-clad schedules prepared days in advance. But the Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee from Queens is more freewheeling. Still expressing puzzlement about why network television crews insist on following her every footstep, Representative Ferraro ate lunch Thursday in the public section of the members' dining room in the House of Representatives. On Friday in New York City, she wandered back from lunch along Queens Boulevard with two friends, Patricia Flynn, her office manager, and Tim Flaherty, a former Congressional aide, apparently enjoying the freedom of a few minutes of normality. But once-routine matters are now out of bounds. Like Walter F. Mondale, who found on his vacation on Long Island before the convention that he had to have a barber come to the house, Representative Ferraro called her hairdresser to her home Friday. Last week the Secret Service started to assign at least one female agent to Representative Ferraro's detail. Usually, agents are placed on rosters to candidates without consideration of their sex, according to agents covering the Congresswoman. ''There are some places we can't go,'' one Secret Service agent said the other day. He was referring in part to public restrooms, which agents are required to check before a Presidential candidate enters.

1162-> POLISH DISSIDENT IS CARRIED OUT OF PRISON
A key Polish dissident jailed since the declaration of martial law in December 1981 said today that Polish security men picked him up and carried him out of the main prison here. The dissident, Adam Michnik, was freed under a sweeping amnesty approved by Parliament July 21. He had demanded that his name be cleared of sedition charges before he would agree to be released from prison. ''I didn't enter of my own accord,'' he said in a telephone interview from his apartment. ''I was carried here. They were security people.'' Also set free, dissident sources said, was Seweryn Jaworski, an activist of the outlawed Solidarity trade union. Taken to His Apartment Mr. Michnik, a member of the disbanded dissident group KOR (Workers Defense Committee), was taken to his apartment in Warsaw this afternoon, his friends said. Mr. Jaworski, former deputy leader of Solidarity's Warsaw chapter, was released Friday, they said. Mr. Jaworski, 54 years old, was one of several Solidarity leaders who had been in prison awaiting trial on charges of conspiring to overthrow the Communist Government. Three others, Andrzej Gwiazda, Marian Jurczyk and Grzegorz Palka, were freed earlier under the amnesty. Among those still in prison are Karol Modzelewski, Jan Rulewski and Andrzej Rozplochowski. Mr. Michnik said he was released from Rakowiecka Prison just after noon and driven to his apartment by policemen. In the telephone interview, Mr. Michnik said: ''I'm too tired to say any more. Please contact me tomorrow morning.'' Mr. Michnik, 37, whose trial on charges of plotting to topple Communist rule was abandoned when the Government declared the amnesty, insisted he was not guilty of the accusations against him. He demanded either to be freed without conditions or to be allowed to state his case in court. He vowed in prison that he would have to be carried out of Rakowiecka if the authorities wanted to include him in the amnesty, which the Government said would cover almost all political prisoners and some 30,000 common criminals. Government's Warning The Government has warned the freed prisoners that the amnesty will be revoked if they repeat the offenses for which they were sentenced or were under investigation. Mr. Michnik served 18 months in prison in the late 1960's for playing a leading role in student protests in Warsaw in 1968. He joined KOR in 1977 and was repeatedly detained. Mr. Michnik, like most of the other dissidents being freed under the amnesty, was jailed after the declaration of martial law on Dec. 13, 1981, followed a wave of internal unrest. The Solidarity union and its affiliates, the only independent unions in the Soviet bloc, were later outlawed. Mr. Michnik and his fellow prisoners rejected a Polish Government offer of emigration to the West in 1983. A friend of Mr. Michnik's said he went from his apartment to St. Martin's convent in Warsaw to greet acquaintances and thank them for their assistance during his imprisonment. The friend quoted Mr. Michnik as saying he had not been allowed to take from Rakowiecka all the notes he made while he was in prison.

23 (AP) - Chul Chang pitched a no-hitter, striking out 14, as power-hitting South Korea claimed a berth in the Little League World Series title game with a 10-0 rout today of Coquitlam, British Columbia. Chang permitted only two base runners. John Pollock walked with two outs in the fifth inning and a pinch-hitter, Scott Leroux, was hit by a pitch in the sixth. South Korea now faces Altamonte Springs, Fla., in the title game Saturday. Altamonte Springs defeated Southport, Ind., 4-2. Except for consolation games, Chang's was the first series no- hitter since Hidetoshi Yoshino of Japan pitched a perfect game against a Saudi Arabian team last year.

1166-> SCREEN: LOVE IN BELFAST
''Cal'' is a beautiful, mournful movie about Northern Ireland. Though much of it takes the form of a love story, intimations of violence are everywhere. The film begins with a murder and soon cuts to a scene in a slaughterhouse, where the father of the title character is employed. Cal (John Lynch), sad-eyed and painfully thin, was himself once employed at the ''abattoir'' (as his father calls the slaughterhouse) but is now out of work. Instead, he has reluctantly been recruited by friends as an accessory to Irish Republican Army terrorist activities, including the killing we have already seen. The victim was a Protestant policeman. And the demure, quiet woman (Helen Mirren) with whom Cal gradually becomes fascinated is the policeman's young widow, Marcella. Cal first spots her at the library, sees her in church, then finds some pretext for visiting the home where she lives with her prosperous in-laws. There, in a well-appointed farmhouse whose furnishings include many photographs of the British royal family, the shy, uneasy Cal is hired as a helper by the dead man's parents. ''Cal,'' which has been gracefully adapted by Bernard Maclaverty from his 1983 novel and equally well directed by Pat O'Connor, uses the smaller details of this story to outline the larger situation. It takes place in several well-drawn households, including the one Cal and his father, Shamie (Donal McCann), share, the only Roman Catholics in a Protestant neighborhood. ''Whisperin' in our own house!'' declares the father with indignation, on the night an anonymous, threatening letter is delivered and the two men sit up all night guarding their home. Like many of the battles waged in ''Cal,'' this is a losing one. At the farmhouse, Cal listens in sorrowful silence to the owners' harsh opinions of his Catholic countrymen, and to their occasional references to the murder. He wants to do penance in some way and also separate himself from the terrorists who find him a convenient accomplice. The film brings implicit religious overtones to Cal's search for redemption, but it never loses sight of the plainness and realism that are its best features. The love story, played in gentle, gradual stages by Miss Mirren and Mr. Lynch, brings out the best in both performers. Miss Mirren, through a reserve that disappears layer by layer, makes Marcella a woman of unexpected substance and generosity, one who is no more comfortable with the pain and paradoxes of Northern Ireland than Cal is himself. Mr. Lynch, a good but less experienced performer with a narrower range, has simpler and more physical ways of communicating that same regret. His quiet gravity is one of the most memorable things about the movie. Another is Mark Knopfler's exceptionally lovely and haunting score. Bittersweet CAL, directed by Pat O'Connor; screenplay by Bernard Maclaverty; director of photography, Stuart Craig; edited by Michael Bradsell; music by Mark Knopfler; produced by Stuart Craig and David Puttnam; released by Warner Bros. and Goldcrest.

1167-> ECHOES OF VIENNA'S HERITAGE
A stroller in Vienna doesn't have to be a compulsive reader of what is written on house walls to note how often the names of Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert recur on the commemorative tablets that abound in many neighborhoods. This is a place where the sight of graffiti is rare but where plaques abound recalling the great moments of a long history, the enduring glories of a mellow civilization and, above all, the giants of music who lived here. The Viennese bristle on being told that theirs is a museum city. The recent construction of a modern subway system, spanking new institutions of advanced learning, the sparkling musical seasons, refurbished coffeehouses and restaurants and the facelifting that many old buildings are undergoing prove that there is plenty of life still in one of the oldest among European capitals. Coats of paint in pastel or downright gaudy colors on many facades have even relieved the prevailing gray that used to make some of the districts between the historical center and the outer ring of wine-growing villages and semirural suburbs look so bleak. Yet the multitude of memorial signs remind the visitor continually of a great past going back all the way to antiquity. A mosaic on the Hoher Markt at the center marks the spot where Emperor Marcus Aurelius had his residence in the encampment that was the Vindobona, a Roman frontier post that coexisted with a much older Celtic village. Among the countless inscriptions glorifying famous Viennese from Hapsburg rulers and archdukes to the theater people who were always favorites in this stage-struck metropolis, a sign near Sch"onbrunn Castle may be one of the most memorable. It informs the curious that Stalin lived in this house in 1913 while writing ''Marxism and the National Question.'' There can't be many other memorials to Stalin outside his home region, the Georgian Soviet Republic. More than 100 plaques in Vienna are dedicated to composers. While watching out for all these signs, the music lover may recapture in imagination some of the surroundings and the moods that must have influenced the workings of genius - the kind of weather that exhilarated or depressed Beethoven perhaps, the hillside where he took his walks, the buildings he saw, the Viennese voices and accents that he used to hear at first and then, in the years of deafness, could understand no longer. That several scores of tablets commemorate Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert is not only a tribute to their greatness but also evidence of their restlessness. Beethoven is known to have lived in at least 30 houses in Vienna between his move from Bonn in 1792 (he had been visiting earlier) and his death in 1827, and almost every one of them carries a sign. The elderly guardian at the small Beethoven museum in the two- story house at 6 Probusgasse even likes to tell sightseers that the composer changed his Viennese address 79 times in 35 years. At 6 Probusgasse Beethoven wrote his Heiligenstadt Testament during the summer of 1802: ''O ye men who think or say that I am malevolent, stubborn or misanthropic, how greatly do you wrong me.'' The document is named after the neighborhood, then a village, now part of Vienna's 19th district. Heiligenstadt is replete with Beethoven memorabilia - a statue, a marble bust, plaques on quite a number of houses, and such street signs as Eroicagasse and Beethovengang. Beethoven's last address was not in Heiligenstadt but much closer to the city center. A marble tablet on a turn-of-the-century building at 15 Schwarzspanier Strasse, near Vienna University, indicates the spot where once the house stood in which Beethoven died edifyingly on March 26, 1827. It records that the memorial was commissioned by the Rossau Men's Choir, a local choral group. Mozart appears as a Wunderkind in court dress, together with Gluck and Haydn, in one of the well-populated reliefs on the monument to Empress Maria Theresa. Showing the motherly monarch seated on her throne surrounded by the likenesses of outstanding contemporaries, this memorial was erected between the Fine Arts and Natural History Museums in 1888. When the boy wonder, with his sister Nannerl, played the piano at Sch"onbrunn Castle and then climbed on the empress's lap, the Mozarts were still living in Salzburg. Mozart fans may trace the composer's way stations in Vienna, seeking out about two dozen plaques in various districts. A tablet on a graceful Baroque building at 13 Am Hof, the former Collalto Palace, records that Mozart gave his first public concert in the capital there in October 1762, at the age of 6. It adds, a trifle rhetorically, that Vienna was to become his home and his destiny. An inscription, in one of the courtyards of the sprawling Teutonic Order building close to St. Stephen's Cathedral, points out that Mozart, after coming to Vienna for good in 1781, had his first living quarters here. After staying for just six weeks, he moved on to new lodgings - and was soon looking for still others. In one of his many Vienna apartments, a walkup at 3 Domgasse, also near St. Stephen's, he composed ''The Marriage of Figaro.'' Today it houses a Mozart museum with manuscripts and other relics on display. A tablet on a rococo house at 5 Petersplatz, the home of Costanze Weber before she became Mozart's wife, has been temporarily removed because the building is being renovated. Near the back entrance to the Steffl department store, 8 Rauhensteingasse, a plaque states that the house in which Mozart died on Dec. 5, 1791, stood on the site until 1849. Schubert seems never to have enjoyed an apartment of his own during his brief, irregular life. According to a sign, his birthplace was the smoky kitchen of a schoolmaster's simple quarters in a two-story building with a charming little courtyard at 54 Nussdorfer Strasse. The place was restored a few years ago and is today a Schubert museum. A short walk leads to a low-lying neighborhood around the Lichtental parish church where the future composer was baptized and where he played the organ. A tablet at 5 S"aulengasse says that he lived there for many years when he served as an assistant to his father in school. Underneath the plaque, the big lettering on the doorway reads: Schubert Garage. When he was finally on his own, the composer would rely for his housing on the generosity of people who were better off than he was. A sign on a bank at 2 Wipplinger Strasse is typical. It indicates that on the second floor of the narrow building that once rose on the spot Schubert lived for three years with his friend, the poet Johann Mayerhofer. There are several such plaques in various districts. The room where Schubert died in 1828, at 6 Kettenbr"ucken Gasse, can be visited. Haydn was, unlike the other three great composers in the Vienna of his era, a stable tenant. According to a tablet on a stately building at 11 Kohlmarkt (opposite Demel's confectionery shop), he lived there for several years after 1790. The money he earned during his concert tours in England enabled him later to buy a modest house in the Mariahilf suburb, where he remained until his death in 1809. The house, at 19 Haydngasse, is today a museum. Christoph Willibald Gluck, Carl Maria von Weber, Robert Schumann, Johann Strauss, father and son, Franz Liszt, Johannes Brahms, Richard Wagner, Anton Bruckner, Hugo Wolf, Gustav Mahler, Alban Berg, Richard Strauss, Franz Lehar and other composers and musicians who lived or sojourned in Vienna - all have their memorials too, some of them more than one. Then there is the Central Cemetery, which travelers are likely to pass on their way from or to Schwechat Airport. It contains the tombs of Gluck, Beethoven, Brahms, Schubert, Hugo Wolf and other musical greats; Mozart who, because he died in poverty, was buried in a mass grave at the nearby St. Mark's Cemetery - where a marble genius mourns for him - is remembered also by a statue in the Central Cemetery. It is characteristic of the peculiar Viennese atmosphere that a local publishing firm (Jugend und Volk) has just brought out a vade mecum with maps of tombs and biographical sketches of 260 famous personages who are buried in the capital's vast city of the dead. There aren't a great many other cemetery guidebooks anywhere.

1168-> TWO FIFTHS OF BEETHOVEN AND MORE AT L.I. FESTIVAL
Mozart's successor in Viennese esteem and musical history, we all know, was Beethoven - a weightier, sterner figure on the whole, for all his unquestioned warmth and humanity. What could be more natural, then, to wean concertgoers from the idyllic delights of summer and Mostly Mozart and prepare them for the fall season than a brief, bracing Beethoven festival? That isn't precisely the reasoning that guided Theodora Bookman when she began the Friends of the Arts Beethoven Festival in Oyster Bay five years ago, but for whatever reasons, it has prospered. ''I've always had this vision of a Tanglewood on Long Island,'' Miss Bookman said the other day. ''The Coe Estate at Oyster Bay is so gorgeous; the music and the place make a perfect marriage.'' The marriage has reached its fifth anniversary. Its progeny now extend over a summerlong series of occasional concerts, but the main event is still the weekend celebration of Beethoven. It opens tonight at 8 with a recital by Andre-Michel Schub, who will play three of the composer's best- known piano sonatas and the 32 Variations in C minor. Tomorrow (it was inevitable) ''Beethoven's Fifth,'' as this year's festival is called, will be celebrated by Julius Rudel, leading the American Symphony Orchestra in the Fifth Symphony and the Fifth (''Emperor'') Piano Concerto, with Claude Frank as soloist. In Tent or on Lawn Both of these events will take place in the festival tent, near the Hay Barn at Planting Fields Arboretum; you can buy a seat under the tent or, for less, bring a chair or blanket and sit on the lawn outside. (Prices tonight are $8 and $10, with lawn admission $6; tomorrow, $12.50 and $15, with lawn $7.) But much more will be going on. For an $8.50 admission fee, you can wander the grounds from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. tomorrow or Sunday and hear Beethoven wherever you go. The schedule breaks down activities into no fewer than 48 separate performances, including all 16 string quartets performed according to the order in which they were composed. Six ensembles have been assembled for that marathon: the Composers String Quartet will play the last four; the Razumovsky String Quartet will play the Razumovskys (Op. 59); the rest will be shared among the Cremona, Metropolitan and Laurentian String Quartets and the Andiamo Chamber Ensemble. The quartets will be played in the Great Hall; the barn, the banquet hall and the Bea Jones Garden will be the settings for such diverse fare as the ''Eyeglasses'' Duet for viola and cello, several of the piano sonatas, lectures by Mr. Frank and Richard Goode (who will play two sonatas and the Opus 119 Bagatelles) and a fortepiano rendition of the ''Pathetique'' sonata. All You Need to Know The pianist Francisco Aybar will contribute a comic talk, ''Everything You Never Needed to Know About Beethoven,'' and the festival will be concluded at 4:30 on Sunday with an unusual finale. Marjorie Gasmo's ''In the Chamber of Lucid Dreams,'' to the Opus 109 sonata, will be danced; Irish and Scottish songs arranged by Beethoven will be sung, and the actress Viveca Lindfors will read the heart-rending ''Heiligenstadt Testament,'' in which Beethoven first acknowledges and wrestles with his encroaching deafness. ''This is a very moving prospect for me,'' Miss Bookman said, ''because she will be interpreting from experience; she is losing her own hearing.'' A ''Beethoven Passport,'' at $35, buys reserved seats for both concerts and daytime admission for both days. The number for ticket information is (516) 922-0061. By car, the festival can be reached by the Long Island Expressway to Exit 39 North, which becomes Glen Cove Road; continue to Route 25A (Northern Boulevard); turn right, continue to Wolver Hollow Road. Follow Wolver Hollow to Chicken Valley Road; turn right, and Planting Fields Road is about a mile ahead. It leads to the gate.

1170-> SCRUNITY OF POLITICAL FIGURES' SPOUSES INCREASING
Being the wife or husband of a political figure has become more complicated and difficult in recent years as a result of two unrelated phenomena: feminism and the Watergate scandals. One byproduct of feminism has been that increasing numbers of political spouses have careers and financial dealings of their own. One byproduct of the Watergate scandals has been to expose them to far more exacting and intrusive public scrutiny. In several cases in recent days or months, charges of impropriety or worse have centered on the independent or purportedly independent financial dealings of several spouses of public officials. The resulting controversies have led to public discussion of the marital relationships of those involved and, in the case of Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro, the Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate, a public disagreement between a wife and her husband, John A. Zaccaro. Whatever the merits of these controversies, they show how difficult it has become for political wives and husbands to keep their business dealings private in the face of legal and political demands for public disclosure of anything that might involve a conflict of interest. This has been especially galling for political wives and husbands who consider themselves independent professionals. 'Second-Class Citizen' Antoinette Hatfield, a real estate agent who is the wife of Senator Mark O. Hatfield, Republican of Oregon, complained this week that a controversy over some payments she received showed ''the wife of a public figure is a second-class citizen.'' Others say disclosure of the business dealings of political spouses is necessary to expose efforts to use them as a means of channeling favors to public officials. Some of the pressure for financial disclosure is of a legal nature. The Ethics in Government Act of 1978 contains detailed requirements for listing information about the income, holdings, gifts, liabilities and transactions of members of Congress, ranking Federal officials, Federal judges, candidates for President and Vice President and, with narrow exceptions, their spouses. There is also political pressure to disclose more than the law requires. Mr. Zaccaro, for example, has been treated to the spectacle of his wife promising that he would make his tax returns public, then jokingly citing his refusal as an example of the stubborness of Italian men, and finally telling the nation's press that she hoped he would back down. No law requires that he release his tax returns, but the New York real estate entrepreneur's refusal seems to be hurting Representative Ferraro's campaign. Omissions in Disclosures Mrs. Ferraro and Mr. Zaccaro have also been accused by her political adversaries and others of violating Federal financial disclosure laws by omitting his business dealings from her disclosure statements and of misleading the Federal Election Commission when it was investigating loans he made to Mrs. Ferraro's 1978 campaign that he admitted were illegal. For six years Mrs. Ferraro has claimed an exemption from disclosing her husband's holdings, liabilities and transactions on the ground that she had no knowledge of them and expected no benefit from them. This has met with skepticism from independent legal experts as well as political adversaries, in light of her close involvement with her husband's business and finances. Mrs. Ferraro has said she will make additional disclosures Monday, and Mr. Zaccaro is reconsidering his position on his tax returns. Mrs. Hatfield's lament about being a second-class citizen grew out of a public controversy about her receipt of $55,000 from Basil A. Tsakos, a Greek entrepreneur who also obtained the assistance of Senator Hatfield in promoting an oil pipeline across Africa. The Meese Case While the Justice Department is conducting an investigation into Senator Hatfield's relationship with Mr. Tsakos, an independent counsel is conducting another one into the financial dealings and disclosures of Edwin Meese 3d, President Reagan's counselor, and his wife, Ursula. The Meese investigation, now in its fifth month, stemmed from Senate hearings on his nomination by the President to be Attorney General. It was spurred by the disclosure that he had omitted from his financial disclosure statements a $15,000 interest-free loan to Mrs. Meese by Edwin Thomas, a family friend, and related stock purchases. A key issue is whether this was an inadvertent oversight, as Mr. Meese has maintained, or a deliberate falsification, which might make it a crime. Another question is whether there was any connection between the loan and the appointment of Mr. Thomas, his wife and their son to Federal jobs. Representative George Hansen, an Idaho Republican, is appealing a four- count felony conviction in Federal District Court here in April for falsifying his financial disclosure statements by omitting what he said were independent financial transactions by his wife, Connie. He failed to list dealings including more than $100,000 in loans in Mrs. Hansen's name that were made or guaranteed by Nelson Bunker Hunt, a Texas billionaire. Mr. Hansen's main defense was that he and his wife had a legal arrangement to keep their finances separate and had been advised by lawyers that he did not have to list her dealings. Federal prosecutors ridiculed this as a ''phony'' effort to evade the disclosure requirement and said the Hansen- Hunt relationship was suffused with ''the stench of political corruption.'' Full Disclosure Not Required While some officials say the financial disclosure law erodes their privacy so severely as to make public service less attractive, the law stops well short of requiring complete disclosure. Some who are close to the situation say it does not go far enough to bring possible conflicts of interest to light. Senator Hatfield's disclosure statement for 1983, for example, gave no clue that Mr. Tsakos had paid his wife $55,000 about the same time the Senator was promoting Mr. Tsakos' African pipeline. The Senator has said he complied with the law by reporting that his wife had received real estate commissions in excess of $1,000, without naming the sources or amounts. While some political figures run into trouble by disclosing too little of their family's finances, others find there are risks in disclosing too much. Roxanne Conlin, who handily won the Democratic nomination for Governor of Iowa in 1982 with a campaign that stressed her feminist credentials and denunciations of tax shelters that benefit the rich, later yielded to pressure to make her finances public. She disclosed that she and her husband, James, the owner of a real estate investment business, had used tax shelters to reduce their state income tax to zero and their Federal income tax to less than $3,000 for 1981. Their net worth was $2.2 million. Mrs. Conlin's big lead in the polls evaporated. Contributions dried up. Opponents called her a hypocrite. Despite a late rally, she lost the election to Lieut. Gov. Terry Branstad, a Republican.

1171-> Sohio Buyback
The Standard Oil Company (Ohio) said its offer to buy back 11 million of its common shares for $47.50 each had been oversubscribed, with about 22.9 million shares being tendered. Sohio said that since it would buy the stock on a pro-rata basis, preliminary estimates showed the oil company would purchase about 0.48 share for each share tendered. All tenders of odd lots - fewer than 100 shares - will be accepted in full without proration, Sohio said. On the New York Stock Exchange today, Sohio fell $1.50, to $45.25. The company has about 248 million common shares outstanding.

1172-> SCREEN: 'JIGSAW MAN,' BRITISH SPY THRILLER
With bursts of choler and sly wit, Laurence Olivier provides a zesty centerpiece for ''The Jigsaw Man,'' the latest in a long line of British thrillers to trade on spies, moles, double agents, defections, betrayed lovers and the long, cold war between the K.G.B. and M.I.6. For the latest match in this staple of 20th-century entertainment, beginning today at the Rivoli, Gemini and the Coliseum, players of more than ordinary interest have been assembled. Not only is there Mr. Olivier, as Adm. Sir Gerald Scaith, head of the British Secret Services, but there is also Michael Caine, playing Sir Gerald's predecessor, Sir Philip Kimberley, who long ago defected to the Soviet Union. And there are Susan George, as Sir Philip's daughter, and Robert Powell, as her lover - a man who has concealed his true profession from her. On the other side of the camera is Terence Young, who directed such James Bond films as ''Dr. No,'' ''From Russia With Love'' and ''Thunderball.'' This time, Mr. Young is directing a film derived from a novel written by Dorothea Bennett, his wife. The plot, as is customary, is convoluted. Sir Philip, the defector who has become an aging, alcoholic nuisance to the Russians, is given plastic surgery and a new name, whipped into shape and dispatched to Britain to recover a microfilmed list of Soviet agents he hid long before. Certain that the Russians will kill him once he serves their purpose, Sir Philip seeks asylum upon reaching Britain, then escapes the British, demands a huge sum for his microfilm, re-enters his daughter's life and becomes the object of a manhunt by both the British and the Russians. Although the main line of the story is clear enough, truncated subplots involving homosexual lovers, old animosities, off-screen events and peripheral characters occasionally confuse matters in a way that suggests that Mr. Young was trying to preserve too much of his source material. Nevertheless, with so many seasoned professionals involved, ''The Jigsaw Man,'' once it gets going, moves briskly through spy literature's familiar landscape of move and countermove, enlivened by the vigor and variety of Mr. Olivier's performance. ''The Jigsaw Man,'' rated PG, contains some gamy language and the sort of violence common to its genre. Spy Puzzle THE JIGSAW MAN, directed by Terence Young; screenplay by Jo Eisinger; director of photography, Freddie Francis; edited by Peter Hunt, Alan Strachan and Derek Trigg; produced by S. Benjamin Fisz; released by United Film Distribution Company. At the Rivoli, Broadway and 49th Street, Gemini, Second Avenue and 64th Street, and other theaters. Running time: 96 minutes.

1175-> ROOMS WITH A VIEW
PAUL GOLDBERGER is the architecture critic of The New York Times. If the pink stucco fantasy of the Beverly Hills Hotel seems to exemplify Los Angeles and the Victorian brick sumptuousness of Claridge's sums up an ideal sense of London, then the classic New York hotel would have to be a place that stands tall on the skyline, exuding energy and that funny mix of romanticism and business that is the essence of New York. Ideally it should be a skyscraper, though it needn't be, but what would seem absolutely necessary to create the quintessential New York hotel would be something to look at - some views of the city. For New York is, for all its hustle and bustle, a narcissistic city, a place that loves to look at itself. New Yorkers may be gregarious, and surely restaurants and bars in New York hotels are as busy as their counterparts elsewhere - but looking out of a window at the skyline, the park, the streets or the rivers seems every bit as vital a part of the experience of being in a New York hotel. It is rather like sitting by the pool in Beverly Hills or taking tea in the lounge in a hotel in London, a way of reminding yourself that you are there and no place else. Most, but not all, of the city's best hotels offer views, and some of them have outlooks that are equal to the best in the city. While there are no rooms for the night atop the World Trade Center or the Empire State Building, and none at all that climb any higher than the 54 stories of the Helmsley Palace on Madison Avenue, no matter. The views from the Park Lane and the Pierre, the Plaza and the United Nations Plaza are every bit as spectacular. And several hotels, like the Gramercy Park and the new River Hotel, offer a chance at views that can't be had anywhere else except from the windows of private apartments. The classic New York hotel view is that of Central Park - not for nothing is Central Park South the ultimate out-of-towners' street, the avenue of hotels and transients. It is almost evenly divided between hotels and apartment houses, which is a high ratio of hotels indeed, and the hotels share a similar view. It is an outlook that has been on a million postcards and thus borders on cliche; it is as central to the identity of New York as the vista down the Champs-Elysees is to Paris. But like that view in Paris, all thought that this could be a tired and shopworn thing to look at disappears once you are there and the power of the real thing confronts you; in summer the park spreads out like a great green blanket, at once smaller and more imposing than you expect, with the skylines of Central Park West and Fifth Avenue giving it crisp definition. When the weather is clear, Harlem spreads out beyond, and the tensile sweep of the George Washington Bridge beyond that, and then the distant lands of Westchester, New Jersey and Connecticut. It is not just scope that makes this view so interesting, though; it is also intimacy, and drama, and the clarity with which you see the connection between the city and nature. The solid masonry buildings of Central Park West and Fifth Avenue and of Central Park South below your very window frame the park; they do not flatter it by pretending to be rustic like the park, but stand up to it and enclose it in a clear, firm wall. By doing so they seem, ironically, to enhance the miracle of the park, for they remind us constantly of the benign sort of tension that exists between the park and the city. The vista is not precisely the same from hotel to hotel, but almost. The rooms on the north side of the Plaza frame Central Park in the copper frames of the gracious, overscaled double-hung windows of Henry Hardenbergh's incomparable building, and it is not hard, particularly when looking in the direction of Central Park West, to sense for a moment that you are seeing precisely what you might have seen a generation ago, from space that you could have sat within two or three generations ago. The Park Lane Hotel, a few doors to the west, is only 13 years old, brand-new by comparison to the Plaza's 77 years, and its lower ceilings and smaller picture windows subtly change the sense of what you see. From the St. Moritz, the architect Emery Roth's splendid setback building from 1930, the Barbizon-Plaza, the Ritz Carlton and the Marriott Essex House, the mood is something in between, for these are all old buildings that have been extensively renovated and, in most cases, given new and fairly expansive windows. The real difference comes not from one hotel to another, but from one floor to another, for the view is one thing on the 3d or 4th floor, something else on the 15th or 16th, and something else altogether on the 40th. The Park Lane rises to 46 stories, and its upper floors have what is surely the most dazzling view of the park and the uptown skyline, but the view from the lower floors is actually more gratifying. On the fifth or sixth floor you sit in the treetops; from just a few floors above that, the breadth of the park opens up, and yet there is still a sense of intimate connection with the city. From the 46th floor the horse-drawn carriages disappear, and all is sky and distance; from the 15th floor, though, it is possible to have it all - the scope of the park and the city, and the intimacy, too. If there is any truly special accommodation on Central Park South, however, it is not in the grandly scaled rooms of the Plaza or the sky-high boxes of the Park Lane; it is in a pair of suites on the 25th floor of the St. Moritz, one on the northwest corner of the building looking out to the park and the other on the southwest corner looking south on the Avenue of the Americas. Neither suite has the prim good taste of the elegantly redone rooms in the Ritz Carlton; both are in fact a bit dowdy, but each has something glorious enough to make up for anything - sprawling terraces rimmed by stone balustrades that allow you to celebrate the view outdoors. The nature of the view changes slightly once you round the corners off Central Park South. From the Sherry-Netherland Hotel on Fifth Avenue, a slender spire designed by Schultze & Weaver that is one of the most graceful presences on the skyline, the view is diagonally across the park, and the city's grid is set in motion. There are relatively few transient rooms there, however, since the hotel is a mix of cooperative apartments and hotel accommodations; the same situation prevails just north of the Sherry-Netherland at the Pierre, and most of the Pierre's rooms are on the north side, blocked in part by the yellow-brick mass of the recent apartment house at 800 Fifth Avenue, but from here and there lovely slices of vista appear. The Mayflower on Central Park West and 61st Street reverses the view, and turns it diagonally to the northeast; though the exterior of this hotel has been mauled by the unconscionable removal of its facade ornament, the interior remains comfortable. There are only a couple of hotels uptown with views of note. The American Stanhope on Fifth Avenue at 81st Street, surrounded not by other hotels but by apartment buildings and the Metropolitan Museum, has several rooms that look directly into Central Park, and a stretched neck can earn a glimpse south to the whole midtown skyline. The Carlyle at 76th Street and Madison Avenue, like the Pierre and the Sherry-Netherland, is a mix of apartments and hotel rooms, and most of the best views high in the tower go to permanent residents, but there are some rooms and suites that are exceptions and offer slices of the park. A budget view can be had at the Excelsior on 81st Street off Central Park West; the upper-floor rooms here look over the American Museum of Natural History and the Hayden Planetarium to the park and midtown. In midtown itself, the views are never quite as sweeping, but there is a trade-off. From the upper floors of the Parker Meridien on 56th Street between the Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue there are views of midtown skyscrapers so close you feel you could reach out and touch the building-tops, and the very high floors here look over the neighboring buildings and over Central Park South to Central Park itself. The Waldorf-Astoria, the romantic twin- towered skyscraper by Schultze & Weaver that is one of the city's great triumphs of Art Deco, has some unexpected and really quite dazzling views up and down Park Avenue from its corner rooms on low and middle floors; the movement of the traffic is like a silent river flowing far below, and it is surprisingly relaxing. From the upper floors of the Waldorf, there are glimpses right into skyscraper tops, as there are from the Helmsley Palace - the 54-story hotel squeezed six years ago behind McKim, Mead & White's great Villard Houses, the grouping that now serves as the hotel's entrance. The Helmsley Palace is as banal a tower as New York has seen, but the rooms within are well-appointed, and the views, considering how close the hotel is to neighboring towers, are open and exciting. From the high floors there is a sweep of distance, and from all floors facing west, the view is right into the back of St. Patrick's Cathedral and on toward Rockefeller Center. Here, as at Central Park, the view from the lower floors is more subtle; you feel balanced delicately atop the ornament of James Renwick's Gothic cathedral. But the best midtown views are surely those from the United Nations Plaza Hotel at 44th Street and First Avenue - itself one of the city's most distinguished postwar skyscrapers. Originally completed in 1976, the hotel has just constructed a second tower to complete the composition of the architect, Kevin Roche, and the views of river and city are sweeping and open. It is really the best of all worlds here; the views extend on one side out across the East River to Brooklyn and Queens, and on the other to midtown. At First Avenue, the hotel is just far enough away to make it possible to view midtown all of a piece, but just close enough to make the towers in the foreground, like the Chrysler Building, loom up like great sculptures. There is one line of suites in the new tower that have triangular living rooms that face southeast, south and west, with a view that swings across 180 degrees. And then there are the views that are not quite as classic, but equally special to New York. From the Gramercy Park Hotel at the foot of Lexington Avenue, the rooms on the south side look into the gracious and gentle square that is Gramercy Park, Manhattan's celebrated private park, and from the upper floors look over the park to lower Manhattan. From the Vista International Hotel at the World Trade Center, there are partial views of lower Manhattan and the Hudson River, now increasingly being blocked by the construction of the adjacent World Financial Center at Battery Park City - no little spectacle in itself. For unobstructed views of the Hudson River, there is the new River Hotel at the corner of West and Christopher Streets, a small and rather precious renovation in a style one might best describe as Post-Modern Purple. (The neighborhood is not the average hotel territory: it has numerous homosexual bars.) But from some of the rooms, and from the top, sixth-floor restaurant, Le Grand Corniche, which has an outside terrace next to an upper-level bar, the view of the Hudson, the piers and the coastline of that state on the other side can be enough to make up for it.

1177-> CAMPAIGN NOTES; Hispanic Voters Protest Bilingual Voter Aid Rules
A sharp cut in the number of counties required to provide bilingual voter assistance will disenfranchise thousands of Hispanic and other minority voters, Democratic Congressmen and civil rights groups asserted Friday. The Census Bureau said that 208 of the 384 counties and political subdivisions where aid to bilingual voters was previously required would no longer be covered, although all of Texas and most of Arizona will still be covered. Twenty-one new counties will also be covered. The rules for assistance for bilingual voters were amended by Congress in 1982 to make it available only in areas where it is needed. The Justice Department has issued a revised list of eligible areas. Many of the counties no longer covered have large numbers of Democratic Hispanic voters, according to Charles Kamasaki of the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic organization, while Republican districts in Florida are still covered, he said.

1181-> BUSINESS DIGEST SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 1984
The Economy Morgan Guaranty cut its prime rate to 12 3/4 percent from 13, the first decline in the key lending rate since February 1983. No major bank followed but they are expected to do so soon, based on the assumption that the Fed has eased its monetary policy. (Page 1.) The Federal Reserve Bank of New York named E. Gerald Corrigan as president, replacing Anthony M. Solomon, who is retiring. Mr. Corrigan, who has been president of the Minneapolis Fed, is considered an expert in regulation of domestic financial markets, but has somewhat less experience in international financial affairs. (39.) Mr. Corrigan is known as both a protege and confidant of the Fed's chairman, Paul A. Volcker. (39.) The Consumer Price Index jumped 0.5 percent in August, more than twice the average gain of the preceding three months, largely because of food and housing.

1182-> U.N. Extends Mandate Of Troops in Lebanon
The Security Council voted today to extend the mandate of the United Nations force in southern Lebanon for six months amid suggestions that it might be expanded after Israeli troops are withdrawn. The extension of the mandate was approved 13 to 0 with the Soviet Union and the Ukraine abstaining. A total of 5,683 soldiers and administrative personnel from 10 nations are in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, which was established in 1978 as a buffer between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization. Fouad Turk, Secretary General of the Lebanese Foreign Ministry, said a report by Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar contained ''encouraging indications of a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanese territory'' once security arrangements are established at the Israeli-Lebanese border.

1183-> SHRIVER AND GARRISON GAIN
For Pam Shriver and Zina Garrison, it was a day to recall the frustrations of youth. Now 22 years old, and the world's fourth-ranked player, Miss Shriver remembered all too vividly how difficult it was to face the top players without crumbling under the pressure as she easily defeated 17-year-old Camille Benjamin, 6-1, 6-2, in just 44 minutes this afternoon. The victory advanced her to the semifinals of the $150,000 United Jersey Bank Classic. Miss Benjamin, who reached the semifinals of the French Open earlier this year, failed to win a point in the first three games. From there, it was more of a battle against herself than it was with Miss Shriver, who was content to keep the ball in play and wait for her flustered foe to commit mistakes. ''When she gets like that she's got to learn to take her time,'' said Miss Shriver, who won despite severe soreness in her elbow. ''That's the time when you stop and take a few breaths. But today, what she did suited me just fine.'' The opponent for Miss Shriver on Saturday will be Miss Garrison, who recalled numerous losses to Bonnie Gadusek during their meetings as junior players and one match on the pro tour last year. Today the losses were avenged as Miss Garrison, who has been firmly entrentched among the top 10 for more than a year, defeated her nemisis for the first time. The score was 6-2, 6-2. ''I never could beat her for anything,'' said Miss Garrison, the fourth-seeded player here. ''Sometimes a player can psych you like that and you don't play against them like you're supposed to. This was good for me.'' The other semifinal will pit the top- seeded Martina Navratilova against 13th-seeded Pam Casale of nearby Fairfield, N.J., who scored an upset over third-seeded Manuela Maleeva, 2-6, 6-3, 6-2. The victory highlighted what the 20-year-old Miss Casale said was the best two weeks of her career. Last week she reached the semifinals of the United States clay-court championships, then lost to Lisa Bonder. Miss Navratilova led the hard-serving Barbara Potter by only 4 games to 3 before winning 7 straight games and taking the match, 6-3, 6-1, with one of her most impressive performances of the tournament. Miss Potter lost for the 13th time without a victory to the world's most dominant player. For Miss Navratilova, it was her 46th consecutive match triumph over all.

1184-> SCOTUING; McGee's Chance
A year ago, during the National Basketball Association playoffs, Mike McGee of the Los Angeles Lakers sat on the bench a lot. He was the fourth guard, behind Earvin (Magic) Johnson, Norm Nixon and Mike Cooper. Playing in six of the Lakers' 15 games, he scored 12 points. This year, with Nixon having been traded to San Diego and Cooper playing mostly at forward, McGee has been a starter in all eight playoff games. He is the team's third-leading scorer and topped the team with 27 points in the victory that clinched the Western Conference semifinal series over Dallas on Tuesday night. During the season, the 6-foot 5-inch guard from Michigan was third in the league in field-goal accuracy with .594, surprisingly high for a backcourt man. ''I get a lot of my points from close to the basket,'' he said yesterday. ''I score a lot after steals or fast breaks. And the coach runs a lot of plays that wind up with me driving to the hoop.'' And speaking of Coach Pat Riley, McGee said, ''He has also told me to take 3-point shots when I'm open. They have been going in for me, so I'm not about to stop. I'm not looking to score a lot, but good opportunities are coming to me.'' McGee has connected on 4 of 11 3-point attempts. Those have helped him to the 17.1 playoff scoring average, almost double his 9.8 figure for the regular season. ''For the first two years when I was here, there were a lot of good guards ahead of me - Magic, Nixon, Eddie Jordan and Cooper. I just worked hard and waited for my chance. ''I can't wait for the next game. I want to play. I've had enough sitting down.''

1185-> No Headline
Strings on F.B.I. Stings Beneath the bicker of their majority and dissenting reports, Democrats and Republicans on the House Civil Rights subcommittee reach an important consensus about Government ''sting'' enterprises: They can be useful tools in fighting crime but need much closer supervision. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, having shunned undercover work during J. Edgar Hoover's 48-year reign, has become much more willing to launch enterprises that masquerade as rackets in order to catch criminals. The well-known Abscam snared seven former members of Congress but it was faulted by a special Senate committee last year for loose management and excessive reliance on cooperating criminals. Other stings were less successful and raised still more questions. One glaring example is Operation Corkscrew, in which agents tried for five years to demonstrate corruption on Cleveland's municipal bench. While a joint F.B.I.-Justice Department review committee nodded, a crooked bailiff hoodwinked agents into thinking he was bribing judges to fix cases; in fact, he was pocketing the F.B.I. bribe money. That debacle occurred because the bureau ignored its own rules requiring a basis for going after the judges and tests to see that the investigation was proceeding as planned. In Operation Colcor, agents lost all perspective in pursuing political corruption in North Carolina's Columbus County. They posed as promoters of a new restaurant, proposed a referendum to sell liquor by the drink in that dry county and passed cash to the local political boss. The referendum passed but was set aside when state officials discovered it was an F.B.I. initiative. A few convictions were obtained, but at a great price. How can such excesses be curbed? Democrats on the House committee want Congress to require a court order, akin to a search warrant, before anyone is targeted for a sting operation. But Republicans agreed with a unanimous Senate committee's judgment last year that truly rigorous monitoring by the Justice Department could be much more effective than a cursory judicial review of these complex undertakings. That idea is worth testing. House Republicans would make the internal review mandatory and require Civil Rights and Civil Division attorneys among the monitors. They also want Congress to monitor this undercover work, especially the performance of the review committee. If that fails, there will be time enough to re-examine the warrant idea. Meanwhile, there's enough agreement to write some constructive legislation.

1186-> POP/JAZZ; BUSTER POINDEXTER, A FAMILIAR FACE AT TRAMPS
The urbane vocalist who was perched on a barstool at Tramps the other day, dressed in the tuxedo and black bow tie that are regulation garb for saloon singers, looked familiar. Long, long ago, in the early 1970's, he made his professional singing debut as the lead vocalist for the legendary and somewhat infamous New York Dolls, the progenitors of punk rock. His later rock career as a solo artist is a matter of public record. To rock aficionados that singer is David Johansen. But this new person, with his slickly oiled hair and a repertory of songs associated with Fats Waller, Bessie Smith and Wynonie Harris, calls himself Buster Poindexter. ''It all started because there wasn't anything to do around here on Monday nights,'' the pseudonymous Mr. Poindexter recalled between sets. ''When I was on the road touring, as David Johansen, of course, I would occasionally bring a couple of guys from my band down to the Holiday Inn lounges and ask if we could do a couple of songs, and the whole thing kind of grew from there. It was originally just a way to do fun songs, songs I like, songs for adults . ''I live just a couple of blocks from Tramps,'' Mr. Johansen explained, ''and Monday nights were always slow in here. So about a year ago I got together with Joe Delia, who plays keyboards in my rock band, and we worked up some songs. People seemed to like it, so we started doing two nights a week, and finally we started playing here on weekends.'' New Album Due People do seem to like Buster Poindexter, and his weekend shows are usually crowded. He will be performing at the club tonight and tomorrow night and over the next two weekends. Then he will go on tour with his rock band to promote ''Sweet Revenge,'' a new David Johansen album, to be released next month. The number to call for details and reservations for Buster Poindexter's last stand - for a while, anyway - is 777-5077. Tramps is at 125 East 15th Street, just east of Irving Place. ''Originally,'' Mr. Johansen noted, ''the Poindexter show was more ballad-oriented. We did a song I liked from a Chet Baker album, 'Deep in a Dream,' and 'Theme From ''The Valley of the Dolls.'' ' But more recently, we've been pandering to the masses by doing more songs with a beat. Some of the early rhythm-and-blues things we do, like the songs Leiber and Stoller wrote for the Coasters, I also do as Johansen. They go over with the rock-and-roll crowd, but songs like 'Life Is Just a Bowl of Cherries' wouldn't do.'' Some of the songs Buster Poindexter sang last weekend at Tramps were a bit bizarre. There were a cheery calypso called ''Everybody's Going Cannibal''; the period piece ''Blonde on a Bum Trip,'' and the strangest song ever recorded by the celebrated New Orleans pianist, Professor Longhair, ''Her Mind Is Gone.'' But strangest of all was a cocktail lounge rhumba that began, ''Don't change your basic patterns, as weird as they may be . . . '' After the show, the singer obligingly explained, ''I learned that one from an album called 'Songs of Couch and Consultation' by Katy Lee. I'm thinking about doing more of her stuff. She wrote songs about various complexes, phobias and the like.'' Brash and Joyful The band that accompanies Buster Poindexter is considerably more coherent than some of the lyrics he sings. It swings in a brash, joyful fashion that recalls Louis Jordan's Tympany Five, without a trace of the self-consciousness that other rock singers have brought to revivals of jump music and jive from the 1930's and 40's. The band's adept drummer, Tony Machine, was once a roadie for the New York Dolls and later played drums for Mr. Johansen. Tony Garnier, on string bass, was an original member of the Western string band Asleep at the Wheel. Brian Koonin, the guitarist, is often heard in the pit orchestras of Broadway shows. Joe Delia, the pianist, plays with both Poindexter and Johansen and is co- producer of the ''Sweet Revenge'' album. Mr. Johansen has always had a comic streak, a gift for mugging and mime and an old showman's sense of timing. Working close to the seated audience at Tramps allows him to explore this side of his performing personality with delightful results. The shows also provide a broader view of his vocal talents than any of his rock albums have managed to do. He is thinking of making a Buster Poindexter album, but has no firm plans yet. ''I have to try to figure out how much confusion will result if I get two careers going under different names,'' Mr. Johansen reflected. ''Buster just started out as a kind of alter ego; I don't want to carry this thing too far.'' He paused a moment. ''But it might be really great,'' he added, ''to go on the road as Johansen and have Buster Poindexter open for me.''

1187-> DANCE: WORKSHOP OF 4 CHOREOGRAPHERS
What did you do last summer?'' Ask that question of Ellen Cornfield, Victoria Marks, Bill De Young and David Dorfman, and they might reply that they had choreographed the dances they offered Thursday night in the Theater of the Riverside Church. They did so while in residence at the Yard, an arts colony on Martha's Vineyard that, under Patricia N. Nanon's direction, has provided dancers with rehearsal space since 1973. In recent years, choreographers associated with the Yard have also been able to show the works they created there at the Riverside Church. Workshops allow artists to try out ideas and even to do some creative fumbling. Therefore it was not surprising that, while Thursday's program was ambitious, it was also choreographically uneven. The most consistently interesting piece was Miss Cornfield's ''timeoverlapse,'' a series of meetings and partings to electronic music by Takehisa Kosugi. The meetings often involved embraces. Yet odd changes of movement quality prevented the work from being a romantic idyll. There were hunchings and staggers, coy poses resembling those of fashion models, jerky robotlike steps and hesitant inchings forward. If it was unclear why the dancers were never allowed to move in a free-and-easy manner, one remained curious about what they would do next. Whereas emotional problems were implicit in ''timeoverlapse,'' they were the very point of Mr. De Young's ''Thief of Souls,'' which concerned a portrait painter romantically attracted to both the men and the women she painted. Once the basic situation was established, one never learned much more about the heroine or the people she loved. But the feverish choreography and the sighing taped score by Ingraham Marshal gave the work dramatic intensity. Like Miss Cornfield's dance, the works of Miss Marks and Mr. Dorfman were plotless yet filled with dramatically evocative gestures. Although many young choreographers are now experimenting productively with dances of this kind, such works can pose problems. Their emotionally charged sequences can become too strong to serve merely as elements in a formal design; yet they may not seem to have any motivation or lead to any convincing resolution. Set to a score by Gerry Hemingway that combined accordion music with taped sounds, Miss Marks's ''Anatomy of a Triangle: Constellations'' began with two lovers in a wistful pose. Then members of a cast of six entered vigorously, sometimes appearing to be friends and at other times to be rivals. The work closed with another wistful pose, this one for the entire cast. But one could never be sure to what extent this study in energy was also intended to be an exploration of human relationships. Mr. Dorfman's ''Grounded'' prompted similar worries. To almost compulsively rhythmic taped music by Peter Wetzler and the Orchestre Jazira, dancers contrasted frantic activity with poses and facial expressions suggesting stolidity or even feebleness. Such extreme contrasts made ''Grounded'' striking. Nevertheless, one kept wondering why Mr. Dorfman had chosen to emphasize these particular states of being.

1188-> POP: BARBARA RANKIN SINGS
Barbara Rankin embodies a very traditional image of the supper club chanteuse. With her ripe, sultry soprano, stability of pitch and an appealingly direct delivery well-suited to simple pop ballads, she suggests a composite of several early-1960's nightclub performers. That image is underscored by a carefully varied repertory that runs from Cole Porter and Irving Berlin medleys to smatterings of contemporary Nashville and Los Angeles pop-funk. Miss Rankin, who is appearing at Freddy's Supper Club through Oct. 6, is backed by an able quartet led by her musical director and keyboardist, Michael Abene. The ensemble's relaxed, sophisticated arrangements complement a polished delivery that caresses uncomplicated, heartfelt ballads like the 1940's standard ''My Heart Tells Me'' and a bilingual version of ''Song on the Sand,'' from ''La Cage aux Folles.'' But there are times when Miss Rankin's smoothness tends toward the bland. Lacking a strong interpretive personality, she lets the subtleties of Stephen Sondheim's ''Everybody Says Don't'' pass her by. And her rushed deliveries of the set's wordier, more sharply syncopated numbers reveal a singer more attuned to pop ballads than to anything resembling jazz.

1189-> SCREEN: DUTCH 'SILENCE'
''A Question of Silence'' was shown as part of 1983's New Directors/New Films Series. Following are excerpts from Janet Maslin's review, which appeared in The New York Times on March 18, 1983. The film opens today at the Waverly Theater, Avenue of the Americas and Third Street. The feminist cause will not be well-served by ''A Question of Silence,'' a Dutch film that tells of three women who stomp, kick and pummel to death a male shopkeeper. The incident is triggered when one of the women tries furtively to steal some merchandise. The manager sees her and is all set to chastise her, when two other female patrons, who don't know the first woman and don't know the manager either, defiantly pocket some merchandise to show her their solidarity. At this, the manager breaks into a cold sweat, and no wonder. Moments afterward, he is beaten to a pulp. Why? Well, apparently because he is a man, and the three shoppers have all been ill-treated by other men they know. ''Do you think there are people who won't think you are mad?'' asks the female psychiatrist who has been appointed to study this case, and from whose point of view the film is presented. ''Yes,'' says one of the accused. ''Women'' Sure enough, female spectators in the courtroom where this case is eventually tried greet the women's testimony with applause. ''A Question of Silence,'' which was written and directed by Marleen Gorris, may not be part of any commonplace genre. But that doesn't keep it from being predictable. The three suspects themselves, who are described more than once as ''ordinary'' women, are a beleaguered mother, a nice, middle-aged woman who likes to knit, and a seretary who resents her boss. The psychiatrist, who is first shown to be very happy with her husband, grows to hate him during the course of the story, and finds herself attracted to the most bold and outspoken of her patients. On her desk, she prominently displays a book by Doris Lessing. The Cast A QUESTION OF SILENCE (''De Stilte Rond Christine M.''). written and directed by Marleen Gorris (Dutch with English subtitles); camera by Frans Bromet; edited by Hans van Donogen; music by Lodewijk de Boer; produced by Mathijs van Heijningen, Sigma Films; a Quartet Films release.

1190-> Brown Tops Princeton
Behind the passing of the quarterback Steve Kettelberger, Brown scored touchdowns on each of its three possessions in the third quarter today and then held off a fourth-quarter Princeton rally to gain a 32-30 Ivy League victory. It was the first time the Bruins have beaten Princeton since 1980. The Bruins are now 2-0 in the Ivy League; their only loss was in a 34-14 nonconference game with Rhode Island. Princeton is 1-1 in the league, having beaten Cornell. The Tigers defeated Bucknell in nonleague play. Kettelberger threw two scoring passes in Brown's big third period and the Bruin defense blunted the effectiveness of Doug Butler, the talented Princeton quarterback. Butler drove the Tigers for two fourth-quarter scores after Brown's lead had reached 32-17. After Princeton failed to cover an onside kick after its last touchdown with 3:16 remaining, Brown ran out the clock. Brown's third-quarter touchdowns came on a 12-yard pass from Kettelberger to the fullback Steve Heffernan; Heffernan's 3-yard sweep and Kettelberg's 9-yard throw to the wide receiver Brad McCaulley. Chris Ingerslev made one point after conversion, missed another and the Bruins also failed on a 2-point attempt after the third touchdown. The game began with Brown withstanding several Princeton surges in the opening 12 minutes before using a 68-yard drive of its own to score. Heffernan scored on a 14-yard counterplay over left tackle. Ingerslev converted for Brown's early 7-0 lead. The Tigers responded with a 76- yard drive and a touchdown on Butler's 23-yard touchdown pass to the split end Derek Graham. Mike Miskovsky tied the score at 7-7.

1191-> BRAZILLIAN POTPOURRI
CRAIG CLAIBORNE is food editor of The New York Times. It has always been my belief that if you want to experience the true, unadulterated flavor of one dish or another, you must eat it in the region or state or nation of its origin, be it the Creole crawfish of Louisiana, the bouillabaisse of Marseilles or the pigeon pie of North Africa. That is why, one day almost a quarter of a century ago, I found myself on a plane for Brazil. My destination was not Rio, but rather Sao Paulo, which, I had been told, is the gastronomic capital of Brazil, much as Lyons, and not Paris, is considered the gastronomic capital of France. I was on my way to sample on native soil a dish called feijoada, which had been dazzlingly good to my taste when I was offered it in the New York apartment of a friend. I was also eager to travel to Salvador, the capital of the Brazilian state of Bahia, to sample the strongly African-influenced dishes of that region. Both forays were memorable, and long remembered. When I returned to Sao Paulo a short while ago to relive the pleasures of two decades past, I got in touch with Paulo Cotrim, a local food and restaurant critic. We met for lunch - feijoada is traditionally a dish served for lunch on Saturday, although some establishments also serve it at midday on Wednesday - at a large, convivial restaurant called Massimo- Alameda Park, which is considered by many to be the finest feijoada restaurant in town. Mr. Cotrim and I paused at the restaurant's bar, where we were offered a choice between what seemed to be the two favored drinks that traditionally precede a feijoada: a caipirinha, a powerfully good and powerfully strong concoction made with crushed limes, sugar and ice, heavily anointed with a distillate of sugar cane called cacha,ca, or a batida, a subtle and stimulating beverage made with fruit juices, rum, sugar and ice. (I found the caipirinha more to my taste; it tickled the palate and prepared the mouth for what was ahead.) Then we were escorted into the dining room. Massimo's is a restaurant of considerable dimensions, but it also has considerable charm; its garden-like atmosphere is both casual and festive. At table, we were offered an assortment of excellent appetizers - small turnovers filled with meat and cheese; deep-fried crab claws served with a puree of avocados; thinly sliced dried beef and a fine batch of miniature cream puff pastry shells filled with chopped olives and fresh heart of palm. As we sipped our drinks, Mr. Cotrim told me that, according to legend, feijoada is a child of Brazilian slavery. The wealthy slave owners lived in fine mansions; the blacks in slave quarters. The owners dined on the best cuts of meat; the less choice bits - such items as pig's ears, feet and tails and spareribs - and the leftovers were taken home by the cooks, to be blended with black beans and kale, both despised by the whites. The dish has evolved into an elaborate stew made with black beans and assorted meats, some of them smoked, including smoked tongue and Portuguese sausages. It is most often compared to the cassoulet of France, but I find this an understatement. To my taste, feijoada may not be more refined, but it is more subtle, more complex in its flavors and textures and more imaginative. Cassoulet champions will take strong issue with me, but I find the black beans of a feijoada richer and more seductive in flavor than the white beans of a cassoulet. The beans are served in a kettle or casserole (or ideally an earthenware pot), the meats are sliced and set out separately on hot platters, and the ceremony begins. The Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos once paid tribute to the dish in a musical essay composed in a hostess's guestbook. The composition was entitled ''Fugue Without End'' and was described by the composer as ''a feijoada set to music.'' The piece was, as any good feijoada should be, in four parts: ''Farina,'' ''Meat,'' ''Rice'' and ''Black Beans.'' Not to labor a point, but Villa-Lobos had the right idea. The composition of a perfect feijoada is symphonic. To the basic blend of beans and meat the guest may help himself to such garnishes as shredded cooked kale or collard greens, sliced oranges, a spicy and delectable onion sauce, an assortment of small pickled hot peppers and farofa. The latter, a finely ground meal made from the dried root of the manioc or cassava plant, is a staple of the Brazilian table. Its appeal is subtle, bland and undeniable. The desserts of Brazil are remarkably varied, remarkably good and remarkably rich. The most outstanding, to my taste, is a celestial, cholesterol-based offering, deep daffodil in color, called quindin. It is a pudding-like affair made with egg yolks, grated coconut, sugar, butter and not much else. There is an equally deadly dessert called fios de ovos (threads of egg yolks) in which more yolks are cooked in a syrup and piped out in thin threads to form a nest, as well as egg and coconut flans and so on. I gave a brief and appreciative sampling to those egg-yolk and coconut-milk custards, but I mainly settled for an array of less calorific desserts, four exceptionally smooth sherbets - one made with fresh watermelon juice, another with pear, a third with mango and a fourth with coconut milk. On my sentimental, but ever so brief, return to Salvador, Bahia, I idled for two hours or so over dinner at Casa de Gamboa, where I had first experienced the subtleties of Afro- Brazilian cuisine. It was there that I first indulged in vatapa, a creamy paste of ineffable goodness made with dried shrimp and red palm oil, dried ground shrimp, peanuts and cashews - the sort of side dish that becomes a major and gratifying factor of a meal. There, too, I tasted the tantalizing dish called xin xin de galinha, chicken cut into small pieces and cooked in oil with onions, garlic, tomato and green peppers and spiked with fresh coriander. The vatapa is blended with the xin xin, and a touch of red palm oil is added for both color and flavor. The result is a masterpiece; my second meal of these dishes, more than two decades after I had originally sampled them, was in no way inferior to the first. Casa de Gamboa is a neat, open, casual establishment whose windows - at least in the room of my choice - open onto a glorious expanse of shining sea. The personnel speak very little English, but the menu is printed in both English and Portuguese. The specialties are many and varied, with a certain emphasis on fish and seafood. Most of the dishes - like the vatapa and xin xin - are a lively yellow color derived from the red palm oil used in their cooking; here again you will find an ample supply of farofa, to be sprinkled onto the foods as desired. There is, of course, far more to the cooking of Bahia than the xin xin and vatapa, and if you ever visit that northern state I would encourage you to try, as well, moqueca of crab, shrimp or other seafood, which is shelled and cooked with tomatoes, green peppers and onions, together with coconut milk and red palm oil, and caruru, a delectable dish of okra with shrimp and fresh coriander. I must add that the cost of dining in Brazilian restaurants is relatively small. A feijoada completa costs about $7 a person, a xin xin de galinha about $3.50 and a lobster moqueca about $11. The beverage of choice, especially with feijoada, is a well- chilled bottle of a good Brazilian beer. Brazilian Feasting Feijoada The following Sao Paulo establishments serve feijoada for lunch on Saturday: MASSIMO ALAMEDA-PARK , Santos 1826 (telephone: 284-0311). SOLARIUM , Caesar Park Hotel, Rua Augusta 1508 (285- 6622). PADDOCK , Avenida Faria Lima 1541 (814-3582), and Avenida Sao Luiz 258 (257-4768). LONDON TAVERN , Sao Paulo Hilton, Avenida Ipiranga 165 (256-0033), where feijoada is also served at lunch on Wednesday. TAMBOUILLE , Avenida Cidade Jardim 425, in the residential neighborhood called Jardim Europa (852- 1371). Bahian Style CASA DA GAMBOA , Rua Newton Prado 51, Gamboa de Cima, Salvador (245-9777), specializes in typically Bahian dishes; the restaurant, in a century-old townhouse overlooking the bay, is closed Sundays.

1192-> MUSIC: MONTREAL SYMPHONY AT CARNEGIE HALL
TIM PAGE FOR nearly a century, Carnegie Hall has served as New York's quintessential showcase for cultural activity; however, it is only when a world-class orchestra plays upon its stage that one recalls what an acoustic miracle the auditorium really is. On such occasions, every detail, from the piping of the piccolo to the roar of the tympani, resounds with translucent clarity - to mix a metaphor or two, one hears both the forest and the trees. On Saturday night, the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, under the direction of Charles Dutoit, filled Carnegie Hall with music by Maurice Ravel, Serge Prokofiev and Hector Berlioz. The program opened with Ravel's ''Rapsodie espagnole,'' which is a charming and colorful early work but, for all of its castanets and bullfight trumpets, about as Latin as ''La vie en rose.'' Mr. Dutoit well understands the expressive possibilities of silence - the simple negation of sound - and built the music tabula rasa , block by sonic block, imbuing every shimmer, every melodic fragment with monolithic import. Rather than wash the listener with a vast spray of sound, Mr. Dutoit seemed more interested in drawing attention to Ravel's myriad of minute details; under his direction, the Montrealers delivered a performance of glittering immediacy. Serge Prokofiev's Piano Concerto No. 3 in C combines a hard, hyperactive muscularity with swooning romanticism; Martha Argerich, who essayed the solo part Saturday night, delivered a lunging, impulsive performance of exhiliarating intensity. Miss Argerich plays with staggering power; the piano easily dominated the large orchestra. Hers was, in many ways, an odd performance; she opted for a blaring, steely sound that would destroy most of the music in the piano literature, but which seemed, for the most part, entirely appropriate to the motoric Modernist insistency of this concerto. The introverted passages of the finale came off least well; while there was beauty to Miss Argerich's playing, it was a strong, harsh beauty, and the ecstatic glissandos that must literally melt over the string section were unconvincing. In addition, the sense of frenetic urgency that made her playing so exciting occasionally backfired; a premature entrance in the last movement momentarily disoriented the orchestra which, however, immediately recovered. But this was a riveting performance, and Miss Argerich deserved the lengthy standing ovation she recieved after it was over. Hector Berlioz's ''Symphonie fantastique'' closed the evening. The premiere difficulty that faces any conductor who attempts Berlioz's music is how to reconcile the composer's wild-eyed romanticism with his paradoxical bent toward Classical serenity; anyone who highlights yin at the expense of yang can only hope to reveal one facet of a complex creator. On Saturday, Mr. Dutoit made a creditable stab at a blend, although, in truth, he let the demonic side of Berlioz's nature gain the upper hand. Still, this was a bracing, if unsettled, performance; the ''Marche au supplice'' was full of gothic horror, while the composer's setting of Gregorian chant rang out with humbling authority in the closing ''Witches Sabbath.'' For the most part, the Montreal Symphony played with spirited precision, and some excellent first-chair artists were given the opportunity to demonstrate their skills. Passage work was essayed with confidence and collegial team spirit. The members of the orchestra work well together, without any effort at upstaging their fellow players, although tutti crescendos had a tendency to be somewhat ragged and unrestrained. Mr. Dutoit is a demonstrative conductor; his gestures economical, yet charged with dramatic intent. At times he resembled a sonic surfer, riding waves of tone, contorting his body now to the right, now to the left, as if to gauge the music's oceanic currents and maintain a balance. It made for interesting theater and seemed to inspire valid performances from his forces.

1193-> SPORTS OF THE TIMES; LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION
The Islanders and the Oilers stuck to hockey last night and avoided the operatic death scenes that marred last year's Stanley Cup finals. They staged a taut opening game, with Grant Fuhr saving the Oilers for two periods and Kevin McClelland's goal beating the Islanders, 1-0. Last year's final round between Edmonton and New York was marked by some of the worst acting ever seen in organized sport. Players lashed around in mock agony that would have been cut from the shabbiest of spaghetti westerns or grade C gangster films. With any luck at all, Billy Smith, the Islanders' goalie, who won the Conn Smythe Trophy as last year's Stanley Cup star, may have taken a few tips from a former actor he visited in Washington after the playoffs. And Edmonton's Glenn Anderson and Wayne Gretzky also need tips from theater people about how to appeal for sympathy. Last night, Smith was hit by Anderson in the second period and lay on the ice for a while, but no accusations followed. Also, Mike Bossy slammed into the boards, but no blame was assessed. Before the game, the referee, Andy van Hellemond, warned both captains to cut out both the fighting and the faking. In last year's final round, it may be remembered, Anderson took a stick in the leg from Smith, hard enough to gain a two-minute penalty against Smith but not the lifetime imprisonment demanded by the Oilers' coach, Glen Sather. Anderson should have imitated his friend, the actress Patty (''Evita'') Lupone, and sung a rousing chorus of ''Don't Cry for Me, Argentina'' while lying stricken on the ice. A touch of gallantry under duress might have hardened the referee's heart toward Smith. On the other hand, Gretzky was guilty of overacting in the second game, when he took an ordinary slash to the thigh pad from Smith and hit the ice like a popped balloon. ''Anybody else in the league wouldn't have gone down,'' said Wally Harris, the referee, who nevertheless penalized Smith five minutes for slashing. Smith outdid Gretzky minutes later when Dave Lumley tried to insert his stick between Smith's mask and chest protector, like a master shucker in a New Orleans oyster bar. Smith fell backward into the net, arms and legs akimbo, like Jimmy Cagney or Edward G. Robinson taking a fusillade of bullets and being propelled against church doors or fancy limousines in their death throes. For his histrionics, Smith was called Mr. Obnoxious, Jack the Ripper and ''a creep'' - and those were from the news articles in Edmonton, not the editorials. When the show moved to Long Island, Smith displayed a new move late in the fourth game after Anderson sought revenge with a stick in Smith's mask. These modern masks are unbreakable, but Smith acted as if his mask were as flimsy as a paper grief mask worn in an Elizabethan tragedy. Smith fell to the ice, writhing in pain, or at least in sympathy for the paint job on his hard-shell mask. He did not recover until he heard the comforting shriek of van Hellemond's whistle, sending Anderson to the cooler for five minutes. ''I was hurt about as bad as Gretzky was,'' said Smith, always bluntly honest. ''But van Hellemond wasn't going to call a penalty until I laid down and started squirming. I'm sorry I had to do it. I hated doing it - it's not my style to do it. But people are giving me cheap shots all the time.'' Van Hellemond is not known to be a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, but he was artistically offended by the display on the ice. He later told Smith: ''There was no need to flop around like a fish out of water.'' Sather sourly predicted Smith would ''probably be up for an Oscar for that.'' But neither Smith nor Gretzky was even nominated for an Oscar this spring, nor was Anderson for feigning an ankle injury, nor Sather for his supporting role. And both squads should take a lesson from it: There is no room in hockey for bad actors. Sport has a fine tradition of athletes feigning insult or injury. During the 1982 World Cup, the greatest soccer players in the world took turns running directly at a defender, giving him a swift kick in the ankle, then performing a one-and- a-half gainer onto the lush Spanish stadium grass, and staying down, clutching one or more damaged joints. This may be a major reason why soccer has not yet taken hold in North America. With all the vicious artificial turf threatening elbows and thighs, nobody wants to take world- level dives. Nothing Jim Brown ever did on film could match the way he used to trudge back toward the huddle after being tackled, one shoulder hunched as if dislocated, the opposite arm hanging limply as if broken in two places. Yet on the next play, Brown would pound for another 6 or 7 yards. In baseball, an admiring Joe Garagiola used to describe Joe Pepitone's ''Low and Outside'' aria, in which Pepitone went to one knee with arms outstretched, pleading his cause with the umpire. Just the other day in the basketball playoff, Dennis Johnson of Boston tried to get a charging foul called on Ray Williams by hobbling down the court as if his hip had been thrown out of its socket. What was even more impressive was Johnson's miraculous healing for a driving layup seconds later. There is nothing wrong with sporting theatrics, but these tough guys from the steppes had better work on their techniques. Gretzky, who has talked of going into acting, would do well to consult Warren Robertson, one of the finest acting coaches in New York. I once spent a few winters playing basketball against Robertson in a steamy little church gym on West 80th Street and never knew he was in the theater, so low-key and physical was his game. As I recall, when Robertson made an infrequent foul call, we never disputed him because he was so sincere . He could teach Gretzky a thing or two about underplaying. As for Smith, the greatest clutch hockey player of at least this generation, since the Islanders' meeting with President Reagan last spring Smith has already shaved his beard and worn a hairpiece. The next step is to portray pain with sincerity, the way Ronald Reagan did in the George Gipp deathbed scene, This Stanley Cup might be decided by Gretzky's instincts against Smith's reflexes. Or it might be decided by whether the referee believes Wayne Gretzky, bravely touching his wounded leg, or Billy Smith, soulfully insisting he never made contact with that fine young man.

1197-> OF WATER; TOO MUCH, TOO LITTLE
Seven years of above-average rain and snowfall have caused more than $30 million damage from flooding in the desert country of southeastern Oregon. The last three seasons have set records for precipitation, and formerly dry lakes have risen to inundate ranches. ''Our ranch is a part of Malheur Lake,'' Elta Taylor said when her family moved off its place on Sod House Road and into Burns, Ore., on higher ground 25 miles to the north. ''It's broke me, that's what it's done,'' said Don Opie, another rancher. He sold his cattle a year ago because their range was flooded, and he moved out of his house in early April. Floods, heavy rainfall, deep lakes and swift rivers are part of the image of the Pacific Northwest, and that is true west of the Cascade range. But east of the mountains, in the high semidesert of eastern Oregon and Washington, the Pacific Northwest is a far different place. This is an unusual flood, too. It did not rise out of the lakes in a few hours, nor will it go away in a few days or even a few months, perhaps not for years. The phenomenon that caused the Great Salt Lake in Utah to rise, threatening highways, houses and factories, is the same one that has flooded the Harney basin in Oregon. Three lakes are involved, and for a quarter century, only the 75-square- mile Malheur Lake had water in it year around. But with the wet years, Harney and Mud Lakes have both filled up, so now it is all one big lake that covers about 250 square miles. In prehistoric times water covered 900 square miles of the basin, and the lake was drained at a gap that is 4,145 feet above sea level. Before the wet years, Malheur Lake's surface was 4,093 feet above sea level. Now it is at 4101, and it is expected to go to perhaps 4,103 feet. There have been proposals that the Army Corps of Engineers spend $18 million to dig a trench to the old drain site, but this was rejected by the corps as not cost effective. Water birds by the thousands visited the expanded lake this spring on their flights north. Naturalists at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge counted 50,000 white geese, 9,000 swans, 60,000 ducks and 25,000 coots. There generally is plenty of water in northern California and never enough in southern California. Regional rivalries block plans to change that imbalance. In the 1960's the state built a canal that carries millions of gallons of water to southern California, rather than having it flow into San Francisco Bay. In 1982 state voters turned down a proposition that would have expanded water transfers to the south. In northern California the opposition was 9 to 1. Now Gov. George Deukmejian, whose home is in southern California, has introduced legislation to increase water transfers, and the quarreling has begun again. The Governor's plan ''could destroy San Francisco Bay,'' San Francisco Supervisor Louise Renne said. At Everett, Wash., the United States Navy has been cast in the role of economic savior. On April 17 the Navy announced that Everett had been selected as the base for a task force that will include the Nimitz, a nuclear-fueled carrier, and eventually as many as 15 other vessels. This will mean that the city of 54,413 people will be home port for 10,000 sailors and 8,000 dependents. There will be 1,700 Navy civilian jobs, and local officials estimate that as many as 18,000 jobs may be created by the surge of new money. This means a lot in a place where unemployment is usually above 10 percent and where in 30 years economic changes have taken away a dozen sawmills that once made Everett thrive. Nevertheless, in the preselection period when officials and business leaders were scrambling to impress the Navy with Everett's desire to become the new Navy base, voices of dissent were heard. The Tulalip Indians fear that dredging to create the deep-water turning basin and anchorages for the fleet will damage the salmon runs that the Indians harvest in the rivers flowing into Port Gardener. Some muted voices worried about the effect of ''all those sailors'' on children in Everett, which has been a quiet place since the mills and loggers left. Others pointed out that Seattle, the Navy's other finalist, showed a lack of interest. If Seattle didn't want it, then why should Everett? Those who asked that question were not answered. There is news, all bad, about the Green River killer, the Puget Sound area's grisliest news story. The news was announced last week by Capt. Frank Adamson, commander of the King County Sheriff's panel assigned to solve the string of murders of young women, mostly prostitutes. He said the skeletal remains of four women found recently east of Seattle were believed to be victims of the Green River killer. He also said three women reported missing had been added to the list of those who may have been victims but whose bodies had not been found. That raised the totals to 24 dead and 13 missing, Captain Adamson said. At times since the discovery in 1982 of the first murders, as many as 80 officers have been at work simultaneously on the case.

1199-> CONSERVATOR GUIDELINES TO BE SET
New York State's top judges have agreed to establish guidelines aimed at insuring that conservators and guardians are appointed by the courts ''on an impartial basis without favoritism and without even an appearance of impropriety,'' the state's Chief Judge said yesterday. The Chief Judge, Lawrence H. Cooke, said in an interview that ways to set up a ''reservoir of qualified persons'' would be considered by the Administrative Board of the courts next month. Judge Cooke said he favored a proposal to limit the number of large fees a conservator or guardian could collect in any one year. The Administrative Board also agreed Thursday to draft detailed guidelines for conservators and guardians. The board's administrative staff has been told to come up with suggested guidelines for the board to consider. The lack of uniform guidelines came to light last month when a court referee questioned loans by John A. Zaccaro from an estate he was managing as a conservator. The loans went to the real-estate business of which Mr. Zaccaro and his wife, Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro, the Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate, were officers. Mr. Zaccaro insisted that he had never been told such loans were improper. A judge decided to remove him as conservator, although there had been no finding of impropriety. The incident prompted the Administrative Board to place on the agenda of its regular meeting for September the possibility of drafting and disseminating written guidelines statewide. The case also raised broader questions about the process under which Mr. Zaccaro had been appointed. In the last 19 months, state courts in New York City have awarded more than $6.8 million in fees under a patchwork system that generally leaves appointments to the discretion of individual judges and often gives the appearance of favoritism to politicians and their associates. The fees were paid to fiduciaries appointed by the courts to oversee the financial affairs of infants, missing persons and people incapacitated by illness or age, and to resolve the estates of people who died. Those appointed by the courts have included current and former public officials and local political leaders, retired judges, the children of judges, and lawyers whose practices appeared to depend greatly on such appointments. Among them were a former judge who received $105,311 for overseeing two estates, a former city official who collected $90,800 for handling four cases and a Queens lawyer who was awarded $181,931 in fees by 11 judges for handling 62 conservatorships and guardianships - the most of any appointee on the list of fees approved since Jan. 1, 1983. Guidelines Proposed in 1980 Presiding Justice Francis T. Murphy Jr. of the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court for the First Department, which covers Manhattan and the Bronx, said yesterday that he was disappointed that the Administrative Board did not adopt recommendations made in 1980 by a panel he had convened on judicial appointments. The Administrative Board, which is composed of Judge Cooke and the presiding justices of the four Appellate Divisions of State Supreme Court, rejected those recommendations as too restrictive. Among the panel's recommendations were that judges be prohibited from appointing former judges within two years of their retirements, or the siblings or offspring of their colleagues in the same county. Judges are barred from appointing their own relatives. ''I was disappointed that the report that came out four years ago was not adopted,'' Justice Murphy said in an interview. ''I suppose you could say it is still under consideration. Our course in the public interest is very clear.'' The 1980 report will be examined to see if any of its recommendations should be used, Judge Cooke said, adding that he was ''hopeful and anxious that something be done definitely.'' Goals for the Guidelines He said, ''It was agreed in concept that there should be established a reservoir of qualified persons for service in each of the counties throughout the state to serve in fiduciary capacities and that provisions be made to insure that the selection of persons from that reservoir be on an impartial basis without favoritism and without even an appearance of impropriety. ''The details will have to fleshed out,'' Judge Cooke said. ''But there shouldn't be more than one substantial appointment to any one person in a year.'' He said the judges had also agreed ''to establish guidelines for fiduciaries for use throughout the state'' which will be ''submitted for action'' at next month's meeting on Oct. 22. 'No Suggestion of Dishonesty' Last month, Justice Edwin Kassoff of State Supreme Court in Queens said that he had found ''no suggestion of dishonesty or malicious intent'' on Mr. Zaccaro's part, but that ''the mere appearance of impropriety must be assiduously avoided.'' The judge later explained that he had appointed Mr. Zaccaro because, although he was neither a lawyer nor a relative of the 84-year-old Queens woman whose estate he was named to supervise, he was ''a successful and experienced businessman with an expertise in management.'' Mr. Zaccaro is also prominent in local political circles and he and his wife are friends of the administrative judge of State Supreme Court in Queens.

1200-> OCCIDENTAL, CHINA IN COAL PACT
More than four years after it opened negotiations, the Occidental Petroleum Corporation today signed an agreement with China to begin developing what could become the world's largest open-pit coal mine. The project at Pingshuo, in north China's Shanxi Province, involves an investment of more than $600 million, making it China's largest venture with a foreign company. Occidental will be joined in the project by Peter Kiewit Sons Inc., a construction and mining company based in Omaha. Rumors had circulated in Peking early last month that the negotiations might collapse, after a drop in the world price of coal made the project less profitable for Occidental. The company asked to renegotiate portions of an interim agreement reached earlier and the Chinese side hinted that it might undertake the mammoth project alone. A formal legal contract remains to be signed in July. But Armand Hammer, Occidental's chairman and chief executive officer, told reporters at the signing today that both sides had reached agreement over the development of the mine. 'This Is It' ''As far as we are concerned, this is it,'' said Dr. Hammer, adding that the agreement opened the way to ordering the mining equipment, detailing the engineering and training the Chinese personnel. The plans for the new mine to be built at Pingshuo, 300 miles west of Peking, envision an output of 15 million tons of coal a year in its first phase. Dr. Hammer expected that this production could triple eventually to 45 million tons. Preliminary surveys have indicated that the mining area, which covers nearly 14.7 square miles, contains reserves of 1.4 billion tons of coal. This is nearly double China's total production of 715 million tons in 1983. Compromises Indicated Dr. Hammer did not say how the earlier stalemate in the negotiations had been surmounted. But his responses to questions from reporters indicated that several compromises had been reached. The 86-year-old physician, who has previously put together substantial ventures in the Soviet Union, said that the Chinese side was now responsible for marketing the coal to Japan, the Pacific Rim countries and, he hoped, eventually Taiwan. According to Peking business sources, Occidental wanted to trim back an earlier pledge to pay Chinese miners American-style wages of about $12 an hour. The miners would get only a fraction, with the state keeping most of the money. Dr. Hammer said that both sides had reached ''a very, very satisfactory deal,'' linked to productivity. He declined to give the new wage, however, saying that ''it will depend on how much coal they produce.'' Details of Financing There were also earlier reports that Occidental had trouble assembling the financing needed for so massive a project, involving investments of $400 million from the United States side and $240 million from the Chinese. Dr. Hammer said that the Bank of America, the First National Bank of Chicago and the First Boston Corporation were involved in the financing, and that the Export-Import Bank in Washington would also be approached. But he said that ''above all, it was the Bank of China that made possible the signing today,'' suggesting that it had agreed to underwrite any shortfall. The price of coal dropped to $40 a ton, from $52, after Occidental reached its preliminary accord with the Chinese. Dr. Hammer hinted that to earn a sufficient return, coal intended for domestic use would be diverted for export. ''If the price falls, we'll export more coal,'' he said. China's paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, met Dr. Hammer today to mark the conclusion of the agreement. Mr. Deng used the occasion to stress that China involved few risks for foreign investors. A Western business analyst said that other Western companies were watching how Occidental fared before committing themselves in China. Reagan Reaction Reported Dr. Hammer said that President Reagan, who is now visiting China, had been ''very pleased'' about the Occidental project, which should boost Sino-American trade substantially.

1201-> CARL J. FRIEDRICH DIES AT 83; INFLUENTIAL HARVARD PROFESSOR
Dr. Carl J. Friedrich, a professor of government at Harvard University for nearly 50 years and the influential author of books on political thought, died Wednesday in a nursing home in Lexington, Mass., after a long illness. He was 83 years old. In the period after World War II, the German-born professor was regarded as one of this country's important thinkers on political ideology. His analyses of totalitarianism and Communism were regarded as ground-breaking. A prolific scholar, he wrote a dozen books ranging from a study of the Baroque Age to one on the philosophy of law to a treatise on Immanuel Kant. Dr. Friedrich's writings and lectures influenced the study of political theory in many universities. Having lived in an era which saw the rise of Nazism and the spread of Communism, Dr. Friedrich sometimes took a dour view of the human inclination for freedom. Erroneous Notion About Freedom In his 1967 book ''An Introduction to Political Theory,'' he wrote that while the liberal tradition believed people wanted freedom maximized, ''experience in the last hundred years has shown this to be quite in error.'' He added, ''Actually I think it is much more nearly true to say that people want a minimum of freedom, rather than a maximum. Most people are very glad to leave a lot of things to other people.'' Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Carter's national security adviser, who was once a student and a co-author of Dr. Friedrich's, described the professor as ''a wonderfully inspiring teacher with a unique gift for stimulating and challenging his students; a major political thinker whose work on totalitarianism has withstood the test of time; an engaging human being who sometimes enraged but always captivated those working with him.'' Dr. Friedrich's government experience was not all academic. From 1946 to 1949, he left Harvard to serve as an adviser to the American military governor in Germany, Gen. Lucius D. Clay. In the early 1950's, he was a constitutional adviser to Puerto Rico and to the European Constituent Assembly. Carl Joachim Friedrich was born June 5, 1901, in Leipzig, Germany, and studied at the Universities of Marburg, Frankfurt and Vienna. He visited the United States as an exchange scholar in 1923, and a few years later, after receiving his doctorate from University of Heidelberg, he came to stay. He began teaching at Harvard in 1926, and he held several professorships until his retirement in 1971. For several years beginning in 1956, Dr. Friedrich held a professorship in political science on the law faculty at Heidelberg, where he founded the Institut f"ur Politische Wissenschaft. After retirement from Harvard, he served as a visiting professor at Colby College, Duke University and the University of Manchester, England. Often Aired Views He was a member of the American Political Science Association, and in 1962 served as its president. He was a man who grappled with the issues of his time and regularly aired his views at public forums and in letters to newspapers. Dr. Friedrich's scholarship ranged over much of Western political thought and culture. His books included ''The New Belief in the Common Man'' (1942); ''Inevitable Peace'' (1948); ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy,'' authored with Mr. Brzezinski (1956); ''The Philosophy of Law in Historical Perspective'' (1957); ''The Pathology of Politics'' (1972), and ''Tradition and Authority'' (1972). Dr. Friedrich's survivors include his wife, the former Lenore Pelham of Cambridge, whom he married in 1924; a brother, Wolfgang G"unter Friedrich of Berlin; two sons, Paul W. of Chicago and Otto of New York; two daughters, Matilda de Boor of Madison, Wis., and Dorothea Gombrich of Oxford, England; 15 grandchildren and one great- grandchild. Funeral services will be private. A memorial service at Memorial Church in Harvard is scheduled for Oct. 21.

1202-> POLL SEES GAIN EQUALING LOSS IF DEMOCRATS PICK A WOMAN
Running a woman for Vice President, a growing hope of Democratic feminists, would gain about as many votes from women as it would lose from men, the latest New York Times/ CBS News Poll suggests. While the net effect would probably be no change, some segments of the population would shift strongly. Having a woman on the Democratic ticket would apparently attract significant numbers of women under 45, Republican women and nonwhites of both sexes, but it would drive off large numbers of men who are independents, men between 45 and 64 and men from the West and the suburbs. Different reasons seemed to move different groups. A belief that men are better at standing up to foreign enemies sometimes worked against the idea of a woman next in line for the Presidency. But other groups supported women as more likely to look after the poor or as better at working out compromises. Some Cross Gender Lines Some of the concerns crossed gender lines. Rita Blair of Poteau, Okla., one of the 990 registered voters among the 1,367 people polled between last Monday and Thursday, said in a follow-up interview that she would be more inclined to vote Democratic if a woman ran for Vice President. But she added: ''Women shouldn't make decisions on, probably, war. Women don't want to fight, and we might have to.'' Hazel Cozad, of Davisville, W.Va., said: ''I don't think we are really qualified to be Vice President, because we change our minds too much. Most women, as anyone knows, can be persuaded real easy, real easy.'' But Mike Yates of Bellingham, Mass., identified one positive theme that was often heard from both sexes when he said: ''We have had enough of 'the good old boys,' and a woman on the ballot represents something fresh and different. Women have a fresh outlook, and women look at things differently.'' Nor was there agreement among political leaders. The mixed results of the poll led them to varying conclusions, too. Ann F. Lewis, political director of the Democratic National Committee, said the indications that a woman on the ticket would help among younger and nonwhite women suggested a potential for the party of a ''surge of a couple of million votes'' by drawing new voters to the polls. Kathy Wilson, head of the National Women's Political Caucus, said, ''Stereotypes on foreign policy are disturbing.'' But she argued that the data suggested that Walter F. Mondale, if he won the noimination, would be well advised to choose a woman as a running mate. She said that was especially true because he did not now run as strongly among women against President Reagan as did his chief Democratic rival, Gary Hart. Robert M. Teeter, president of Market Opinion Research, a Detroit company that conducts polls for Republicans, said this poll showed for the first time that it was no longer ''a net negative to have a woman.'' Twelve or 16 years ago it would have been, he said. Delayed Effect Seen And while he saw some advantage for Mr. Mondale in putting a woman on his ticket, he said there might well be ''some still significant social biases that polls won't measure now because they won't come out until the end of a campaign.'' Moreover, he said, the Democrats' greatest problem in this area is that ''they don't have a credible woman to run.'' The question of a woman as Vice President, advanced by such groups as the National Women's Political Caucus as a way for Democrats to cement the voting advantage they now hold among women, was tested in two ways in the poll. It was measured hypothetically by asking the 990 registered voters in the poll: ''If the Democratic Presidential candidate chooses a woman for Vice President, would it make a difference in whether or not you vote for the Democrat in November?'' Those who said yes were then asked if it would make them more or less likely to vote Democratic. Eight percent said ''more likely,'' and 10 percent said ''less likely.'' In a poll of this size, the difference between 8 percent and 10 percent is not statistically significant. Hypothetical Choices Used Their views were also tested with hypothetical pairings. Every respondent was asked if he or she would vote for Mr. Reagan or Mr. Mondale. Then, later in the interview, each was asked if he or she would vote for Mr. Reagan and Vice President Bush or for a Democratic ticket headed by Mr. Mondale. Half of those interviewed were given a ticket of Mr. Mondale and Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro of Queens, who is one of the women most often mentioned as a possible candidate. The other half were asked about a ticket of Mr. Mondale and Representative James J. Florio of New Jersey. He was chosen because he also serves in the House, is also from the Northeast, also has an Italian name, and has a level of name recognition about as low as Representative Ferraro's. For many respondents, it appeared that adding the name of a relatively popular Vice President, Mr. Bush, pushed them in a Republican direction. But when the two halves of the sample were compared, there were some dramatic differences in how the potential leads of Republicans or Democrats changed. Older Men vs. Younger Women For example, among men 45 to 64, the Republicans' lead increased 3 percentage points with Representative Florio in the race, but increased 21 points with Representative Ferraro, for a net gain of 18 points with a woman in the race. Among women under 45, the Republicans gained 7 points when Mr. Florio was added to the Democratic ticket but lost 2 points with Mrs. Ferraro in the contest. Among all men, Republicans gained 5 percentage points with a woman on the Democratic ticket. Among all women, the Democrats gained 5. These were some of the other groups showing major shifts toward the Democrats with a woman on their ticket: unmarried women, 13 points; Republican women, 12 points; Northeastern women 11 points; moderate women, 10 points; Southern women, 10 points; women under 45, 9 points, and nonwhites, 9 points. These were some of the groups showing major shifts toward the Republicans with a woman on the Democratic ticket: independent men, 24 points; Western men, 17 points; suburban men, 13 points; Middle Western men, 12 points, and conservative men, 9 points. While it was closely correlated with the voting intentions of only some of those groups, the perception that women were less likely to good at ''standing up to foreign enemies'' appeared to be an important factor. In all, 66 percent of the respondents said men were better at this, and only 8 percent said women were. Foreign Policy Issue Cited Democrats are trying to get the public to worry more Mr. Reagan's foreign policy, but by doing so, said Mr. Teeter of Market Opinion Research, ''they are emphasizing the issue that's the biggest woman negative.'' But Ruth Mandel, director of the Center for the American Woman and Politics at Rutgers University, contended that the results on that question could be expected because in American history there were no images or role models of women ''in confrontation with enemies.'' She said she thought a female candidate, unknown to begin with, could show her competence in the campaign. But she and others interviewed, such as Mrs. Wilson of the Women's Political Caucus, argued that polling now could not measure the excitement a woman could bring to the Democratic ticket. One poll respondent, Dorothy Deason of Dunedin, Fla., conveyed such excitement when she said in a later interview: ''If we could get a woman even on the ticket at all, it would be such a big step. What is needed now is a woman to have the chance to make a stand.''

1204-> Thomas E. Gaddis Dies at 76; Wrote 'Birdman of Alcatraz'
Thomas Eugene Gaddis, whose 1955 book ''Birdman of Alcatraz'' became one of the nation's best-known prison biographies, died Wednesday in a Portland nursing home. He was 76 years old and was suffering from cancer. Mr. Gaddis, who was born in Denver, was an educator, prison consultant and psychologist as well as a writer. He was co-author with James Long of ''Killer: A Journal of Murder,'' a book about the life of a convicted Oregon serial killer, Carl Panzram. ''Birdman of Alcatraz'' was the story of Robert Stroud, a Federal judge's grandson who was sentenced to life in solitary confinement after stabbing a guard to death in Leavenworth Federal prison in Kansas. He was in prison for a slaying committed in Alaska. While in solitary, Mr. Stroud became an expert on birds, writing ''Stroud's Digest of the Diseases of Birds'' in Leavenworth from 1939 to 1941. In 1962, ''Birdman of Alcatraz'' was produced as a movie starring Burt Lancaster in the role of Mr. Stroud. In recent years, Mr. Gaddis worked as a court consultant and on various writing projects.

1206-> CHESS; IS AN ISOLATED PAWN ANATHEMA?
Some years ago, the late Max Euwe of the Netherlands, who was world champion from 1935 to 1937, said,''I don't see what the fuss over the isolated pawn is all about. I never minded having one.'' But he was speaking against the prevailing mode of theory. The isolated pawn has become anathema for most of today's leading players. The Swedish grandmaster Ulf Andersson, while never sermonizing on the subject, shakes his head in patronizing pity at the sight of one. The Danish grandmaster Bent Larsen, never shy where his principles are concerned, doubts that the isolated pawn has any value. The classical view that the isolated QP helps to produce attacks in virtue of its controlling central space has never impressed him. The kind of attack that Larsen has never believed in can be seen in the game between the international masters Nick de Firmian of Oakland, Calif., and Sergey Kudrin of Stamford, Conn., in the last round of the United States Championship in Berkeley, Calif. For this performance, de Firmian shared the Paul M. Albert Jr. brilliancy prize with the Seattle grandmaster Yasser Seirawan. What began as an English Opening was soon altered. De Firmian's 7 P-QR3, by preventing a pin of the White QN with . . . B-N5, threatened to cramp the black position with 8 P-Q5. Kudrin therefore advanced 7 . . . P-Q4 and after 8 PxP, NxP the position displayed the characteristics of a Semi-Tarrasch Defense. De Firmian's 9 B-N5ch had a usefully disruptive effect on Black's development. Normally it would be advisable for Black to occupy his QB3 square with a knight, but at this point, 9 . . . N-B3? would allow White to reinforce the pin powerfully with 10 N-K5. Thus, Kudrin was obliged to misplace his QB with 9 . . . B-B3, and de Firmian let it stay misplaced by retreating to a good diagonal with 10 B-Q3. Nevertheless, the black defense was surely adequate up through de Firmian's 13 N-K4. Kudrin should now have played 13 . . . N/4-B3, making it difficult for White to sustain any initiative, since 14 N/4-N5 is rebuffed by 14 . . . P-KR3. Instead, he gave de Firmian a crucial tempo to get the attack off and running with 13 . . . N/2-B3?, which permitted 14 N-K5!, B-N2; 15 N-N5. Now, all 15 . . . P-KR3?! would accomplish is a weakening of the black king position after the smooth retreat with 16 N/N5-B3. With 19 . . . N-K2, Kudrin was hoping to strengthen his king position by 20 . . . N-N3, but after 20 N-N4! that was not possible. Thus, 20 . . . N-N3? would be shattered by 21 NxNch, PxN; 22 NxRP!, KxN; 23 Q-R5ch, K-N1; 24 BxN, PxB; 25 QxPch, K-R1; 26 R-K3!, BxNP!; 27 QxB, R-B2; 28 R-R3ch, R-R2; 29 RxRch, KxR; 30 R-B3!, with the decisive threat of 31 R-R3mate. With 22 Q-R3, de Firmian's plan of attack was 23 B-R2, 24 BxN, 25 NxNch and 26 QxPmate. Kudrin should have taken a deep breath and played 22 . . . P-KR4, but he tried 22 . . . B- B5? instead. De Firmian promptly riddled the black king position with 23 BxB, QxB; 24 N-R6ch, K-N2; 25 N/6xP! In desperation - it was useless to play 25 . . . QR-K1; 26 Q-R6ch, K-N1; 27 BxP! - Kudrin offered his queen for two minor pieces with 25 . . . RxN. De Firmian refused after 26 NxPch, K-N1, preferring 27 NxR for its maintaining neater control of the position. After 28 R-K8ch, there could have followed 28 . . . R-B1; 29 RxRch, QxR (29 . . . KxR?; 30 N-K6ch); 30 QxN, QxN; 31 Q-K6ch, with Black the exchange and two pawns down in a hopeless position. Kudrin gave up.

1207-> CAMPAIGN NOTES; Senate Seeks Restraints On Election Projections
The Senate joined the House today in calling for voluntary restraints on election projections and the polling of voters as they leave voting places. A resolution, passed June 26 by the House, was approved by the Senate by voice vote without dissent. The resolution, which does not have the force of law and does not require the President's signature, reads: ''Broadcasters and other members of the news media should voluntarily refrain from characterizing or projecting results of an election before all polls for the office have closed; and the news media, including industry, trade, and professional organizations, should adopt guidelines to assure that data from exit interviews are not used to characterize or project results of an election before all polls for the office have closed.'' Senator Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, told the Senate that NBC News, ABC News and CBS News all projected Ronald Reagan's victory over President Carter in 1980 before the polls had closed on the West Coast.

1209-> Dedication Was Key for U.S. Winners
Right to the end, even after the gold medals hung from their necks, members of the United States men's Olympic team followed the direction of the coach. The United States victory over Spain had been assured 15 minutes after play began, first with a near- perfect display of shooting from a team whose shooters were once questioned, then with a pressure defense that had always been at the core of its plan. When the score was finally frozen at 96-65 and the national anthem had been played, the players rushed from the victory stand to their bench and surrounded Henry Iba, the man who had coached two Olympic champions and had suffered through the controversial 1972 loss to the Soviet Union, the only loss in 78 United States Olympic games. Bobby Knight, the coach who had pushed this team to the end, pointed his thumbs toward the ceiling. The players quickly followed his command. And when Iba was lifted into the air, there were tears in Knight's eyes. Other Thoughts for Knight Knight had insisted all along that a gold medal was his team's sole purpose, that there was no goal of achieving something higher. But his tears during the tribute to Iba, and his words afterward, suggested that there had been other thoughts. ''This will be his last great Olympic memory,'' Knight said of Iba. ''In 1972 a gold medal was stolen from him and his team. Just absolutely taken away in violation of all the rules of the game. It meant a great deal to me, and I think to the players, to have Coach Iba involved with us through this, and particularly here tonight, when the gold medal was not taken away from us, as it was then.'' Even before the American team had been chosen, Knight had said that the best way to avoid a loss was to lead by more than a point near the end. The United States lost its unbeaten record in 1972 when R. William Jones, the ecretary-general of the international basketball body, ordered the clock set back to three seconds, which allowed the Soviet team time for the long pass that led to the winning basket. The last time the United States played Spain, in the last of the preliminary games, the Americans trailed by a point as the clock ticked toward two minutes to play in the first half. By that time Friday night, the United States lead was 27 points. A Lopsided Victory After the Americans had produced the third most lopsided Olympic final and won their games by an average of 32.1 points, Knight tried his best to prevent the absence of the Soviet Union from placing an asterisk beside his team's record. ''I've watched them play for two years,'' Knight said, ''and we beat the Russians' butts anywhere they want to play. The Russians can't play defense. ''They just played in a tournament in Italy, with Italy, Yugoslavia and Spain,'' Knight said. ''They lose to Yugoslavia, they beat Italy by 10, I think, and they beat Spain by 5. Now you tell me the Russians can play these guys and you're not as smart as I think you are, and I don't think a whole lot of you are real smart to begin with. There's no way they could even come close to this bunch.'' A Missing Fact What Knight failed to mention was that the Soviets had defeated Spain by 27 points when the result counted most, at the Olympic qualifying tournament in Paris in May. With their absence here beyond his control, and with a field that was clearly inferior to the United States, all Knight could do was create his own goal: This would be the best amateur team that ever played the game. ''He told us that every day,'' said Wayman Tisdale, who was the leading American rebounder. ''If we worked as hard as we could and we really played up to our potential, that, hey, there's no way they couldn't say that we were the best team.'' At the end, even Knight sounded surprised that a group with such talent, most of them already assured of the riches of the professional game, would work as hard as it did. ''I think this group will always remain a challenge to any group that represents the United States in the future, in terms of unselfishness and playing hard,'' Knight said. His Style Emerged Of course, Knight was always available for his style of constructive criticism. He had screamed at Michael Jordan near the end of a recent one-sided victory, while Jordan struggled with a toothache. In the final, Jordan led all scorers with 20 points, making 9 of 15 shots and also making three steals. But it was Leon Wood, whose 63 assists broke Phil Ford's 1976 Olympic record of 54, who heard the most abuse - and underwent the biggest change in style. Wood said the low point of his experience came the day before the quarterfinal game against West Germany, when he was dismissed from practice minutes after it began. ''I think he was just trying to get a point across,'' Wood said, ''not only to me, but to everybody that, 'Hey, we're playing the West Germans in the quarterfinals and hey, I'm not messing around.' '' In his Olympic experience, Wood had learned to play defense. He also had learned to find ways of rationalizing occasionally unreasonable demands in order to reach a goal. That is what they all had to learn. It Was 'Worth It' ''If I had to say what it was like,'' said Chris Mullin of Brooklyn, who averaged 11.6 points and played outstanding defense, ''I'd say we put everything into one ultimate goal, and we got that. I mean, we put everything into it - blood, sweat, tears, yelling, screaming, laughing, and we came out with exactly what we wanted to do, so I think the whole thing was worth it.'' It seemed such a short while ago that they were in Bloomington, Ind., at the start of their summer, some of them homesick, most of them wondering what they would have to go through. Now it was time to go home. ''And I'm gonna go hug every mean person that I thought was mean,'' Tisdale said. Challenge to Soviet Would he be willing to play the Soviet? Would this team regroup, and work again to please its coach and remove the asterisk forever? ''Definitely,'' Tisdale said. ''It might mean another week of practice,'' someone said. ''It's O.K.,'' Tisdale said. ''It's worth the sacrifice.'' And then he took a moment to think. ''Um, on the other hand,'' Tisdale said, ''let's just forget the practice. Let's play 'em tomorrow.''

1210-> WRITERS DISCUSS THEME OF MYTHS IN MODERN LIFE
Old myths, old gods, old heroes have never died. They are only sleeping at the bottom of our mind, waiting for our call. We have need for them. They represent the wisdom of our race.'' Thus the poet Stanley Kunitz sounded a major theme of a three-day conference of writers, artists and scholars on ''The Presence of Myth in Contemporary Life'' that opened Thursday at the New School. The list of participants, drawn from Europe and Latin America as well as the United States, was almost as imposing as the subjects of their talks. Joining Mr. Kunitz at the opening session, Kenneth Burke, the literary critic, spoke on ''The Omnipresence of Myth.'' Among the lecturers scheduled today are Umberto Eco, the author of ''The Name of the Rose,'' who will speak on ''The Semiotics of Symbols'' and Robert J. Lifton, a psychiatrist and the author of ''Death in Life: Survivors of Hiroshima,'' who calls his talk ''The End of the World: Myth and Event.'' Despite an effort by the sponsors to concentrate the thoughts of the participants on questions like ''In what ways does myth manifest itself in modern life?'' most of the speakers went their own way. Bernard Malamud, the novelist, who was unable to attend the conference, sent along a short story, ''In Kew Gardens,'' in which the details of Virginia Woolf's life were treated as a kind of myth. The Greek novelist Vassilis Vassilikos spoke about myth in modern Greek literature and television. Sheldon Wolin, a professor of political philosophy at Princeton University, chose as his subject ''The Modern Political System: Myth Without Ritual.'' The Senses and the Soul Mr. Burke, who has taken on mythic proportions of his own after more than a half century as critic and philosopher, ranged over a couple of millennia of philosophic ponderings upon the relationship between man's senses and the soul. Although frail and bent at the age of 87, Mr. Burke, his white hair and beard dancing, raced spiritedly from Aristotle to St. Augustine to St. Thomas Aquinas to Dante to Coleridge to Bentham to Emerson to I. A. Richards, chuckling privately as he sped along, as though they were all old pals with whom he had gossiped just the other night. Now and then, the talks intersected. A main point of intersection was Sigmund Freud, whose use of Greek mythology, notably the story of Oedipus, has entered so deeply into the 20th-century psyche. Mr. Burke suggested that the practice of psychoanalysis had turned the role of Oedipus upside down. He observed that unlike the unfortunate Greek king, who sought the murderer of his father only to discover his own guilt, today's patient is likely to enter analysis suffused with feelings of guilt and is cured when he is convinced of his innocence. Mr. Kunitz, too, showed an interest in innocence. ''Poets are forever trying, against the odds, to recapture their innocence,'' he said. ''That is why one goes to them for spiritual enlightenment.'' Issue of Oedipus He called the Oedipus myth ''a cursed issue'' and argued that the myth of parricide holds less meaning in 20th-century America than the myth of reconciliation represented by the meeting of Odysseus and his son Telemachus after 20 years of separation, when Odysseus reveals himself: ''I am the father whom your boyhood lacked.'' Mr Kunitz drew attention to a contemporary ''outburst of father-son poems. It's a new literary phenomenon.'' Remarking on the ''astonishing'' number of American poets who lost their fathers at an early age, he added, ''And even when physically present they are spiritually absent.'' He attributed the evident sense of the father's absence to social forces, such as economic pressures, technological change and the breakup of the family: ''The father is as lost in life as he is in the Army, the factory, the marketplace.'' The poems, he said, give an insight into ''a culture in crisis.'' Unlike the biological connections between a mother and her children, Mr. Kunitz maintained, the father's connection is ''tenuous and impalpable'' and therefore open to mythic treatment. He echoed the description of fatherhood in Joyce's ''Ulysses,'' as ''a mystical estate.'' Fathers and Eulogies Citing E. E. Cummings's poem, ''my father moved through dooms of love,'' Mr. Kunitz noted that American poets have tended to deal with their fathers in an elegiac spirit. But, he added, the poems are not eulogies. He read from the works of such poets as Mark Strand, James Tate and James Wright, which express, along with grief for loss of one's father, powerful feelings of the division between father and son. He celebrated the effort at reconciliation underlying such works: ''In that act of love the poet restores his father's pride and manhood.'' Out of such poetry, he said, grows ''the myth we are creating in our own time.'' He quoted from a poem of his own, ''Father and Son,'' which he wrote 50 years ago: '' 'Father,' I cried, 'return. You know the way.' '' The conference, which took two years to put together, was the inspiration of Matti Megged, a former dean of humanities at Haifa University, who now teaches comparative literature at the New School. It was sponsored jointly by the New School's Graduate Faculty of Political and Social Science, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary, and the nearby Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, which is marking its 125th anniversary. The conference ends this evening with a film, ''The Way of the Dead Indians,'' produced by Michel Perrin and Jean Arlaud, which will be shown at Cooper Union at 8 o'clock.

1211-> SPELLMAN BOOK DELETES HOMOSEXUAL ASSERTIONS
A biography of Francis Cardinal Spellman, which in its early stages had asserted that the late Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York was a homosexual whose sex life ''was a source of profound embarrassment and shame to many priests,'' will be published Oct. 31 without that assertion. Four pages of similar assertions, which were in the bound galleys that had been distributed to reviewers last July, also will not appear in the book. The biography is ''The American Pope: The Life and Times of Francis Cardinal Spellman'' by John Cooney, published by Times Books. It is a sharply critical account of the Roman Catholic prelate who, as New York's Archbishop from 1939 to 1967, was one of the most influential men of his era. The publicity release accompanying the book describes it as tracing ''the use and abuse of poilitical power by a religious leader who did more than any other to destroy the wall separating church and state in America.'' The bound galleys cited four people, including the author Gore Vidal, who asserted that the prelate was a homosexual. But none of the four offered direct proof. In the finished version of the book, which arrived at the publisher yesterday, three of the original four people, including Mr. Vidal, plus two others, are cited in a footnote after the following statement on page 109: ''For years rumors abounded about Cardinal Spelllman being a homosexual. As a result, many felt - and continue to feel - that Spellman the public moralist may well have been a contradiction of the man of the flesh. Numerous priests and others interviewed took his homosexuality for granted.'' The remainder of the published paragraph says: ''Others within the Church and outside have steadfastly dismissed such claims. Finally, to make an absolute statement about Spellman's sexual activities is to invite an irresolvable debate and to deflect attention from his words and deeds.'' The new version contrasts sharply with the assertions in the earlier version of the book. On Aug. 1, Times Books said it was requiring the author to substantiate the assertions. Joseph Consolino, president and publisher of Times Books, said yesterday that he had no comment on the changes. In a statement last August he said, ''We feel we have a responsibility not to publish damaging allegations which cannot be substantiated or which are based on hearsay.''

1212-> CAMPAIGN NOTES; Bush's Right to Vote In Texas Challenged
A Texas State Representative, Clint Hackney, filed a challenge Friday to Vice President Bush's right to vote in Texas, but a county official said the challenge would probably not be heard until after the election. Mr. Hackney, a Democrat, handed the complaint to Tax Assessor Carl Smith of Harris County, but Mr. Smith said state law gave Mr. Bush 60 days' notice of the challenge. ''The point is he's not from Texas,'' Mr. Hackney said. ''He's from Maine. He should vote in Maine.'' Mr. Hackney said he decided to file the challenge after Mr. Bush disclosed that he paid Maine property taxes. Although Mr. Hackney said Mr. Bush did not own a house in Houston, county records show the Vice President owns an undeveloped lot west of the downtown area.

1213-> MASSACHUSETTS DEATH PENALTY LAW OVERRULED
A divided Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled today that the state's death penalty law is unconstitutional because it unfairly encourages murder defendants to plead guilty to avoid the threat of capital punishment. The 1982 law violates the Massachusetts Constitution and ''impermissibly burdens both the right against self-incrimination and the right to a jury trial,'' Justice Paul Liacos wrote in the opinion, adopted by a vote of 4 to 3. The ruling came in response to a request from District Attorney John Conte of Worcester County, who wanted the court's guidance before proceeding with a criminal trial against three men accused of murdering a state trooper on Feb. 26, 1983. The ruling noted that under the terms of the 1982 legislation ''the death penalty may be imposed, if at all, only after a trial by jury.'' ''Those who plead quilty in cases in which death would be a possible sentence after trial thereby avoid the risk of being put to death,'' the opinion said. ''The inevitable consequence is that defendants are discouraged from asserting their right not to plead guilty and their right to demand a trial by jury.'' Amendment in 1982 In a hearing before the court May 7, an attorney for the defendants, Donald Deren, said, ''I can't possibly conceive of a defendant who chooses a course of defense that could lead to the death penalty.'' But Daniel Toomey, assistant district attorney in Worcester County, argued that if all parts of the law were read ''in harmony,'' a trial judge could empanel a special jury to decide whether to impose the death penalty on a defendant who pleaded guilty. An amendment approved by Massachusetts voters in November 1982 said: ''No provision of the Constitution . . . shall be construed as prohibiting the imposition of the punishment of death.''

1214-> MONDALE COMMERCIALS SEIZE SPACE WEAPONS ISSUE
In a 30- second commercial shown tonight on ''Cheers,'' ''Hill Street Blues'' and other parts of the prime-time television schedule, the Mondale-Ferraro campaign unveiled one issue by which it hopes to dominate the Presidential debate Sunday night and the rest of this campaign. This departure in emphasis for the Mondale camp is a calculated gamble intended to charge the remaining weeks of campaigning with the force of a life-or-death proposition, and to give the voters a striking example of the difference in outlook between Walter F. Mondale and President Reagan. ''We want to raise the stakes even further in the election and in the debate, by reminding people what's at stake,'' says Richard Leone, the Mondale adviser in charge of media strategy. The issue is the weapons system that the Reagan Administration has proposed to create in space. There have been hints of this increased focus on the nuclear arms race in Mr. Mondale's radio speech last Sunday, and in the pronouncements of his running mate, Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro. Ferraro Touts Debate ''If you have any doubt about where Walter Mondale and Ronald Reagan stand on the issues of war and peace, watch the debate Sunday night,'' she told audiences Wednesday. ''Your future may depend on it.'' But in an age of video games, computers and all the high technology associated with the television screen, the campaign chose to introduce the issue, with all its implications, with the graphic medium of three television commercials. The theme of the commercial tonight is in dramatic contrast to the five- minute Reagan commercial that has been appearing all week, in which Mr. Reagan, seated in the Oval Office, talks about the various ways in which ''good things are happening.'' ''We're reaching toward new frontiers of science, technology and space,'' Mr. Reagan says. ''Students are doing better in school. Crime is down, our people are more united and America is at peace.'' Warning in Commercial The Mondale commercial paints a starker picture. ''Ronald Reagan is determined to put killer weapons in space,'' it says. ''The Soviets will have to match us, and the arms race will rage out of control, orbiting, aiming, waiting, with a response time to fire so short there'll be no time to wake a President. Computers will take control. On Nov. 6, you can take control. No weapons in space by either side. Draw the line at the heavens, with Mondale.'' The commercial, by depicting the question of extending the arms race to the heavens as the central issue of the future, attempts to portray Mr. Mondale as the leader that a sane future requires. But the impact of the commercial lies in the graphic effects that accompany the words. Produced by Roy Spence, a Mondale media consultant, it begins with a view of earth as seen from a satellite. As the camera backs up, the viewer realizes that the image is appearing on a television monitor in the midddle of war room, a place of glowing computer screens and buttons, with no humans. In the foreground is a red telephone. Its lines blink and go unanswered. Its alarm buzzer sounds. The computer system begins to flash the graphics of a program set into relentless motion, and only when the voice suggests that the viewer ''can take control'' does the system stop. Reagan Talked Long Planned In comparison with the Reagan commercials, which Reagan-Bush campaign officials say were planned long ago and are not intended to set the stage for the foreign policy debate, the Mondale commercial is a conscious attempt to charge the atmosphere of the debate with one paramount issue. In Mr. Reagan's main commercial, the emphasis is on national well-being and domestic economic health, with Mr. Reagan in the role of spiritual leader. Mr. Mondale, ''my opponent,'' is portrayed as a glum spirit, committed to more taxation. ''He sees America divided by envy,'' Mr. Reagan says. ''We see America inspired, and uniting for opportunity. If we stick together, we'll keep building something new and much better - a renewed American spirit with a future of shining opportunities our children can cherish forever.'' The Mondale strategy, which aides say evolved in discussions of how to forge one issue that would clearly differentiate the two candidacies in the last phase of the campaign, is intended to pierce that Reagan aura of well- being. Gap of 10 Points Is Seen Mondale aides quoting the campaign's own polls say the Democratic nominee now trails Mr. Reagan by slightly less than 10 percentage points, and the space weapons strategy is an attempt to address what one poll taker called ''an issue of overriding concern among target voters.'' The target voters, he said, are those who are ''undecided and weak Reagan voters, people we have to dislodge.'' The space weapons system, he said, is Mr. Mondale's choice of an issue that will get their attention. He believes, the aide said, ''that the Administration is very vulnerable on this point.''

Some 2,000 of the city's most prominent and connected people, minus a few angry Democrats, gathered last night at the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Dinner to dine on rack of lamb and chew over both the words of President Reagan and the absence of any official Democratic reply. Although the annual dinner, sponsored by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, is billed as a nonpartisan event to raise money for Catholic hospitals and to honor the former Democratic Governor of New York, the atmosphere last night was often partisan. President Reagan was cheered when he was introduced and cheers greeted several mentions of his name. When a letter by Walter F. Mondale was read explaining the Democratic Presidential nominee's absence, there was a round of lusty booing. Mr. Mondale originally agreed to appear at the dinner, but last Friday he wrote to the Archbishop to say he could not attend becuase he would be busy preparing for his Sunday night debate with Mr. Reagan. ''Reagan-Bush'' buttons embellished the tuxedos and long evening gowns of guests who were waiting to clear metal detectors before entering the ballroom at the Waldorf-Astoria. Buttons endorsing Mr. Mondale were rare. Last night was the 39th time since Francis Cardinal Spellman established the dinner that New Yorkers had decked themselves out for the dinner, a mainstay of the city's political season. There were so many powerful or important people at the dinner that the dais had five tiers. No Chair for O'ConnorFor some moments, the Archbishop of New York himself could not sit down: organizers had not placed enough chairs at the dais. The Archbishop, John J. O'Connor, jokingly noted that this was his first Al Smith Dinner as well as the first for the priest who organized it, and that he hoped next year he would have a chair. Earlier, as the Presidential couple and the Archbishop were emerging from the ballroom for a photo session, the formally attired Nancy Reagan caught her heel, apparently in the carpeting or the hem of her gown, and stumbled backward. Archbishop O'Connor caught her. Governor Smith, ''the Happy Warrior'' who was the first Roman Catholic Presidential nominee, remains a hero to many Democrats. But a few prominent Democrats stayed away from the event because the dinner committee did not allow Geraldine A. Ferraro, the Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee, to fill in for Mr. Mondale. ''Some are not coming,'' said Governor Cuomo, ''politically active people who are deeply committed to the Democratic cause who feel they want to protest.'' Mr. Cuomo said that he was attending ''as Governor,'' not as a Democrat. At the same time, many of those who did attend expressed disappointment with Mr. Mondale's absence. One guest, Robert S. Carroll, handed out red matchboxes with gold lettering that read: ''Where's Fritz.'' Mr. Mondale's absence, he said, was a ''disastrous move because he was beginning to make inroads into ethnic America.'' 'Insulted Every Catholic' The Rev. Leo J. Daly, director of campus ministries at Fordham University, said, ''Some feelings might have been hurt because the Archdiocese puts a lot of work into this dinner to make it nice.'' Stronger language was used by Joseph Sullivan Jr., a layman who has been attending the dinners loyally for decades. Mr. Mondale, he said, had ''insulted every Catholic in the United States.'' Of course, partisan politicians expressed partisan views. Mayor Koch, a Democrat who originally questioned Mr. Mondale's decision to forgo the dinner, told reporters before entering the ballroom: ''I think it would have been better for him to have come than to have prepared for Sunday because he's going to cream the President on Sunday.'' Senator Alfonse D'Amato, a Republican, said he thought Mr. Mondale ''ducked out on this because he did not want to give the President a forum in which he could recoup.'' In most Presidential election years, the dinner has been a platform for the two major-party candidates to show their style and for the leader of the Archdiocesse to drop subtle hints about candidates he favors. This year some Democrats complained that the new Archbishop had injected himself into the campaign. Archbishop O'Connor has criticized Representative Ferraro's position on abortion, that women should be free to choose to terminate a pregnancy. Demonstrators in Street Outside the hotel on Park Avenue, hundreds of demonstrators pressed up against police barricades, chanting slogans supporting and criticizing both parties' candidates. Opponents of Mr. Reagan demonstrated between 48th and 49th Streets on the west side of Park Avenue, shouting attacks on United States policy in Central America. A group favoring the right to abortion staged a sidewalk drama, complete with masks, ridiculing the President's steadfast opposition. Their show was titled, ''If Reagan Could Get Pregnant, He'd Be for Mondale-Ferraro.'' One block to the north, between 50th and 51st Streets, large crowds supporting Mr. Reagan chanted, ''Four more years!'' There was no way to determine how many of those invited stayed away from the dinner as a protest. Pamela Harriman, the wife of W. Averell Harriman, the former New York Governor and longtime diplomat, bought one of the 316 tables, but did not come. Instead, R. Peter Straus and his wife, Ellen, who together head WMCA radio, were at the table. ''Mrs. Harriman is indisposed,'' said Mrs. Straus, ''and she graciously gave us her tickets.'' Mr. Harriman is ailing and had not been expected. Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., the historian, who was to have sat at the Harriman table, was also absent, but said his health was fine. 'Clearly a Biased Dinner' ''The refusal of the group to invite Geraldine Ferraro shows that it is entirely pro-right-Reagan and I'm not going,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''It's clearly a biased dinner. When Cardinal Cooke was there it was a very nonpartisan thing. But Admiral O'Connor is clearly a Reaganite and he's trying to transform a fairly nonpartisan event into a Reagan rally.'' Archbishop O'Connor served as a Navy rear admiral in charge of chaplins. Mr. Cuomo said elected officials were not particpating in the protest. ''They have to come as elected officials to show respect for the church and for the Archbishop,'' the Governor said. Carol Bellamy, the City Council President, attended. ''I've always gone, as long as I've been invited,'' she said, explaining that she had not been invited her first two years as Council President. The proceeds go to the Smith Foundation, which passes the money on to Catholic hospitals in the Archdiocesse and to the Beth Israel Medical Center. Beth Israel is supported because of the late Charles H. Silver, its president for 37 years, who was a close political ally of Cardinal Spellman.

1217-> Intruder Tries to Rape Nun in Her Convent
A man armed with a knife entered a Manhattan convent last night and attempted to rape a nun, according to the police. The nun, Cynthia Wilhelmy, 28-years-old, fought off the man and was hurt in the struggle, but she refused medical aid, the police said. The nun was attacked shortly before 11 P.M. The police said her assailant had climbed up foliage to a second-story window of the Roman Catholic convent, the Dalton Center for Mission and Peace at 323 East 33d Street. He found Sister Wilhelmy alone in a cubicle, and threatened her with the knife, but fled after she screamed and resisted him. Another nun at the convent reported that $60 was missing from her room. The assailant was described as an Hispanic male, 5 feet 9, and of solid build, according to the police. He wore an off-white kerchief over his face, had dark eyes and wore blue jeans and black shoes.

1219-> BUSINESS PEOPLE; Former GAF Official Back After Proxy Battle
In chess, a player can move sideward, even backward, and still end up with a checkmate. James T. Sherwin, an expert chess player who was New York State champion in 1951, has applied this technique in the corporate management game. Mr. Sherwin, 50, had spent 23 years with GAF before resigning in June 1983 as executive vice president during the bitter proxy contest waged by Samuel J. Heyman, who eventually became chairman and chief executive in December 1983. Expressing worry about the long-term future of GAF, Mr. Sherwin took a job as executive vice president of Triangle Industries, a maker of vending equipment and copper wiring that he describes as ''about half the size of GAF.'' It is rare that a new management taking over after a bitter proxy fight rehires departed managers, but Mr. Heyman has done just that: He has persuaded Mr. Sherwin to return to GAF, this time as vice chairman and chief administrative officer, with responsibility for areas like finance, human resources and corporate development. Mr. Heyman plans to keep his eyes primarily on GAF's operating divisions. Mr. Sherwin, a graduate of Columbia and its law school, joined GAF in 1960 after three years with a law firm. He was assigned to the legal department, which he described as a ''two- man shop'' and a busy one. In those years GAF (then known as General Aniline and Film) was owned by the Government because of its World War II German background. The Government eventually divested itself of the company through a public offering. In 1969 Mr. Sherwin became general manager of European operations, then group vice president of photographic operations, and finally executive vice president for finance and administration, all of which, gives him ''ability and depth of experience'' to help effect a turnaround at GAF, according to Mr. Heyman. ''It is a happy occasion for me to be back at GAF,'' Mr. Sherwin said. ''Many of my former collegues are here.'' As for chess, he said, ''I like to play in speed chess tournaments on Friday evenings.'' He thinks that chess has some business value in the sense of its being an analytical discipline, but knowledge of law has ''more immediate relevance.'' As for GAF, he said, ''I think that the earnings results for the year will be excellent, and the new team is taking hold.''

1223-> BUSINESS PEOPLE; Dual Position Is Filled By Woods Petroleum
V. Lee Powell has been elected president and chief executive of the Woods Petroleum Corporation. Mr. Powell, 50, joined Woods, a leading independent oil and gas producer based in Oklahoma City, in 1966. In 1973, he was named executive vice president and became chief operating officer at the company last November. Mr. Powell succeeds A. D. Freshour, 62, who has been president and chief executive of the company since 1968. Mr. Freshour, who was named chairman in 1976, will retain that title. Neither Mr. Powell nor Mr. Freshour could be reached for comment. A petroleum engineer, Mr. Powell graduated from the Missouri School of Mines in 1955 and earned a Master of Science degree from Pennsylvania State University in 1960. The company said it had redeemed more than 200,000 shares of common stock owned by Mr. Freshour at the May 18 closing price of $25.50, and added that he had entered into a two- year consulting agreement with Woods. At the close of trading yesterday, Woods Petroleum shares on the New York Stock Exchange stood at $25, down 50 cents. A company spokesman would not elaborate on the buyback arrangement. In the first quarter, Woods Petroleum reported net income of $5.3 million on revenues of $23.7 million; a year earlier, the company reported earnings of $4.7 million on revenues of $18.4 million.

1225-> MUSIC: WORK BY ZWILICH
THE New York premiere of Ellen Taaffe Zwilich's ''Chamber Symphony'' provided the principal interest at the St. Luke's Chamber Ensemble's Tuesday evening concert at the Abraham Goodman House. This 18-minute composition is built on two contrasting musical ideas - a patina of stark, parallel octaves, and more lyrical contrapuntal passages. If it does not quite have the effortless eloquence of Mrs. Zwilich's most recent compositions, the ''Chamber Symphony'' remains a work of concision and power, and it was exceptionally well played Tuesday night. Things got off to a rather shaky start with a performance of Igor Stravinsky's ''Octet'' which lacked the composer's requisite snarl. Bob Mintzer's ''Concertino for tenor saxophone, winds and strings,'' in its world premiere, called to mind an overly sweet film score - a mixture of Satie-like simplicity, prettified jazz and saxophone improvisation. The performance was presumably definitive; Mr. Mintzer played the solo part. The program closed with a sturdy, songful performance of Beethoven's ''Septet in E Flat'' (Op.20) which was marred by some insecure intonation, and a lack of the consistency that usually distinguishes the ensemble's performances.

1227-> CELTICS GAIN FINAL ROUND
The Boston Celtics' rebounding was so dominant tonight that not even their sloppy floor play could deter them from clinching the Eastern Conference title at Boston Garden. With the 115-108 victory from the Milwaukee Bucks, the Celtics took the four-of-seven-game championship series, 4 to 1, and remained unbeaten at home in nine playoff games this season. They are 2-5 on the road. The first two games of the final series will be here. The Celtics will play the winner of the Western Conference final between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Phoenix Suns. Boston has won 14 National Basketball Association championships, more than any other franchise. The St. Louis Hawks, in 1958, were the only team to beat the Celtics once they reached the finals. With Larry Bird grabbing 13 rebounds and Robert Parish getting 11, the Celtics outrebounded the Bucks, 53-36. But the rebounding statistic that hurt more was the 24-14 dominance of the offensive boards. ''It was some of the things that we were doing early,'' said Cedric Maxwell, who had 19 points and 7 rebounds, ''that we were eventually able to get out an run. We hit the boards hard, and it just wore them down.'' The Celtics' first 2 points set the tone of the domination: A basket by Dennis Johnson on an offensive rebound of a Parish miss. The Celtics had a 31-15 rebounding edge at halftime, but only led, 62-52, because 11 turnovers accounted for 16 Milwaukee points. With the help of 13 consecutive points, the Celtics expanded the lead to 83-63, with 5 minutes 44 minutes remaining in the third period. It was one of two big runs the Celtics had. With the Bucks ahead by 40-36, the Celtics had run off 12 points, 7 by Bird, who led the Celtic scorers with 21 points despite shooting 8 for 21. ''That's called 'spurt' basketball,'' said Coach Don Nelson of the Bucks, a former Celtic. ''The Celtics are capable of scoring points in bunches. The only way you can beat that is by being consistent out there and avoid such a thing. When you commit a turnover, let them dominate you off the boards the way they did, you can get hurt and we did.'' With the help of Celtic turnovers, coupled with 24 points by Marques Johnson and 21 by Mike Dunleavy, 9 of which came from 3-point baskets, the Bucks made several comeback attempts. The one that worried Coach K. C. Jones of the Celtics the most was the Bucks' rally after his team had taken the 20-point lead. The Bucks cut the deficit to 5 in the closing moments. ''I'm very happy and relieved to end this series here,'' Jones said. ''We had a chance to blow them out, but Milwaukee wouldn't let it happen and we had a lot to do with it. We started to relax. We acted like the game was over and played some very ugly basketball. Maybe it was fatigue, but we were very careless with the big lead.'' ''We made a heck of a run at them,'' Nelson said. ''We did it basically with the things we did all season long, play our halfcourt game and be patient. The clock just ran out on us.'' Jones was equally happy that the clock ran out. ''I'm very happy and relieved to end this series here,'' said. Jones, mindful that Milwaukee had swept Boston in four games last year. said. ''We would have been in trouble if we had to play Game 6 in Milwaukee.'' Bridgeman Stricken by Heat The heat in the arena got to Junior Bridgeman, the Bucks' forward, who had only 4 points and shot 1 for 12. ''Junior was hyperventilating in the dressing room from at halftime,'' said Nelson, ''and we didn't know whether he could play or not. We threw him in the shower, and he was able to give us some sporadic minutes in the second half, but it was not the real Junior out there. . . . Bird has led the Celtics in scoring in every playoff game but one and has led or tied for the lead in rebounding 8 times. He also has led or tied in assists 11 times. . . . Marques Johnson, who wears uniform No. 8, wore No. 6 because his uniform was lost or stolen. se

1229-> NEW YORK DAY BY DAY; Speaking From Experience
The idea of role models is becoming a reality for 27 students at Martin Luther King High School on Amsterdam Avenue, thanks to the Women's Media Group and the New York City School Volunteer program. Each week, some sophomores meet with journalists. Yesterday, Alex Haley, the author, talked about the ''write stuff.'' ''I speak at lots of colleges,'' he said, ''and students say that two or three years ago, their classmates in high school dropped out. When they return to their hometowns, they talk about how painful it is to see the gulf that has developed between them and the dropouts. ''And I speak in penitentiaries, and I always realize that I'm looking into the same intelligent faces I see at universities, but they took a wrong turn.'' Mr. Haley was on the way from his home in Los Angeles to visit King Hassan II of Morocco. ''You really get an inside look at what goes on,'' said David Duncan, a 16-year-old from the East Flatbush section of Brooklyn. ''When you see people on TV, you don't know what they really do.'' Interested in politics, he intends to go to law school. James Green, 15, from the Crown Heights area of Brooklyn, said: ''I meet people who inspire me. If he can make it, I could make it, too.'' Mr. Haley spoke of his childhood in a small town in Tennessee. ''I wish there had been something like this program available to me at your age,'' he told the group. ''You know, you're not going to have an effect on a whole class,'' he observed, ''but maybe there are two or three whom I can make see that you can overcome, you can succeed. What they do within the next five years will probably determine the course of the rest of their lives.''

1230-> ALGERIA AFTER 30 YEARS: A REVOLUTION MATURES
Thirty years after the start of Algeria's battle for independence from France, the country still shows signs of the commitment to socialism that its new leaders made when they took control and proclaimed Algeria ''a beacon of African revolution.'' The capital has a dilapidated air. Food and most other goods are scarce, and fruit juice is unobtainable in a country that was once France's orange grove. A population explosion keeps the streets crowded with young people gazing at half empty shops. Economic development continues at a frenzied but inefficient pace. Security seems oppressive. Yet beneath the surface, a process of change and relaxation is under way. And as the Government prepares for the 30th anniversary this Thursday of the start of its fight for freedom, Algerian leaders say the celebrations are intended to show the world that Algeria has achieved maturity as a nation. ''We are a constitutional democracy now,'' Mohammed Cherif Messaadia, secretary of the ruling party's Central Committee, told a group of foreign reporters visiting the country this month at the Government's invitation. ''The institutions are in place. We are no longer a revolutionary regime.'' In the early hours of Nov. 1, 1954, armed members of an obscure Algerian nationalist organization called the Front de Liberation Nationale attacked French police posts and a lead mine in the Aur es Mountains of eastern Algeria. Six French citizens were killed. The French Governor in Algiers dismissed the incidents as insubstantial. But the Algerian war of independence had begun. Seven years and nearly a million lives later, President Charles de Gaulle finally abandoned the attempt to keep Algeria French by force of arms. Over 800,000 French settlers who once regarded Algeria as home were repatriated, and Africa's second largest country, with its rich oil and gas fields, was handed over to the F.L.N.'s radical and embittered leaders. To mark the anniversary and demonstrate its more self-confident, relaxed stance, the Government of Chadli Benjedid, an army colonel who became President after the death of President Houari Boumediene in 1979, has granted amnesty to the many guerrillas who have fallen out with Algeria's leaders since independence. Last week the bodies of Belkacem Krim and Mohammed Khider, two of the F.L.N.'s founding fathers who were driven into exile and killed by Algerian agents in the 1970's, were brought back from Europe and reburied with military honors. Ahmed Ben Bella, Algeria's first President, who was overthrown by Mr. Boumediene, has been released from detention and given a regular income and is welcome to return from self- exile in Europe, Mr. Messaadia said. Also welcome, he said, is Hocine A"it- Ahmed, another father of the revolution who escaped to Switzerland after being sentenced to death. ''The generation that won independence is growing older,'' Mr. Messaadia said. ''It's time to forget past divisions.'' Yet, as in many aspects of Algerian life, political passions engendered by the fight with France seem to limit the speed of change. Over 400,000 Algerians descended from those who fought on the French side in the war remain in France, unable to return, their Algerian property confiscated. No More Exit Visas In other ways, too, the Benjedid Government is edging away from the austere revolutionary policies of its predecessors. Algerians no longer need exit visas to leave the country, and the foreign exchange allowance for travelers has been increased. Housing and farmland seized from the departing French are being sold cheaply to private owners. Efforts are under way to increase production of consumer goods, and private businessmen are being encouraged by the Government. Algeria's foreign policy also seems to be evolving in a more moderate direction. Algeria played a crucial role in obtaining the release of the hostages from the United States Embassy in Teheran, Iran, in 1981, and the Government has increasingly shared Western concern about the destabilizing activities of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader, in the region. Algeria has also relaxed its traditional hostility to what it has called the reactionary Moroccan Government of King Hassan II. Similarly, Algeria shares the Reagan Administration's concern about the surprise ''treaty of union'' that Morocco and Libya announced in August. 'Page Has Been Turned' Officially, Algeria says that ''the page has been turned'' in its relations with France. But France has been embarrassed by the Algerian decision to celebrate the start of a war in which 40,000 French soldiers and civilians died. Despite criticism from the right and from organizations of former settlers, Foreign Minister Claude Cheysson will attend the celebrations. Alluding in a recent television interview to France's continuing strong commercial ties with Algeria, he said, ''We did not choose the date, but can France afford to be absent?'' Algerian leaders seem to be using the anniversary to exploit anti-French feelings and stir up patriotic sentiment among the country's fast-growing population, 60 percent of whom were born after independence. On radio and television, former guerrilla leaders endlessly recount their campaigns, and others reminisce about life on death row in French prisons. Officials often talk of the miseries of colonialism and attribute current difficulties to French neglect. ''What do we have to unify us but the war and Islam?'' Information Minister Bachir Rouis said. Islam's contribution seems to be minimal, and Algeria appears relatively unmarked by the fundamentalist revival in other Moslem countries. The clergy are paid by the state and carefully controlled. The Driving Force: Youth On the other hand, Algerian officials acknowledge that the driving force behind the Government's more pragmatic approach recently is the need to satisfy the material aspirations of that huge body of young people born after independence and who do not share the ideals of those who won it. Algeria's population, which has doubled, to 22 million since indepedence, is expected to reach 30 million by the end of the decade despite a vigorous birth- control program. The Government is putting resources into education, hoping this will enable the country's youth to support themselves. But politics has slowed progress. First education was Arabized and French was demoted, and standards fell. Now the Government faces a shortage of trained artisans because people leaving school prefer white-collar jobs. So priorities are being shifted again toward technical training. Algeria's principal source of wealth is its oil and gas reserves, and the country has skillfully maximized its income from them as world prices fell. But it has had less success investing those revenues to create an economy able to employ its growing population when oil and gas run out. Early Mistakes Recognized The Soviet-style centralized economic planning and enormous investment in heavy industry favored by Algeria's early rulers are now recognized as mistakes. So too is neglect of agriculture, which has produced an explosion in food imports that last year cost the country $2.6 billion, or a quarter of its energy earnings. The Benjedid Government has started making changes, cutting up the 60 to 70 hugh national industries into 400 smaller ones. Wages in Government factories are being linked to output to encourage production, and the Government is giving more support to the private sector in industry and farming. Foreign investment in partnership with the Government has been legalized, and top priority in the new five-year development plan goes to agriculture and irrigation. But the pace of change remains slow, hampered by the revolutionary ideology of the leaders and an unwieldy bureaucracy. Private business may not compete with the state sector. In practice, it appears to be confined to clothing, construction, some metalwork and services. Algeria has yet to find a foreign investor willing to accept its terms for partnership with the Government.

1232-> U.S. SAYS STUDY FOUND MANUEL BROKE NO LAW
The White House announced today that two investigations ordered by President Reagan had found that there had been ''no violation'' of the law in the preparation of a Central Intelligence Agency manual for Nicaraguan guerrillas. But the inquiries concluded there may have been ''lapses in judgment'' requiring disciplinary action. according to the White House statement. It added that President Reagan concurred with the conclusions of the reports. The White House said the three-paragraph statement represented the final word from President Reagan on the controversy over the manual. The manual recommends that Nicaraguan officials be ''neutralized,'' a term that many officials have said is a euphemism for assassination. The statement was issued in Santa Barbara in the name of the President's spokesman, Larry Speakes, and included no direct comment from Mr. Reagan. The President's own last direct comment on the subject was a prediction last Wednesday that the issue would prove to be ''much ado about nothing.'' Two Reports On Friday, Congressional and intelligence officials disclosed that one of the reports, by the Inspector General of the C.I.A., had recommended that ''five or six officials be disciplined.'' A senior Government official said ''no senior officials are involved.'' The second report, the results of which were announced for the first time today, was prepared by the Intelligence Oversight Board. Mr. Reagan said on Nov. 3 that there was ''nothing in that manual that talked assassination at all.'' He added that he thought the Director of Central Intelligence, William J. Casey, had been ''very forthcoming'' when Mr. Casey told Congress that the purpose of the manual was to help the Nicaragan guerrillas to be more forthcoming in ''face-to-face communication.'' Peter Roussel, a White House deputy press secretary, said today that ''the President feels he has cleared the air'' about the manual. ''The President received, approved and concurs in the report,'' he said. While the White House summary of the two reports said that the C.I.A. had committed ''poor judgment and lapses in oversight at lower levels,'' no mention was made of possible dismissals. ''Suspensions and reprimands'' were possible, Mr. Roussel said, but he had no information on whether dismissals had been ruled out. During the second televised debate with Walter F. Mondale, the Democratic presidential nominee, the President said that any Government official involved in the preparation of the manual would be dismissed. The White House said today that the President was relying on the Director of Central Intelligence to take appropriate disciplinary actions. In summarizing the findings of the inquiries by the C.I.A. Inspector General's office and the Intelligence Oversight Board, the White House said that ''detailed and extensive'' investigations found ''there had been no violation by C.I.A. personnel or contract employees of the Constitution or laws of the United States, executive orders or Presidential directives.'' Assassination Forbidden These laws forbid intelligence agents from taking part in or recommending the assassination of officials of rival governments. Throughout the controversy, critics of the Administration have insisted that the word ''neutralize'' is a well-known euphemism for murdering officials. President Reagan and other Administration officials have denied this, maintaining that the manual merely urged guerrillas to peacefully depose Nicaraguan officials. A week ago, the President contended the manual really meant: ''You just say to the fellow who's sitting there in the office, 'You're not in the office anymore.' '' The White House summary of the inquiries said: ''Both bodies noted that despite portions which could be misinterpreted, the manual had worthy purposes - instilling in Nicaraguan freedom fighters the knowledge of how to promote understanding of their goals among the people and counselling them on appropriate behavior in dealing with civilians.'' The manual, prepared by a C.I.A. contract worker, advised insurgents to ''kidnap all Nicaraguan Government officials'' and blackmail ordinary citizens into joining the rebellion. It also suggested hiring criminals to shoot fellow insurgents and thereby create martyrs for the guerrilla cause. Such critics as Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who is vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, have scorned the manual as a misguided plagiarizing of guerrilla tracts used by Marxist insurgents whom the Administration professes to oppose. On Friday, after reviewing the Inspector General's report, Senator Moynihan also said that it was ''appalling'' because it recommended only light discipline when something far stronger was needed. Congressional officials said discipline was recommended for ''five or six officials.'' The White House declined to make the two reports public, although Administration officials had said during the election campaign that they likely would be made public. No Administration official was available here to answer detailed questions on the controversy as the President completed a four-day vacation at his mountainside ranch. ''The I.G. report identified instances of poor judgment and lapses in oversight at lower levels within the Agency,'' the White House statement said, without elaboration. ''Recommendations for corrective measures to strengthen management and oversight within the C.I.A. were approved as well as disciplinary action where lapses in judgment or performance occurred.'' During the election campaign, in which the manual was an issue, President Reagan's National Security Advisor, Robert C. McFarlane, said that any Government official involved in the preparation or approval of the manual ''will be removed.''

1233-> ARSONS PLAGUE DETROIT IN PRE-HALLOWEEN OUTBREAK
An apartment building was set ablaze and flames from fires in abandoned buildings leaped to occupied houses tonight as increased police and fire forces battled the traditional ''Devil's Night'' Halloween Eve arson spree. For the first time since the riots of 1967, suburban fire departments were called in to help city firefighters, said Robert Berg, press secretary to Mayor Coleman A. Young. Most of the fires were set in abandoned buildings, garages and trash cans, although one apartment building was burning and at least three other blazes spread from vacant houses to neighboring, occupied dwellings. In one block on the city's east side, three houses and a telephone pole were on fire. Two firefighters were reported slightly injured, said a city firefighter, John King. No injuries were reported from the dwelling fires. The fire department did not have a tally of the number of fire calls, but Mr. Berg, who was working out of the fire commissioner's office, estimated that there were at least 150. There were fewer structure fires than last year, when more than 400 buildings were set afire in a 24-hour period, said Deputy Fire Commissioner Phillip Gorak. Two firefighters were injured fighting the 1983 fires, and one man was found dead in the burned-out remains of a vacant house. This year, Mayor Young put searchlight-equipped helicopters in the air, tripled the number of police on the streets and increased the firefighting staff by a third. More than 1,400 volunteers helped patrol the streets in cars equipped with citizen-band radios, as did city workers in Department of Public Works vehicles with radios and fire extinguishers. ''We're doing a lot better this year,'' said Mr. Gorak. ''With the helicopters helping out, we're doing a better job of coordinating the dispatch efforts.'' Last year the city had more fires than available crews, partly because too many firefighters and trucks were sent to trash fires that could have been handled by a smaller crew, he said. Mischief has been a hallmark of the day, one day before Halloween, but the scale of last year's arson binge was unprecedented. City officials acted to see that it did not happen again. ''Arson, vandalism and malicious destruction of property are against the law,'' Mayor Young said last week as he announced the preparations. ''They will not be tolerated in Detroit on Devil's Night or any other night of the year.'' Despite the prevention effort and warnings, arsonists got an early start this year, Mr. Berg said. ''There were 189 alarms between midnight Sunday and 8 A.M.'' today, he said. ''Twenty- five of them were false, 107 were dumpsters, 28 were dwellings and 28 were autos.''

1234-> PAPER CHAINS
THE BUYING AND SELLING OF AMERICA'S NEWSPAPERS Edited by Loren Ghiglione. 200 pp. Indianapolis: R. J. Berg & Company. $21.95. Does an independently owned newspaper get better or worse when it is sold to a large newspaper chain? This question has plagued journalists and thoughtful readers for years. The answer provided in ''The Buying and Selling of America's Newspapers'' - an effort by a group of journalists to take an objective, unsentimental look at what happened to 10 medium- to small- sized newspapers when they were acquired by chains - is intentionally ambivalent. ''It's virtually impossible to generalize - good guys or bad? - about the groups' impact,'' Loren Ghiglione writes in his introduction. But the issue is one that provokes passionate feelings in many journalists, politicians and ordinary citizens. Mr. Ghiglione, who heads a small chain of newspapers and is president of the New England Press Association, has made an effort to keep the analyses by the contributors as cool and precise as possible. But in doing so, he has kept the book from seriously addressing the important issue of the emotional - sometimes irrational - impact on a community when its locally owned newspaper is sold to a newspaper chain. In communities such as those described here, the local newspaper is often the town's soul as well as its primary source of news. Instead, each of the case histories follows a loose formula. There is a crisp, detailed history of the events leading up to the sale of the paper, including sketchy profiles of the major figures involved in the paper's ownership and management, and then an examination of what happened after the sale (often including statistics comparing the number of reporters on the staff and the number of local stories appearing on the paper's front page before and after the sale). Included are some of the most interesting recent sales of small newspapers to some of the nation's best-known chains, including Gannett, Knight-Ridder and the Hearst Corporation. The book explores the Hodding Carter family's sale of the crusadingly liberal Delta Democrat-Times in Greenville, Miss., Alex S. Jones writes about press issues for The New York Times. to Freedom Newspapers, a newspaper group with a strong libertarian, anti-government orientation. There is also a chapter about the sale of The New Mexican in Sante Fe to Gannett, the nation's largest newspaper chain, in 1976, and the unusual lawsuit that has resulted in which Robert M. McKinney, the original owner, is seeking to force Gannett to return the paper to him. Though the matter is still in litigation, the prickly Mr. McKinney has had some success in persuading the courts that Gannett violated the terms of sale, which had given him authority to run the paper even though he had sold it. One of the most effective demonstrations of the difference chain ownership can make is presented in a case history written by Mr. Ghiglione himself. He describes, straightforwardly and vividly, the troubling fate of The Transcript of North Adams, Mass. The Transcript was purchased in 1976 by Affiliated Publications, the owner of The Boston Globe, and then sold by Affiliated in 1979 to Ingersoll Publications Co. The year before its sale to Affiliated, the New England Press Association had named the paper the best small daily in the region. Its news staff was twice that of most dailies its size, and the paper devoted more space to news than any comparable daily in New England. BUT it also made little money under the administration of either the family that originally owned it or Affiliated, which had left the family management in place. In its best year, the paper's after-tax income was only $82,594 on revenues of $2 million, which in the industry would be considered an uncomfortably slim profit margin, one that would provide little cushion in tough times and would make it risky to invest in sophisticated new equipment. Under Ingersoll management, efficiency and profits have increased, but the newspaper no longer has the reputation of being the best for its size in New England. As Mr. Ghiglione mentions, and as the case histories here demonstrate again and again, the bottom line has a great deal to do with how newspapers are managed by newspaper chains. But what ''The Buying and Selling of America's Newspapers'' does not offer readers who are not already familiar with the economics of operating such newspapers is a means of recognizing prudent management from plundering. Mr. Ghiglione could have added greatly to the depth of his book if he had added a chapter explaining the tension between being a practical businessman and an idealistic newspaperman, something he surely understands.B

1236-> SEVEN MISTAKES INVESTORS MAKE OVER AND OVER
IF investors were ranked according to their skill, the results would resemble a bell-shaped curve. At one end would be a very small number of individuals who did extremely well, and, at the other, a very small number who did extremely poorly. The overwhelming majority's per- formance would be average, falling in the middle of the curve. But investors who find themselves in this middle territory frequently end up with investment results that underperform the market averages. After they pay fees and commissions to brokers and investment managers, their average returns often are, well, less than average. To improve their chances of greater returns, professionals say, investors need to be aware of common investment pitfalls and steer clear of them. ''There are lots of ways to lose money,'' said Dennis G. Sherva, director of research at Morgan, Stanley & Company. The professionals identify seven mistakes that trip investors time and time again. These investing sins are not just committed by the amateur, they say. As the joke on Wall Street goes, the professional is an amateur with a Quotron machine on his desk. The first and most basic mistake is having too little diversification. Richard Abramson, a partner at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, says that in the more than 500 portfolios he has examined over the years, very few are properly diversified to spread risk among asset classes, such as stocks, bonds and real estate. And, too often, stock portions are too concentrated in a few industries or stock sectors. ''They are overly concentrated in utilities or small stocks,'' he said. ''When a broker sells you something, it usually is what you want, not what you need.'' Investors should decide how much risk they can live with, and invest accordingly, added Michael A. Petrino, a managing director of Prudential Asset Management Company in Newark. For example, those who can stand the risk might want to put the bulk of their assets in stocks. Others, who decide they cannot stomach the ups and downs of the stock market, might want more of their assets in relatively stable investments, such as annuities, bonds and money market funds. Craig Virden, for instance, who works in publishing in New York, said that when he invests in speculative ventures, he invests only as much as he is willing to lose. Professionals know of no magic number of stocks that insures a proper diversity of assets. But, probably, an individual investor needs to spend at least $15,000 in the stock market to diversify enough. Overly diversified portfolios, on the other hand, can result in mediocre performance, academic studies have shown. The odds of one person being able to find increas- ing numbers of superior stocks are too high, the professionals say. A second common mistake is paying too much for a stock. People usually do not buy items they think are overvalued. Rather, they look for bargains. ''When you buy a dress, you are going to try to buy it at a discount,'' said Suresh L. Bhirud, investment strategist at the First Boston Corporation. ''But most investors pay a fair value for their stocks, instead of buying them when they are undervalued. It's tough to beat the market when you're buying fairly valued stocks.'' Bernstein's Mr. Abramson pointed out that investors shy away from the bargain stocks because of what makes them bargains in the first place. Pointing to the money center bank stocks, such as Citibank and Chase Manhattan, which were shunned early this year, he remarked, ''What broker says, 'I've got a bargain for you: these banks with their Latin American exposure.' '' A third pitfall is lack of discipline when it comes to selling stocks. Professionals, as well as individual investors, ''tend to ride a stock up and then back down again,'' said Jettie Edwards, who monitors hundreds of investment firms for Buck Pension Fund Services in New York. Only a handful of investors, she finds, decide the stock's fair value before they buy and then sell when it reaches that price. For example, Kevin Sullivan, an executive recruiter in New York, recalled that he bought a stock in the mid-1970's based on a tip that the company would be acquired. He bought it at 10 and watched it jump to 12 the next day, The merger was suppose to occur at 18. But the stock never reached that level and the merger never took place. Mr Sullivan, who did not sell the stock, watched as it collapsed to 3. The lesson he learned was ''cut your losses'' when an expected event does not occur. Investors do not sell, say professionals, because they ''fall in love'' with the stock. They think that it will climb forever in value. This investing mistake happens because investors do not stick with their objectives. They buy a stock with a goal in mind, but when it does not happen, they still continue to hang on. ''If you think a stock is going to triple and it doesn't, sell it,'' recommended Laszlo Birinyi Jr., an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. Buying fad stocks is a fourth temptation for individual investors. Often they come in just when the smart money is moving out. The stock may continue to increase in price for a short time, but inevitably the pyramid collapses. Fad stocks in recent years, said Mr. Abramson, included the high-technology stocks in 1983 and the energy stocks in 1980. Both groups soared and then fell dramatically, after many investors were drawn in. Investors often get pulled into these investments because they committed a fifth egregious error: They invested after hearing a ''hot tip,'' rather than after conducting the necessary research, often arduous and boring, on the company and its industry. ''If you take a walk down Wall Street, you will not find people handing out $50 bills,'' said Salomon's Mr. Birinyi, who said that he hears innumerable tips sitting on the trading desk at Salomon Brothers. ''Maybe one out of 25 is worth something,'' he said. But while buying a much-talked-about stock may seem hard to resist, often buying an unpopular issue is far more rewarding. For example, the Fidelity Magellan Fund gained national attention, and billions of dollars from new investors, only after Peter Lynch, its manager, went out on a limb and invested 5 percent of the fund in the Chrysler Corporation at the very bottom of the recession. Buying unpopular issues may often prove a better strategy than buying everyone's favorites. But beware of trying to time the market. Professionals and academics point to statistical studies that show that picking market peaks and bottoms - the sixth common mistake - is almost impossible. Nevertheless, investors often swing large parts of their portfolios out of stocks and into cash instruments when they think that the stock market is about to turn down. But while they avoid bear markets, they often fail to buy back stocks at the right time. Thus, they often miss a large part of the market's move. ''The game is against you,'' said Mr. Abramson. Indeed, in August, many fund managers had more than one-half of their portfolios parked in cash when the market shot up. They failed to get into the market in time to enjoy the upswing. Investors who move into cash to avoid bear markets may find they have missed the bull market as well. As a result, a majority of professional investors prefer to stick with stocks through bull and bear markets. They try to protect their portfolios in down markets by owning high-yielding, defensive issues, which do not decline as much. Finally, investors err because they do not know when, and when not, to cut stocks. For example, when someone buys a stock that is cheap and unpopular, he might have to wait for months, or years, before other investors find it attractive and bid it up in price, Mr. Abramson said. With these stocks, he advised, even if the stock declines in price, investors should not sell. They, in fact, should consider bu3ing even more shares. But investors who buy growth stocks, or more aggressive high fliers, may have to take a different approach. When these stocks begin falling, say professional investors who specialize in buying them, reconsider the investment and perhaps sell out the position. Sometimes, investors simply have to accept that the stock may not have been such a good pick after all. If an aggressive high flier goes into a dive, it may be time to bail out. How does an investor distinguish between stocks that are worth hanging on to and stocks that are not worth holding for long? Investors should consult with their brokers, but, in general, stocks that are in a temporary slide because the market is down might be worth holding for some time. For instance, energy stocks were knocked down earlier this year, but are expected eventually to rebound, although perhaps not for years. On the other hand, high-tech stocks in the early 1980's were high fliers. These stocks often rapidly rise to prominence, only to fall just as quickly. Steven A. Kroll, executive vice president at E.F. Hutton & Company, said, ''You have to turn around and say, 'I made a mistake.' '' He said that a warning signal comes when you get ''that little rash on the back of the neck, and you start to defend the stock.'' Remember, he said, ''this is not your kid.''

1237-> THE CITY; 2Killed and 6 Hurt In Bronx Collision
Two people were killed and six were injured yesterday when one car struck another broadside on Decatur Avenue in the Bronx, the police said. The driver of one of the cars, Fransisco Canales, 28 years old, of 2685 Valentine Avenue in the Bronx, was charged with manslaughter and drunken driving. Sgt. Peter Sweeney said Mr. Canales was driving south on Decatur at about 4:30 A.M. when he went through a stop sign at 196th Street and rammed a car carrying six people. Two men in their 30's in the car were killed and four women were hurt, Sergeant Sweeney said. All were removed through the roof of the car, which was cut open by a rescue squad. Sergeant Sweeney declined to identify the victims until their families were told. He said Mr. Canales and the only passenger in his car, Carlos Diaz, 27, were treated at Jacobi Hospital in the Bronx and released.

1239-> BRIEFING ; Rank? Did You Say Rank?
No one is more sensitive about rank and its subtle gradations than Washington bureaucrats. Even their jokes on the subject often have a cutting edge. The other day a State Department officer had completed one of those anonymous ''background'' briefings for the White House press corps, and the group was reminded by an aide that the source was to be identified in print only as ''an Administration official.'' ''Couldn't you make that 'senior Administration official'?'' asked the source, only half in jest.

1240-> BEATRICE CHEMICAL UNIT TO I.C.I. FOR $750 MILLION
As part of its effort to return to its roots as a food and consumer products company, the Beatrice Companies announced today that it had signed a definitive agreement to sell its chemical operations to Imperial Chemical Industries P.L.C. of London for $750 million in cash. The transaction should be completed in late February 1985, Beatrice said. Today's announcement followed Wednesday's news that Beatrice had agreed to sell its agricultural products, leather and graphic arts operations to separate buyers for $117 million. Since the Chicago-based conglomerate acquired Esmark Inc. for $2.7 billion last August, James L. Dutt, Beatrice's chairman, has repeatedly stated the company's commitment to shed more than $1 billion in businesses to help pay off the debt incurred by the Esmark acquisition. ''Beatrice has always made good money with its specialty chemicals, but it's really getting back to its basic strengths by concentrating on consumer products,'' said John P. Larson, an analyst with Blunt, Ellis & Loewi in Milwaukee. For the six months ended Aug. 31, Beatrice earned $173 million on sales of $5.4 billion. Those figures included two months of Esmark operations. John C. Bierbusse, with Duff & Phelps in Chicago, said Mr. Dutt had ''enhanced his credibility'' by meeting his divestiture target. ''A lot of people were suspicious of Beatrice's ability to generate that level of proceeds,'' Mr. Bierbusse said. ''But they've done it sooner rather than later.'' According to Peter M. Aslet, an I.C.I. spokesman in New York, the key ''growth elements'' in the acquisition were the Fiberite Corporation of Winona, Minn., which manufactures advanced composite materials used in the military and aerospace industries, and the LNP Corporation of Malvern, Pa., a supplier of molded plastic compounds. Other companies that I.C.I. is purchasing from Beatrice include Stahl Finish and Paule Chemical, suppliers of leather finishes, based in Peabody, Mass; Polyvinyl Chemical Industries, a Wilmington, Mass., manufacturer of resins and binders for paints and coatings; the Converters Ink Company, a Linden, N.J., manufacturer of printing inks, and Thoro System Products, a Miami manufacturer of concrete waterproofing and finishing materials.

1241-> PROSPECTS; Horsing Around for Fun
The nation's horse population is once again thriving as more people, especially in the heavily populated Northeast and in California, take up riding for recreation. According to the Agriculture Department, there were 8.4 million horses of all breeds galloping about in 1983, up from 6.2 million in 1971 - with much of the growth in recent years. That's still a far cry from the peak of more than 25 million horses and mules back in 1920, when the auto finally began to transform the nation's transportation system, making the horse superfluous. The horse population reached a low point of 3 million animals in the 1950's, after the Army abolished the horse cavalry, explained Ami Shinitzky, editor and publisher of Equus magazine in Gaithersburg, Md. ''And farmers, too, had mechanized by that time,'' he said. But Mr. Shinitzky noted that the number of horses began to grow again during the Presidency of John F. Kennedy, whose wife, Jacqueline, popularized riding. ''Since then, riding academies, boarding stables and recreational facilities offering horseback riding have proliferated,'' spawning a bit of an industry, despite the growth of vexing zoning laws.

1243-> THE REGION; Stay of Execution Ordered in Jersey
The State Supreme Court today stayed the execution of a convicted murderer and allowed the State Public Defender's office to pursue an appeal on his behalf. In a one-page order, the court denied the request of the murderer, James J. Koedatich, that he be killed by lethal injection Dec. 18, as scheduled. He would be the first person executed since New Jersey restored capital punishment in August 1982. The court said Mr. Koedatich could raise arguments during the appeal. The public defender and the State Attorney General have sought to stay the execution at least until the capital-punishment law can be tested in court. Mr. Koedatich, 36 years old, of Morristown, has said that he is not guilty but that he does not want to endure a life prison term for the the abduction and stabbing death of an 18- year-old student from Parsippany- Troy Hills, Amie Hoffman, on Nov. 23, 1982. He was convicted and sentenced last October.

1244-> SHOP FOR 19TH-CENTURY COLLECTORS
What do Gloria Vanderbilt, Yves Saint Laurent and Andy Warhol have in common? All collect Victorian furniture, and they have for years. Now, these design-conscious style setters are no longer alone. There are scores of new collectors - actors, writers, investment bankers, lawyers and stockbrokers - many under the age of 35, who are pursuing Victorian designs produced in the United States and abroad between 1840 and 1900. They vie with museums for the finest examples. Supplying them all are a band of young dealers stocking quality European and American selections, which include Greek, Gothic, Rococo, Elizabethan, Egyptian and Renaissance Revival as well as the Japanese-influenced pieces. Indeed, there are almost as many approaches to collecting Victoriana as there are furniture styles. The most adventurous collectors try to find mechanically innovative and stylistically extreme examples. To them, the more eccentric, romantic and historically exaggerated a chair, cabinet or table the better. Gothic chairs of the Middle Ages never boasted such arches and boldly carved tracery as the 19th-century interpretations. And chairs were never framed in sphinxes until a century ago. Other more cautious collectors prefer blander, familiar designs: 19th-century copies of the 18th-century furnishings at Versailles, for example. The attraction increases when they realize that these neo-classical and Rococo Revival pieces are among the most deftly made period furniture designs available today. Another major reason: Most are still affordable. The finest chairs and tables may command prices in four, five and six figures, but 18th-century examples of comparable quality are at least twice, and much as 10 times, the price. Enthusiasts for the nineteenth-century began in the early 1960's to buy the Victorian designs of John Henry Belter, the German-born designer who filled American parlors with Rococo Revival designs: weighty and curvaceous chairs, tables and sofas, all poised on high-heeled legs. Joseph T. Butler, the urbane curator and director of Sleepy Hollow Restorations in Tarrytown, N.Y., pioneered more than 20 years ago in collecting Victorian pieces and writing about the period. His book, ''American Antiques 1800 to 1900,'' published in 1965, was one of the first to suggest it was time to look again at 19th-century furniture. ''Victorian has had a bad press forever,'' said Margot Johnson, whose shop is at 40 West 40th Street. ''I think of Victorian as happy furniture, and it makes me smile. A lot of it, especially the American pieces, is romantic or it has an exotic eccentricity that is wonderful.'' Miss Johnson's American versions number several suites or individual pieces by Herter Brothers, a prestigious maker, including an ebonized cherry three-piece bedroom set in the Japanese style with floral inlay at $95,000. (It is a bedroom in this styling that Andy Warhol bought eight years ago, when prices were half what they are today.) There's an eccentric book-shaped table in the Renaissance style at $15,000 and an exotic Gothic Revival oak side chair at $5,500. ''Why Victorian?'' asked Herve Aaron of Didier Aaron, the Paris- based antiques concern at 32 East 67th Street. ''It is a period of discovery for collectors - and for us.'' He said that today's collectors are tired of the pure architectural simplicity of Bauhaus and other modern design, and they are bored with the 18th century too. Mr. Aaron favors American Victorian but also stocks European versions, including a German Gothic Revival suite: a desk, four chairs and two tables at $46,000. An American pair of Egyptian Revival chairs is $7,500. Richard McGeehan is a 26-year-old Bedford Hills, N.Y., dealer. His stock, which can be seen by appointment (telephone 914-241-3815), includes an Egyptian Revival sphinx- framed side chair awash with gilding, attributed to Potier & Stymus at $12,000, and a Renaissance Revival Eastlake bedroom suite of bird's-eye maple beds, dressing tables, a table and chairs, with carved flowers, gargoyles and crocodile heads, at $25,000 for the set. Melinda Florian Papp and William Papp, the grandchildren of Florian Papp, the late founder of the English antiques concern at 962 Madison Avenue (at 75th Street), have introduced Victorian pieces there. A handsome Gothic Revival oak sideboard dominating the entranceway is $14,500. A pair of 1840's Gothic oak chairs is $1,600 the pair and a Renaissance- styled cabinet with incised geometric motifs, ring pulls and a plinth base is $6,800. Mimi Findlay operates out of a loft, on the second floor at 1556 Third Avenue (at 87th Street). Her hours are Wednesday through Friday, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. She says most of her stock in all of the revival styles is unlabeled, including an Elizabethan Revival chair with a tufted needlework seat at $450. Among the exceptions is a Herter Brothers display cabinet in ebonized wood at $36,000. Eileen and Richard Dubrow, who were among the first to specialize in Rococo Revival and the Wooton Patent desks used in Wells Fargo offices a century ago, work out of their home in Queens and appear at antiques shows. They now stock other Renaissance Revival designs. Telephone: 212-767-9758. Address: Box 128, Bayside, Queens, N.Y. 11361. The Victorian designs sold at auction at Christie's, Sotheby's, William Doyle Galleries and Phillips Son & Neale are usually European and most are 19th-century copies of 18th-century styles. There are two categories of Victorian sales at Sotheby's, York Avenue at 72d Street. The finer offerings have furniture from $1,500 for a simple desk or pair of chairs to $60,000 for a signed Rococo Revival suite of parlor chairs and sofa. The Arcade sales, offering less valuable antiques, have pairs of chairs at $400 up. ''English Victorian represents the best buy,'' said Elaine Whitmire, Sotheby's Victorian specialist. ''Prices are low and the quality is exceptional.''

1245-> NEW SERVICE MATCHES ELDERLY WITH HOMES FOR FOSTER CARE
Jeanette Vaughan is in the matchmaking business. She finds foster homes for ailing older people. Her service brings together elderly people who may need help walking, bathing or feeding themselves and foster families who want to earn extra income. Mrs. Vaughan's service is an alternative to more costly convalescent homes or live-in nurses. Before she places elderly clients, they and their families meet with prospective foster families. ''We would never place anyone together who thought they couldn't get along,'' she said. The elderly clients or their families pay a fee to Mrs. Vaughan, a nurse. And she pays the foster families $500 a month for each client. The families also receive regular days off and one week's paid vacation in their first year of service. Convalescent homes and live-in nurses generally charge about $1,200 a month for similar services, Mrs. Vaughan said. ''This gives people a cheaper alternative and more personal type of care,'' she said. Five-Day Training Class Mrs. Vaughan, a 22-year-old registered nurse, trains the prospective foster families in an intensive five-day class that emphasizes, among other things, home health aid skills, nutrition and communications skills. The program, Senior Foster Services, provides four separate types of foster care: full-time service, a short- term care program for people needing help immediately after a hospital stay, interim care for those needing help between hospital visits, and eight-hour day care. The program does not handle people with major health problems. Since Mrs. Vaughan began her service in July she has trained 15 families and placed four elderly people with foster families. At this point, she said, she is breaking even on costs. Her service, the only one licensed by the state of Texas, is modeled on a program started two years ago by St. Francis Hospital in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. Assisted by her husband, Doug, also a nurse, Mrs. Vaughan visits clients at the foster homes once a week to assure that the foster families are providing the agreed-upon care. Contact With Natural Families For example, she said, elderly clients must have some contact with their natural families at least once a week, and foster families must plan at least one activity with the clients each week. Foster families cannot administer medicine, she said. Most of the foster families are divorced or widowed women or older couples, Mrs. Vaughan said. ''It not only helps the clients,'' she explained, ''it's a good way for some families to bring in some extra money - especially for older single women.'' ''The more you involve the senior citizen, the more they'll get back from any program,'' she said. ''This program forces them to become involved with people.'' Mrs. Vaughan said she first thought of a foster care program for the elderly when she was working on a research paper on alternative health care for the elderly at West Texas State University. ''Of course, it's not for every senior citizen,'' she said. ''Sometimes, the only route can be a nursing home. But for those that can work within its constraints, I think it's the best option around.''

1248-> SPORTS PEOPLE; First Words
It must have been quite a piece of apple pie, because when Ed Reinhardt had finished it, he said, ''I'm full.'' It was a routine enough comment except for one fact: Those were the first words that Reinhardt, the Colorado tight end, had spoken since he suffered a severe head injury in a game against Oregon on Sept. 15 and fell into a coma. According to Craig Hospital in Denver, the words were spoken during last week, as Reinhardt continued to improve on a program of rehabilitation that began last month.

1249-> THE BUREAUCRACY; TO CZAR OR NOT TO CZAR
There is an iron law of bureaucracy that goes as follows: If the formal decision- making system is not working the President's presumed will, create an informal one to work around the obstacles; failing that, make personnel changes to remove the obstacles; and if unwilling to do that, add some new faces to the team to change the power balance and get things moving. It seems President Reagan is seriously contemplating the last move as a way of ending the gridlock within his own team on arms control and getting negotiations with the Soviet Union going again. To this end, senior Administration officials were saying at the end of last week that Mr. Reagan was inclined toward creating an arms control special envoy or, maybe even beyond that, a ''czar.'' Predictably, the idea has generated little enthusiasm and a good deal of opposition from the vested bureaucratic interests who fear that their power and prerogatives might be curtailed. This is true even for some in the State Department who want to make progress in the suspended arms control talks with Moscow. A Volatile Area Such an arrangement has had mixed results in such areas as energey and the Middle East but has never been tried in the politically and ideologically volatile area of arms control. To Peter Tarnoff, who was a kind of bureaucratic czar as the State Department's Executive Secretary from 1977 to 1981, ''Only the President can be the czar and only the Secretary of State can be the special envoy on such a controversial and vital national security issue.'' ''If senior officials lose a fight with the czar, they have the right to go to the President for redress and will, and only the Secretary of State will be taken as authoritative by the Russians,'' said Mr. Tarnoff, who is now executive director of the Northern California World Affairs Council. In other words, the fights will not go away as long as people with substantial differences control the major departments and agencies. One Who Favors the Envoy Idea Sol Linowitz, who served as President Carter's special envoy for the Panama Canal negotiations and later for the Middle East, said he thought the special envoy idea could work. ''But it may be at a certain point you may want to replace the envoy with the Secretary of State,'' he said. Mr. Linowitz feels the idea can succeed only if the envoy is perceived as close to the President, can speak with confidence in behalf of the President, is familiar with the issues and has a great deal of patience and commitment to reaching agreement. As he described what he did, Mr. Linowitz went to Panama with the ''full authority of the President'' and without ''specific negotiating instructions.'' He could ''explore all permutations and combinations,'' then bring these ideas back to Washington to explore proposals and compromises. He succeeded in bringing home a Panama Canal treaty, but he did not make much progress on the Middle East. Others preceded and succeeded him as special Middle East envoy. But the only ones who were actually able to reach Middle East agreements were Henry A. Kissinger as Secretary of State negotiating the Israeli-Egyptian troop separation pact in 1973 and President Carter and Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance negotiating the 1978 Camp David accords between Israel and Egypt. Of New Ideas and Elephants To Mr. Tarnoff, the Middle East situation is more like the arms control arena than the Panama Canal talks - ''tougher internally and externally,'' he said. The idea of the special envoy seems more viable to Administration officials than does the czar idea. An energy czar was established by President Nixon and by statute, in effect, in 1973 after the Arab oil boycott. But the czar was soon transformed into an established office in the White House and then into the Energy Department itself. To work, most agreed, the czar needed a bureaucratic and institutional base. Besides, as a high-level Administration official commented: ''There is no way Shultz or Weinberger or McFarlane would stand for that on arms control. These are the elephants who head the most important departments and agencies.'' He was referring to Secretary of State George P. Shultz, Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger and Robert C. McFarlane, the national security adviser. Officials credit Mr. McFarlane and his staff with the envoy idea. Mr. Shultz's position is variously described as for, against and neutral. One of his aides said, ''Shultz was one of those who started this ball rolling,'' and another said, ''He would resign if it happened.'' Either the envoy or the czar would impinge substantially on the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency's role as home and protector of the arms control negotiator and negotiating team. For example, the current arms control negotiators have their offices in this agency and are serviced by its staff. Pentagon civilians such as Richard N. Perle, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Internaitonal Security Policy, oppose either the czar or the special envoy as unnecessary. Mr. Perle and his colleagues say the problem of making arms control agreements is not with Administration proposals but with Kremlin intransigence. Joint Chiefs Not Enthused The Joint Chiefs of Staff are not bubbling over with enthusiasm, either. As a military officer put it, ''they don't like'' anything that is outside the normal routine, where they believe their full institutional voice might not be heard. To a number of officials inside the Administration and arms control experts on the outside, an envoy might help, as Mr. Linowitz said, but the problem runs deeper. Officials acknowledge two critical factors: the deep and abiding differences among them on arms control and the general lack of knowledge among senior officials of the subject matter. As has happened in every Administration, every arms control issue in dispute, no matter how small and technical, has been taken to the National Security Council and the President for resolution. Many Administration officials concede that with the exception of Mr. McFarlane, the other principals around the table still have not mastered all the material. As one experienced official put it, ''Everyone agrees that the people sitting with Nixon, Ford and Carter knew much more about these issues than the current bunch.'' A number of officials who have fought in the trenches on arms control for almost four years said they were happy that Mr. Reagan was contemplating the envoy and czar ideas as a sign of a new commitment to arms control on his part. But the view of these old hands is that it will take more than Presidential commitment and more than a special envoy.

1251-> SORTING OUT THE CONFUSION AFTER A.T.& T.'S BREAKUP
JEWEL MORGAN, a retired social services worker in Westchester County, held 40 shares of American Telephone and Telegraph Company stock for 25 years. She was one of 3.2 million shareholders who put their faith in the world's largest company, and over the years Ma Bell did not fail her or other shareholders, at least when it came to the sanctity of the dividend. But all became confusion with the breakup of A.T.& T. last Jan. 1. Mrs. Morgan, for instance, could have received a package of stock - 40 shares in the new A.T.& T., plus four shares in each of the seven new regional phone companies that were established at the time - in return for her 40 shares of the old A.T.& T. She decided instead on another A.T.& T. option - to take the new A.T.& T. stock and to consolidate the shares of the seven regional companies into one regional company, paying a small fee to A.T.& T., which acted as stockbroker. Although Mrs. Morgan lives in an area served by the new regional telephone company called Nynex, she decided to put all her eggs in the Bell South basket. People she knew in the phone business advised her that Bell South, in the Sunbelt, was likely to grow faster than phone companies in the Frostbelt. Mrs. Morgan also read that the new A.T.& T., devoid of its regional companies, was now an enterprise with long-distance service and equipment manufacturing - and with dreams of creating new telecommunications and computer businesses. That was too risky for her, she decided. She cashed in the A.T.& T. stock, putting the money in bank savings. Many Wall Street securities analysts say Mrs. Morgan made the right move. Financially conservative investors, they say, should go with the regional companies - which are regulated utilities - for the dividend yields. A.T.& T. has become a stock for institutions and those willing to take a risk on the growth potential of its largely untested businesses. ''We'll have to wait and see whether they can be competitive in high tech,'' said John S. Bain, an analyst at Shearson Lehman/American Express. ''They are the largest long-distance company and they make good equipment, but that's not a growth company. They have to do other things to become a hot issue.'' The company is going through a transition, from one concerned with dividend yield to one worried about growth. In mid-October, A.T.& T. announced third quarter earnings that were disappointing to some analysts. As for Mrs. Morgan's decision to go with one regional company instead of owning a piece of all seven, analysts are divided. Some say she was right, noting that certain regionals have an edge, but other analysts say the regionals are horses of the same color. ''The market, at least, seems to be treating these companies as virtually interchangeable,'' said Mr. Bain. ''Every one of these companies has done well.'' Edward M. Greenberg of Sanford C. Bernstein & Company added that the regional companies ''are all regulated companies and their rates of return don't vary that much.'' In addition to Bell South, Bell Atlantic, Nynex and Ameritech, there are Pacific Telesis, Southwestern Bell and U.S. West. Some analysts perceive differences among the regional companies. Harold McKinney, head of the investment policy committee for Fleet Financial, a bank based in Providence, R.I., said the bank decided to concentrate on Bell South and Bell Atlantic, selling the other five regional company stocks. ''We looked for growth, a favorable regulatory climate in the areas served and the demographics of the area,'' Mr. McKinney said. ''We felt Bell South and Bell Atlantic had a chance to grow 7 percent a year with an 8 percent dividend yield for a return of 15 percent.'' At Salomon Brothers Inc., where research is directed at institutions and not individual investors, Neil Yelsey, a telephone analyst, said firm analysts liked three regionals - U.S. West, Bell South and Ameritech. Salomon analysts are neutral on the shares of A.T.& T., he said. Although the old Ma Bell thrived on a huge stockholder base that demanded high earnings to go toward dividends, the smaller, independent offspring find that servicing all these stockholders is expensive. In an attempt to reduce the large base of shareholders - more than three million - inherited from A.T.& T., three of the regional companies, Ameritech, U.S. West and Pacific Telesis, offered to buy back stock from investors holding fewer than 50 shares. Holders were able to sell their stock to the company without paying a brokerage fee or commission. U.S. West reported that from late June until late August it closed 240,000 individual accounts, cutting U.S. West's total shareholder base to 1.25 million. Pacific Telesis said that in June and July 154,000 of its 1.5 million shareholders took advantage of its offer to buy back shares. There are ways to invest in telephone company stocks besides buying the stock outright. Many brokerage firms offer telephone and telecommunications mutual funds, which invest in companies throughout the industry. In addition, some funds recreate the old Ma Bell by investing in A.T.& T. and the regionals. Merrill Lynch & Company, E.F. Hutton & Company and several others offer these funds for a fee. They deliver one dividend check, which can be reinvested. These unit trusts have sold well, according to Wall Street brokerage firms. E.F. Hutton's fund, for example, is three months old and has sold seven million shares with a market value of some $420 million. ''They have been very successful,'' a spokesman said. So far the funds have done better than the new A.T.& T., which has been flat, and not as well as the regional companies, which have been up about 15 percent. A fund that is traded on the New York Stock Exchange is Ameritrust, which created two kinds of shares from the old A.T.& T. - one paying dividend income and another paying capital gains. The capital gains paying shares were recently trading at 7 1/4 and the dividend paying shares at 62 1/2, while the reconstructed aggregate value of the old A.T.& T. was at 70 1/4. For the sophisticated, the New York Stock Exchange trades options on its telephone index, consisting of A.T.& T. and the seven regionals. An option represents the right either to buy or sell a defined amount of the underlying index at a contracted price by a specified date. Ma Bell's reputation died hard, however. ''Ma Bell was a religion in the 50's,'' Mr. McKinney of Fleet Financial recalled. Mrs. Morgan, for instance, bought A.T.& T. stock years ago because of its reputation as a safe investment. Over the years, she said, she did not lose money, but she did not make a great deal of money either. But when the price of the stock languished for years and when interest rates began to rise, she figures she perhaps should have sold despite A.T.& T.'s solid reputation. She could have done at least as well with her money safely in the bank.

1252-> MAKING WEIGHT A PROBLEM FOR BUMPHUS
Johnny Bumphus is obviously getting too big for his World Boxing Association 140- pound championship belt. His first junior-welterweight title defense, Friday night here against Gene (Mad Dog) Hatcher, could well be his last. Not that Hatcher, an earnest, plod- ahead club fighter ranked seventh by the W.B.A., figures to upset the smooth, undefeated southpaw. The 23-year-old champion has been straining to keep 140 pounds on his 6-foot frame since he was an 18-year-old amateur champion and has appeared weak in recent fights. ''At 143 pounds, Bump would be 100- 1 to win,'' said Dan Duva, the promoter whose father, Lou, is a co-manager of Bumphus. ''At 139 or 140, it's only 4-1.'' The Duvas plan to move Bumphus into the 147-pound welterweight class after the Hatcher bout and after one 10-rounder hope to match him with Milton McCrory, the World Boxing Council champion. They are not as interested in meeting Hatcher's stablemate, Donald Curry, who holds the W.B.A. 147-pound title. Not to worry. Curry will probably be moving up in weight class, too. His manager, Dave Gorman, said that after the July title defense against Nino LaRocca of Italy, Curry would probably explore the 154-pound junior-middleweight division ''and go after guys like Thomas Hearns and Wilfred Benitez.'' ''There's really nothing left for Donald at 147 anyway,'' said Gorman. ''We'd love to unify the title, but McCrory won't fight us. He's got no guts. The only other fight would be with Aaron Pryor, which I think would make a perfect match.'' Bumphus won the W.B.A. title, vacated last year by Pryor, but was not impressive in outpointing Lorenzo Garcia of Argentina last January. George Benton, his trainer, knew Bumphus would not look good against Garcia, but told his charge, ''Win the title and you'll look great in your next fight.'' ''This is my next fight,'' said Bumphus today. Hatcher's style would seem perfect for the counterpunching Bumphus. In fact, Gorman had turned down the same $75,000 purse for Hatcher to take $50,000 to meet Howard Davis Jr. earlier this year, a fight that was canceled when Hatcher suffered a cut over his left eye in training. A victory over Davis would have put Hatcher in line to challenge Pryor for the International Boxing Federation junior- welterweight title. Gorman's strategy - having to beat two fine fighters, Davis and Pryor, to win a title instead of just meeting Bumphus - was not as strange as it appeared. ''I felt Gene would beat Davis and then we could be in the driver's seat,'' said Gorman. ''Then we'd have gotten a lot more for a Bumphus fight.'' Gorman also said he took the Davis bout out of ''loyalty'' to Bob Arum, who had promoted Hatcher into contender status, and objected to the larger Duva offer for a Bumphus fight because of the options involved. Arum is predicting Hatcher will win what is basically the preliminary bout to Ray (Boom Boom) Mancini's defense of the W.B.A. lightweight title against Livingstone Bramble. Only three years ago, when he and Duva worked together on the NBC production ''Tomorrow's Champions,'' Arum raved about Bumphus. ''He has the talent of a Ray Leonard,'' said Arum. Today's final news conference for Friday night's nationally televised bouts (Channel 5 in New York) was attended by four armed and uniformed policemen - a precaution against the possibility that the inflammable Bramble and Mancini might start proceedings earlier than scheduled - and Bramble's voodoo doctor from the Virgin Islands. Bramble, a native of the Virgin Islands, does not believe in voodoo. But his father does and the fighter said he would ''honor'' the customs of the islands. Bramble would identify the voodoo doctor only as ''Doctor Doo'' and would not talk about him. The voodoo doctor, a teacher from St. Croix dressed in a red robe, dark glasses and black derby hat, stared intently at Mancini. So far, his spells have had little effect on the champion. ''Mostly it's affected our TV reception,'' said Dave Wolf, Mancini's manager. ''We can't get ESPN.''

1253-> SOFTWARE TO MANAGE PORTFOLIOS
NOT long ago, using a personal computer as an investing tool was still more art than science. Just ask Patricia Lehrburger. Bitten by the technical investing bug four years ago, Miss Lehrburger decided that she wanted a computer to draw her graphs with moving averages. But finding the software to do the job was tricky then. ''The situation was a lot different,'' Miss Lehrburger said. ''We had to hunt to see where we could get this program and where we could get that one. Today there is so much more software that it's bewildering.'' Investors today can choose from hundreds of software programs, much of it more sophisticated than the early programs. It is no longer necessary to patch together an investing system from separate communications and graphics programs, as Miss Lehrburger did. But this has created another problem: how to find the right software program. ''The hardware exists, and the software is out there,'' said Thomas A. Meyers, president of the American Association of Microcomputer Investors, ''but the problem is that many people have trouble locating software that meets their personal needs or matches a particular strategy.'' ''We tell our members to begin by defining a specific strategy,'' said Mr. Meyers. ''Then, we suggest they find the software that will do what they want to do, and then to go out and buy the hardware. Unfortunately, that's not the way a lot of people start. The first thing they do is buy the machine.'' Investing strategies - and the software to implement them - are conventionally divided into two categories: technical analysis and fundamental analysis. Technical analysis is the study of charts that convey price movements and other market indicators. Fundamental analysis concentrates on companies' basic financial information. A third branch of investing software, portfolio management, tracks an individual's holdings of stocks, bonds or commodities. Technical Analysis Miss Lehrburger knew that her orientation and philosophy would be technical. ''You can get a feeling for what's happening to a stock or an industry by watching the charts,'' Miss Lehrburger said. ''You're not going to be 100 percent accurate, but you can get some predictive feeling.'' She has traded her original Apple II for a Texas Instruments Professional Computer on which she follows the charts of about 250 stocks and industry groups, using the Dow Jones Market Analyzer program. Prices are fed into the program through the Window-on-Wall-Street package, a software and hardware package that works like the pocket stock quote devices. Using the program, Miss Lehrburger is able to get immediate prices from the stock exchange and other technical trading data. Miss Lehrburger says she is very happy with the Dow Jones Market Analyzer software. But other quality programs exist as well, such as the Savant Corporation's Technical Investor, Anidata Inc.'s Market Analyst and Summa Software's Winning on Wall Street, although these programs have not attracted as many buyers as the Market Analyzer. ''Investment software vendors are stuck,'' Mr. Meyers said. ''Computer stores can't afford to give much shelf space to specialty programs so they end up stocking only the very biggest names. Other manufacturers depend on selling by taking an ad in Barron's or by direct mail, and there's really no percentage in that. Prices stay high because they have to recover their investment on fewer sales.'' Before buying a program, investors should decide what they need it to do. Three features form the core of the technical analysis packages now available: retrieving data from an on- line data base, drawing price charts with moving averages and resistance lines, and printing copies of the charts and data. More sophisticated - and more expensive - packages might offer point-and-figure charting, in which only significant price changes in securites are charted, as well as the ability to view the charts of several securities simultaneously and the ability to draw on several data bases, which charge fees each time they are used. Finally, new computer users are advised to find out if the manufacturer actively supports the package, for example, by maintaining a toll-free telephone number to answer users' questions. Fundamental John B. Kilroy sits across the aisle from Miss Lehrburger in terms of investment philosophy. ''I have a minimal interest in the technical analysis,'' said the director of corporate finance for Betz Laboratories in Philadelphia. Instead, Mr. Kilroy puts his I.B.M. personal computer to work as a fundamental analysis tool. ''I use the computer to differentiate between those issues the market is overpaying for and those that it's underpaying for in terms of performance,'' Mr. Kilroy said. ''The goal is to find the undervalued companies. Then I do my own research to find out about the company's outlook.'' Mr. Kilroy says he does not make use of the on-line data bases in his research because ''they're all too expensive.'' Instead, he uses Standard & Poor's Stockpak II and Value Line's Value/Screen. These programs and others such as Dow Jones Market Microscope that make use of electronic data bases allow investors like Mr. Kilroy to set up a series of tests. For instance, an investor might want a list of stocks with lower than average price-to-earnings ratios and higher than average earnings growth. The computer scans thousands of issues to select stocks that meet those criteria and then ranks them by either criterion. Alternatively, an investor might want to look up financial information available on a company. Fundamental analysis has only recently become practical as microcomputers have increased in power and storage capacity , and, consequently, there are fewer choices here than in technical analysis software. Investors are again advised to be specific about their needs before buying. The Standard & Poor's and Value Line programs include subscriptions to a data base on diskettes, and once a month purchasers receive new disks that contain updated information. In a single operation, S.&P.'s Stockpak can sift through as many as 4,559 stocks using up to seven different criteria selected by the user. The user can then print out a report using one of 10 ready-made report formats or one that has been custom designed with up to 12 columns of data. The Dow Jones Market Microscope retrieves information available through the Dow Jones News Retrieval Service and sorts through it. The information, which comes from the Media General Financial data base, is updated weekly, but the program can usefully sort and rank only stocks within a single industry group. Portfolio For the serious investor, keeping track of the portfolio is just as important as drawing and interpreting charts or researching a company. In assessing an investment strategy, it is vital to know how well it has paid off. Miss Lehrburger keeps tabs on her portfolio using the Pear Portfolio Management System from Hale Systems Inc. Mr. Kilroy uses the Personal Investor program from the PBL Corporation. And Alan K. Jeydel, a broker for Prudential-Bache Securities in Princeton, N.J., wrote his own program that allows him to organize his client list and manage his own holdings, using the spreadsheet function of his Peachtext 5000 software. Before buying any program, an investor needs to be certain it can keep track of as many securities, and as many types of securities, as are held in the portfolio. In addition it might be important to update the value of the portfolio electronically and to record dividends or interest automatically. A final consideration is whether the package is sophisticated enough to generate reports showing how well the portfolio and its components are performing, as well as the tax consequences of any transactions. Since investments are really only a part of one's financial management, it might make sense to find a portfolio manager that is integrated into a personal financial manager. The Micro Education Corporation of America's Managing Your Money program combines a comprehensive investment manager with a complete financial management program. Best Systems' Personal Finance program can also be adapted to track portfolios, as can the Home Accountant from Continental Software. Sources Independent information on investment software is increasing, but it is still hard to find. ''I strongly recommend the special interest groups,'' said John McMullen, a consultant specializing in business and financial applications of computers. ''The Big Apple Users Group for Apple computer owners and the N.Y.P.C. for I.B.M users have done good things. I also read Financial Software and Wall Street Computer Review to keep up with what's new.'' Another place to turn is Mr. Meyers's Microcomputer Investors association. Membership costs $49 a year and includes a year's subscription to the bimonthly A.A.M.I. Journal, which publishes reviews of software and services available to investors. Anyone, but especially those who are just testing the waters in investing by computer, might want to send a self-addressed, stamped envelope to the A.A.M.I. at P.O. Box 1384, Princeton, N.J. 08542, for a free list of investing software available for the personal computer of his or her choice.

1254-> SPORTS WORLD SPECIALS; Vigil of Hope
Seven weeks after he collapsed on the sidelines after being tackled in a game against Oregon in Eugene, Ed Reinhardt Jr., a 19-year-old Colorado tight end, remains in a coma, according to officials of the University of Colorado Medical Center in Denver, but the young man's small, fifth-floor room in the hospital's surgical intensive-care unit has become a center of hope and inspiration. It is decorated by pennants, posters and photographs sent by fellow football players and other well-wishers from across the country, and has become a focal point for hospital professionals. ''Our staff is a very compassionate, caring staff,'' Tom Rees, a hospital spokesman, said the other day. ''They have become very attached to him, and they watch over him very, very carefully.'' While the staff provides close, round-the- clock care, the patient's parents, Ed and Pat Reinhardt, have been maintaining their own almost-constant vigils, talking to their son, exhorting him to recover and watching his eyes while they hold his hands, waiting for a signal that will tell them he is aware of their presence. So far, according to Rees, there have been a few such indications, but only intermittently, and despite what doctors consider some small, overall improvement, they can still not predict how long he may remain comatose. In Eugene, Reinhardt underwent three operations - to remove a blood clot from his brain, to monitor swelling, and to remove fluid from his lungs. Since he was transferred to Denver on Oct. 16, to be closer to his family in Littleton, Colo., he has had two more operations, to implant a shunt to drain off any further accumulations of fluid in the brain, and to cap a hole drilled in his skull for a previous operation. He has also been getting a different kind of treatment, one doctors have not been prepared to dismiss. In what started as a way to limit visitors and has become a centerpiece of their efforts to revive their son, the Reinhardts have asked his friends and others to send him upbeat, taped messages, which they play for him on a cassette recorder. In addition to more than 1,000 cards and letters that have arrived since Reinhardt was transferred to Denver, the cassettes are beginning to arrive in profusion, according to Rees, and are all faithfully played.

1255-> JUSTICE DEPARTMENT; FIGHTING OLD AND NEW WARS AND SPOTS ON THE WALL
For the last few months, the wall above the fireplace in the office of Attorney General William French Smith has been decorated by an empty picture hook. After he announced his resignation last January, Mr. Smith packed up his files and returned to the Smithsonian a colorful California landscape that had graced the spot, as well as other paintings he had borrowed from the museum. But now Mr. Smith has virtually abandoned plans to leave Washington until after the November election. And as a symbol, perhaps, of his resignation to that change, he filled the empty hook today with a portrait of Edmund Randolph, the first Attorney General of the United States, who served from 1789 to 1794. Mr. Smith reluctantly agreed to remain in office in early April, after the nomination of his designated successor, Edwin Meese 3d, was put on hold because of an independent counsel's investigation of Mr. Meese's financial affairs. Friends have said it took a good deal of persuasion and a personal request from President Reagan to deflect Mr. Smith from his firm resolve to return to private practice in California. No Time to Think of Attitudes But, characteristic of his loyalty to Mr. Reagan, Mr. Smith does not acknowledge any annoyance at having to stay. ''I'm doing exactly what I've done for the past three years,'' he said in an interview. ''With the responsibilities of this position, I don't have time to think about attitudes and circumstances.'' Privately, friends of Mr. Smith see some paradox in the fact that in the first two years of the Reagan Administration Mr. Smith was plagued by persistent rumors that Mr. Meese was lobbying to get his job, but then when Mr. Smith was ready to depart he was pressed into remaining on the job because of Mr. Meese's troubles in winning confirmation. ''It's unfortunate the whole thing had to happen,'' Mr. Smith said. ''But I don't think anyone thinks it will be resolved very quickly.'' His List of Priorities High on his list of priorities right now are two old battles, crime and immigration legislation, and a new one, his appeal of Federal Judge Harold H. Greene's order directing him to seek an independent counsel's inquiry into the transfer of briefing papers from the Carter campaign camp to the Reagan campaign camp in 1980. Judge Greene said Mr. Smith had ignored the requirements of the Ethics in Government Act, which defines when the Attorney General must ask a judicial panel to appoint an independent counsel. ''It seems we have a judge who wants to be not only a judge but Attorney General as well,'' Mr. Smith said, contending that the Ethics Act gives sole discretion to the Attorney General for deciding when the evidence requires starting the process that can lead to the appointment of an independent counsel. ''Public perception is a total irrelevancy to this question,'' he said, dismissing the notion that his decision not to seek an independent counsel in the case may have fostered the impression that the Administration was seeking to gloss over, or even cover up, what happened. ''Public opinion polls are not our responsibility, which is to comply with the requirements of the Act and let the chips fall,'' he said. ''It's a question of prosecutorial function. We go at that question the same way we go at any statute.'' A 'Perennial Optimist' Describing himself as a ''perennial optimist,'' Mr. Smith said he was hopeful that the immigration bill, his key legislative goal, as well as bankruptcy and crime legislation could still be enacted in this Congressional session. But he expressed irritation with how the House has so far handled, or not handled, the crime package that has already passed the Senate twice with only one negative vote. ''If the House does not take up a package that received such overwhelming bipartisan support in the Senate, it simply is not doing its job,'' Mr. Smith said. On illegal drugs, which he has often termed the nation's top crime problem, Attorney General Smith said the issue was not well understood. He disputed recent criticism from Congress that conflict among agencies sharing responsibility for drug enforcement was hampering effectiveness and said that, to the contrary, cooperation had been enhanced. ''Confusion exists between what is being done and the fact that drugs are still available in the country - and they are,'' he said. ''But to say that because this is the case, all our efforts are for nought, is to truly misunderstand the problem.'' ''Trying to bring out that distinction is truly frustrating,'' Mr. Smith added. ''It's like saying because crime exists in a certain town you should abolish its police department.'' An International Problem Mr. Smith said greater attention should be paid to the importance of treating the narcotics trade as an international problem, requiring ''close working relationships with high officials of source and transit countries.'' As an example, he said the importance of the mutual assistance and extradition treaties he negotiated with Italy had not been appreciated. But in dealing with organized crime, he pointed out, it is as crucial to be able to intercept the dealings between New York and Palermo as it is to stop those between New York and Chicago. ''We have to look very closely at tying foreign aid more closely to to drug cooperation,'' the Attorney General added. Mr. Smith said he had ''laid the groundwork for international cooperation on drug trafficking'' on his several trips abroad. The trips, including visits to Thailand, Pakistan, Hong Kong, Japan, Italy, France, Spain, Morocco, Peru, Bolivia, El Salvador, Mexico, Canada and Australia, have made him the most widely-traveled Attorney General ever, but they have brought considerable criticism for the costs incurred. ''I think the trips are some of the most important things I've done in office,'' Mr. Smith said. Criticism Termed 'Uninformed' ''All the trips have received high praise from the State Department, the Congress, including both Democrats and Republicans, the White House, and officials of the countries visited,'' he said. ''The only harsh comments have come from certain members of the media, and in each case the criticism has been surprisingly uninformed.'' Ninety percent of the costs involved were ''bookkeeping entries,'' Mr. Smith said, resulting from the use of a Government plane that would have been in use in any case and did not involve extra ''costs to the taxpayers.'' Although Mr. Smith said at the time of his resignation that he would work for President Reagan's re-election campaign, now that he is staying at the Justice Department that will not be possible. He said he recognized, however, that actions by the department in the Reagan Administration would probably be raised in the Presidential campaign. In particular, critics have accused the Justice Department of undermining progress on civil rights and threatening civil liberties. ''I am sure there are those with viewpoints different from ours on busing and quotas who will try to inject them into the campaign,'' he said. ''But that will be a hazardous undertaking because on issues like that, we have widespread public support.''

1256-> BIG HOMES ARE BACK IN NORTH HILLS, L.I.
History will never repeat itself here: The great estates and palatial homes that once lined the wooded drives of this North Shore Nassau County community are all but gone. Most have been redeveloped in the last 15 years into condominiums and private homes on small plots. But there has been a circling back of sorts. In fits and starts, the zoning changes that opened the full-throttle development of North Hills in the early 1970's have been cut back. A moratorium on new building projects - the second in the last four years - is to end this month, and a further decrease in zoning density is expected next year. From 1969, when each new home generally required a lot of at least two acres, to a peak density of 12 condominium units per acre allowed at some projects in the late 1970's, the new zoning is expected to return to a level of one or two acres a home. Developers say the upzoning of North Hills has brought on a circling back of another sort as well: to large- size houses not commonly built here since the days of the old estates. With land prices rising and density allowances falling, developers found that increasing the size, luxury and price of their homes was one of the only ways to compensate. The logic was clear: If fewer homes can be built on a given space, build them bigger, to cost more. Now, a project that is perhaps the extreme manifestation of that trend has begun construction on Searingtown Road, just off the Long Island Expressway. The project, called The Mews, was originally proposed in 1978 at a density of six units per acre and a size of about 2,700 square feet per home. Density cutbacks demanded by village officials, however - to a level of four units to the acre - accompanied by steadily rising land prices, dictated changes in plan and design. ''The land was the same - just spread over fewer units,'' said Robert Sameroff, the developer of The Mews. ''You have to make up for it somehow.'' As the number of condominiums allowed on Mr. Sameroff's 5.3-acre parcel was cut to 22, from the planned 31, the home sizes ballooned to more than 3,500 square feet, with a master bedroom suite in one model that alone covers more that 1,000 square feet. With finished basements, the attached houses of The Mews can each be converted to nearly 5,500 square feet of space. That compares with 2,800 to 3,000 square feet for some of the other large-home projects under way in North Hills, and less than 2,000 square feet for many of the projects built in the middle to late 1970's. Prices at The Mews begin at $375,000 and run to nearly $500,000. Mr. Sameroff is a 59-year-old former aerospace engineer and real estate broker who is making his debut as a builder with the current project. He said homes of the size he was building at The Mews might not be repeated in North Hills. In the last few years, he explained, village officials have been putting increased pressure on condominium developers to leave undisturbed the extra land space dictated by the lower-density zoning. ''We got in right in the middle,'' he said, referring to the pressure to upzone and the pressure to maintain open land space. ''It was something of a fluke.'' North Hills, which is within the town of North Hempstead, just south of Manhasset Bay and less than four miles from Queens, was one of the last preserves of undeveloped land in Nassau County when downzoning began in 1970, starting the development wave. Dr. Lowell H. Kane, who has been Mayor of North Hills since 1978 (he bought a condominium there in 1977), said much of the pressure for upzoning in the community had come from outsiders - water conservation and air quality officials, for example. Some village residents have also been pushing for restrictions. The population of North Hills has risen to nearly 2,500 from about 300 in 1970. Dr. Kane, a practicing urologist, added that while the upzoning had certainly slowed the village's population growth, it did not yet seem to have significantly diminished the number of new housing developments. Currently, six projects are in construction in North Hills - a total of 330 housing units, including The Mews. That development, which began marketing just before Labor Day, is scheduled for occupancy in April or May, with the final units to be finished late next year or in early 1986. So far, seven of the two-story, cedar- sided homes have been sold, primarily to buyers from the local Nassau County area or Queens. Mr. Sameroff said he had used ''aerospace design concepts'' in the project, which features truss beams that run the length of each unit. The truss beams, he said, carry the stress of the buildings, allowing more flexibility in moving structurally unnecessary interior walls to fit a buyer's wishes. The architect for the project is Roy McCutcheon.

1257-> STALEMATE IN SALVADOR
Unless one side or the other changes its position, peace talks between the Government of President Jose Napoleon Duarte and Salvadoran leftist rebels may be stalemated. In two meetings each party has presented proposals that the other has rejected as a demand for surrender. In interviews this week, rebel and Government officials showed little willingness to budge from their initial stands. The rapid progress to deadlock is an indication of the political constraints that bind each side and the formidable obstacles to a negotiated end to five years of war. The fundamental differences separating the two parties have turned even optimists into doubters. ''I had hope for peace,'' said one Government negotiator who met with the rebels last week. ''Now I don't.'' The two initial meetings between Government and guerrillas have shown that Mr. Duarte is not interested in arguing about fundamental points. His position is that his Government and the Constitution that regulates it are legitimate. Mr. Duarte's offer to the rebels is only that they be guaranteed the security to join the democratic process he believes is underway. Demands by the Rebels The rebels answer, repeating previously stated guerrilla positions, that neither Mr. Duarte's Government nor the Constitution are legitimate. They want a new Government, a new Constitution and a new army. The rebels have suggested that Mr. Duarte's quick and absolute rejection of their proposal was intended to keep conservative critics at bay while he seeks the means to keep the talks alive. That explanation appears to be only partly accurate. While Mr. Duarte knows that neither the army high command nor the conservative majority in the Legislative Assembly will tolerate any tampering with the Constitution, the President himself also appears to be a firm believer in the legality of his Government. His aides say the guerrillas made a fundamental miscalculation if they thought otherwise. Mr. Duarte's offer of talks within the limits of the present political system is therefore not negotiable. Attacks by Duarte The strength of Mr. Duarte's public attacks on the rebel proposal reportedly caught guerrilla leaders by surprise. They watched Mr. Duarte go on national television to denounce their plan last week, according to a Western diplomat who was present. ''They were shocked by the severity of his rejection,'' the diplomat said. While Mr. Duarte's inflexible reply is not entirely surprising, the rebels' decision to put forward such a sweeping proposal so early in the talks is less easy to understand. It is not clear why they felt it was in their interest to put a strong set of demands on the table now, especially when they seemed purposely to avoid raising divisive issues in their first meeting with the Government in the town of La Palma in October. One explanation may be that the rebels had no time make a collective decision on their position before the meeting in La Palma. In the six weeks that have passed since, however, the five military factions of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, the rebels' umbrella organization, had time to make their voice heard. Speech by Rebel Commander The firmness of the rebel stand was underlined by Facundo Guardada, a commander of the rebel Popular Liberation Forces Army, who gave a speech after last week's talks denouncing Mr. Duarte's Government. Another rebel leader at the talks said the speech had been written to emphasize the position of rebel military leaders. Their tough position may indicate that the rebels do not feel they can enter talks without reassuring their own forces that the goals for which they first began fighting in 1979 remain unchanged. It may also show that the rebels feel they can at least survive on the battlefield. Salvadoran Government officials are now reassessing their earlier view, more often expressed as a hope, that the rebels' willingness to attend talks indicated a weakening of their military position. ''We haven't weakened them enough,'' said one Government representative to the talks with the rebels. ''This proposal means they're strong.'' A rebel delegate to the talks confirmed that analysis in an interview last week. 'We Are Not Losing' ''The heart of this is the war and we are not losing the war,'' he said. Spokesmen for each side said their forces would meet with new determination on the battlefield in the months ahead to try to force a recalculation of the balance of power that underlies their political positions. While the war goes on, Mr. Duarte may be left with little more to do than find a way to wind down the talks without being blamed for ending them. Two of four Government representatives to last week's reunion with the rebels said in interviews that they would not attend another negotiating session unless the guerrillas first explicitly endorsed the present Constitution. Mr. Duarte, however, may try to leave himself more room for maneuver. His calculation will be influenced by the soundings he takes this week among army commanders as well as by the views of activists in his Christian Democratic Party. They intend to use the peace effort as a winning issue in legislative elections next March. Such thinking may lead Mr. Duarte to keep the talks fitfully alive by concentrating on smaller issues such as an agreement on prisoner exchanges, or food aid to refugees. But he might also decide that he cannot pursue even that level of discussion without a statement from the rebels saying they will respect the Constitution. When asked what would happen next, a Government negotiator who is one of Mr. Duarte's closest advisers shook his head and looked pained. ''My feeling is that there are no longer objective conditions for a dialogue,'' he said.

1258-> ART PEOPLE
JUST the way he has always done, Paul Cadmus slipped quietly into town recently and proceeded to amaze a few people. Now 80 years old, the artist has shunned abstract painting all his life, producing instead in the painstakingly slow ''egg-tempera'' medium realistic works that are charged with symbolic, violent and often homoerotic imagery. Many of those works appear in ''Paul Cadmus: Enfant Terrible at 80,'' a film by David Sutherland that had its premiere at the Museum of Modern Art. The film is narrated by Cadmus, who speaks to the camera while sketching a model, preparing an egg yolk to make his tempera paint, or perusing letters the author E. M. Forster wrote to him. The film, judging from the overflow crowds at the museum, is only part of a Cadmus rediscovery that is advancing on several fronts. An illustrated book on the artist, written by Lincoln Kirstein and published by Imago Books, was issued this year, and a retrospective exhibition of his work recently completed a nationwide tour at the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers. ''I think people are getting tired of too much abstraction,'' Mr. Cadmus says, explaining what he believes is one reason for the new interest in his work. ''I think people want to get much more out of painting than they do from just a decorative thing to hang over the sofa. I think that people want to look at people.'' Mr. Cadmus, a gentle-speaking man with a direct and earnest gaze, offers a total contrast to the frequently shocking subject matter of his paintings. Among the most famous pictures are ones that depict the 1926 slaughter of strikebreaking Illinois miners in his 1940 ''Herrin Massacre,'' and a portrait of grotesque figures in the 14th Street station in his 1975 ''Subway Symphony.'' ''I'm not a violent person myself,'' Mr. Cadmus says. ''I abhor violence, and I suppose I try to show how awful violence is. I don't like paintings that's too violent in its brushwork. What interests me are violent scenes that are painted with delicacy and made into an order of sorts.'' About his newfound celebrity, Cadmus admits to ambivalence. ''It helps with my sales and that sort of thing,'' he said. ''But I prefer to live like a mouse. I don't like the idea of being turned into a personage, rather than just a person. I don't have any plans except just to keep on working. Preferably, quietly.'' New Influences For Chen Yi Fei Chen Yi Fei's studio is bare, but he's hardly in despair. He sold nearly every painting he did during the last year, 42 in all, at his recently completed one-man show at the Hammer Galleries, 33 West 57th Street. It was the 38-year-old Mr. Chen's second show at the gallery. His first show, last year, also sold out. Which is not bad, really, for an artist who landed at Kennedy International Airport in 1980 with five pieces of luggage and not a word of English. What Mr. Chen did have was years of artistic training and experience in China, where he was a successful painter. He decided to use his savings to move to the United States during a period of liberal passport issuance. For his first six months in New York, he was afraid to enter the 57th Street galleries. ''The doorman at the Hammer Gallery looked like a policeman,'' Mr. Chen said. ''After half a year, I realized that the galleries were open to the public, that anybody could go in.'' Although his first two shows were of paintings in a romantic, realist style, Mr. Chen says he is rapidly absorbing a number of new influences in New York. ''Every two weeks I go to all the galleries in SoHo, 57th Street and Madison Avenue,'' he says. ''I want to let my eye look at not just one point, but at everything, even movies and plays. It is very exciting. My style will change, not from picking out a new style, but slowly, from my heart and soul.'' When Museum Directors Are the Exhibitors Should an arts institution that goes by the name of ''museum'' ever exhibit works that are made by the men and women who run it and choose what will hang on its walls? Peter van der Does, the former assistant director of the Artists' Choice Museum in SoHo, believes not, and says he quit his job last month over the issue. The exhibition in question is currently hanging at the museum, titled ''Artist's Choice: The First Eight Years.'' The museum was founded eight years ago by artists of the ''Figurative Alliance,'' a New York group that was devoted to promoting non- Abstract art against the abstractionist trends that prevailed at the time. It sponsored only traveling exhibitions and shows in rented galleries until this September, when it opened its permanent home at 394 West Broadway. Among the more than 100 paintings and sculptures in the present show are works by each of the 16 members of the museum's board of artists. The board chooses what shows will be mounted at the museum, and oversees its day to day operations. The curators of this show are Stephanie DeManuelle and Pamela Endacott, both members of the board. ''It's a conflict of interest and a conflict of museum ethics,'' Mr. van der Does said. ''You can show your own works in a co-op gallery, but the bottom line in a museum is quality. When there's so much good work out there, picking only your own work is unfair to artists at large.'' Members of the board, however, say that the current show is a retrospective exhibition, and thus a natural extension of the museum's activities of recent years. ''The show is a celebration that we finally have this space,'' Richard Pitts, the chairman of the board, said. ''We tried to show as many of the people who have been involved with the museum as possible. Some of them have been active in the figurative art movement, and we were not going to eliminate them from the show just because they are on the museum board.''

1259-> POSTINGS; CO-OPS FOR NOHO
For years the area north of Houston Street and east of the Bowery, now known as NoHo, was a residential no-man's-land where all but a few of the living spaces were illegal. But in the 1970's, the pressures exerted by a demand for more housing and retail space in the area, which borders the East Village and SoHo, prompted the city to rezone the manufacturing neighborhood to allow more residential use. Now gentrification is in high gear. Among the buildings undergoing a transformation is the seven- story structure at 10 Bleecker Street, at the southeast corner of Bleecker and Elizabeth Streets. This former manufacturing building, which stood empty for more than 10 years, once housed a company that made tents for the military. In the spring, it will reopen as a residential cooperative. John Goldman, one of the principals of the project, says that the apartments in the turn-of-the-century building will be a mix of finished and unfinished loft-style spaces. Each of the 5,000- square-foot floors will be sold as quarter-, half- or full-floor units and are expected to go for $200 to $250 a square foot. The ground floor will be leased or sold as retail, gallery or restaurant space. The architect for the project is John Averitt of the Manhattan firm of Lipkin, Averitt & Barclay. Occupancy is scheduled for May.

1261-> AUCTIONS
THE largest and most important selection of Frank Lloyd Wright's designs ever to be auctioned - stained-glass windows, home and office furniture, lighting fixtures, a rare copper urn and architectural drawings - will be sold today at Christie's, Park Avenue at 59th Street. In the sale, starting at 2 P.M., are 19 works from some of Wright's most important buildings, and more than a dozen turn-of-the-century designs by Louis H. Sullivan, Charles Rennie Mackintosh and Greene & Greene. Outstanding among Wright's six stained-glass designs in this auction are a skylight and a six-panel window from the 1912 Frances W. Little house, known as Northome, in Wayzata, Minn. One of Wright's great residences and one of the last in his Prairie style, Northome was bought by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1972 after plans for its demolition became known. A year ago, the living room of the Little house - a space of breathtaking scale and elegant details - was installed in the museum's American Wing. Other rooms are in the Allentown (Pa.) Art Museum, the Minneapolis Institute of Arts and the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts. Both windows are typical of Wright in design. The leaded-glass panels have abstract geometric patterns of colored squares and triangles framing the clear- and frosted-glass panes. The six-panel window, which was designed more to see through than to be looked at, comes with its original oak- framed screens and storm windows, and may bring up to $80,000. The oak- framed frosted-glass skylight, measuring a bit under 2 by 3 feet, was in a hallway. It may sell for as much as $6,000. Of even greater importance to some Wright enthusiasts are the late 1930's Cherokee-red enameled steel and walnut desk and chair from the S. C. Johnson & Son administration building in Racine, Wis. This is the only set from the Johnson commission in private hands; the four others extant are in museums - the Metropolitan, the Museum of Modern Art, the Milwaukee Art Museum and the Art Institute of Chicago. The set may sell for up to $45,000. Notable, too, is the copper urn from the 1899 house Wright built for Edward C. Waller in River Forest, Ill. This 18-inch spherical vessel, embellished in hammered neo-Gothic and geometric motifs, was made to stand atop the stair post in the entrance hall (up to $80,000). Christie's sale continues tomorrow at 10 A.M. and 2 P.M. with Art Nouveau and Art Deco selections, including examples from many of the major designers of the period. There is, for example, a 1929 modern desk, almost seven feet long, by Emile Jacques Ruhlmann. The richly grained wood desk with gilt-bronze hardware is being sold by the Museum of Modern Art. ''We discovered when the modern-design galleries were completed that we did not have the room to display it,'' Stewart Johnson, the museum's curator of design, explained. It may bring up to $70,000. David Geffen's collection of 18 Tiffany lamps and vases will be sold toward the end of the day, about 4 P.M. Mr. Geffen, a theatrical producer and recording executive, said he is selling because his taste has changed from Tiffany to Abstract Expressionist art. ''Paintings have become my obsession,'' he said. Tiffany once was, he added. He started collecting it in 1972 and bought from most of the major New York dealers, including Lillian Nassau, Minna Rosenblatt and Simon Lieberman. ''There is a level on which I'm very sad to see them go,'' he said. ''Ultimately, though, you are just a renter of the art you own.'' Mr. Geffen's lamps may bring hefty prices. A dome-shaped magnolia-patterned stained-glass lamp on a bronze base may sell for up to $500,000 and a flowering-lotus table lamp may sell for as much as $400,000. Expansion at Christie's Will Nearly Double Space Christie's is almost doubling the size of its galleries in an expansion to be completed this spring. The auction house, which occupies 30,000 square feet in the Delmonico Hotel, has taken over two floors and a basement in the adjoining office-condominium building to the west. The enlarged quarters will measure about 55,000 square feet, with a new sales room and other facilities. Sales increased in the first four months of the auction season at Sotheby's, and declined at Christie's, according to figures released in London yesterday. Sotheby's international sales totaled $242 million, compared with $204 million a year ago. Michael Ainslie, president and chief executive, said that half the total was achieved in New York, the rest in London, Monte Carlo, Geneva and Hong Kong. Christie's international sales totaled $180.7 million, compared with $181.4 million a year ago. New York sales were $92.4 million, compared with $95.3 million a year ago. Reprise The manuscript of Richard Straus's last song, ''Malven,'' which was never printed or performed - it was written for Maria Jeritza, the Czechoslovak soprano, 10 months before his death in November 1948 - sold Wednesday at Sotheby's for $60,500 to a collector who was not identified.

1262-> LEBANESE LOSING IDENTITY IN A RETREAT INTO FACTIONS
In a sense, the Lebanese are becoming extinct. It is not that they are dying off, although they are doing that, too. It is that the number of people in Lebanon who think of themselves and identify themselves as ''Lebanese'' - as opposed to members of a religious group - is becoming smaller and smaller. The latest fad in Beirut among young Christian and Moslem militants is wearing little plastic pictures the size of bubble-gum baseball cards around their necks. The Moslems wear pictures of the Shiite leaders Nabih Berri and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Druse carry Walid Jumblat and the Christians wear Bashir Gemayel. Cabinet Has No Place to Meet The new so-called national unity Government grouping all the sectarian leaders has not been able to meet normally because it has not been able to find a neutral, common ground where all its members can gather and feel safe. Almost every inch of Lebanon, including the presidential palace, has been claimed by rival sects. The Cabinet has been reduced to meeting in the President's personal home or in the no man's land between different sectarian cantons. That is all that is left right now of the old, shared Lebanon - a no man's land. ''People have started to live in self- enclosed bubbles, but bubbles don't make a nation,'' Samir Khalaf, a sociologist at the American University of Beirut, said. The Lebanese identity has been in a process of fragmentation ever since the civil war started in 1975, but during the last nine months that process has gone farther and faster than in the previous eight years combined, Mr. Khalaf said. What Hastened the Breakup What set off this trend was the war last year in the Shuf Mountains between the Druse and the Maronite Christians, the two core communities around which the state of Lebanon was formed. Before this mountain war the civil conflict in Lebanon tended to be relatively impersonal and ideological - in the sense of right versus left - and it included a significant involvement of Palestinian outsiders. The Shuf war was different. It was a purely Lebanese affair. It was not impersonal or ideological but pitted neighbor against neighbor. Druse and Maronites who had lived together for years began massacring each other for control of territory. This war unleashed mutual fear and suspicion that spread like a poison throughout Lebanon. Everyone became aware of himself and of his neighbor. Everyone knew that no matter what his political views he could be killed just for who he was, so safety meant drawing closer to one's own sect or seeking shelter in one's own canton. Since then each religious group has been intent on protecting its share of Lebanon, but no one seems to be trying anymore to protect Lebanon as a whole - as the open, tolerant, pluralistic society of old. ''The old concept of Lebanon is alien now to the majority of Lebanese,'' Elias Saba, a Greek Orthodox former Cabinet member, said. If the process continues, it is possible that in a few years there will be no more Lebanese in Lebanon. There will be only agglomerations of Druse, Shiites, Maronites, Sunnis, Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholics and Armenians. Living together is a habit, and after nine years of war the Lebanese are losing the habit. ''We don't feel for South Lebanon anymore, we don't feel for East Beirut, we don't feel for the north,'' Sofia Saadeh, a Christian West Beirut intellectual, said. ''We only feel when it hits us now. This is the real dismemberment. ''It means I am not a Lebanese anymore,'' she added. ''I think in that sense there are no Lebanese anymore. There are only pro-Israelis, pro-Syrians, pro-Druse, pro-Shiites, pro-Sunnis and pro-Maronites. The only place you can have Lebanon anymore is in your head, and even that is going.'' Beirut's Cosmopolitan City Center Provided the Ideology for Lebanon When people think of the old pluralistic Lebanon, they are really thinking of the old Beirut. Beirut was never just the capital of Lebanon. Beirut was an ideology. The ideology was one of coexistence of different cultures and religious groups and it was forged in the covered markets and alleyways, the coffee shops and the bookstalls of the old Beirut city center. There 7,000 shops once stood crammed together, with the Maronite cobbler next to the Druse butcher, the Greek Orthodox money-changer next to the Sunni tailor and the Shiite importer next to the Armenian jeweler. The city center was the place where the Lebanese communities were homogenized into one cosmopolitan nation. ''The culture of Lebanese coexistence is a creation of Beirut,'' Salim Nasr, a sociologist specializing in the history of Beirut, said. ''When I was a little boy I discovered Lebanese society there, the different accents and cultures and forms of dress. It was where the country met the rest of the world and the different components of the country met each other.'' The Mechanism Is Gone Today the homogenizing mechanism is gone. The old Beirut city center has become the so-called Green Line that separates the rival Christian and Moslem militias. Its old shops are occupied today by snipers. Many of the Moslem and Christian businessmen who once rubbed elbows in the souk now conclude business deals in a no man's land along the only road open between the two halves the city - because each one is too afraid to cross to the other's side. ''The symbol of Beirut's unity has become the symbol of its disunity,'' Mr. Nasr said. Those Lebanese who grew up with the city center and cherished its pluralistic ethos have never quite felt at home in Beirut since it was destroyed. Some merchants still keep the address of their branch offices in the city center on their stationery as a symbol of solidarity with the past. Other people will go to more extreme lengths to preserve its spirit. Ask Nabil Tabbara. Personal Archive Created At the height of the civil war in 1976 it appeared that the graceful stone archways and marketplaces of the old city center were either going to be wrecked forever by fighting or bulldozed eventually in reconstruction. To keep a personal archive for himself of the Lebanon he cherished, Mr. Tabbara took leave from his job as an architect and decided in the middle of the fighting to try to sketch and photograph what remained of the city center before it disappeared. ''I didn't know what would be left of the old Beirut,'' Mr. Tabbara, a Sunni Moslem, recalled, ''and I always remembered the people of Warsaw who broke into their municipal archives after the Nazis invaded and hid all the plans and drawings of the Warsaw city center, which they used to rebuild it later.'' Armed only with a camera, a pencil and sketch pads, Mr. Tabbara spent a month obtaining passes from the militias to enter the battle zone, then headed off to draw what was still standing. Militiamen Eventually Helped ''I would go down to the Phonecia Hotel every morning, park my car and then walk to the Green Line,'' he said. ''At first the gunmen would say, 'Look at this fool sitting on the rubble sketching with the rockets and the bullets going by.' They thought I was absolutely crazy. But after a while they really got into what I was doing. Some days they would lay down a barrage of machine-gun fire to cover me so I could run across a dangerous street, or they would break into a building so I could get a particular view from the roof.'' After three months of work, Mr. Tabbara took all of his sketches, photographs and the street signs of famous avenues, which he also collected, and put them away for safekeeping. At the time, the civil war was grinding to a halt and it appeared that the Government was going to try to rebuild the city center more or less as it was. For eight years the pictures sat in his drawer. Then came Feb. 6, 1984. The Lebanese Army split and the city center, which was undergoing extensive repairs, became the Green Line again. Only this time it looked to be permanent. Scenes Captured in Watercolors ''I felt like I was contemplating something very near to me that was dying,'' Mr. Tabbara recalled. ''This was the roots of my generation and I felt I was losing my roots for good.'' To hold onto a fragment of those roots, Mr. Tabbara started to paint. Using his eight-year-old sketches and photographs as a guide, he spent days alone in his house painting watercolors of the streets and shops of the city center as best he could remember them. Even though some of the paintings show crumbled buildings, they are bright of color, lively and exude a palpable warmth and serenity. ''They express my own joy,'' Mr. Tabbara said as he showed off his pictures to a visitor, ''because I think the atmosphere was the most important thing in my recollection. The variety of one shop next to the other brought a sense of life and togetherness. Now people just belong to their sectarian neighborhoods. Do you call this belonging? This is ghettoism.'' Mr. Tabbara says his children have no idea what his paintings are about. It's just ''Daddy's crazy hobby.'' His friends, though, the people he grew up with, all want to buy the pictures - some at any price. ''Without the city center and what it stood for, Beirut will never be the same,'' Mr. Tabbara concluded. ''No matter how hard we try, we will never really be able to go home again.'' West Beirut Is Being Islamized With Bombs Going Off in the Night The explosions usually come around 11 P.M., just after people have crawled into bed. They shake the house for a second, rattle the windows and then there is dead quiet. People don't even react to them anymore. Husbands and wives just nod to each other and go back to sleep. They both know what it is - another bar in West Beirut has been blown up. In the last two months most of the bars in West Beirut have been bombed. Today their facades are bricked over. No one knows for sure who is doing the bombing, but few have any doubt it is the Moslem extremists who are putting their stamp on West Beirut. Even after Beirut split in two in 1975, the spirit of the city center was carried on by certain secular, multireligious institutions, such as the American University of Beirut. West Beirut was always the one place someone could come from any part of Lebanon and still feel at home. Christians and Moslems continued to live there side by side when East Beirut became almost exclusively Christian. But now this last sancturary of pluralism is also gradually being snuffed out. West Beirut's New Character The shelling by the Lebanese Army of the Shiite southern suburbs of Beirut during the first week of February drove some 150,000 Shiites - many of them poor rural emigrants from the south - out of their homes and into the heart of West Beirut, where they squatted wherever they could. The movement of refugees, coupled with the military takeover of West Beirut by the Shiite Amal militia on Feb. 6 - has turned the Western half of the capital into a Shiite-dominated canton. ''These newcomers don't know what West Beirut was,'' said a Christian banker who has lived in West Beirut all his life. ''They don't mean to do any harm. But they come either as victors or dispossessed and have no appreciation for the way things are.'' The Islamization of West Beirut has begun, and it is hard to see how the process will ever be reversed. Besides the bars being destroyed, more and more woman can be seen wearing head coverings on the street and there are rumors everywhere that the beaches this summer are going to be forcibly segregated between men and women. No Shorts for Women ''I went into a boutique on Hamra Street last week and asked the owner for a pair of shorts,'' a 23-year-old woman who is a graduate student at the American University said. ''The owner looked at me like I was nuts. 'Are you crazy,' he said. 'We are not selling shorts this year.' '' West Beirut has started to take on the look of Baalbek, the Iranian-controlled village in central Lebanon. Virtually every building has been stamped with a poster of Ayatollah Khomeini and Imam Musa al-Sadr, the missing Lebanese Shiite spiritual leader. No one dares take them down. Refugees come door-to-door selling pictures of Ayatollah Khomeini. Some people buy two just to be on the safe side. They put them on their cars or in their windows as if they were American-style burglar warnings. ''This house is protected by. . . .'' Hamra Street, once known as the Champs-Elysees of the Middle East, now looks like a village market. The trendy boutiques have disappeared behind a wall of sidewalk vendors who sell everything from watches to panty hose out of suitcases or the trunks of cars. Just off Hamra Street refugee butchers can be seen slaughtering sheep on the sidewalk. Cheerleaders Threatened The American University of Beirut, maybe the freest 88 acres of land in the whole Arab world, has also not been spared. At its hospital the bulletin board that used to announce medical lectures was recently covered over with the sayings of Shiite Imams and verses from the Koran. At a recent intramural football match, cheerleaders wearing short skirts ran off the field in the middle of a cheer after someone in the stands shouted a threat to throw acid on their exposed legs. The signs of increasing alienation between the Sunni, Druse, Shiite and Christian groups that made up West Beirut are everywhere. For the first time in its history, the residents' staff organization at the university hospital had an election for officers this year in which doctors ran for positions as Sunnis, Shiites and Christians instead of as nonpartisan physicians. Asked why this happened, each doctor would say something like this: ''The other side made me do it. They were running as Christians, so I had to run as a Moslem,'' or vice versa. Even banking has been hit. After the Druse militia attacked the Sunni Mourabitoun militia several weeks ago, the Sunni depositors in the Druse-owned African-Arab Bank withdrew 400,000 Lebanese pounds, about $71,500, in one day, banking sources said. Neutrality Is Not Allowed The spirit of relative tolerance that characterized West Beirut, which was the main reason all the foreign embassies and news agencies were there, is also waning. People are not allowed to be neutral. Several weeks ago militiamen entered pinball parlors around West Beirut and hauled off the players to the Green Line to fill sandbags. They were told that ''if they had time to play pinball, they had time to fill sandbags.'' Unidentified gunmen came into the St. Francis Catholic Church one Sunday and tried to drag off three Sri Lankans for similar work. Since then the Shiite Amal militia - which has tried its best to moderate Moslem extremists trying to impose their views - has sent militiamen to attend services and protect the worshipers. The British Ambassador and several American diplomats are also members of the church and also attend with bodyguards. ''We have a lot of firepower in church these days,'' Diane Dillard, the American Consul General, said. Not all Christians have bodyguards, however, and many of them who can afford to are quietly leaving West Beirut for good. It was impossible to find candles for Palm Sunday in West Beirut this year because Moslem shopkeepers were afraid to stock them. This new atmosphere has created a lament of sorts for the Palestine Liberation Organization. The P.L.O. committed its share of excesses during its days in control of West Beirut, but it was also a quasi-secular state and it could provide a reasonable amount of security and keep the religious fanatics in check. ''Would you believe that we actually miss the P.L.O.,'' one Christian secretary said. ''They were bastards but they were organized bastards. They could offer us phones and electricity and the telex worked. Try making a long distance phone call today. If someone got kidnapped, the P.L.O. could find them. Now who do you call?'' Many Are Happy at Not Seeing Their Enemies in the Other Camps For the die-hard Christians and Moslems who never much cared for one another anyway, the new polarization is a blessing. The Green Line for them is not the Berlin Wall forcibly keeping them apart but rather the Hoover Dam holding each community back from the other. ''I don't want anything to do with those Moslem savages,'' commented one Maronite professor at American University's East Beirut campus who hasn't been to West Beirut in years. ''I am surviving very nicely as I am now. The split has been 10 years and I think it is best we each go our own way. They talk about all of us living together. How? What for?'' No, this professor and thousands of Christians and Moslems like him feel no pain over what is happening. It is the people who have tried during the last 10 years to continue to live a Lebanese life, despite all the pressures to choose sides, who are grieving today. ''Everyone is being drawn to his corner,'' Salim Nasr, the sociologist, said. ''The problem is for those of us who have no corner, who identify only with Lebanon and not a particular sect. We are being forced to either leave or change our identity.'' An Exile From East and West Typical of this breed is Michel Abu Jawdi, the editor of An Nahar newspaper and probably the best-known columnist in the Arab world. A Maronite Christian who has lived in predominantly Moslem West Beirut most of his life, the 51-year-old Mr. Abu Jawdi holds court in his office every morning. Friends and politicians from every one of Lebanon's 17 religious groups shuffle in and out, taking turns joining the always heated discussion in the semicircle of chairs around his desk. In this clash of ideas and perspectives Mr. Abu Jawdi would often draw inspiration for his columns. Lately, however, Mr. Abu Jawdi, has begun to feel that he does not fit in anymore, that he is becoming a stranger in his own house, an outsider in his own neighborhood. There is no place for him in the rising Moslem tide of West Beirut, where he feels unwelcome as a Christian. There is no place for him in East Beirut, where he is seen as a turncoat and where he feels he would wilt without the company of his Moslem and Druse companions. 'Beirut Left Us' ''I am a stranger in East Beirut by choice and I am becoming a stranger in West Beirut by force,'' he noted. ''I am supposed to go to Paris, but I keep delaying the trip. I am afraid once I am there I will ask myself: 'Why should I go back. What home am I returning to?' '' Because he refuses to return to his corner in East Beirut, Mr. Abu Jawdi said, he has decided to ''live in a closet'' with his little circle of friends who still think as he does. Beirut today is littered with these new refugees - Lebanese who feel that they have lost their homes not in the physical sense but in the existential sense. ''Beirut left us, we did not leave Beirut,'' Dr. Munir Shammaa, a Moslem physician at the university hospital, said. ''For the first time I feel that I don't belong here anymore. Those people who exploited the beautiful formula of Beirut are unwanted now.'' ''I had a party last week and invited all my friends, the people I know here who still think like me,'' added Dr. Shamma'a. ''It was a very small party.'' TOMORROW: Lebanon's lost generation.

1263-> PERSONAL FINANCE; THE SAD REALITIES IF INDEXING
WITH the advent of indexing, the traditional link between inflation and the personal income tax will be broken for the first time. When the indexing mechanism goes into effect next year, tax rates will be automatically adjusted for inflation - but this historic step may turn out to be more rhetoric than reality for most taxpayers. And once higher Social Security taxes are factored in, most people will find that at best they have just a few extra dollars in their paychecks each week. The initial impact will be modest, ''but it's a good step in the right direction,'' said Leon M. Nad, national tax partner with the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse. He, along with many tax experts, applauds the idea behind indexing, which is to prevent the Government from reaping windfall revenues from continuing inflation. Workers are pushed into higher tax brackets after receiving wage increases that are merely intended to help them keep pace with the cost of living, and do not represent a gain in real income. In periods of high inflation, this problem of ''bracket creep'' intensifies. ''Indexing means tax fairness,'' said Martha Jay, a partner in the accounting firm of Peat Marwick. ''It's an attempt to limit the extra money the Government collects when inflation moves you into higher tax brackets.'' The Government recently announced that for l985 the tax brackets, the zero-bracket amount (or old standard deduction) and the personal exemptions will all be adjusted upward by an inflation factor of 4.1 percent. Among other things, the change means that people can earn slightly more next year and still remain in the same tax bracket. For example, in 1985, a married couple filing jointly will fall into the 38 percent bracket if their taxable income is between $47,670 and $62,450; this year, the couple would fall in that bracket only if their income was between $45,800 and $60,000. For the wealthy, widening of the brackets means that married couples filing jointly can have $169,020 in taxable income next year before they move into the top 50 percent bracket, against $162,400 this year. Indexing also means that the zero-bracket amount will increase slightly next year, to $3,540 for married people filing joint returns, $2,390 for single taxpayers and $1,770 for married people filing separately. The personal exemption will rise to $1,040, from the current $1,000. The net impact of all these changes is that if you receive no raise or one that is less than 4.1 percent in 1985, your tax bill will decline, all other things being equal. If by chance you receive a raise precisely equal to 4.1 percent, then your tax bill will be the same as it was in 1984. And if your raise exceeds that, only the portion in excess of 4.1 percent will catapult you into a higher tax bracket. Miss Jay of Peat Marwick has developed several examples showing how indexing might affect three hypothetical individuals who receive no income apart from their salaries and make no adjustments for such items as contributions to an Individual Retirement Account. They all have two children and file joint returns with their spouses. To isolate the impact of indexing, their itemized deductions were kept constant at 23 percent of their 1984 salaries. IN the first scenario, a mid-level manager with a $40,000 salary in 1984 pays a tax of $4,874. His work is adequate but not outstanding, and he receives a modest 6 percent raise, to $42,400, in 1985. His tax bill on that income, had indexing not gone into effect, would have been $5,546. But with indexing, it is only $5,394, so the new provision ''saves'' him $152 in taxes, even though he pays a higher tax bill in 1985 than in 1984. In the second case, a higher-level executive who receives a $100,000 salary in 1984 pays a tax of $22,056. Because her performance is exemplary (and because her company prides itself on its affirmative action stance) she receives a more generous 10 percent raise in 1985. This brings her salary to $110,000. Her tax bill is $25,839, more than it was the previous year, but $417 less than she would have owed without indexing. The final example involves a chief executive officer who earns $400,000 in 1984 and pays $135,100 in taxes. The board of directors is delighted with his work and gives him a 20 percent raise in 1985. That raises his salary to $480,000, and his tax bill to $174,332. While he owes substantially more in tax than the previous year, his tax bill is nonetheless $768 less than it would have been without indexing. However, these figures do not tell the entire story, because what you save in income tax next year due to indexing may be outweighed by what you owe in higher Social Security tax. Both F.I.C.A. (for the Federal Insurance Contributions Act) and the self-employment tax will be going up in 1985. Workers will be hit with a double whammy: Both the tax rate, and the wage base upon which that rate is calculated, will increase. The result is that the maximum F.I.C.A. tax, for employees whose 1985 salaries are at least $39,600, will be $259 more than in 1984, while the maximum self-employment tax will rise by $402. When these Social Security tax increases are cranked into Miss Jay's calculations, the benefits of indexing become insignificant indeed. In fact, they disappear altogether for the $40,000-a-year executive: his savings from indexing are more than wiped out by his higher F.I.C.A., and he suffers a net loss of $107 after taxes. The $100,000-a-year executive has a net gain of $158 for the year - about $3 more a week in take-home pay - while the $400,000- a-year executive has a net gain of $509, or under $10 a week in additional take-home pay. In addition to widening the tax brackets and increasing both the zero-bracket amount and the personal exemption, indexing will also liberalize a few other items in the code. For example, the new $1,000 limit on the amount of investment tax credit that can be claimed for luxury automobiles used for business will be adjusted upward next year to reflect any future increases in car prices, said Mr. Nad. And the current deductible limits on how much companies can contribute to corporate pension plans on behalf of individual workers will also be indexed. But this adjustment will be postponed until 1988, instead of taking effect in 1986, as originally scheduled. As welcome as these initial steps are, tax experts believe there are many more provisions in the tax code that need to be regularly adjusted for inflation before the tax system is adequately indexed. These include such items as the $10,000 annual gift tax exclusion, the $125,000 exclusion on the sale of a home by older people, and the $80,000 foreign earned income exclusion for taxpayers living overseas. ''In effect, people who rely on provisions in the tax code that have fixed dollar amounts are penalized'' without indexing, said Mr. Nad.

1264-> Indian Airlines Buys Boeing 757's
Indian Airlines, the state-run domestic carrier, has decided to buy Boeing 757's in preference to the British- French Airbus, Kamini Chaddha, managing director, said. He declined to say how many the airline would buy or at what price. It fits better into our system and is operationally and economically more suitable for us, he said. The 757 can carry nearly 180 passengers and will replace the airline's fleet of 10-year- old Boeing 737's. As of March 1983, Indian Airlines had 25 Boeing 737's, 10 Airbus A300's, 12 British Aerospace HS-748's and 8 Fokker F-27's.

1265-> JAZZ: STEVE KUHN LEADS TRIO AT VANGUARD
STEVE KUHN'S piano has usually been heard in recent years in the context of a quartet, into which the voice of Sheila Jordan was integrated, or in solo situations. This week at the Village Vanguard, through Sunday, he is back in the setting in which he spent most of his earlier years - a trio supported by bass and drums, but with differences. One difference is the caliber of his colleagues - his bassist is Ron Carter, a musician of unusual versatility, imagination and skill, and his drummer is Al Foster, taking a brief leave from Miles Davis's group. But another, and quite provocative, difference, is the way in which he is mixing jazz tunes that have become standard pieces in that field and standards from the pop field. One set at his opening on Tuesday consisted of J. J. Johnson's ''Lament,'' Gigi Gryce's ''Minority,'' John Coltrane's ''Trane's Blues'' and Mr. Davis's ''Tune-Up,'' all of them established parts of the jazz repertory, along with ''How Insensitive,'' ''Alone Together'' and ''I Thought About You'' from the pop field. In performance, they became all of a piece - the jazz numbers were, in one way or another, strongly melodic, but developed in authentic and imaginative jazz terms, while the pop tunes retained their familiar, singable qualities as Mr. Kuhn put them into a jazz context. To a degree, what Mr. Kuhn is doing is a more subtle and complex variant of Erroll Garner's approach. Mr. Kuhn is a positive, two-handed pianist who can be effectively spare and sketchy but who also builds rolling, sometimes oddly accented lines that eventually sweep relentlessly along, driven by the rhythmic juggernaut supplied by Mr. Carter and Mr. Foster.

1266-> AN OIL MARKET FIT TO DEAL WITH DISRUPTIONS
To the Editor: In a June 4 editorial, you realistically addressed oil supply disruption in the Persian Gulf. Because oil is fungible, i.e., freely traded, a possible price rise would affect all consumers, including Americans, even though this country draws only 3 percent of its oil from the gulf. For the same reason, the oil-sharing agreement of the International Energy Agency is superfluous; the market will allocate the available oil much better and with less fuss. What else should be done? Panic buying can drive up the price - for a while. But releases of stockpiled oil, and exhortations, can counter panic. No governmental coordination is needed; in fact, it would create mischief. Again, because oil is fungible, any release anywhere will moderate the price for all consumers. If the U.S. Government released oil early, and Japan held back, the U.S. could make a profit by selling at the high world price and buying back after the peak has passed, and Japan would miss the peak. But if the price continued upward, then the Japanese Government would make a greater profit by selling later. Every owner of oil stockpiles, whether private or public, becomes in effect a speculator. The oil consumer will be unaffected by the source of the oil and is better off if there are many individual decisions made on releasing oil rather than a single one - which could be wrongly timed. S. FRED SINGER Fairfax, Va., June 5, 1984

1267-> A German Bid for U.S. News
Gruner & Jahr, the West German publishing group, said it had bid $150 million for U. S. News & World Report, the third-largest weekly news magazine in the United States. Gruner & Jahr is based in Hamburg, and 74.9 percent of the company is owned by Bertelsmann, a publishing group whose United States subsidiaries include Bantam Books and Arista Records. Gruner & Jahr said that on May 30 it had filed a statement of intent to acquire the United States magazine through the Brown Printing Company, a United States subsidiary it acquired in 1979. Gruner & Jahr publishes about 20 magazines, including Parents and Young Miss in the United States. It was jolted last year when its flagship magazine, Stern, published bogus diaries of Adolf Hitler. In fiscal year 1983, its worldwide revenues rose 9.1 percent, to the equivalent of $708.9 million. The company does not disclose its net income, but Bertelsmann, its parent, said net earnings rose 51.4 percent, to $59.3 million, on a 3 percent sales increase, to $2.3 billion. U. S. News, which is employee- owned, has been seeking bids since an unidentified company made an unexpected offer in December. Several other publishing concerns have been reported to be interested in bidding.

1269-> A Playful Prediction Becomes Battle Cry
On May 22 in Wheeling, W. Va., Walter F. Mondale playfully vowed to reporters that he would cross the threshold of 1,967 delegates, the number needed to win the Democratic Presidential nomination, at 11:59 A.M. June 6, central daylight time. Since then the promise became a refrain at every news conference where the candidate was asked when he would have the delegates to win the nomination. In Chicago, for example, Mr. Mondale said he initially believed he would have the delegates by noon on June 6 but was ''much more confident'' and had decided to move it up by a minute. On Tuesday the Mondale staff wore buttons reading ''Is It Noon Yet?'' This morning at precisely 11:59, Mr. Mondale walked into a hotel ballroom here and began, ''Yesterday the primary season came to a close.''

1270-> INDIRA GANDHI CALLS REBELLION 'UNDER CONTROL'
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared today that the rebellion by Sikh soldiers of the past few days was ''fully under control.'' No new desertions were reported. In addition to the statement by Mrs. Gandhi, who spoke to opposition leaders, the Government formally asserted that after the Indian Army operation against Sikh militants last week in the Golden Temple in Amritsar, the holiest Sikh shrine, the rebellion had been moving ''toward full- scale insurgency.'' The army has said Sikhs seeking more autonomy for the northern state of Punjab, which has a large Sikh population, had been using the temple to store arms and harbor terrorists. 'Certain Foreign Powers' The purpose of the insurgency, the Government said today, was the creation of an independent Sikh state with ''the encouragement, connivance and assistance of certain foreign powers.'' A Government spokesman declined to say which foreign powers were meant. The assertions were apparently part of an attempt to mollify large numbers of angry Sikhs offended by the invasion of the Golden Temple, in which at least 450 people, and perhaps as many as 1,200, were killed. There has been no independent verification of the casualties or of Government assertions that the situation in Punjab is improving. Foreign reporters have been barred from the state and Indian reporters have been severely restricted there. The Government also said it would treat captured Sikh deserters from the army with ''utmost sympathy and understanding.'' This will include the extension of full service benefits to the families of 42 deserters said to have been killed while trying to avoid capture, the Government said. The total included three deserters who died today after a gunbattle Tuesday in Gujarat. The Government said about 1,200 deserters had been captured in various parts of the country. In the most serious uprising, at Ramgarh in Bihar, the desertions turned into mutiny when Sikh soldiers killed a brigadier. Some Rail Service Resumes In Punjab, some rail service resumed today, curfews were lifted for substantial periods and in Jullundur, where the city's 11 newspapers had been suspended since early last week, the papers resumed publication. But a ban on the reporting and publication of news about the operations against the Sikh militants remained in effect. According to the Government, terrorists still at large killed three people in the Bhatinda district of Punjab on Tuesday night. An official Home Ministry spokesman said the army was continuing to hunt Sikhs not killed or captured at the Golden Temple and 43 other places of worship throughout Punjab last week. The spokesman said the number still at large was probably ''not in the hundreds'' - a statement apparently at odds with a military estimate, disclosed last week by army sources, that perhaps 5,000 militants remained at large and that it might take months to hunt them down. The Home Ministry spokesman also said 350 to 400 militants were killed in the raid on the Golden Temple, along with 90 soldiers. Other Government sources put the number of Sikhs killed in the temple assault at 800, and some army sources say it is as high as 1,000. Denies Women Were Killed The Home Ministry spokesman denied reports that women and children were killed in the Golden Temple. ''Not even one woman or one child got killed,'' he said. He also denied a report that all or most Sikh soldiers had been removed from the ranks before the assault on the temple began. ''This is quite wrong,'' he said, adding that the force included numerous Sikhs. Varying reports emerged today as to how Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, the militant leader who died in the temple fighting, was killed. Army sources said last week that he died in a hail of bullets during a battle with troops. The Home Ministry spokesman, however, supported what some militants who surrendered during the temple battle have said - that Mr. Bhindranwale was killed by members of the Babbar Khalsa, a rival group of armed men loyal to Harchand Singh Longowal, the leader of a moderate Sikh faction. According to this account, the Babbar Khalsa members shot Mr. Bhindranwale and two of his lieutenants after Mr. Bhindranwale rebuffed their appeal to join forces in the fight. According to a third account, also by captured militants, Mr. Bhindranwale's own supporters killed him when they wanted to surrender but he refused. Asked about the conflicting reports, the Home Ministry spokesman said he would ''not like to enter that area'' until he knew for certain just what had happened. Says Deserters Were Misinformed As to the army deserters, the spokesman said most of them had left their posts and headed toward Punjab because they had been misinformed as to events there. Some of the Sikh soldiers, the spokesman said, heard rumors that other troops were raping and looting in Punjab and that the Golden Temple had been destroyed. Because of this ''false propaganda'' and the misunderstanding it caused, the Government said earlier, it is preparing to treat the deserters with sympathy. In an official document put out by the Home Ministry tonight, the Government asserted, as it has several times, that the Harmandir Sahib, the Golden Temple proper, was not damaged in the temple battle. It said further that troops were instructed not to wear leather inside the temple grounds. The wearing of leather is considered an offense in the Sikh religion. When the troops entered the Harmandir Sahib, the statement said, they did so barefoot, in accordance with Sikh religious custom. In the same document, the Government said the militant movement that reportedly used the temple as its headquarters, armory and base of operations had paralyzed the state of Punjab. ''And with a little more time,'' the statement said, ''there would have been little left of civil administration in Punjab.'' 'Should Be Pondered' Evidently in an attempt to lessen Sikh anger further over the temple assault, the statement said the depth, breadth and seriousness of the militant threat to both Punjab and the nation ''should be pondered by every right- thinking Sikh in this country.'' The document asserted that in time, the militant movement would have developed into a ''full-scale insurgency, which would have crippled the armed forces in any future confrontation across the borders.'' The border referred to was apparently the one with Pakistan. Pakistan and India have fought four wars, and mutual suspicion persists. The purpose of the militant movement was to create an indepedent Sikh nation called Khalistan, the document said. Mr. Bhindranwale had said that he did not favor the creation of Khalistan. The Home Ministry document, however, said the militants led by Mr. Bhindranwale ''were perhaps only cogs in the wheel'' of a movement ''fully supported by neighboring and foreign powers.'' The ministry spokesman said that the conspiracy was ''very deep seated'' and that the nature of foreign involvement would become clear with time. The document asserted that the Sikh militants were well trained and well disciplined militarily, and that training was carried out in what were ostensibly religious camps in the Pakistani-occupied portion of Kashmir, in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir and in Sikh temples in various parts of India. Captives Reportedly Shot AMRITSAR, India, June 13 (AP) - A doctor and a police official said today that army troops shot several captive Sikhs at point-blank range here last week after tying their hands behind their backs. ''Two of the Sikhs whose post-mortem examinations I conducted had their hands tied at the back,'' said the doctor, a Sikh who normally works in a Government hospital in nearby Jullundur. ''Some of my other colleagues conducting post-mortems also came across young Sikhs who had been shot this way,'' the doctor said. The police official, an Amritsar deputy police superintendent who is also a Sikh, said at least 13 Sikhs were tied up and shot by the soldiers who stormed the Golden Temple last week.

1271-> CLUES TO HOSPITAL QUALITY THE PUBLIC SHOULD KNOW
To the Editor: Your June 4 news article ''Proposed Rule Brings Battle on Access to Hospital Data'' cites the proposal by the Department of Health and Human Services to make public detailed information on medical care provided by physicians and hospitals. There is now ample evidence to suggest that greater public information leads to both containment of rising costs and increases in the quality of care. Let us consider the case of open- heart surgery (recent findings suggest that the conclusions apply to other major surgeries as well): Studies have shown an inverse relationship between the number of cardiac surgeries performed at hospitals and mortality rates, even adjusting for case mix of patients. This association may stem from a number of reasons. With a greater number of surgeries, surgical teams may work more easily together; complications in surgery can be anticipated; specialized facilities and equipment might be acquired, and surgical skills can be perfected. Furthermore, an inverse relationship has also been shown between number of surgeries and cost per surgery, since fixed costs are apportioned to the number of patients. Recent studies published in leading medical journals reveal that 55 percent of hospitals in the U.S. perform fewer than 200 cardiac surgeries per year, the minimum recommended for proficiency by the Department of Health and Human Services. The range in number is quite large, even within cities. For example, in 1981, the latest year in which unpublished data by the American Hospital Association are available, the number of open-heart surgeries by hospital in New York City ranged from 75 at Veterans Administration Medical Center to 1,337 at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. In New York State, there were seven hospitals which performed fewer than 200 open- heart surgeries, in California 47. Most of us enter hospitals recommended to us by our physicians, but more information on the quality of hospitals may be necessary. If hospitals are unwilling to disseminate such information, perhaps labeling certain hospitals as dangerous to one's health for certain procedures might be an alternative. A listing of the number of cardiac surgeries performed by hospital might be another. If restaurants can be rated by our local newspapers, surely we are entitled to at least as much information when it comes to selection of a hospital for serious surgery. If more information were available on the quality of hospitals, a greater number of people would have surgery at quality hospitals, resulting in an improvement in overall quality of care. Hospitals that perform a sub-optimal number of surgeries may have to close some of their surgery facilities. These closings would also decrease the rate of increase in health-care costs. I believe that the increased dissemination of information in the medical marketplace would be a significant step in improving the quality of care as well as reducing the high costs of health care today. WARREN GREENBERG Washington, June 6, 1984 The writer is an associate professor in George Washington University's Department of Health Services Administration.

1272-> THURSDAY, JUNE 21, 1984 International
Democrats were rebuffed as the Senate rejected, by a vote of 55 to 41, a proposal to withdraw nearly one-third of American troops in Europe in 1990 if NATO members failed to increase military contributions. The proposal was offered by Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia. The Senate later voted, 94 to 3, to accept a compromise measure urging NATO members to increase their contributions to the alliance, but omitting any threat to withdraw American troops. (Page A1, Col. 1.) Widened Saudi air defense activity was indicated by Reagan Administration officials. They said that Saudi Arabia had told the United States and friendly countries in the Persian Gulf region that it would move to intercept threatening aircraft in waters beyond Saudi territorial limits. (A1:1-2.) Francois Mitterrand flew to Moscow for a visit that both the French and the Russians are approaching warily. The visit, his first as France's President, is expected to be rich in political maneuvering and symbolic gestures but short on firm results. (A4:3-6.) A drive against Portuguese guerrillas has resulted in the detention of at least 40 people and the seizure of caches of weapons, explosives and money. The police said the raids were aimed at destroying an urban guerrilla organization. (A3:4-6.) National A comprehensive immigration bill designed to stem the flow of illegal aliens into this country was narrowly approved by the House. The landmark measure would prohibit the employment of illegal aliens and offer legal status to illegal aliens who can show they have been living in the United States continuously since January 1982. The final vote for passage after a week of bitter debate was 216 to 211. (A1:4-6.) The fear of deportation haunts the lives of illegal aliens. A Mexican couple in Houston with four children is torn about getting further help for an ill child who is a citizen, lest it expose the whole family to deportation. The immigration bill will affect perhaps six million ''illegals.'' (A1:4-5.) The economy is growing much faster than expected while inflation is continuing to ease, the Commerce Department reported. It announced a ''flash'' estimate of a 5.7 percent annual rate for growth of the gross national product in the present quarter. At the same time, it said, inflation is declining, to 3.5 percent from 4.9 percent in the first quarter. (A1:3.) Backers of Jesse Jackson tried to put the Democratic Party on record as favoring ''an independent state for Palestinians,'' but the attempt was defeated overwhelmingly by the 15- member committee drafting the 1984 convention platform. The vote was 13 to 2, with only the two Jackson delegates in support. (A1:2.) Walter F. Mondale telephoned the Rev. Jesse Jackson twice on Tuesday, but apparently failed to resolve differences over Mr. Jackson's demand for rule changes that would give the civil rights leader additional delegates at the Democratic National Convention in San Francisco next month. (B10:1-5.) A reprimand for George Hansen was recommended by the House ethics committee. Representative Hansen, Republican of Idaho, was convicted by a Federal District Court in April of four felony charges relating to his failure to disclose complete details of his complex financial holdings that are required by the 1978 Ethics in Government Act. (A16:1-3.) The lawyer handling the estate of Mario Rios, a California millionaire, said she had learned that Mr. Rios was not the biological father of two frozen embryos ''orphaned'' by his death and that this should clear the way for a grown son, Michael, to inherit his father's fortune. Laura Horwitch, who represents Michael Rios, said doctors at the Melbourne, Australia, clinic where the embryos are held frozen told her that the sperm used to fertilize eggs taken from his wife, Elsa, came from an anonymous donor, not Mr. Rios. (A16:1-2.) Metropolitan Religious groups will be exempt from a mayoral order that bars job discrimination against homosexuals until the legality of the order is tested in the courts, Mayor Koch announced. The announcement eased a dispute between City Hall and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York and the Salvation Army. But both sides agreed that the complex moral arguments that the religious groups had raised would eventually have to be faced. (A1:5-6.) A tip from the father of two victims, a cartridge shell in a burned-out apartment and identification by two witnesses were the main clues that led to the arrest of Christopher Thomas, a 34-year-old Bronx man, for the April 15 slaying of two women and eight children in Brooklyn. (A1:2-4.) A minimum drinking age of 21 throughout the nation was urged by President Reagan as he viewed a high school's program to combat drunken driving in Oradell, N.J. Mr. Reagan then flew to Hartford, where he criticized House Democrats for opposing parts of his proposed anticrime legislation. (B2:1-3.) Lee Krasner Pollock died in New York Hospital at the age of 75. She was a leading Abstract Expressionist painter, the artistic partner and widow of Jackson Pollock and a force in the New York art world. (D23:4-5.) page D1

1273-> Karol Malcyzynski Is Dead; Member of Polish Parliament
Karol Malcuzynski, a member of the Polish Parliament who declined to vote for martial law in 1981, died of a stroke today in a hospital here, friends said. He was 61 years old. A journalist who worked in the 1940's for the Communist Party newspaper Trybuna Ludu and served as press attache at the embassy in London from 1957 to 1960, Mr. Malcuzynski was known for his advocacy of civil rights and the Solidarity movement. One of 49 nonparty members in the Communist-dominated 460-seat Parliament, he was critical of loyalty oaths required in the opening months of martial law and urged officials to open the press to people outside the party.

1274-> JUDGE REJECTS A BID FOR DISMISSAL OF DRUG CASE AGAINST DELOREAN
Federal District Judge Robert M. Takasugi today rejected a defense bid for dismissal of drug charges against John Z. DeLorean. The judge also said a prosecutor had committed no improprieties in the handling of investigative notes, laying to rest an issue that generated four days of courtroom conflict. Judge Takasugi said that after a thorough reading of disputed notes turned over on court request Tuesday by James P. Walsh Jr., the chief prosecutor, he concluded there was no basis for a dismissal of charges or for declaration of a mistrial. The judge said, ''The accusations as to Mr. Walsh's integrity and performance are certainly unjustified.'' Mr. DeLorean is charged with conspiring to import and distribute 55 pounds of cocaine in the hope of making a large profit. The defense contends Mr. DeLorean thought he was pursuing a legitimate business deal, which he needed to save the sports car company he founded in Northern Ireland. Hoffman Examination Ends The arguments over the notes, which have been a sideshow to the testimony of James Timothy Hoffman, a Government informer, ended as it began last Thursday, out of the sight and hearing of the six-man, six-woman jury that will decide Mr. DeLorean's guilt or innocence. Mr. DeLorean's chief lawyer, Howard L. Weitzman, completed cross- examination today of Mr. Hoffman, the Government's star witness, after 12 days of grueling questioning. Mr. Weitzman acknowledged outside of court that he did not ''chop him into little pieces,'' the words he had used in making a prediction to reporters when he began questioning Mr. Hoffman. ''He's a con man by profession,'' Mr. Weitzman said. ''He's used to lying for a living.'' The defense lawyers had not filed papers on a motion for dismissal. But the defense had talked to the judge about filing one since last week. Donald M. Re, the other DeLorean lawyer, said they would file a motion for dismissal Thursday. Discrepancies Were Discussed The contention over the notes involved whether the Government had produced all the information the defense was entitled to concerning meetings before a second indictment of Mr. DeLorean. Mr. Walsh and Mr. Hoffman acknowledged that they used the meetings to discusss discrepancies in the informer's statements. Mr. Weitzman had said the defense was most concerned over statements Mr. Hoffman made in his testimony before a grand jury on Oct. 29, 1982, some of which Hoffman has admitted at the trial were not true. Mr. Weitzman cited several, including that Mr. Hoffman told the grand jury he first met Mr. DeLorean in 1979, as a neighbor near San Diego, when it was actually 1980, and that Mr. DeLorean had approached him in 1982 before raising the subject of a drug deal, but he testified that he had actually called Mr. DeLorean. The defense contends that the most important contradiction was a statement by Mr. Hoffman to the grand jury that he had recorded all telephone conversations with Mr. DeLorean. The informer later said that four calls were not recorded. Mr. Hoffman has testified that he simply forgot to account for the unrecorded calls to the grand jury. The judge also denied a defense request for a transcript of the second grand jury proceedings, which met in June 1983. Mr. DeLorean was indicted for a second time after two co-defendants in the first indictment pleaded guilty. Mr. Weitzman ended his cross- examination without asking Mr. Hoffman about a purported threat that Mr. DeLorean has said the informer made against his family had Mr. DeLorean tried to back out of a drug deal. Asked about the omission, Mr. Weitzman told reporters he did not bring up the threat because he did not expect to get a truthful answer.

1278-> EXCITEMENT STIRS DEMOCRATS WITH WOMAN SET FOR TICKET
Thursday the Democrats made history. Today they made plans. Gripped by excitement and incipient exhaustion, party officials and Walter F. Mondale's campaign staff members began drafting a political strategy and image to match their new Vice-Presidential contender. ''It's a different world today,'' said Ann F. Lewis, political director of the Democratic National Committee, taking a break from nonstop convention meetings to talk about the changes wrought by Mr. Mondale's selection of Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro as his running mate. Mrs. Lewis and others gleefully asserted that Mr. Mondale's choice had caused surprise and confusion in the Republican camp. 'Reagan's at a Loss' ''It's so clear Reagan's at a loss right now,'' she said. ''It ain't step by step anymore. Now we're light years ahead in terms of political strategy.'' Ernest Green, an Assistant Secretary of Labor in the Carter Administration who is a leading supporter of the Rev. Jesse Jackson, joined Mrs. Lewis in the kitchen of the noisy committee headquarters. ''The Administration's baffled, all twisted in knots,'' he said, with a satisfied grin. ''This has opened the way for an enormous pool of talent that's been overlooked.'' Robert Squier, a Democratic campaign consultant, said White House officials he knew were scrambling to recast the Republican campaign. ''They always wanted to run against Mondale because he's so predictable,'' said Mr. Squier. ''But now he's done the most unpredictable thing in the history of the Republic. They had a contingency plan for every contingency except what he did to 'em.'' When Prosecutor Lays Out Case He expects the Republicans to underestimate Mrs. Ferraro at first. ''Right now there's a lot of smirking and grinning at the White House,'' he added. ''But when this prosecuting attorney gets done laying out her case against the Republicans, those smirks and grins will be gone.'' Many Democrats were still crowing over the image of Ronald Reagan in a Kentucky cave when he learned of his new opponent. ''I love that metaphor of Reagan as caveman,'' said Mr. Squier. Thomas Donilon and a team of young Mondale staff members stayed up until the early hours calling more than 1,000 delegates across the country to get their reaction. He said the response was overwhelmingly positive. ''Some people were so happy they cried,'' Mr. Donilon said. The mood of San Francisco seemed to reflect the energy suffusing the Democrats. Gary Hart flew in and delegates began arriving, causing long lines in hotels. Final plans were being made for 300 convention events, from welcoming parties for delegates to a reception by Mayor Dianne Feinstein. Scene at Mondale Command At the American Savings Building was the whirlwind known as Mr. Mondale's Democratic National Convention command post. This office features a communication system of nearly 200 convention floor hot lines, 75 two-way radios, dozens of beepers and 1,400 volunteers and 200 staff members. There is also a transportation system known as MART. That stands for Mondale Area Rapid Transit when it works and Mondale's Attempt at Rapid Transit when it doesn't. Mrs. Lewis said she expected the Republicans to try to attack Mrs. Ferraro on the issue of war and peace. ''We're anticipating them playing up the commander-in-chief angle,'' said Mrs. Lewis. ''I'm going to start an in- house pool on when they'll come up with the first pictures of George Bush reviewing the troops.'' Mr. Squier said the Democrats would be able to use Mrs. Ferraro's sex in their favor. ''A woman will have some advantages a man doesn't have. She can be tough without sounding shrill or mean.'' He added: ''She can attack the callous disregard of problems in the Administration on environment'' as well as the so-called sleaze factor. ''She can say 'If this Admistration is taking these sort of ethical stands now, think what kind of standards they'll have when they're on their own and not facing an election.' '' Mrs. Lewis and other officials were busy today working on the platform and the script of the convention program. Mrs. Ferraro's Schedule They have altered the program so that Mrs. Ferraro would no longer fulfill her function as head of the platform chairman and present the platform Tuesday. ''The enthusiasm over Gerry would swamp the program,'' Mrs. Lewis said. Party officials have also been in negotiations to avoid fights with the forces of Mr. Jackson and Mr. Hart, particularly over sensitive platform issues of affirmative action and banning the use of military forces in the Persion Gulf. They expect Mr. Hart to go ahead with his fight on the Persian Gulf, but by today they felt they had a chance to resolve the question on affirmative action. Mr. Jackson's performance is still worrisome to them. ''Jesse Jackson clearly understands that this speech is a major opportunity for him in his new stature,'' Mrs. Lewis said.

1279-> SPORTS PEOPLE;
The boxer who said ''no mas'' to end a bout almost four years ago said no more to his career yesterday at the airport in Panama City. Roberto Duran , knocked out in the second round last week by Thomas Hearns, returned home and announced his retirement from boxing before a crowd estimated at 1,000. ''All I can say is 'Hands of Stone' is no longer thinking about boxing,'' said Duran, calling himself by his nickname. ''He is thinking of other things, let's say of having fun. I believe that after 17 or 18 years of boxing, I have given everything for this country. And I hope the country knows how to respond.'' Duran has held world titles in three divisions - lightweight, welterweight and junior middleweight. His overall record is 77-6 with 57 knockouts.

1280-> Cambodia Rebels Vow To Press Hanoi Harder
The three leaders of Cambodia's resistance coalition ended three days of talks here today and said they had resolved to increase diplomatic and military offensives against Vietnamese occupation. A statement said the coalition president, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the vice president, Khieu Samphan, and the prime minister, Son Sann, conducted their talks at the Prince's Peking home. ''The three resistance leaders decided to take new measures together to advance the just struggle of Kampuchea,'' the statement said, using the Cambodians' name for their country. It gave no details of the new measures. An aide to Prine Sihanouk said only that the coalition would increase its diplomatic and military efforts against Hanoi, whose forces invaded Cambodia in December 1978 and installed the Heng Samrin regime in January 1979. The coalition is recognized by the United Nations as Cambodia's government, although it holds only limited areas of the country, mainly along the Thai border.

2 Weeks at Bear Mountain For Homeless Children If 9-year-old Tarik Dubose was tongue-tied when he was asked what he wanted to do at camp this summer, it might have been because Tarik had never been to camp. He was among the 83 homeless children temporarily sheltered by the city with their families in the Carter Hotel off Times Square who left this week for Camp Homeward Bound at Bear Mountain State Park. ''I'll be glad to get out of here myself,'' Tarik's mother, Bertha Dubose, said, as she watched the children follow their counselors out of the hotel lobby. Mrs. Dubose said she and her four children had been living in one hotel room for eight months. The second of three two-week sessions was beginning at the camp, which was started this year to serve homeless children. It is operated by the Coalition for the Homeless. On a Lake Kanawauke, Camp Homeward Bound offers swimming, hiking, dancing and arts and crafts. The camp director, Thomas H. Styron, was at the Carter the other day to help pick up the new campers, whose ages range from 7 to 11. Among the 130 campers at the first session were six break-dancers who performed at a nearby hospital in Tuxedo Park, Mr. Styron said. Last April, Mr. Styron and his counselors began visiting 5 of the estimated 50 New York hotels that shelter homeless families to sign up children for camp. ''The sad part is that there are 7,000 kids in these hotels,'' Mr. Styron said, ''and we can only help several hundred of them.'' Although the city and the state have given some money to the camp, Mr. Styron said $20,000 more was needed for clothing and equipment. ''Some of these kids come only with the clothes on their backs,'' he said.

1283-> NICARAGUA SAYS IT WILL RELAX CURBS FOR ELECTION CAMPAIGN
The Nicaraguan Government announced today that it would relax its 28- month-old state of emergency for the coming election campaign. Daniel Ortega Saavedra, the junta coordinator, made the announcement at celebrations here marking the fifth anniversary of the Sandinista Revolution. Mr. Ortega, addressing a crowd of more than 150,000 Government supporters, said the Nov. 4 voting would be ''the first free election in Nicaragua's history.'' But he said the emergency restrictions could not be lifted entirely because of the continued military threat posed by rebels. He announced that 7,391 Nicaraguans had been killed by insurgents in three years of fighting. Under the changes announced today, Mr. Ortega said, political campaigners will be free to travel to every part of the country, hold outdoor rallies and speak and write openly about any subject except national defense. Complaints by Opposition Many opposition leaders, however, said that only a complete repeal of the emergency law and other restricive decrees could persuade them to take part in the election. They have complained that their access to television and radio is restricted and that they cannot compete fairly as long as the apparatus of government is controlled by the Sandinistas. Several opposition parties are considering whether to take part in the election. One likely opposition presidential candidate, Virgilio Godoy Reyes of the Independent Liberal Party, in an interview after Mr. Ortega's speech, called his announcement ''a bit vague.'' ''We don't know how far these measures will go,'' Mr. Godoy said. In his speech, Mr. Ortega addressed himself to the Reagan Administration. ''To the leaders of the United States Government, we say stop the aggression so the emergency can be lifted,'' he declared. ''United States leaders, you imposed the emergency on us. Do not be demagogic, cynical and antidemocratic. Stop the aggression.'' Rebels Aided by U.S. Guerrilla groups fighting to overthrow the Sandinistas have received millions of dollars in covert assistance from the United States Government. Mr. Ortega said armed conflict with rebels ''not only has not stopped, but has expanded.'' His brother, Defense Minister Humberto Ortega Saavedra, said at a ceremony several days ago that the war ''probably will not recede during the next six months.'' Delegations representing 40 foreign governments were in Nicaragua for the anniversary observance, according to a Sandinista commander, Carlos Nunez. He said there were 300 other official guests from political parties and other groups in foreign countries. Two national leaders, Desi Bouterse of Suriname and Jerry Rawlings of Ghana, attended. El Salvador did not send an official delegation, though President Jose Napoleon Duarte considered it. Salvadoran rebels were represented by their civilian leader, Guillermo Manuel Ungo. Washington did not send a delegation, although the United States Ambassador, Harry Bergold, sat with the diplomatic corps. Mr. Ortega noted the presence of pro-Sandinista Americans in the crowd and said he was grateful for their support. ''This is their revolution too,'' he said. Mr. Ortega was chosen this week as the Sandinista candidate for President, and he is viewed as the heavy favorite to win in November. Critics say the Government has restricted their activity to such an extent that they are unable to launch a strong challenge to his candidacy. When they swept to power five years ago, the Sandinistas committed themselves to maintaining a mixed economy, a nonaligned foreign policy and a pluralist political system. Whether they have kept these promises is a matter of continuing debate among Nicaraguans and foreigners. The Reagan Administration and many elements of the opposition say they have not. According to diplomats and members of the Sandinista Front, Mr. Ortega's selection as presidential candidate withstood a challenge by Interior Minister Tomas Borge. Along with Mr. Ortega and Mr. Ramirez as presidential and vice presidential candidates, the Sandinistas also named their candidates for the new 90- member National Assembly.

Dr. Isaac Chomski, a retired Manhattan physician who, as official doctor to the Israeli Consulate and United Nations Mission, treated Golda Meir, Moshe Sharett and Abba Eban among many other Israeli leaders, died Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 80 years old. Dr. Chomski, who retired last year after more than 40 years of practice, was personal physician to Mrs. Meir, the former Prime Minister of Israel, for 25 years. Dr. Chomski was born in Warsaw and received his medical education at the Universities of Paris and Montpelier. He came to the United States from France in 1941, accompanied by 111 refugee children in a program sponsored by the United States Committee for the Care of European Children, headed by Eleanor Roosevelt and Marshall Field 3d. Dr. Chomski is survived by his wife, Masha; a son, Joseph, of Bethesda, Md.; two brothers, Baruch, of Paris and Meir, of Tel Aviv; a sister, Regina Ben-Amittay, of Tel Aviv, and one grandchild.

1286-> EX-CHASE OFFICIAL SAID TO BE NEW CHIEF
William S. Ogden, a leading international banker and a former vice chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank, is expected to be named today as the new chief executive officer of the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company of Chicago, according to bank analysts. The selection of the 56-year-old Mr. Ogden, who had been a leading contender for the presidency of Chase, the nation's third-largest banking company, would pit two former senior Chase executives against each other as the heads of the two largest banks in Chicago. The other is Barry F. Sullivan, who left Chase in 1980 to take over the then-troubled First National Bank of Chicago. Since then, First Chicago's earnings have improved substantially. Although Mr. Ogden will be chief excutive officer of Continental, it is understood that the bank will have an unusual management structure, and that Mr. Ogden will share power with another appointee. Late yesterday in Chicago one knowledgeable source reported that John E. Swearingen, retired chairman of the Standard Oil Company (Indiana), would join the new Continental management team. The report surprised former colleagues at Indiana Standard and could not be confirmed. Calls to Mr. Swearingen's Chicago home went unanswered. The appointments would be made effectively by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Mr. Ogden and a second officer would replace David G. Taylor, Continental's current chairman and chief executive officer, and Edward S. Bottum, president. The two were named to their positions last February, after the resignations of Roger E. Anderson, the former chairman who presided over Continental's downfall, and John H. Perkins, its president. Mr. Ogden, who had been with Chase for three decades, stayed on there as vice chairman and chief financial officer until February 1983, although he had been passed over for the No. 2 spot in 1980, when Thomas G. Labrecque was named president. Following his retirement, he has been a financial consultant, operating out of Connecticut. Officials would not confirm the reports. Mr. Ogden's wife, Marian, answered a phone call to his Connecticut home yesterday, but replied ''no comment'' to questions regarding whether he had been chosen for the job. But the Madison Hotel in Washington, where Mr. Ogden usually stays in that city, confirmed yesterday that Mr. Ogden had checked in Tuesday evening and that he had checked out yesterday. Broad International Experience In addition to his seven-year stint as Chase's chief financial officer, Mr. Ogden has had broad experience in international banking and in 1972 he was put in charge of the bank's international operations. It was during the 1970's that Chase's international activities expanded rapidly under the chairmanship of David Rockerfeller. Shortly before Mr. Ogden left Chase in 1983, he played a major role in organizing the Institute of International Finance, an organization designed to improve the exchange of credit information among international banks and their borrowers. Mr. Ogden's international prestige is believed to have been a major factor in his choice as the new chief executive officer of Continental. Analysts said his global reputation is expected to quickly help restore Continental's ability to raise funds from banks around the world. It was huge withdrawals of deposits by banks in Europe and Asia that led to the Chicago bank's near-collapse last May.

1287-> Required Reading The Public Servant
Senator David Durenberger, Republican of Minnesota, in remarks to the Senate, Aug. 10: Anybody who has been around Washington for more than a few days is exposed to all kinds of cynical comments about the ability of our Government to recognize and reward talent. In fact, the myth of the incompetent or uncaring public servant has become so pervasive that we have recently seen the spectacle of politicians running for office on the claim that they don't know anybody in Washington. One of the things which first convinced me to enter politics is the growing distrust and dislike of the American people for their Government. It is vital that we as a nation move to restore trust between the people and their public servants. If we do not, governance will become more and more difficult. The Elderly Victim Senator John Heinz, Republican of Pennsylvania, in remarks to the Senate, Aug. 10: As chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I have been particularly concerned about the fear of crime and the impact of crime, especially upon elderly victims. There is good cause for concern. The Department of Justice concludes that of the 26 million older Americans in this country, about 182,000 will be victims of a violent crime this year. About 642,000 will suffer a theft. Another 1.5 million households will be the victims of larceny. Older persons are more concerned about the impact of crime on their lives than they are about their health, income or most other social programs.

1291-> THE SIZE OF NEW YORK CITY'S CRIME PROBLEM
To the Editor: Your April 25 editorial ''Bluster From the Bench'' is a curious specimen of an almost arrogant dishonesty. You, sitting in a Times Square building protected by a tight security system, say that I, sitting in a nearby courthouse ringed by narcotics sellers and wired from top to bottom with a newly installed burglar alarm system, know ''how to ring the crime chimes.'' You say this in a city with 2.5 million reported felonies since 1980 and, according to a Police Department report you published last December, 312,000 outstanding arrest warrants for suspects who have jumped bail. If I know how to ring the chimes, you know how to deceitfully stop them. You flippantly repeat my statement that ''criminals have taken the city'' and liken me to someone ''hustling votes in a fearful neighborhood.'' You did not think Police Commissioner Ward was hustling votes when you quoted him on your April 19 front page as saying that ''we're just going to go out there and take the streets back from the hoodlums and give them back to the people.'' Nor did you regard New York City residents as chime ringers when, in an editorial of Jan. 2, 1982, you noted that the overwhelming number of them had cited crime as the city's primary problem. You hypocritically chide me for saying that ''crime has beaten government to its knees'' when you have published articles showing that law enforcement officials are able to pursue such a small percentage of felons that I hesitate to repeat the figures you printed because they might inspire someone to commit a crime. You ask, ''Why did the voters turn down a bond issue to build more prisons?'' and answer the question by asserting that the 1981 bond issue was defeated because voters did not consider more prison cells necessary. After the bond issue was defeated by 13,699 votes, your editorial stated that ''officials who campaigned vigorously for it should read the slim majority as a mixed mandate: yes, build urgently needed cells, but do something about management, too.'' Why did you hide that mandate while you were propping me up for an editorial auto-da-fe? Why did you state, as you threw the match, that voters ''seem more interested in fixing up streets, subways and schools'' than in building more prisons? You yourself reported on Dec. 13, 1981, that New York City and metropolitan area voters favored the bond issue by a margin of 2 to 1. The voters who you say are more interested in subways than prisons apparently live in upstate agricultural counties. The hundreds of thousands of metal gates on New York City apartment windows, you say, ''may simply reflect a shrewd calculation'' that dollars spent on gates ''probably buy more protection than additional tax dollars for criminal justice.'' This inhumane statement would shock the hundreds of thousands of people who have put up those gates to protect themselves from burglary, robbery, rape and murder, and who, as if imprisoned, must peer from behind bars as they watch the seasons change. You say our prisons are ''for the most vicious, repetitive criminals'' and tell us that we must ''find other ways to punish the rest.'' Do you propose freeing all criminals who, by standards that you may have devised, are merely moderately vicious or, if ''most vicious,'' have not been repeatedly most vicious? Do you not sense that society must protect itself while looking for ''other ways to punish the rest,'' and that society has been looking for those ways for more than 200 years - without the slightest success? FRANCIS T. MURPHY New York, April 30, 1984 The writer, presiding justice of State Supreme Court's Appellate Division, First Department, is president of the Federation of New York State Judges.

1292-> THE REGION; Boy Learns 'Gold' Has 17/ Glitter
Joey Errico has been given the bad news. The gold bar he found in the bushes when he fell off his bicycle near his home in Franklin Square, L.I., turned out to be brass. Joey, who is 12 years old, picked up the dull yellow metal object after his fall at Maple Drive and Kalb Avenue on Saturday afternoon. Back home he polished the bar - 4 inches long, 2 inches wide and half an inch thick - and it became a shiny, gold-colored object. He and his mother, Eileen Errico, took the bar to the Elmont station house of the Nassau County police. Detectives said it could be worth several thousand dollars if it turned out to be gold. They sent it to the police laboratory in Mineola for analysis. The report came back Wednesday and it was relayed to Joey. Twelve ounces of brass, the laboratory said, worth about 17 cents.

1293-> SHUTTLE CONDITION DELIGHTS ENGINEERS
Space agency engineers reported here today that the space shuttle Discovery came through its inaugural flight in far better condition than did its sister spaceships, the Columbia and the Challenger. An inspection of the $1.2 billion shuttle, which landed here Wednesday, showed that it sustained minor damage to the brakes, landing gear and a couple of heat-shielding tiles. Herman K. Widick, ground operations manager at the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Fla., said that a quick look at the wastewater nozzle gave no indication why ice accumulated around it, which caused concern in the six-day mission. ''It was wet, but nothing beyond that,'' Mr. Widick said of the nozzle. Describing the Discovery's condition at a news conference, Mr. Widick said: ''You couldn't expect it to be any better. It looks like the turnaround will be simpler than we would have anticipated after a first flight.'' Shuttle Will Return to Florida The plan now is to ferry the Discovery back to Cape Canaveral this weekend atop a Boeing 747. In Florida it is to undergo more detailed inspection and maintenance in preparation for its next flight, scheduled for early November. The next shuttle mission, the 13th since the program became spaceborne in 1981, is tentatively set for launching Oct. 1, with the Challenger going into orbit carrying an Earth Radiation Budget Satellite and a mapping camera. Two astronauts are scheduled to take a space walk to practice in-orbit refueling operations. Mr. Widick said that trouble with the brakes, which has been chronic in shuttle landings, was relatively minor this time: some broken washers and retaining clips. The brakes were being shipped back to the manufacturer, the B. F. Goodrich Company in Troy, Ohio, for further analysis. David McClure, a company spokesman, said, ''More instrumentation is being put on future flights, until we have enough data to pinpoint the problem.'' Pressure Leak Is Discovered On all but one shuttle landing, the Columbia's second, the brakes have been damaged, though they never failed to bring the spaceships to a full stop after a normal roll-out on the runway. Engineers also noted that a pressure leak developed in the shock absorber on the right strut of the landing gear during the Discovery's landing. This left the spaceship sitting about three feet lower on its right side, which could account for the fact that the Discovery failed to keep to the center line of the runway, veering to the right in the roll-out. While engineers worked on the spaceship, the Discovery crew took the day off to rest at their homes in Houston. The crew members are Henry W. Hartsfield Jr., Comdr. Michael L. Coats of the Navy, Lieut. Col. Richard M. Mullane of the Air Force, Dr. Steven A. Hawley, Dr. Judith A. Resnik and Charles D. Walker.

1294-> PHILHARMONIC HAILED IN JAKARTA
The New York Philharmonic won enthusiastic reviews today after a sell-out concert here Wednesday night. The orchestra's conductor, Zubin Mehta, drew calls for an encore Wednesday evening from an audience of 3,000 people, who applauded the Philharmonic's performance of Gustav Mahler's Symphony No. 5. The audience, which included diplomats and members of President Suharto's Cabinet, appeared moved when Mr. Mehta asked for a moment of silence in memory of Adam Malik, the former Indonesian Vice President, who died of cancer Wednesday. 'Best Treat' in Decades Idris Sardi, one of Indonesia's most distinguished violinists, hailed the orchestra's visit as the ''best treat'' for Indonesia in several decades. The orchestra was scheduled to play a second concert here tonight before leaving for Singapore, the next stop on its monthlong Asian tour. The tour became controversial when the Philharmonic at first agreed to drop a work from its program in Malaysia at the Government's request. The Government asked that ''Schelomo, a Hebrew Rhapsody for Cello and Orchestra'' by Ernest Bloch not be played in Kuala Lumpur because it would be offensive to Malaysia's mainly Moslem population. After protests in the United States, the Philharmonic canceled its appearance in Malaysia and added a stop in Bangkok, Thailand. Tour spokesmen in Indonesia, whose population is also mainly Moslem, said the program for the Philharmonic was prepared months ago and that ''Schelomo'' had not been included.

1296-> ROCK: CYNDI LAUPER IN A HOMECOMING OCNCERT
Cyndi Lauper's rock concert Wednesday night at Pier 84 had all the ingredients of a celebratory homecoming. The place was packed, with a crowd primed to love her (the number of look-alikes and children was striking, but the audience as a whole was refreshingly mixed). She herself was dressed particularly flamboyantly - variations on the theme of orange - and had brought along her mother, ''Captain'' Lou Albano and others familiar from her videos. She was in really excellent voice, stronger and clearer than on her record. And yet, for all the charm of her personality, the show never really cohered, never managed to transcend individual songs into the sort of exultant experience it might well have been. For those who came in late, Miss Lauper is a singer in her early 30's who finally caught on big this year with her solo debut album, ''She's So Unusual.'' Miss Lauper brings an ebullient personality, a set of Betty Boop mannerisms, a rugged soprano that encompasses both dance tunes and affecting ballads, a strong song- writing gift plus an unerring ear for songs by others and a fine band into one by now massively popular package. On Wednesday, however, too much time was spent dithering about the stage between numbers; the dithering had its sweet moments, but along with the ''reconciliation'' with Mr. Albano, after their studiously public ''feud,'' valuable momentum was lost. In addition, it took several songs for the technicians to get the balance right: Miss Lauper was buried damagingly in the mix, although a side effect was to focus attention on the invention and confidence of her intrumentalists. Little care seemed to have been spent in figuring out how to knit everything - song sequence and patter - into a whole that moved triumphantly to a climax. That said, there was much to enjoy. Miss Lauper's knack for the clever interpolation and symbolically affecting song selections have not deserted her, as in the funny yet somehow meaningful interruption of her old- timey version of the 1929 ''He's So Unusual'' with the ominous refrain from the rap hit ''The Message'' by Grandmaster Flash, or her single encore, ''Baby Workout,'' by the late and beloved Jackie Wilson. Her set consisted of her album plus a few new songs that will presumably appear on her next album, due early next year. All the hits sounded good (at least after the balance problem was rectified). But to this taste, the most moving song of the night was the Brains' cult classic, ''Money Changes Everything,'' which she placed just before her final ''Girls Just Want to Have Fun'' and which she really does do superbly. One thing money can do is distance rock stars from their roots. In Miss Lauper's case, even with a less than perfect homecoming concert, she still seems to be drawing inspiration from the music and the city that made her what she is.

1300-> CHESAPEAKE DECLARING WAR ON PROPOSED MILITARY TESTS
Preparations for nuclear war are not traditional topics of conversation among people of the Chesapeake Bay, an area famous for its fishing villages, seafood restaurants, oyster harvests and crab cakes. Now, however, commercial and sports fishermen have joined the State of Maryland to protest the construction of a large device in the southern Chesapeake meant to zap ships with electromagnetic pulses that mimic those of a nuclear blast. Detonated high above Earth's atmosphere, a nuclear bomb would bathe many thousands of square miles with an electromagnetic pulse, known as E.M.P., that can surge through metal objects or wires and damage electronic parts. It could knock out unprotected equipment over an area the size of the Pacific Ocean. The Navy wants to build its simulator, called Empress II, to insure that warships are invulnerable to the pulse. The fishermen and the state fear it will kill marine life and upset the bay's delicate ecological balance. The Navy's hand was strengthened last week by a report from the National Academy of Sciences, which said scientists were ''uncomfortable'' with some routine methods the military uses to protect devices from the pulse, since the protections are not foolproof. But the report went on to say that their fallibility made it all the more important to test their effectiveness. ''The report had a clear message,'' said John M. Richardson of the academy's committee on electromagnetic pulse. ''You have to perform tests at facilities like Empress in order to make progress. Military systems are getting so complex that you can't be sure from first principles that they're protected.'' The academy report has been all but ignored by the opposition. ''The bay is one of the most productive ecosystems in the world,'' said Ellen L. Fraites, executive assistant to Maryland Governor Harry Hughes. ''We're making a massive effort to clean it up and now the Navy's going to subject it to this incredible insult. It doesn't make sense.'' The Navy's desire for the new simulator stems in part from the difficulties of protecting ships from E.M.P. The ideal way to protect a military device - a missile, for example - is to cover it completely with a thin sheet of metal that can siphon off the high-voltage surge before it gets in and does damage. Ships are too big for that approach. Instead, their internal wires and cables must be fitted with myriad filters and surge arresters. The Navy has one simulator, Empress I, at Point Patience in Solomons, Md. Its power is limited, however, and so is the size of ship it can accommodate; destroyers and aircraft carriers cannot navigate the narrow channels to get near it. Empress II would be barge-mounted. Its 130-foot-high antenna would be able to shoot 7 million volts, whose intensity would diminish rapidly with distance, toward a nearby warship. Scheduled for completion in 1987, the pulser would be floated west of Bloodsworth Island, near the center of the bay. In a letter sent to Navy Secretary John F. Lehman Jr. in June, Governor Hughes protested the probable effect of Empress II on fish, marine mammals and waterfowl, along with its ''unacceptable adverse impact'' on commercial fishing and recreational boating; apparently, the Navy would close a 12.6-square-mile area, including 1,193 acres of oyster banks, during testing periods. Governor Hughes wrote Mr. Lehman again last week, saying he also fears that the device might disrupt the controls at the nearby Calvert Cliffs nuclear plant. According to Cmdr. William Tate, head of the survivability program in the Navy's Theater Nuclear Warfare Office, critics are well intentioned but needlessly frightened. ''People are apprehensive about something as new and novel as this,'' he said. ''But we've never had any problems with Empress I, with animals or wildlife.'' He said he expects no problems with Empress II. Commander Tate said the Navy had informally given officials in Maryland and Virginia advance copies of an environmental assessment statement. By June of next year, he said, the Navy planned to submit a final impact statement to the Environmental Protection Agency. ''We've got problems that can only be solved by going to a bigger simulator,'' he said. ''We've tried to be open and honest about all this. Clearly it's not going to be an economic boon for the area around Bloodsworth Island. But we'll try to minimize any adverse effects.''

1301-> Chimp in Queens Gets Drunk and Disorderly
After raiding a liquor cabinet, a pet chimpanzee dived through the front window of its owner's house and ran drunkenly though a neighborhood in Hollis, Queens, breaking windows and biting a neighbor on the toe, the police reported yesterday. The chimp, named Bongo, evaded pursuing police officers for half an hour Friday evening until its owner, Mario Cervantes, arrived and persuaded it to return home, according to the authorities. ''The chimp was left in the family house alone,'' Sgt. Charles R. DeCosta, a police spokesman, said. ''He somehow found a quart bottle of vodka and he drank it, and two bottles of beer, and then he crashed through a window and ran into the street.''

1302-> LOUISANA VOTER APATHY SEEN AS AIDING JACKSON
Louisiana holds a Presidential primary on Saturday that some Democrats view more as an act of legal obedience than a political exercise. Gov. Edwin W. Edwards says he plans to boycott the court-ordered election. He called it a ''meaningless'' and ''silly'' waste of taxpayer money. In another gesture of defiance, the State Legislature, which tried to abolish the primary in what it said was an economy move, has refused so far to approve a $150,000 budget request to pay for printing the ballots. State election officials, however, had the ballots printed anyway. In a state known for the vitality of its music and politics, the relatively muted campaign waged here by the three Democratic Presidential candidates has failed to shake the electorate out of its apathy. If enough voters follow the Governor's example, the results could provide a big opening for the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Jackson Supporters Hopeful Overshadowed by the Texas caucuses on the same day, the Louisiana primary is a preference vote, and 57 of the state's 69 national convention delegates will be chosen at party caucuses on May 19. The outcome of the Saturday's balloting is not expected to have a dramatic impact on the campaigns of Walter F. Mondale and Senator Gary Hart of Colorado for the Democratic Presidential nomination. But it has the potential to grab its share of national attention if Mr. Jackson does as well as some of his supporters are predicting. Mr. Jackson, they say, could finish first or second if record numbers of blacks go to the polls, as they have done in other states, and if his two opponents wind up splitting a low white vote. About 28 percent, or 500,000, of the state's 1.7 million registered Democrats are black. With state election officials predicting a voter turnout of 20 percent, or about 350,000, the expectations of Jackson supporters do not strike some as unrealistic, especially in light of Mr. Jackson's showing in last Tuesday's Tennessee primary. In Tennessee, while record numbers of white voters stayed home, record numbers of blacks, who make up only 15 percent of the state electorate, went to the polls. As a result, Mr. Jackson carried three of the state's four largest cities, Memphis, Nashville and Chattanooga, and finished a strong third, only three percentage points behind Mr. Hart. If that voting pattern repeats itself in Louisiana, said Paul Weston, state coordinator of the Mondale campaign, ''There is a real possibility Jackson could come in second, or maybe even first. I think this is going to be a close race where any of the three could break out.'' Jack Scott, a State Representative directing Mr. Hart's campaign, said the Senator's chances of winning depended on a heavy voter turnout. ''The interest is not as high as it should be,'' he said. ''A 25 to 30 percent turnout would be the level where Hart could start doing well.'' Move to Save $1 Million The fact that a primary is being held at all, he said, is a major victory for the Hart and Jackson forces. The State Legislature, faced with a budget crunch, last year voted to cancel the primary, which was originally scheduled for April 7, to save the $1 million the election is expected to cost. Some of Mr. Mondale's backers, including leaders of organized labor, wanted to substitute caucuses, which would have been financed by the State Democratic Party. But supporters of Mr. Hart and Mr. Jackson objected, saying the caucus process would favor the candidate with the most money and the strongest organization. Mr. Jackson's supporters, contending that such a change required Federal approval under the Voting Rights Act, successfully challenged the move in Federal court. But not even a Federal court can command Louisiana Democrats to get excited about this contest. The last candidate debate, held in Dallas Wednesday night, was not even carried on television in this state. Party officials and other Democrats say there seems to be a lack of enthusiasm among voters for either Mr. Mondale or Mr. Hart. The state's most prominent Democratic elected officials, including Senator Russell B. Long, as well as the Governor, are remaining on the sidelines. One explanation offered by some of their supporters was that these officials do not consider the primary important enough to risk public endorsements that could disturb their own political coalitions. 'Let Blacks Have Their Day' ''I think their feeling is this primary is not as important to them as the black vote in this state,'' said one state legislator. ''So why not stand aside and let blacks have their day with Jesse?'' The Governor's brother, Marion Edwards, has been stumping the state for Mr. Mondale, telling voters that the former Vice President had promised, if elected President, to release a $2.2 billion Federal oil escrow fund, most of which would go to Louisiana. Mr. Hart has also tried to curry favor with the state's oil industry, stressing his Senate vote against the Carter Administration's windfall profit tax on newly discovered oil. The Senator, his campaign aides here say, has promised to repeal the tax if elected President. ''Our answer to that,'' said Mr. Weston of the Mondale campaign, ''is that Mondale's position in favor of the windfall profits tax is the same as Louisiana's two Senators. So what's the beef?''

1305-> SCOUTING; For Giant Fans
Longtime Giant fans may have a special interest when Alabama and Louisiana State are matched in a Southeastern Conference game at Birmingham on Nov. 10. Why? Simply because two former Mara Tech head coaches, of divergent specialties, will be pacing the sidelines. Bill Arnsparger, in his first year as head coach of the Fighting Tigers, has been famed for his wizardy with the defensive unit of the Miami Dolphins during 11 of the last 14 years. The only time his reputation for thwarting opposition offenses suffered was from 1974 to 1976, when his Giants allowed 770 points in 35 games. Ray Perkins, conversely, is a specialist in the big-play offense, as demonstrated by the 366 points his Crimson Tide scored in 12 games last season, the first for him at Tuscaloosa after a four-year tenure with the Giants. L.S.U.'s need for defensive bolstering is clear. Last season, in 11 games, the Tigers surrendered 253 points, including 32 in a loss to Perkins and Alabama. Neither coach's philosophy prospered with the Giants. Arnsparger won only 7 of 35 games, Perkins 23 of 57.

1306-> SPORTS OF THE TIMES; THE WINDOW ON NEW YORK
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. They are still the New York Jets. It says so right on their team yearbook, and in the standings of the National Football League, even if they happened to be playing in another state last night. And, although their quest for the perfect washroom took them to Giants Stadium, the Jets could become a true New York team again in five years, according to their lease and stated club policy. The question is how much New York City and New York State should pay to get them to return to the city that nurtured them. The odyssey of the Jets to another state is hardly so grave as the departure of the Colts from Baltimore, a thriving city that deserved better from organized sports. The Jets' odyssey, of only a few miles, was undertaken because Leon Hess, the principal owner of the team, was not happy with the facilities at Shea, the 20-year-old municipal stadium in the Flushing marshland that has not aged well. Now Governor Cuomo and Mayor Koch are trying to persuade Hess to help finance a new stadium. Within two weeks, the New York Urban Development Corporation is expected to recommend to the Governor that a site near Shea Stadium be used for a football stadium and a sports arena. Now that recent generations have become used to watching sports events on television without partaking of sun, rain, snow or fresh city air, some thinkers are enamored with the concept of a domed stadium. A dome is not worth building just for a football team, and it is a ghastly threat to real baseball. Yet, to lure the Jets back for eight league games a year, it might be necessary to build a Hessdome or a Trumpdome. As the bricquets blazed and the hamburger fat sizzled in the parking lots of Giants Stadium last night, the Jets were in a brave new world. But there is a ''window'' clause that could put them back in New York City by the 1989 season, if they are prepared to forfeit a $10 million bond that they have posted with the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority. This clause is contained in the Jets' lease with the authority, which gives them the right to remain at Giants Stadium for as long as 35 years. Is the clause merely a public-relations concession to New York City, to cover Leon Hess's eagerness to scramble to a more profitable stadium in his home state? Perhaps. But Hess has said he would entertain the possibility of returning to a ''proper facility'' in New York. ''The Jets' position is precisely that,'' Steve Gutman, the team's secretary and administrative manager, said yesterday. ''We have told Mayor Koch that we stand by our option. From Feb. 1 to Feb. 15 of 1986, there is a window during which we can terminate our contract by the 1989 season.'' Gutman said that Hess had ''promised the Mayor of New York that if he proved a football facility would be built within that time frame, we would come back.'' ''The first step of that clause is that simple,'' Gutman continued. ''By 1986, plans must be absolutely bound and guaranteed. The stadium doesn't have to be standing. It couldn't possibly be.'' Are the Jets merely tantalizing city loyalists, in order to justify using the more-impressive New York name and playing all those New York pop tunes during timeouts? ''The city does take it seriously,'' Tom Kelly, the Mayor's press secretary, said yesterday. But the city also seems to be taking seriously some implications of luring back the Jets. The city has spent more than $100 million to rebuild Yankee Stadium and additional millions to renovate Shea Stadium and give tax abatements to Madison Square Garden. And these gifts to privately owned teams would seem like Cracker Jack prizes compared with what it would take to build a ''proper facility'' for Leon Hess. Anew stadium is not a major priority in New York City. The subways are a disgrace. The public schools are no bargain. The city is only beginning to repair the roads ignored during the fiscal crises of the last decade. To finance a pleasure palace for a football team would be wrong. But Mayor Koch, who is running for re-election next year, and Governor Cuomo could use the moral force of their offices to convince Leon Hess that, to be a true New York team, you really ought to play your games in New York. Gutman said the Jets had not done ''the final analysis yet,'' but a glance at license plates last night indicated more or less the same regional mix as at Shea Stadium: plenty of New York and Connecticut plates, along with those from New Jersey. Gutman said the 15,000 ticket-holders at Shea Stadium, who had a total of 49,000 seats, had been of this mix: 20 percent from Queens, Nassau and Suffolk; 60 percent from the other boroughs, upstate New York and New England; 18 percent from New Jersey, and 2 percent from ''elsewhere.'' Those Shea patrons bought an additional 12,000 tickets for Giants Stadium, adding up to 61,000 seats there. Gutman said the next 4,000 tickets had gone to waiting-list customers from the Shea era and that the remaining 11,000 had been sold to a New Jersey-era waiting list. ''We don't think there was even a minor defection,'' Gutman said. ''I'm sure some people in eastern Suffolk County have given up on us, but not in any mass measurement.'' Don Phelan, the president and supreme chowderhead of the Jets Parking and Chowder Society, from the Shea Stadium parking fields, said he did not know of anybody who had turned in tickets. A resident of North Massapequa, L.I., he resented the extra hours of traffic jams, but he was going to last night's game ''even though it will hurt to walk under the sign that says 'Giants Stadium.' '' The Jets are regional in nature, but they have traded in on New York city's image for a quarter of a century. They belong back in New York. But not at any cost. The city now has no-parking signs that speak in Edwardian inflections: ''Don't Even THINK of Parking Here.'' Let there also be signs that say: ''Don't Even THINK of Building a Stadium With Mostly Taxpayers' Money.''

1308-> EDDIE MURPHY AS POP SINGER
ROBERT PALMER EDDIE MURPHY, the 23-year- old comedian whose television, film and stage performances and best-selling comedy albums have already made him one of the most sought-after figures in show business, will soon be trying out a new role, that of a pop singer. Last week, CBS issued Mr. Murphy's first pop single, ''Party All the Time.'' The song and the record were written and produced by his friend, the recording star Rick James. Mr. Murphy joined the cast of television's ''Saturday Night Live'' in 1980, when he was 19 years old. He became the show's biggest star, but he recently left to devote more energy to his burgeoning film career. The young comic's first two films, ''Forty Eight Hours'' and ''Trading Places,'' together grossed more than $100 million by the end of 1983. A poll of America's theater owners voted Mr. Murphy the second most popular box- office attraction last year, just behind Clint Eastwood. Such success prompted Paramount to tear up his previous contract and give Mr. Murphy a deal more to his liking. The new contract calls for Mr. Murphy to star in five films, providing him with earnings of at least $15 million. That is probably among the biggest contracts for the services of a single actor in movie history. But there is more. Mr. Murphy will co- produce his films through his own production company, Eddie Murphy Productions, which he organized with his two managers, Robert Wachs and Richard Tienken. Shortage of Screenplays Mr. Murphy and his associates have been inundated with screenplays, but according to the comedian: ''There just aren't that many good scripts around. Most of them seem to be copies of roles or sketches of things I've already done. I won't do a film unless I can tell it's going to be a hit just from reading the script.'' His next starring role will be a portrayal of a policeman in an action- comedy tentatively titled ''Beverly Hills Cop,'' which is scheduled to begin shooting early next month. ''The role orginally was created for Sylvester Stallone,'' said Mr. Wachs. ''But it is going to be just right for Eddie.'' Mr. Murphy has done well in a hand-me-down role before; his role in ''Trading Places'' was originally written with Richard Pryor in mind. Why would an entertainer as successful, and as busy, as Mr. Murphy start yet another career, as a pop singer? ''I can't say I'm trying it out of boredom,'' Mr. Murphy said the other day. He was sitting near his elaborate, modular stereo system in his palatial five-bedroom house in Alpine, N.J., dressed, as usual, in black leather, a sartorial style more typical of pop stars than of comics. A Difficult Conversation The most recent album by the rock group Talking Heads was blaring from two speakers, and Mr. Murphy was practically shouting. ''It's exciting to do what I already do,'' he insisted. ''But singing is something I've always wanted to do, and something I like doing. Why do so many singers want to act? It's the same sort of thing.'' On ''Party All the Time,'' Mr. Murphy's forthcoming disk, he sings in a high tenor, and while the sound of his voice occasionally suggests the influence of Al Green and other soul singers, his style is his own. Rick James's production and arrangement are such that this is a pop single one can dance and listen to. ''I'm wondering how the public is going to take this,'' Mr. Murphy said. ''I think they're either going to love the fact that I'm singing, or they'll hate it. If they hate it, I won't sing anymore, except in my house. If they love it. . .well, I won't be the first singing comic, but I'll be the first comic singer.'' There is a small but functional home recording studio in one room of Mr. Murphy's house, with a drum set, guitar, bass, electric piano, synthesizer and rhythm machine. Mr. Murphy has been working on songs he has written himself and recording them in rough ''demo'' form, playing his own instrumental backing. Some of the tunes are only sketches; some are more developed. Together, they project a personality that is considerably more sensitive and vulnerable than the brash comic character one sees on stage and screen - the Eddie Murphy who said: ''Controversy fuels comedy. I can go out on stage now and easily do 10 or 15 minutes on all the people who are angry with me because of something in one or another of my routines. I admit that my comedy is controversial, but there's no malice in it.'' Bandleader in High School Murphy emphasized that his hopes for a singing career were more than a passing fancy. ''I organized my own bands when I was in high school on Long Island,'' he said. ''I was singing before I did comedy. I would do tunes by the Commodores, some by Earth, Wind and Fire, and then I'd do impressions of Al Green, or Elvis Presley. I was the band's manager, leader and lead singer. Actually, there were guys in the group who sang much better than me; I just wanted to be out front.'' Mr. Murphy still calls Elvis Presley ''my idol, the only entertainer of any kind that I would have liked to trade places with.'' If Mr. Murphy's single is successful, he plans to record an album of songs, and to integrate his comic and singing talents into a new kind of stage show. ''I've heard disk jockeys in discoth eques playing my comedy album, and playing another record, some kind of instrumental music with a strong beat, behind it. That sounded real good. It gave me the idea for a show that would have the audience laughing and snapping their fingers at the same time. I might open with a short standup routine, sing a song or two, do some impressions, all with a nice hot band playing behind me, and with lights, explosions, all the effects you see at a rock concert. I want to revolutionize standup comedy.'' Mr. Murphy's more immediate plans include work on his next feature film and on new material for his standup routines. ''A standup comic is sharing his life experiences with his audience,'' he said, ''and you can only experience so much in 23 years. A lot of the material on my two comedy albums came from growing up and being around my family. It's a big family and get-togethers tend to be real funny. But since I joined the cast of 'Saturday Night Live,' a lot of my life has been studios, cameras, interviews and so on. So for the next year or so, I'm planning on living a little bit, seeing my family more and working on my music. I'll probably tour again a year from this coming summer.'' He'll Be Seen on Reruns ''Best Defense,'' a military comedy starring Dudley Moore that features Mr. Murphy in a cameo appearance as an Army truck driver, will be released this summer. And while Mr. Murphy will not be doing any more 'Saturday Night' programs - he has turned down a request to appear on the final show of this season - there will be plenty of Mr. Murphy's routines on the show's late-night reruns. His second comedy album, ''Eddie Murphy: Comedian,'' won the 1984 Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album of the Year, has sold more than a million copies (an exceptional success for a comedy album), and continues to sell briskly. His recent HBO cable-television special is also selling, as a home video. ''I'm 23, and I don't take drugs, or drink, or even smoke,'' Mr. Murphy said. ''I feel like I have a long career in front of me. I'm a comic actor first and foremost, but who knows? Maybe one day I'll do some serious acting. Maybe I'll make hit records as a singer. I have the luxury of being able to experiment.''

1309-> Meadowlands Exacta Brings an Inquiry;
Authorities today began investigating the eighth race Thursday night at the Meadowlands race track after a 30-to-1 shot and a 20-to-1 shot finished first and second but returned a relatively modest $2 exacta payoff of $255.40. Afterward, about 100 fans, apparently anticipating a higher payoff, jeered drivers, pulled down a 12-foot section of chain-link fence, set one trash bin afire and tipped over others, and threw beer and programs onto the track, according to the state police. There were no arrests and no injuries. ''We're investigating thoroughly all aspects of the running of the race and the betting on the race,'' said Det. Sgt. Louis Parisi, supervisor of the State Police Integrity Unit at the track. An analysis of the computer print- out of all exacta betting on the race was started this morning, according to Bruce Garland, deputy director of the New Jersey Racing Commission. He said officials were looking for any big bets or other unusual betting activity. Films of the race will be reviewed and drivers of the nine pacers in it will be interviewed, Mr. Garland said. ''But that's not to say that anyone is suspected of anything,'' he said. The winner of the race, Wonderfella, who paid $63.60 on a $2 win bet, and the second-place horse, Alert Killean, who returned $22.80 for a $2 place bet, were the two longest shots in the field. The 2-to-1 favorite, Kawartha Pompay, ran sixth, and the second betting choice, Macho Hill, at 5-to-2, finished last after a wheel on his sulky broke. Exacta wagering requires the selection of the first two finishers in order. Mr. Garland said that although bettors might have considered the exacta payoff small, it was mathematically correct. The parimutuel pool for exacta wagering is separate from the win, place and show pools. The odds that are displayed on the toteboard reflect the win pool only. Mr. Garland said the eighth race's exacta pool was $102,976. Of that, $653 was bet on the winning 3-6 combination. ''We're not looking at whether the payoff is wrong. It's not,'' Mr. Garland said. ''We're looking into the betting patterns.''

1312-> NEW YORK; DODGING AT THE GREEN
A few days ago, I was riding up Third Avenue in a taxi. The light turned red and the taxi stopped. But a car alongside drove blithely through the signal. The car was wearing a large sign. It read: ''Student Driver.'' Whaddaya know, I thought to myself, they're teaching it now. Red- light running, in short, has become so natural a part of New York City life, so ''normal'' here, that driving instructors are apparently making it a mandatory part of their course. It has got to the point where if you stop for a light, some bozo behind you will start leaning on his horn in indignation because you obeyed the law. There was a time when you could blame fiscally reduced law enforcement for the growth of this unhealthy syndrome. But now the Police Department is getting back some of its old manpower and has been issuing summonses in record numbers. Yet this ticket blitz, regrettably, does not seem to have yet altered the behavioral pattern that says there's nothing wrong with flouting the traffic laws - and other laws - in this town. Drivers are still sailing through lights by the dozens, people still litter as if it's a civic requirement, subway smoking is still practiced with relative impunity. It takes years, sometimes generations, for community traditions to take hold. It may be that it takes just as long to get them back once you've let them slide, as this community did over the last couple of decades. So we should applaud the police efforts and Mayor Koch's commitment - and urge them on to do more. Deputy Inspector Thomas Ryan, who heads the Police Department's traffic division, points to the declining number of pedestrian fatalities as a possible sign that progress is being made. But pedestrian injuries haven't dropped; they're very high - roughly 15,000 a year. In the end, it is far more than a police or mayoral problem. It is, rather, a community decision - about whether we wish to live in an atmosphere of anarchy or instead in a condition of civilized respect for the social contract. You can't send people scattering at crosswalks and then expect them to honor your space and your rights. People often shrug helplessly in these situations and question whether they personally can do anything about it. Well, a group of worried citizens formed an organization two years ago - it is called STOP, for Stop Traffic Offenses Program - and they are doing something effective. They have raised the consciousness of city officials to get stricter enforcement, persuaded businesses to contribute money and services to the publicity campaign and lobbied successfully in Albany for a toughening of the traffic laws and fines. But it's a hard process - reclaiming the streets from lawlessness - so if any reader wishes to help this group, STOP's address is 777 Third Avenue, N.Y., N.Y. 10017. The telephone number is 935-0990. STOP has received major help from Mobil, the Chase bank and the Winston billboard company, which for a time earlier this year donated the space on some of its boards for the STOP message - ''Give NY a brake! Running red lights must stop.'' Now, with its private donations, the group will purchase prime space for its billboards at entrances to the city. In addition, 13,000 billboards have been placed in buses and subway cars. STOP is also pushing for traffic- safety classes in the schools. In Albany, the group helped push through the Knorr-Lafayette bill, now in effect, which raised the fine for running a red light from $35 to $50 and made it $100 for a second offense and $250 for a third. STOP is pressing for still higher fines - pointing out that the dog-litter law carries the same $50 minimum - and for laws that would suspend the license of a repeat offender. Bus drivers - who, one acknowledges, have difficult jobs - remain major offenders. Over the years, the police, perhaps out of kinship for fellow city employees, looked the other way at this recklessness. Recently, as a result of prodding from STOP and others, they are issuing a few tickets. They should issue a lot more - particularly to the drivers of the private express buses (who are not city employees). ''The private bus companies are the worst,'' says Irene Krone, president of STOP. ''They think this city is their superhighway.'' These are crimes, like any other. They may seem minor in a city where muggings and burglaries cast a darker shadow, but when communities begin to ignore ''minor'' crimes, they take a major step toward disorder and nihilism. B

1313-> MEESE FRIEND IN U.S. POST FACING GRAND JURY
The chairman of the Merit System Protection Board, a friend of Edwin Meese 3d since law school, will be questioned next week by a Federal grand jury, a board spokesman, Mahlon Anderson, said today. The board's function is to protect the integrity of the system of advancement on the basis of merit and the rights of Federal employees. Its chairman, Herbert Ellingwood, was asked to appear Tuesday before the grand jury after he was questioned Wednesday by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and a deputy to Jacob A. Stein, the independent counsel looking into Mr. Meese's affairs. Two Government employees on the board, Richard D. Redenius, its managing director, and Jacqueline Bradley, its assistant managing director for regional operations, were questioned and asked to appear before the jury, Mr. Anderson said. Mr. Stein was appointed April 2 to investigate Mr. Meese, President Reagan's counselor, whom Mr. Reagan has nominated for Attorney General. Meese Lawyers Comment ''No negative implication is to be drawn from the fact that witnesses are being called to testify before a grand jury,'' Mr. Meese's lawyers, Leonard Garment and E. Robert Wallach, said in a statement. ''This is exactly the course of action we would expect from a diligent independent counsel.'' The witnesses apparently will be questioned about how Gretchen Thomas got a job in the merit board's San Francisco office after her husband, Edwin, was named regional director of the San Francisco office of the General Service Administration, the Government's supplying and warehousing agency. The Thomases are friends of Mr. Meese. Mr. Meese's failure to disclose an interest-free loan of $15,000 from Mr. Thomas on financial disclosure forms was one of the matters Mr. Stein was told to investigate when he was appointed, Mr. Stein is seeking to determine whether any criminal violations occurred in the awarding of Government posts to seven of Mr. Meese's financial benefactors, including Mr. Thomas, whose son, Tad, was given a job in the Labor Department.

1315-> AFGHANS GET SLICE OF THE FAST-FOOD BUSINESS
The Afghans in New York may soon be to fast food what Koreans are to produce. Immigrants from Afghanistan seem to have opened fried-chicken restaurants in every corner of the city. Some 10,000 to 15,000 refugees have arrived here since Soviet troops marched into their country in December 1979, and there are already about 110 Afghan fast food shops in the New York area. They bear such popular all-American names as Boston Fried Chicken, Harlem Fried Chicken and Texas Fried Chicken. Afghans have also opened restaurants in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C., and most recently California, for a total of about 200 chicken places in the country. Although many of the latest Afghan arrivals have entered the fried- chicken business, the man who started it all and some of the major chicken entrepeneurs from Afghanistan arrived before the Soviet invasion. Taeb Zia, who is known in Afghan circles as the father of Kennedy Fried Chicken, studied engineering in Baku in the Soviet Union. ''But I hated Russia and didn't like the factory work,'' he recalled the other day. He came to the United States in 1972 and got a job with Kansas Fried Chicken through an employment agency. Three years later he had earned enough to buy the franchise. ''Then I saw I could do chicken just as well and 15 to 20 percent cheaper with my own recipe and spices,'' Mr. Zia said. Today he runs six Kennedy Fried Chicken Shops in Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn, employing mainly Afghan refugees and providing technical assistance to many other aspiring Afghan entrepeneurs. His chain is named after the American President ''just because Afghans like him a lot.'' The Afghan incursion into chicken is a direct result of Mr. Zia's involvement. In a kind of pyramid effect, he hired Afghan refugees who worked in his shops and then went on to open their own. Although many Afghans arrived in the United States with language problems and little experience, they learned from him. ''We don't know what to do, and then we see Zia and learn how an Afghan can do business here,'' said Abdul Mosaver, who owns two successful New York Fried Chicken stores in Queens and one in Brooklyn, employing a total of 50 people, mostly Afghans.'' Like other Afghans, Mr. Mosaver says his fried chicken is special because of the spices, mainly red pepper and fresh garlic. But competing with ''the giants,'' such as Kentucky Fried Chicken, is not easy, according to Qedeer Nazary, who has the franchise for Texas Fried Chicken at 42d Street and 7th Avenue. Mr. Nazary, a former assistant controller with Afghan Airlines, came here in 1978 with his family when it was clear the Communists would take over. He tired his hand at an assortment of jobs before he followed the example of Mr. Zia and the other Afghan fast-food entrepreneurs and went into chicken. Many of the supplies for the Afghan fast-food industry are sold by Habibullah Mayar, who runs an air-freight trucking business out of a warehouse in Jamaica, Queens. He is also the chairman of an organization called the Afghan Community in America. ''I had everything, but I realized something would happen because the leftist movement was gaining ground,'' said Mr. Mayar, who came to the United States with his wife and year-old son in 1971. Under a sign proclaiming ''Free Afghanistan,'' members of the Afghan organization help refugees with legal documents and collect medicine and clothing for the three million Afghan refugees in camps in Pakistan. The Afghan Community in America also takes part in anti-Soviet demonstrations and rallies. Despite the deep concerns of the Afghans in New York about their homeland, they are also very much a part of their new country. ''This is the only place where I could settle and raise a family, because there's freedom,'' said Mr. Nazary, who lives in Rego Park, Queens, with his two sons, a daughter-in-law and two grandsons.

1316-> CHINA ADDS COMPASSION TO ITS BIRTH CONTROL DRIVE
When China began one of its periodic family planning drives early last year, the family planning officials of Shunyi County responded with a vengeance. Middle- aged women using intrauterine devices were told to undergo sterilization. Other women were taken off oral contraceptives and fitted with IUD's. The IUD's were issued without much concern about sizing, so some women who switched became pregnant. Last year, according to medical workers, 7,629 women, or nearly 1 in 10 married women of childbearing age in Shunyi County, had abortions. The county, northeast of Peking, recorded 84 abortions for every 100 live births in 1983. China has found that a stringent birth control policy is the only way that it can limit its population, now over one billion, and provide rising living standards. Last year China's population grew by 1.154 percent, which was well below the 1.73 percent growth rate reported for all of Asia last year. One Child Per Couple The Chinese Government permits each couple a single child, though exceptions are made in some rural areas if the firstborn is a daughter, on the logic that a farmer needs a son to help work the land. Husband and wife have a duty to practice family planning under Article 49 of the 1982 Constitution. An unauthorized pregnancy usually means an abortion. If an extra child is born, the wife may be instructed to undergo sterilization. The preoccupation with holding China's population to 1.2 billion by the year 2000 has left many officials with little sensitivity for the feelings of the women involved. ''The family planning people are pushing so fast to achieve their targets that they ignore what the women's health problems are,'' said Dr. Barbara Pillsbury, an American medical anthropologist, who is a director of the International Women's Health Coalition in Washington. ''They don't pay much attention to the side effects of the IUD and the pill, or the psychological effects, or the effects of anemia during pregnancy.'' The Peking Medical College is concerned about making birth control more compassionate, said Dr. Pillsbury, who spent 10 days as a guest of the college. She said the college wanted to set up a project in Shunyi County to better acquaint family planning officials, who are mostly men, with the needs of women, including personal counseling, a wider choice of contraceptives and greater attention to potential side effects. Dr. Pillsbury said Shunyi County, with a population of 477,000, was picked by the Peking Medical College for a pilot project because its birth rate was 1.9 percent last year. That was only slightly higher than China's 1983 birth rate of 1.86 percent. Natural growth is reached by subtracting the mortality rate - slightly over seven-tenths of 1 percent - from the birth rate. Wang Shaoxian, a Peking Medical College faculty member who studied in the United States, has proposed inviting American experts of ethnic Chinese descent from Johns Hopkins University and the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta to train 15 junior staff members at the Peking Medical College, Dr. Pillsbury said. The United States experts would in turn fan out into Shunyi County to educate local planning cadres, as officials are called in China. Dr. Pillsbury said she was told the program would cost about $233,000 over a three-year period. ''This is the first attempt to do this sort of thing,'' Dr. Pillsbury said. ''They regard it as a pilot project. If it succeeds, they can hold it up as a model to the rest of China, and the family planning program would be influenced by what they have accomplished.'' The State Family Planning Commission, which operates separately from the Ministry of Public Health, has set up a training course for family planning officials in Nanjing. The commission, which supervises the educational and administrative aspects of birth control, is preparing to offer its technical services, including contraceptives and abortions, putting it in competition with local clinics that operate under the Ministry of Public Health. The project in Shunyi County would focus on improving the quality rather than quantity of birth control. ''They want to make it more humane, to reduce the rate of abortion,'' Dr. Pillsbury said. The Chinese Government has not released statistics on the number of abortions, which reflect the ineffectiveness of birth control measures. But a study of what Dr. Pillsbury called ''a very large'' sample of eligible married women in the western district of Peking in 1982 and 1983 showed that 44.7 percent of such women had at least one induced abortion. In 1982 the district had 74 abortions per 100 live births. That meant that over 40 percent of all pregnancies were terminated by abortion, Dr. Pillsbury said. She said the situation was not considered unusual for China. A major weakness of China's family planning is the ignorance or disinterest of some local officials entrusted with carrying it out, according to Dr. Pillsbury. Many local officials have been reassigned from other jobs, notably the agricultural communes that are now being dismantled, because there is no other work for them. Dr. Pillsbury, who speaks Chinese, said she found them concerned about the statistical results of birth control. ''Family planning cadres don't have a high level of education,'' she said, ''and they don't have knowledge of women's or children's health.'' Another Western health specialist agreed that ''it's getting done by administrative cadres who have no understanding of family planning in its ethical issues.'' Reports of Pressure There have been reports of women being cajoled into signing a single child pledge while they are still groggy from delivering their first child. Intrauterine devices, like the steel ring, a commonly used IUD in China, are reportedly forced on women who cannot tolerate them and experience side effects like nausea and bleeding. Last September Qian Xinzhong, head of the State Family Planning Commission, denied Western news reports that women in China were being coerced into compliance. His commission said women were subjected only to persuasion and education. In practice this may include exhausting ''study sessions'' under the badgering of officials and neighbors until a woman agrees to have her pregnancy terminated or be sterilized. Last June Mr. Qian told the National People's Congress, China's nominal legislature, that of 110 million Chinese women using contraceptives, half had been fitted with contraceptive coils and one-third were sterilized.

1317-> CABLE TV NOTES; THIS 'SATYAGRAHA' IS DISTINGUISHED BY ITS GERMAN DESIGNER
Opera, music and theater lovers with access to the venturesome Bravo arts channel (available in the New York area in most suburbs though not in Manhattan) will have a rare opportunity to encounter something really unusual tomorrow night at 10 (and again on Aug. 25 and Sept. 22 at 5 P.M.). At those times, Bravo will telecast the 1981 Stuttgart Opera production of Philip Glass's opera ''Satyagraha.'' The opera itself will be of interest to admirers of Mr. Glass, whose ''Akhnaten'' will be given its American premiere this fall by the Houston Grand Opera and then, in November, by the New York City Opera - with ''Satyagraha'' scheduled to join it in the City Opera repertory in 1986. A series of tableaus on the life of the young Gandhi in Africa, as he struggled to transform inner religious enlightenment into outer political freedom, ''Satyagraha'' is a prime example of Mr. Glass's much-discussed operatic Minimalism. But the Bravo presentation will be of equal interest in acquainting American viewers with the work of the stage designer and director Achim Freyer, whom one German magazine recently called ''perhaps the most creative theater personage of today.'' Mr. Freyer was a student of Bertolt Brecht's, and that influence can still be seen in his work. But he now epitomizes a lavishly pictorial, mystically all-embracing style that seems almost a direct contradiction of his former master's blunt directness. Mr. Freyer's work has proven enormously influential in ways that have been hardly yet perceived on the mostly conservative, budget-bound theater and opera stages of the United States. The ''Satyagraha'' production Bravo viewers will watch is full of Mr. Freyer's characteristic touches. His stage visions glow with color and light and are enlivened by a restless sea of humanity, some of it grotesque and bizarre (there are masks and actual dwarfs) in the German tradition of George Grosz and G"unter Grass. Mr. Freyer makes free use of Oriental iconography (fitting for an opera suffused with Hinduism), kitsch and such modern visual talismans as neon and searchlights. It is all, even on television, quite dazzling. There are those - Mr. Freyer among them - who doubt the ability of any telecast, with its lighting limitations and small screen, to capture the immediacy of a stage production as complex and precisely colored as this. In an interview a few months ago in Wuppertal, West Germany, where he was overseeing the recreation of this ''Satyagraha'' production for that city's opera house, Mr. Freyer specifically discounted the value of television in transmitting a true picture of his intentions. But despite his reservations, many of the spectacular qualities of his work come through amply on television. And, for American viewers, this telecast - along with Bravo's previous screenings of Mr. Freyer's Stuttgart production of Weber's ''Freisch"utz'' - is likely to be the only opportunity short of a trip to Germany to see his work. He remains almost unknown in this country, and his demands in terms of time and the sheer physical complexity of his productions make it unlikely that he will be able to work here anytime soon. Beverly Sills of the City Opera, for one, says she was ''thrilled'' by his ''Akhnaten'' at that opera's world premiere last spring in Stuttgart. But a study of the requirements of his ''Satyagraha'' has apparently dissuaded her from attempting to recreate it at the New York State Theater. For example: in the first scene of the opera, after a preliminary rapturous trio between Gandhi, the mythical Prince Arjuna and the Lord Krishna, two choruses representing the white and Indian communities of Africa make their entrance. In the Dutch production seen a few years ago at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the choral singers simply walked on from both sides of the stage. In Mr. Freyer's version they enter, some 80 strong, individually strapped in soaring, angelic positions to two gigantic, solidly constructed flats, painted to represent heaven, which roll in on carts. The effect is of some gigantic Hindu religious fresco, awesome and enrapturing; the mechanical and physical forces required to achieve this effect would tax the mightiest of theaters. What is it that makes Mr. Freyer's work so extraordinary? The answer will be found most immediately in one's sheer gut response to his work. Miss Sills was not alone in her reaction. Nearly all the American critics in Stuttgart found themselves shaking their heads in amazement; this ''Akhnaten'' was a scenic realization that for constant bedazzlement and painterly beauty surpassed anything in their experience. That commanding power doesn't please everyone. There are those who find Mr. Freyer's work over-busy and intellectually cluttered in a typically Germanic way. Mr. Glass is a Minimalist, which means among other things that he adheres to a ''non- narrative'' dramatic form that is far less rich in busy incident than the typical neo-naturalistic opera plot. In fact, while Mr. Freyer was drawn to Mr. Glass because he loved his music, he finds himself both compelled and confused by this lack of plot detail and rounded characterization. ''When one does Mozart, there are real characters to work with,'' he observed in Wuppertal. ''With Glass, there are no characters, no progression in the action, no dramatic development.'' In response, Mr. Freyer fills in the gaps with business of his own - so much so that he credits himself with the ''scenario'' in the Stuttgart programs for both Glass operas. To this taste, nearly all of his inventions are interesting and appropriate, not to speak of being fantastically beautiful. But for some of Mr. Glass's champions (and for Mr. Glass himself, it sometimes seems, although he remains guardedly ambivalent on that point), Mr. Freyer's work looks more like overinterpretation than interpretation. Yet, once one accepts the German penchant for intellectualization, Mr. Freyer's work emerges as a rare combination of critical thinking, dramatic instinct and visual imagination. No matter how bizarre some of his intepretations of the standard repertory may seem at first (e.g., putting the title figure of Gluck's ''Iphigenie en Tauride'' on platform shoes throughout, making her tower, 10 feet tall, over everyone else), he insists that he bases every production on the libretto and the music. And that's ultimately just the way it looks. ''My work is a tension between the past and the present,'' he said in Wuppertal. ''I only make what is in the score. I am not free.'' Elsewhere, he has spoken of his staging conceptions as ''parallel composition,'' rejecting ''stage pictures foreign to the work itself.'' ''If you take any element away from my productions, you destroy the whole,'' he added. ''Everything has its own irrational necessity.'' If Mr. Freyer's importance can be first perceived through one's intuitive, immediate reaction, it can also be explained historically, by an examination of his place within the revolution of German stage direction and design since World War II, and of his own paradoxical relationship to Brecht. Mr. Freyer was born in Berlin in 1934, and when that city was divided between East and West, he found himself an East German. That suited his left-leaning ideological instincts, however. East Berlin in the late 1950's and 60's was an avant-garde theatrical and operatic showcase, deliberately fostered by the Communist government. Most of the stars came from the West, actually lived there or had ideas about Communism that differed from the Soviet-controlled Party line. Still, it was a time of Brecht and Walter Felsentein, Benno Besson and Ruth Berghaus, and Mr. Freyer profited from them all. From Brecht, with whom he actually studied, Mr. Freyer drew a penchant for dramatic intensity and an underlying social concern. But it was from the fantastical Mr. Besson, a brilliant Swiss theater director little known in the West, and from Miss Berghaus, whose fascinating if sometimes willful opera productions are best known in the West at the Frankfurt Opera, that Mr. Freyer learned the most. While he was still in East Berlin, he was only a designer. It was after his emigration to West Germany in 1971 (his wife Ilona, who is also a designer, and his twin daughters came with him) that he expanded into stage direction, as well. As a designer in the West, he worked often with the opera director Hans Neugebauer and the vanguard theater director Claus Peymann. Most of his early work as a director-designer was in the theater, which is traditionally more radical in Germany than opera. But now he concentrates on opera - no doubt because of his love for music and for the fantasy opera offers but also, he says, ''because I like knowing now what I'll be doing in 1988.'' Theater and opera is his public side and, many believe, his most complete realization as an artist. But privately, he paints, and by now he is also recognized as one of Germany's most important painters, with exhibitions that travel around th country and respectful consideration by art critics. Robert Wilson, who on one level represents a kind of Minimalist American equivalent of Mr. Freyer, was also a painter, and that is no coincidence. What makes Mr. Freyer's work so influential is that he epitomizes a tendency dominant in stage design and direction today, one that is indicated by the increasing number of stage directors who, like him, started their careers as designers. That tendency is the concentration on sumptuously beautiful stage pictures, a trend observable throughout Europe and, to some extent, in the American avant garde. In lesser hands, these pictures simply take over the collaborative process, in defiance of the composer, his librettist and the musical needs of the singers and conductor. But with a musically sensitive artist like Mr. Freyer, they enhance the whole in quite wonderful ways: The eye is beguiled, the mind is enriched and the music is allowed to ring forth freely. This is an evolution that in the world of opera can be traced back to Wieland Wagner, the elder grandson of the composer. Before his untimely death of cancer in 1966, Mr. Wagner had transformed the German stage. He is best known for his cool, Minimal, gorgeously lit stage pictures. But shortly before his death, he was moving into a new phase, in which he decorated his formerly bare stage with gigantic, strange, often psychologically inspired props; Carl Jung was Mr. Wagner's new hero. But this development, seen most fully in his last Bayreuth ''Ring'' of 1965, remained relatively little known outside Germany. It is this tradition that Mr. Freyer - without consciously realizing it, it seems - is developing today. His stage pictures are full of disorienting, dreamlike icons, welling up from the subconscious. His work lies close to the dark heart of German Romanticism and might thus seem far removed from Brecht's determined prosaicness and crusty distrust of rhetoric of any sort. Indeed, with his fascination for Mr. Glass's work and his forthcoming staging of Handel's ''Messiah'' for West Berlin's German Opera in February 1985, Mr. Freyer might appear to have become an outright religious mystic. But this he denies. Instead, he chooses to see ''Satyagraha,'' the production to be telecast tomorrow, as an opera about overt political struggle, and underscores the point by bringing in police in full, fierce regalia, with motorcyles and police dogs, at one climactic moment. Yet, he also seems to be working in his own mind toward a connection between psychology and mysticism - and to be building his own bridge between Brecht and his current work. ''In East Germany today, everyone is a Brecht student, but without individuality,'' he said in Wuppertal. ''Socialist thinking was very underdeveloped in psychology. What I'm interested in now is the inner mission of man - inner models for mankind that are just as political as external political events.''

1318-> House Panel Trade Accord
A House trade subcommittee agreed today to a 10-year renewal of preferential trade treatment allowing 3,000 products from 140 developing countries to enter the United States duty free. The subcommittee's agreement on a means of removing the most advanced developing countries from the duty-free list eliminated a major hurdle for the Administration-backed extension. House members had argued that the program allowed duty-free imports from newly industrialized countries no longer needing the trade assistance.

1320-> NO MERGER SEEN IN PRO FOOTBALL
United States Football League team owners are misguided if they believe that, by shifting to a fall schedule, they would force a merger or prod the National Football League into accepting them, Commissioner Pete Rozelle of the N.F.L. said yesterday. Rather than being threatened by the U.S.F.L. change from a spring schedule, N.F.L. owners welcome the shift, Rozelle said. He was reacting to the decision Wednesday by the U.S.F.L. at its owners' meeting in Chicago to go head to head with the N.F.L., starting in the fall of 1986. Rozelle said he had heard for some time that some owners in the new league were interested in playing in the fall to push for a merger, or acceptance by the N.F.L. ''I just can't see it happening,'' he said. ''There's just no sentiment for it. When we expand, we'd want to pick our own cities and our own owners. There are many, many reasons why it would not be feasible. One of them would be antitrust problems. We had to get a bill through Congress to merge with the A.F.L. And would the Players Association want a merger?'' Disagrees With Trump Addressing himself to remarks by the Generals' owner, Donald Trump, who said the move to the fall would hurt the N.F.L. because ''salaries would go up and ratings would go down,'' Rozelle said, ''Donald has an erroneous view if he thinks this shakes up the N.F.L.'' A significant reason why the U.S.F.L. decided to change its schedule is the bigger television audience in the fall than in the spring - about 15 percent more people watch television on Sundays later in the year. This would be translated into more revenue. ''In competing for television dollars, there's more available for fall - but also for the colleges,'' Rozelle said. ''And there will be advertising revenue put in college television now because of the recent rulings.'' Rozelle said that ''eight or 10 owners'' to whom he had spoken said that they were happy about the U.S.F.L.'s shift. Confidence in Product ''Everyone I spoke to said they're in favor of going to the fall because it stops spreading football out,'' Rozelle said. He also pointed out a more significant aspect of the situation, one which suggests that the N.F.L. owners simply believe their product will dwarf the U.S.F.L.'s: ''On a Sunday, we will put three N.F.L. games into every city in the country,'' he said, except for the 13 cities where the N.F.L. games will be played, where there would be at least two. He suggested that fans would rather watch an N.F.L. game than attend a U.S.F.L. game. Moves Are Likely Meanwhile, the U.S.F.L. was undergoing major changes as a result of the shift. The franchises in New Jersey, Chicago, Philadelphia, Denver, Houston, Tampa, Pittsburgh and New Orleans may be forced to change stadiums, if not cities, because of schedule conflicts. It appears that the Generals may be on their way to Shea Stadium, since they would be unable to find fall playing dates in Giants Stadium because the Jets and Giants are there. Fred Wilpon, an owner of the Mets, said he had had no conversations with city officials about sharing Shea Stadium with a U.S.F.L. team. ''We're not closed to it,'' said Wilpon. ''We have told the city we'll cooperate in any way we can.'' Trying to Keep Stars The person in charge of bringing another team to play in Shea Stadium, Consumers Affairs Commissioner Angelo J. Aponte, was not available for comment. In Philadelphia, Mayor W. Wilson Goode said yesterday he would meet with Myles Tanenbaum, the Stars' owner, tomorrow to attempt to keep the league championship team in that city. Tanenbaum said the Stars could not play there in the fall because Veterans Stadium would be unavailable and another site, Franklin Field, had too many drawbacks. He suggested the team would move to Baltimore after playing in Philadelphia next spring. The U.S.F.L. went ahead yesterday with its plans to consolidate from 18 to 14 teams. The Oklahoma Outlaws were merged with the Oakland Invaders, and that franchise will be based in Oakland. Blitz May Not Exist But there was no further word on the unsettled Miami-Washington situation. The Washington Federals' club was purchased last June by a Miami investor, and Howard Schnellenberger left the University of Miami to become the head coach. However, league sources said the sale and Schnellenberger's contract were contingent on springtime play. He has been the subject of speculation as a potential coach of the Giants. While some teams may have a lame-duck status, the Chicago Blitz may not even be in business next spring since their owner, Eddie Einhorn, is considering taking them out for a year, putting them in another city, and then returning to Chicago. He said Chicago fans will not support springtime football, and he also did not want the football team, which he purchased late last season, competing with the White Sox franchise, which he also owns. Although the U.S.F.L.'s contract with ABC-TV, which was recently renewed for next season, calls for teams in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, Einhorn said that that was negotiable.

1321-> SPORTS PEOPLE; CLOUD OVER WEBSTER
There was no still no word yesterday on how long the Knicks would be without Marvin Webster , their backup center, who is suffering from hepatitis and acute anemia. Webster underwent further tests at Lenox Hill Hospital and was asked to return again Oct. 22. His absence has been of particular concern to the Knicks because Bill Cartwright , the regular center, is still recovering from a stress fracture of his left foot. Cartwright is scheduled for X-rays Tuesday to determine how well the foot is healing and when the Knicks can expect him back. . . . Gerald Henderson , the guard who has earned two championship rings in five years with the Celtics, has signed a multiyear contract with Boston. No details were announced, but according to reports Henderson, who became a free agent after helping the Celtics to a 15th title last June, signed for four years at about $325,000 a season.

1322-> FORGOTTEN PROMISE TO THE UPPER DELAWARE
To the Editor: There is a 75-mile stretch of the Delaware River, known as the Upper Delaware, that is widely acclaimed as a scenic delight. The Delaware begins its 375-mile journey to the sea from upstate New York in the water supply reservoirs of the City of New York. The river meanders, tumbles and flows between the states of New York and Pennsylvania from the vicinity of Hancock to Port Jervis and beyond to Delaware Bay. For generations it has provided profitable rafting, exhilarating canoeing and the most rewarding fishing. To preserve the natural majesty of the Upper Delaware, President Carter signed legislation in 1978 which included the Upper Delaware as part of the nation's wild and scenic river heritage. This law did not create another national park; rather it called upon various levels of government, under the general stewardship of the U.S. Department of Interior, to create a management plan, which, within three years (by 1981) might prescribe a means to safeguard the river's natural environment without uprooting those people who live and make a living along its banks. There has been - sorry to report - a great deal of bureaucratic dawdling and delay by the various ''cooperating'' levels of government. The passage of six years has sown popular dissatisfaction and confusion, promoted savage, localized rabble-rousing and produced rumblings for de-authorization and repeal of the legislation. Grievously disappointed residents, farmers, merchants and recreationists are concerned and, indeed, rebellious, over the failures of governments at every level to implement the legislation. Three successive Interior Secretaries have neither heard the clarion call of the legislation nor the voices of the people of the Upper Delaware Valley. Preoccupation with other matters has apparently doomed what all acknowledge was to be a unique national experiment. The fact is that we are adrift on the river without a paddle. There are no firm hands ready at the tiller. What a pity! HERBERT J. FABRICANT Goshen, N.Y., April 19, 1984 The writer is former chairman of the Upper Delaware Citizens Advisory Council.

1323-> 4 Wounded, Including Child, In Brooklyn Store Shooting
Four people, including a 12-year-old girl, were wounded last night when two men entered a grocery store in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn and opened fire with handguns, the police said. The reason for the shootings was not clear. The gunmen entered the store, at 323 Powell Street, shortly after 6 P.M. and shot two employees in the chest. The girl was hit in the leg and another customer was grazed slightly. The gunmen then fled. Both store employees were taken to Kings County Hospital where they were undergoing surgery. They were described as being in serious condition. The girl was admitted to Brookdale Hospital in good condition. None of the injured were identified.

1324-> AROUND THE NATION; Upjohn Heir in Sex Case Is Sentenced Anew
Roger A. Gauntlett, an Upjohn Company heir originally sentenced to ''chemical castration'' and five years probation for raping his teen-age stepdaughter, was resentenced today to 5 to 15 years. The action came after a public outcry that the first penalty had been too lenient. Visiting Circuit Judge Jack W. Warren of Ingham County gave Mr. Gauntlett 237 days' credit for time served. Mr. Gauntlett pleaded no contest in July 1983 to criminal sexual assault. On Jan. 30, Kalamazoo County Circuit Judge George Borsos sentenced Mr. Gauntlett, the great-grandson of W. E. Upjohn, to five years' probation, the first year to be served in jail. Judge Borsos ordered treatment with Depo- Provera, a drug produced by Upjohn and used experimentally to reduce the male sex drive. He termed the treatment ''castration by chemical means.'' In State Supreme Court Aug. 24, a Court of Appeals ruling that threw out the Depo-Provera portion of the sentence was upheld.

1327-> STEIN AND GREEN ARGUE FINANCES IN 2D DEBATE
Representative Bill Green and Borough President Andrew J. Stein of Manhattan sharply questioned each other's finances yesterday in the second debate of their contest in the 15th Congressional District on the East Side. Mr. Stein, a Democrat, demanded during the radio debate on WMCA that Mr. Green, a Republican, release his income-tax returns, a demand he also makes in his latest radio commercials. ''What's he hiding?'' Mr. Stein said in an interview in a hallway after the debate. ''What percentage did he pay? Maybe he didn't pay anything.'' Mr. Green, who several times referred to ''Stein sleaze,'' pulled from his briefcase a copy of a 1978 State Labor Department document, called a warrant, asking Mr. Stein for $4,430.80 in back unemployment-insurance taxes. 'Accountant's Mistake' ''You tried to stiff the state,'' Mr. Green said on the air as they sat a few feet apart at a table. Mr. Stein professed ignorance of the warrant, but said later that it referred to unpaid taxes for Primary Day and Election Day poll watchers in 1977. He called it ''an accountant's mistake'' and said the money, including interest, was paid to the state in 1978. Mr. Green, who is seeking his fourth full term in the House, told Mr. Stein, and reporters after the debate, that he would not disclose his tax returns. Such disclosures have become common in political campaigns. Mr. Green said he had filled out House financial reports that showed all his assets and liabilities and those of his wife and children. The forms deal in general categories rather than with specifics. Mr. Green said he was balancing his ''right to privacy and the public's right to know.'' Mr. Green also refused to say what percentage of his income he pays in taxes. Connection to Bankruptcy Mr. Stein, who has released his tax forms, said he had paid 15 percent of his 1983 income in Federal, state and local taxes. He said that the tax-return disclosure was important because of the Green family's involvement in a multimillion-dollar bankruptcy. Mr. Green responded that he was a creditor in the bankruptcy of a company controlled by an ''estranged brother-in-law.'' The candidates also argued about Mr. Green's charges that Mr. Stein had a poor attendance record while in the State Assembly. Mr. Stein said he had not missed any important votes when his vote was crucial. Mr. Green replied that a vote on the death penalty in 1976 had ended in a tie. ''You were not there,'' Mr. Green said. ''How can you say you didn't miss important votes?'' 'Bring Up Another Issue' Mr. Stein paused, then said, ''I'd like to bring up another issue.'' This led to the discussion of Mr. Green's tax returns. Mr. Green said he had ''a proven track record in getting things done for New York City,'' and that Mr. Stein was a ''no show'' Assemblyman. Mr. Stein said that Mr. Green had supported Reagan Administration budget cuts that had cost the city $1.5 billion over the last three years. He said that as Borough President and as an Assmblyman representing a district on the East Side, he had spearheaded an investigation of nursing homes and had been active in behalf of the elderly and tenants.

1328-> FINDINGS ON MEESE SUBMITTED TO JUDGES BY SPECIAL COUNSEL
Jacob A. Stein, the independent counsel who has been investigating allegations of wrongdoing on the part of Edwin Meese 3d, the Presidential counsel, submitted his final report Wednesday to the three- judge panel that appointed him to conduct the inquiry. According to sources familiar with the inquiry, the report will not be made public until after the judges examine it, which will take a few days. The report, hundreds of pages long, is widely expected to say that no grounds exist to prosecute Mr. Meese for any violation of law. Mr. Stein has declined to comment on those expectations. Mr. Stein, who was appointed last April, investigated several charges that Mr. Meese had engaged in criminal conduct in his personal financial affairs. The charges were made in Senate confirmation hearings on Mr. Meese's nomination as Attorney General. The Senate Judiciary Committee suspended its confirmation proceedings pending the inquiry. Attorney General William French Smith asked the three-judge panel to appoint an independent counsel to handle the matter after it was disclosed that Mr. Meese had failed to report an interest-free $15,000 loan from a friend who received a Federal job. Last week the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Strom Thurmond, Republican of South Carolina, removed Mr. Meese's nomination from the committee agenda for the rest of this year. An aide said the Senator felt it would be ''politicized,'' if handled this year. President Reagan said he would resubmit the nomination if he was elected to a second term.

1330-> MEI Receives Merger Offer MINNEAPOLIS, May 10
(Reuters) - The MEI Corporation said it had been approached by Carl Marks & Company, a New York investment banking firm, about the possible merger of MEI with a company to be formed by Carl Marks in exchange for cash and securities. The company said the proposal includes payment of $43 to $45 a share. MEI, a soft- drink bottler and snack and health food distributor, has about 16.9 million shares outstanding. On the New York Stock Exchange today, MEI jumped $3.625, to $39.50. MEI said the securities involved could be represented by a spinoff of MEI's snack and health food segment, and it noted that MEI management would retain control and have substantial equity participation. MEI said its discussions with Carl Marks are in the preliminary stages and that the necessary financing for the proposed merger had not yet been obtained. Should a definitive proposal evolve, it must be considered by the board of directors and approved by shareholders, the company said.

1331-> ; MCI Long-Distance Fee Rise
The MCI Communications Corporation announced today that it would raise its long-distance calling rates by up to 5 percent next month. Washington-based MCI, the second- largest long-distance phone company in the nation, behind the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, said it was increasing its daytime calling rates by an average 1.75 percent and its evening, night and weekend rates by an average 5 percent. The changes will be reflected in an informational tariff to be filed Monday at the Federal Communications Commission and will become effective Oct. 15, according to an MCI spokesman, Gary Tobin. F.C.C. approval is not required for the new rates to go into effect. ''Companies raise prices because costs go up, and our costs have gone up in several areas,'' Mr. Tobin said. MCI has embarked on a major construction program with plans to spend $1 billion this year.

1332-> THE EVENING HOURS
NEW YORKERS jammed into parties as if they had been deprived for months and gawked at celebrities as if they had never seen one, when the fall social season - never mind the calendar - got under way this week. At the National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadow, where there was a benefit for the Arts With the Handicapped-Omega/ Itzhak Perlman Scholarship, the crowd stared at Senator Edward M. Kennedy; his children, Kara and Edward M. Jr.; his sister, Jean Kennedy Smith, and her daughter, Amanda; Neil Simon; Roberta Peters, and Itzhak Perlman. An award was given to Jody Trucks, a nationally ranked college tennis player whose foot was severed in an auto accident and reattached and who now teaches tennis professionally. Presenting the Omega Award, Edward Kennedy Jr., who lost a leg to cancer, said that he avoids the word ''handicapped.'' ''I prefer the word physically challenged,'' he said, adding that the evening provided him with a rare opportunity. ''It is not often I have a chance to speak and my father has to listen,'' he said. TENNIS didn't seem to be much on the minds of the several hundred people who jammed into Amsterdam's Bar and Rotisserie Wednesday to celebrate the wedding tomorrow of Ilie Nastase, the tennis star, and Alexandra King, who is giving up a modeling career. Overheard at the party, given by Ramlosa, the Swedish mineral-water producer, were such comments as: ''I'm doing a quick check on who I know''; ''I took a wonderful picture of you at Princess Caroline's,'' and ''I'm going out with Joan Jett later on this evening. She's mellow and so am I.'' The last remark was made by Rowdy Gaines, the Olympic gold-medal swimming champion. The guest list also included Donald Trump, Pilar Echavarria, Arthur Ashe and Vitas Gerulaitis. Miss King was asked how she would deal with her husband's famous temper tantrums. ''He's a seriously quiet person,'' she said. ''He's never raised a voice to me, or a racquet. I've never heard those words I'm told he uses on the court.'' As for Mr. Nastase, who was married once before, he said, ''It's my second set and this time I'm going to win.'' SEVERAL years ago, Regine lamented, no one in this country knew Julio Iglesias. ''When he was depressed, I said, 'You will be a big star.' '' Certainly he was earlier this week, at parties held to celebrate his sold-out - in two hours - engagement at Radio City Music Hall and his platinum record, ''1100 Bel Air Place.'' The crooner could barely make his way through the throngs of photographers screaming ''Julio, Julio,'' at the parties: one at Regine's, the other at Windows on the World. At Regine's, former Gov. Hugh L. Carey and his wife joined Alexander Godunov, Harry Reasoner, Hugh O'Brian, Cornelia Guest and others for dinner. Mr. Carey remarked, ''We can always use a good voice in New York.'' Then it was on to Windows on the World for the singer, where even larger crowds had assembled for the bash given by CBS Records. While guests, mainly on the young side of 30, waited, they contented themselves with identifying Audrey Landers, who plays Afton on ''Dallas.'' Miss Landers said she had won a major role in the movie version of ''A Chorus Line.'' They also admired David Keith, who in jeans and vest bore no resemblance to his military demeanor in ''An Officer and a Gentleman.'' ''I was told to wear whatever I wanted,'' he said gazing into a sea of black tie. ''Now it looks like we're making a statement.'' Asked whether he was luxuriating in the tumultuous attention, Mr. Iglesias responded enigmatically, ''I always try to stay healthy.'' BY contrast, the mood was subdued at Limelight, the church-turned- disco on the Avenue of the Americas, at a benefit to aid the Theater Off Park. Guests gathered in a library sufficiently high above the dance floor to permit conversation. The Off Broadway organization, which is marking its 10th anniversary, has just been transformed from a showcase to a company. ''A showcase means actors donate their services,'' said Albert Harris, artistic director. ''A company means we're paying them.'' Theater people such as Maurice Hines and Beatrice Straight, board members, patrons of the company and residents of the Murray Hill neighborhood showed up to lend their support. ''It's been a long hot summer, a very long summer,'' said Liliane Montevecchi, who was standing in as hostess for Gwen Verdon and whose show, ''Gotta Getaway,'' had just closed at Radio City Music Hall. ''It's long and hot when you do two shows a day.''

1335-> LIFE IN EAST CLEVELAND: A 1950'S MIGRANT FAMILY CONSIDERS A NEW MOVE
Mamie Delaney Williams, matriarch of the Northern branch of her family, was treated to a surprise party for her 70th birthday. Three generations were present, most of them having moved to Cleveland from Montgomery, Ala., in the early 1950's, a small part of a great wave of black migration. For Mrs. Williams's family, the attraction was the vitality and promise and freedom. The bright red flames and black smoke belching from the steel mills in the Flats, the assembly lines that produced the parts for American cars, the feeling of relief to escape segregation, the sights, the sounds, the smells of the big city: all were beautiful to a family of Southerners looking for a better life, searching for a chance. Mrs. Williams, when asked what she wanted to do on her birthday, replied, ''Kick up my heels and dance!'' That she did, in a kind of 50's shuffle, expending enough energy to work up a sweat, tiring a bit too quickly. She still exhibits concern about her four sons and two daughters, about their children and their problems. Three of her children have been divorced; only one remarried. ''I'm from the old school,'' she has said. ''We don't do that unless it's absolutely necessary.'' After she was widowed nearly 30 years ago, she remarried. To her, death is the only way marriages should break up: that is ''absolutely necessary.'' In this bedroom community snuggling against Cleveland, Mamie Williams lives on the ground floor of a duplex; a daughter and her children live upstairs. It is an old house, and Mrs. Williams has been trying to get her husband, Charlie, to buy a condominium. But time and age make Charlie reluctant even to contemplate such a major change. Both are retired, he from the Ford plant on the West Side, she from nursing. She spends days watching the soap operas; he is hooked on the Indians and Browns. Life seems to provide nothing much to worry about. ''If he wants, we could stay here in East Cleveland,'' she remarked. ''I know he doesn't want to move too far. I wouldn't want that, either. But we need to make a move.'' Recently she and Robbin, her teen-age granddaughter, were victims of an armed robbery. A young couple said they needed to make a telephone call and then held a gun on the two women for 20 minutes, searching the house. ''I was afraid at first,'' Mrs. Williams said. ''Then I got mad. Finally, I told them they had to leave because my husband was due home. They left.'' They took some jewelry, money and a television set. The incident intensified Mrs. Williams's desire to move. Robbin feels safer now as a student at the University of Cincinnati. Moving has become the main topic of conversation. It certainly is part of the family legacy. A walk today through the Glenville section, where the family first settled in Ohio, tells a story far different from the 1950's. Vacant lots, boarded-up buildings and potholes are common, yet they contrast with the pastels and bright colors of the two- and three-story frame houses on quiet streets. Many of the lawns are still neatly trimmed. Back then the signs of life were the small shops that brought clusters of people from those quiet streets; teen-agers doo-wopping on street corners on St. Clair or Superior Avenue; the rumble of decrepit streetcars; eight movie houses; the night life on 105th Street, Cafe Society, Dearing's, Tia Juana. Activity. People. Gaiety. Today the signs of aging are everywhere. The red brick of Cory United Methodist Church is dingy and dull; the St. Clair-105th Street branch of the long-defunct Cleveland Trust Bank is empty; Park Place, at Wade Park and East Boulevard, contends for the title of ugliest apartment complex in North America. Religious congregations have taken over the storefronts that once housed thriving small businesses. The area abounds with social service agencies trying to cope with the needs of the section's growing number of poor people. Partly out of pride and partly because of success, nearly all the family has stayed in Cleveland. For most families that left the South, to return without prosperity was to admit failure. It has only been recently that blacks have begun going back, responding to the changes in both regions. ''Alfred has decided to go back to Montgomery,'' Mrs. Williams announced, referring to her second son. ''There's really nothing much to keep him here.'' Alfred was badly burned in a fire and is on disability pay; he has been divorced and has difficulty finding work in Cleveland's poor economy. Until recently, even hard times provided no reason to think about going back South. The family speaks uneasily of two cousins who came upon hard times and died on the streets of New York rather than return to Montgomery. Alfred packed his bags, gave up his apartment and moved in with his mother to await one more disability check. ''He alerted his grandmother and aunt in Montgomery he was coming,'' Mrs. Williams said. That was three months ago and Alfred is still here, his bags still packed. ''I think he's afraid to do it,'' Mrs. Williams said. ''Doesn't know what it would be like after 30 years. He sounded interested and excited about it at first, and they want him to come. But he must be scared to go.'' The feeling in the family is, if he goes South again, then a cousin, Mary, will surely follow, and maybe others. ''He'd be the first of us,'' Mrs. Williams said. ''I don't think I'd ever do it.'' She was not convincing.

1336-> U.S. SAYS IT WON'T RETALIATE NOW
The United States today called the bombing of the United States Embassy in Beirut ''a senseless, brutal attack'' and a reminder that ''civilized norms of behavior are threatened by those who use terrorism as a political weapon.'' But senior officials said that, despite the frustration and anger over the third such attack against Americans in Beirut in 18 months, there was no plan for any immediate retaliation. Walter F. Mondale, the Democratic Presidential contender, said in Seattle that he would support any ''appropriate countermeasures'' President Reagan might contemplate. (Page A13.) Congressional reaction ranged from criticism of security measures to calls for stronger efforts against terrorism. (Page A12.) The President, at the urging of Secretary of State George P. Shultz, decided on a restrained response, officials said. Expressing a seeming resignation over the attack, Mr. Reagan said before leaving on a campaign trip to the Middle West: ''You have to live and you have to do your best to protect yourself, but you have to know that these terrorist groups are threatening all over the world.'' He said the United States would not be driven out of Lebanon. ''We cannot crawl in a hole some place and stop performing,'' he said. Mr. Shultz, his expression somber, told a State Department audience that the United States was taking ''every measure we can to deal effectively with this problem,'' but that the problem ''will be with us.'' In Beirut, security had been increased at the embassy, and all United States Embassies in the Middle East had been on alert since a general threat made on Sept. 8 by the Islamic Holy War, the group that said it carried out the attack today. From the first days of Mr. Reagan's term, the Administration had spoken of the need to retaliate swiftly against terrorism. But White House and State De partment officials said that there was no plan to carry out any military actions against the Islamic Holy War group, which is believed linked to Iran. John Hughes, the State Department spokesman, said no retaliatory action was ''contemplated or imminent.'' He refused to rule out action in the future, but said that, for the moment, the priority was to assure the well-being of those who were injured and ascertain the whereabouts of those missing. Last October, after the attack on Marine headquarters in Beirut, the White House said that, once the perpetrators were found, the United States would ''respond to this criminal act.'' But nothing was ever done. Difficult to Pinpoint a Target At that time, officials said it was difficult to pinpoint a target in which those responsible could be hit and, moreover, France and Israel had already made air strikes of their own against camps believed to house terrorists in the Bekaa valley, east of Beirut. Mr. Hughes said Mr. Shultz had sent a team led by Richard W. Murphy, Assistant Secretary for Near East and South Asian affairs, and Robert B. Oakley, in charge of antiterrorism affairs, to Beirut to recommend additional measures. Mr. Shultz took charge of the Administration's operations in the predawn hours when word of the attack reached Washington shortly after 4:30 A. M. A sense of shock seemed to sweep over the capital. A White House official said: ''It was a nightmare revisited. All of a sudden, I could see the embassy disaster and the marines being killed, and I realized it was not over yet.'' Robert S. Dillon, who was Ambassador to Lebanon when the American Embassy in West Beirut was destroyed by a car bomb in April 1983, said: ''When I saw the TV this morning, I asked 'How could it happen again?' '' Beirut No Longer in Public Eye Beirut had been virtually dropped from the political vocabulary here in the last six months. After two years of intensive interest, the Administration - and its political opponents - seemed to want to forget about Lebanon once the marines had been pulled out and the Lebanese Government adopted a pro-Syrian stance last March. The shock over the incident today again raised questions that had been more or less submerged - whether the United States had a role to play in Lebanon, and whether it was worthwhile keeping such a large presence. The State Department said there were 100 official Americans in Beirut. Blow to American Standing Lebanon's decision in March to abrogate the Israeli accord worked out by Mr. Shultz was a blow to American standing in the region. As a result, officials had been uninterested in talking about Lebanon. The new Lebanese Government, seeking to improve relations with Syria, had in fact gone to the United Nations to seek a Security Council resolution to force the Israelis out of southern Lebanon. But the United States vetoed the resolution, leading to the threat of Sept. 8 by the Islamic Holy War group against American installations in the region. President Reagan, at a campaign stop in Norway, Iowa, spoke fatalistically today about trying to protect against terrorism. ''I think if someone is determined to do what they did, it is pretty difficult to prevent it,'' he said. ''Actually, the only defense you have against terrorist activities is if you can infiltrate and intercept and know in advance where they are going to strike.'' Issue Is Against Whom to Strike Mr. Shultz had been a leading advocate for adopting such a pre-emptive policy. But officials said that the Central Intelligence Agency had not been able to infiltrate terrorist groups. ''There is no sense talking about retaliation,'' a State Department official said, ''unless you know who is to be retaliated against.'' Israel tends to strike against groups believed responsible for terrorist acts, without necessarily hitting the actual perpetrators. The United States has been reluctant to adopt such an approach. Senator John Glenn, Democrat of Ohio, said: ''We must make every effort to determine the ultimate source of these terrorist attacks. If it turns out to be the Government of Iran, as has been rumored, then I think the President should consider terminating whatever shipments of parts and equipment to that country that may still be continuing.'' Reagan on Phone to Envoy Mr. Shultz discussed the attack on the embassy at a State Department ceremony honoring Foreign Service officers, including some who had distinguished themselves in Lebanon. He said he and Mr. Reagan had both spoken by phone with Ambassador Reginald Bartholomew in his hospital room in Beirut. ''He says he is just fine,'' Mr. Shultz said. ''Just a few cuts. But in his characteristic way of courage and coolness under fire, he has given us his report on the situation in Beirut. ''This terrorist attack once again reminds us of the importance of the efforts that we are taking to combat terrorism, of the international dimension of this problem, and of course the importance of working with other countries as we do to combat it in every way that we can. ''And I can assure you that we are taking, and will continue to take, every measure we can to deal effectively with this problem.'' Mr. Hughes, the State Department spokesman, said Mr. Shultz had spoken for the Administration in expressing ''our feelings about the senseless brutal attack on Americans and Lebanese working in Beirut.''

1337-> FRITZIE ZIVIC, 71, FIGHTER WHO HELD WELTERWEIGHT TITLE PITTSBURGH, May 17 (UPI) - Fritzie Zivic, whose catlike quickness helped him win the world welterweight championship and 165 fights in an 18- year professional boxing career, died of Alzheimer's disease Wednesday at a Veterans Administration hospital in suburban Aspinwall. He was 71 years old and had been a patient at the hospital for the last three years.
Zivic, a native of Pittsburgh, had a checkered career. He beat some of the greatest fighters of his day, including Jake La Motta, but also lost to many of much lesser regard. He held the welterweight championship for only 9 months and suffered 65 losses among his 230 professsional fights. Nonetheless, he was recognized as a master boxer, and in 1973 he was elected to the sport's Hall of Fame. Sugar Ray Robinson, who beat him twice, once said that he had learned more in 10 rounds with Zivic than in all his other fights put together. Won Title From Armstrong Zivic, whose real given name was Ferdinand, is best remembered for taking the title away from Henry Armstrong on Oct. 4, 1940, in a 15-round decision at Madison Square Garden. After retiring from the ring in 1949, Zivic turned to promoting and managing, but neither endeavor was successful. He was a lavish spender, and by the early 1950's he had encountered deep financial problems. He is survived by his wife, Helen; a daughter, two sons, two brothers and four grandchildren.

1338-> ANTIQUES; BIG SHOW IN HARTFORD SETS THE TRENDS IN ANTIQUES
FOR lovers of American antiques, be they collectors, curators, or merely connoisseurs, discreet dealers or indiscriminate dabblers, there is nothing more delectable than the cornucopia of a major antiques show. At such a show as the 18th Annual Connecticut Antiques Show next weekend in Hartford, they can, unlike at a museum exhibition, talk to fellow aficionados, quibble and haggle, touch and even buy. Unlike at a private collection, they need not show respect and be polite. Unlike at an auction, they can come a little late and avoid much of the stress and uncertainty of competition. Unlike at a library, they need not be hushed and their eyes and hands are occupied with more dimensions. And unlike at most other shows, they can get a firm sense of the marketplace, because this is the first major antiques show of the season in the Northeast. What happens in Hartford will strongly indicate the state of the market and will influence other shows that follow: Boston later this month, White Plains next month, Greenwich in December, Washington in January and Philadelphia in April. In recent interviews, many who will be leading dealers at the show have reported that they are enjoying their finest year in memory and are bringing many museum- quality items. They attribute the growing interest in the field to the economy's recovery, the continued removal from the private sector of many of the best pieces into public collections and historic house restorations, election-year patriotism and a rising enthusiasm among collectors. According to Francis Bealey, a dealer from Essex who will be exhibiting at the Hartford show, ''the market is magnificent, absolutely unbelievable: the better the offerings, the more avid the collectors.'' Jerome Blum, a dealer in Lisbon, declared that it was ''the best'' in at least 20 years because ''the supply is down and the appreciation by the public is up.'' If such momentum continues, of course, then the relatively stable prices of the last few years for less-than-prime pieces will begin to feel the pressures of inflation. Scarcity and a widening audience have intensified the competition for the finest examples. But there are many tiers in the market, and bargains remain at the lower end in attractive antiques that have been restored and may be missing some of their original hardware. Such examples, according to Arthur Liverant of Nathan Liverant & Son of Colchester, may be valued at only half of a comparable-quality original piece. The market interest for the lesser- quality items, however, according to Mr. Bealey, is ''chancy'' because of growing sophistication by collectors ''who are really con cerned about information and decisively go after the good stuff.'' Provenance, he said, is not as critical as quality of workmanship and original condition, and he advised all collectors to buy every possible book on their subjects. With 95 exhibitors invited from 12 states, the show, which will be held Friday through Sunday at the State Armory at Broad Street and Capitol Avenue, will attract buyers not only from across the country, according to many of the exhibitors, but also even from Europe. The lure is the show's reputation for authenticity and its strict adherence to showing only Early American furniture made between the 1640's and the 1840's and decorations, many of which were imported for use during the same period. The show is ''vetted,'' which means that its organizers insist that no reproductions be allowed. In an increasingly mobile world, Early American furniture and decorative accessories are prized by many collectors in Europe, just as they are in this country, for their investment value, their rarity, their simplification of design and, sometimes, for their worth as a kind of status symbol. Some buyers, especially those who collect ceramics, visit the Connecticut show in search of items made in England exclusively for sale in the American colonies. Many colonial accessories, because of restrictive British regulations before the American Revolution, were necessarily imported. And many American antiques are rarer than the equivalent pieces made in Europe because of the shorter traditions and smaller constituencies. The show, which this year joins with the Wadsworth Atheneum in celebrating its opening of 17 new galleries of American furnishings, is a benefit for the Antiquarian and Landmark Society, Connecticut's largest preservation agency. Also featured in the show, in addition to furniture, will be displays of American pewter, silver, earthenware and glass, iron and woodenware, early textiles and an excellent variety of American paintings. Those who attend the show will be provided with special guest passes to visit the newly opened galleries of the Wadsworth Atheneum. Among the many examples of fine Connecticut and other New England furniture of the early 18th century that Mr. Liverant will display will be a rare, Queen Anne dressing table or lowboy, valued for its diminutive size and graceful lightness of line. Made of maple and poplar about 1740 in eastern Connecticut, the table has a typical wide overhang of its molded- edge top board. The case is just 24 inches wide. The long, slender cabriole legs end in pad feet. The apron is carved and scalloped in the front and on the sides. There is a long top drawer above a row of three deep drawers, the center one of which has a starburst carving. The price is $22,000. Mr. Liverant will also show many paintings, including a captain's portrait by Isaac Sheffield (1798-1845) and an Edward Rook (1870-1960) painting of an old mill in Old Lyme. To be shown by Mr. Blum is a rare set of six chairs made by Duncan Phyfe, generally recognized as America's foremost designer-craftsman of the mid-Federal period. The chairs were on loan during the 1920's and 30's to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and are so marked on the back in ink with the museum's code. The chairs, with delicately carved lyre backs and ''hairy paw feet,'' were considered prime examples of Phyfe's work in their own period, and one of these was illustrated in ''Furniture Masterpieces of Duncan Phyfe,'' published by the Metropolitan Museum and Doubleday in 1922. The set of chairs will be $75,000. Mr. Bealey will show an important pair of American Federal carved, inlaid and veneered mahogany, satinwood and rosewood console tables. One table's back has three mortise elements and the other has three tenon elements so that they can be joined together. The tables are in original condition and were made in the Philadelphia-Baltimore area about 1800; they are priced at $45,000. A rare example of a portrait by Abraham Delanoy (1742-1795) will be shown by Marguerite Riordan of Stonington, in what is believed to be its original ebonized and gilt frame. The subject is the wife of Capt. John Sherman of New Haven, and their son, Henry, who was born in 1785. Lillian Blankley Cogan of Farmington will offer a wide variety of antiques, including a very rare wooden hatbox for an 18th-century ''tri-corn'' hat for $8,500 that she recently found at an auction. She had searched for the hatbox for several decades after seeing it reproduced in a reference book by Wallace Nutting.

1343-> FONTENOT DEFEATS BLUE JAYS
Early tonight, before it could ruin him, Ray Fontenot stopped throwing the best pitch he has - the sinker pointed outside. But he abandoned it only for a time. When he returned to it, the Toronto Blue Jays were unsuspecting and they chased it where they could not possibly make contact, below their knees and beyond the reach of their swings. The Yankees won, 6-1, because of a basic tactical decision of their catcher and pitcher to make the plan unpredictable. Rick Cerone, behind the plate, altered the location of the pitches by changing the target. Because of that, the Yankees split the four-game series with the Blue Jays and are still in fourth, where they started the week, three-and-a-half games behind second-place Toronto. ''Rick did it,'' Fontentot said of Cerone. ''I couldn't get my outside sinker working and that's usually my bread and butter. So he moved me inside. The hitters weren't expecting that, and I know they weren't expecting me to start throwing outside again.'' To compliment the sublime techniques of their battery, the Yankees came up with two spates of power, one in the fourth inning that featured three straight extra-base hits and produced three runs to put them into the lead where they remained. The other burst came an inning earlier on a line drive that Dave Winfield hit off the thigh of Toronto's starting pitcher, Luis Leal. Immediately before, Leal had come close to hitting Winfield with two straight chest-high pitches. Leal pitched on into the fourth but retired only one more batter. A report later said Leal had suffered a bruised thigh. There were no other great crescendos in the contest except for Don Mattingly's 22d home run with the bases empty in the fifth. ''That's the way I like it, nice and easy,'' said Fontenot, who allowed five hits, struck out six, and walked five in eight innings.''Too often this year it hasn't been that way.'' Fontenot, now 7-8, is the left-hander who as a rookie last year was 8-2 and raised great promise. But he has flitted between the bullpen and the starting rotation, actually performing better in a relief capacity than as a starter. In 11 relief appearances, he has a 1.84 earned-run average, but over all he has a 3.83 e.r.a. And then this week, he received word that he had been suspended for three days for his part in a bench- clearing brawl with the California Angels a week and a half ago. His appeal of the ruling will be heard on Friday afternoon in the league office. In the first four innings tonight, he allowed four hits and walked four. Each team scored once in the third and then the Yankees struck in the fourth. Scott Bradley, making his first major league start, doubled and soon scored when Mike Pagliarulo pulled the ball over the first-base bag for another two-base hit. He, in turn, came in on a triple by Omar Moreno. That blow sent Toronto's starter, Leal, from the game. Willie Randolph brought Moreno home with a fly out to center. Batting Race Same Winfield and Mattingly each had two hits in five times at bat, and their averages remained the same - Winfield at .351, Mattingly at .347.

1345-> Japanese Protest U.S. Move
Four thousand mothers and children gathered in the port city of Yokosuka today to protest the scheduled deployment of Tomahawk cruise missiles on United States Navy ships, the police said. The battleship New Jersey, equipped with Tomahawk missiles, will reportedly begin stopping at Yokosuka in June. Japan's large pacifist groups argue that because the Tomahawks can be equipped with nuclear warheads they violate Japan's policy against introducing nuclear weapons into the country.

1346-> U.S. MIGHT APPROVE MISSILE PAYMENTS
Air Force contract managers are satisfied with the Hughes Aircraft Company's efforts to solve workmanship problems and have recommended that the Pentagon resume millions of dollars in payments frozen since last month, a defense contract official said today. The recommendation calls for the Pentagon to release 50 percent of the withheld monthly progress payments when Hughes resumes missile production at its facility in Tucson, Ariz., possibly as early as Oct. 1, said Dr. Thomas S. Amlie, assistant for technical systems in the Air Force's financial management office. The other half of the payments would be made when Hughes begins delivering missiles in good condition, Dr. Amlie said in a telephone interview from Washington. Three of six divisions of Hughes, the Pentagon's largest supplier of missiles, radar and high-technology equipment, have been beset with allegations of shoddy workmanship on some weapons systems for the last two months. No Action on Payment Request At the company's Tucson plant, the Pentagon has stopped accepting missiles, has withheld $37.8 million in payments for July and has not acted on a request for August payments that was submitted late Tuesday. Neither the Pentagon nor Hughes would say how much money is involved in the request. A Hughes spokesman, Scott Rayburn, said today that it would be ''inappropriate'' for him to comment on the recommendation or on when the company might resume missile production, because Hughes ''has not been notified by the Air Force or the Pentagon as to their decision on progress payments or resumption of production.'' ''Hughes is making a massive effort'' to overcome problems, Dr. Amlie said, ''and they seem to be doing all the right things. They are working furiously to retrain their people.'' Spokesmen for the Air Force and the Defense Department declined to confirm that the recommendation had been made or to comment on Amlie's report, and Air Force Maj. Jim Jannette said Dr. Amlie was not an authorized spokesman. Dr. Amlie said that production at the Tucson plant, which was halted Aug. 9, could resume by Oct. 1.

1347-> BOOKS OF THE TIMES
CITIES AND THE WEALTH OF NATIONS. Principles of Economic Life. By Jane Jacobs. 257 pages. Random House. $17.95. READERS of Jane Jacobs's previous maverick books on cities know how highly she esteems urban life and economic activity. In ''The Death and Life of Great American Cities,'' she argued that cities were essential to the well-being of the polity. In ''The Economy of Cities,'' she went a step further and theorized that urban life was not only more important than rural life but also probably preceded it historically in the economic development of ancient economies. Now, in ''Cities and Wealth,'' she has taken her thesis to its logical limits (and perhaps, some would argue, quite beyond it). Now she is saying that cities are not only essential to a nation's economic well-being but are also the true source of economic productivity and the creation of wealth. Forget Marx and Keynes, she says. Forget supply-side economics and demand-side economics, the Phillips Curve and the Laffer Curve. Forget the nation state as a ''salient entity for understanding the structure of economic life,'' for as such it is merely a ''mercantilist tautology,'' Mrs. Jacobs insists, ''a repetition of the idea of national treasure.'' Accept that the beginning of economic expansion occurs when a city replaces its imports by creating its own products. Import-replacing happens in cities because only cities supply the rich symbiotic mix of activities that permit innovation and adaptation to occur. Indeed, as Mrs. Jacobs devoted ''The Economy of Cities'' to explaining, ''Any settlement that becomes good at import-replacing becomes a city.'' Accept that, as Mrs. Jacobs puts it in the somewhat chunky but not entirely rhythmless prose of ''Cities and the Wealth of Nations'': ''The expansion that derives from city import-replacing consists specifically of these five forms of growth'': 1. ''abruptly enlarged city markets for new and different imports consisting largely of rural goods and of innovations being produced in other cities;'' 2. ''abruptly increased numbers and kinds of jobs in the import-replacing city''; 3. ''increased transplants of city work into nonurban locations as older enterprises are crowded out''; 4. ''new uses for technology, particularly to increase rural production and productivity''; and 5. ''growth of city capital.'' Accept that it is when these activities cease that stagnation and inflation occur, not for any reason having to do with the gross national product, interest rates or the money supply. Accept all this and you will understand why, in Mrs. Jacobs's view, not nation states but cities and their regions ought to be recognized as ''the suitable entity for analyzing economic life.'' And why it follows that in the ideal scheme of things cities and their regions should be permitted to function on their own, with their own currencies even, and their own system of tariffs if necessary. Under such an arrangement, New York City might come back to life again. And France might cease to be a drain on the European Economic Community. Now, not even Jane Jacobs seriously believes that any such arrangement is about to be implemented, although she does indulge herself in wistful expressions of how nice it would be if the nation-states of the world could only give up fighting with one another. But she can dream, can't she? And what down-to-earth dreams these are, especially when you compare them with the ''reality'' of most economic theory. Why does transplanting a viable industry fail to revive the stagnant economy of the area to which it is transferred? Because its very transplantability makes it too self-contained to interact productively with its new economic environment, which is why building a Lockheed factory in Marietta, Ga., won't really stimulate the local economy significantly. How can you identify a declining economy? When it is investing in military production, or in transfer payments, or in advanced-backward economies like those of many African and South American countries. These are ''transactions of decline,'' she argues, which is why she believes that imperialism as a system has economic failure built into it, and why she can announce with such conviction: ''Today the Soviet Union and the United States each predicts and anticipates the economic decline of the other. Neither will be disappointed.'' One obvious appeal of Jane Jacobs's writing is that she thinks of economic activities as highly organic processes and is therefore able to write about them in a way that is not only comprehensible but entertaining. Yet precisely because she is so easy and fun to read, you tend not to take her with the utmost seriousness. Economics is just too difficult a subject to be treated so sensibly, you reason. Yet the more you read Mrs. Jacobs and compare her prognoses with those of the establishment economists, the more you have to wonder. It's true that when it comes to economics, everything is upside down and backwards. But maybe her intelligibility shouldn't be held against her. After all, just because she makes such good sense doesn't necessarily mean that she's wrong! Still, whether it's right or wrong, ''Cities and the Wealth of Nations'' is well worth reading. Like Mrs. Jacobs's other books, it offers a concrete approach to an abstract and elusive subject. That, all by itself, makes for an intoxicating experience.

1348-> Flyers Get 13, Tie Club Mark PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 18
Illka Sinisalo and Brian Propp each scored three goals as the Philadelphia Flyers' routed the Vancouver Canucks tonight, 13-2. The 13 goals tied a club record. The game was marred by six fights in the second period and the ejection of six players: Vancouver's Doug Lidster, Moe Lemay, Doug Halward and Garth Butcher and Philadelphia's Doug Crossman and Len Hachborn. Philadelphia (2-1-1) had not scored a first-period goal in three games this season, but got four against Vancouver (1- 4-0). Propp made it 2-0 with his first two shots - scoring at 2 minutes 41 seconds and 7:13. Brad McCrimmon made it 3-0 for Philadelphia, his first goal since March 12, 1983.

1349-> GOING OUT GUIDE
BRITISH AUTHOR Although she may be best known here as the writer of the opening episodes of the television series ''Upstairs, Downstairs,'' Fay Weldon is a prominent novelist at home in England. She has written best sellers there and has won praise for her latest book, ''The Life and Loves of a She Devil,'' to be published this autumn by Pantheon in New York. She also caused a stir recently by denouncing British publishers for their treatment of authors. Mrs. Weldon is here from London to give her first reading in this country, at Queens College. She doesn't usually do this sort of thing, according to Regina Barreca, a faculty member, but, ''When I explained that I was writing my dissertation on her work and that a group of people she has greatly influenced wanted very much to hear her read, she agreed to come.'' The author has described herself as ''a feminist, although many contemporary feminists would dispute that because I associate with men and wash my son's socks.'' Her work has appeared in feminist literary journals and in women's magazines such as Redbook and Mademoiselle. She will read at 6 tonight in the Student Union, Room 310. The college is in Flushing on Kissena Boulevard and the Long Island Expressway. The event is free. Information: 520-7322. MINORITY STRUGGLE Another writer will be on another campus tonight, not to read his works but to discuss ''The Struggle of Minority Artists in the United States.'' Imamu Amiri Baraka, the playwright and poet who used to be known as LeRoi Jones, will present the lecture tonight at 7 in the Schimmel Auditorium of New York University's Tisch Hall, 40 West Fourth Street. An N.Y.U. spokesman said she had told Mr. Baraka that drama students were particularly interested in hearing about ''his changing role as a black playwright and the role of black actors, writers and directors in the theater today.'' Admission is free. Information: 598-7695. 'GREEN HORNET' ALUMNUS Billy Roy, who will sing and play piano at the Carnegie Tavern, 165 West 56th Street, in an open-ended engagement beginning tonight, started his career at age 3, singing on the radio in Detroit in a weekly children's program. Which makes him how old now? ''Younger than Bobby Short,'' he said helpfully, having accompanied Mr. Short recently in Boston. When he was old enough to read, Mr. Roy began his other career, as an actor. He was in radio shows including ''The Lone Ranger'' and ''The Green Hornet,'' and in such films as ''The Corn Is Green'' with Bette Davis, ''Passage to Marseilles'' with Humphrey Bogart, and ''It Happened in Brooklyn'' with Frank Sinatra. More recently, he was in ''Love, Sidney'' on NBC-TV. Mr. Roy, who has been a musical director for Julius Monk, Dorothy Dandridge, Ginger Rogers, Bernadette Peters and Margaret Whiting, will be backed by John Loehrke on bass. They will play some of Mr. Roy's own works as well as music by such composers as Cole Porter, No"el Coward, Cy Coleman, George Gershwin and Elton John. Peformances Monday through Saturday evenings at various times between 9 and midnight. There's a $7.95 minimum from 8 to 10 P.M., $5.95 thereafter. Drinks start at $2.25 and entrees range from $7 to $13. Reservations suggested: 757-9522.

1350-> SPORTS PEOPLE; Esposito Era Ends
Fifteen years after he joined the Chicago Black Hawks and immediately became the team's No. 1 goalie, Tony Esposito has been told that he will not be invited to the team's training camp when it opens Sept. 18. The 41-year-old Esposito, who had been expecting such a move since Coach Orval Tessier sharply reduced his playing time last year, said he did not think he was ready to retire. ''No sense looking back,'' he said. ''It's over here. Now I have to decide where I go from here.'' Bob Pulford , the Black Hawks' general manager, said Esposito had been let go because Murray Bannerman , the club's regular goaltender, had proven himself and the club wanted to develop younger talent, either Warren Skorodenski or Jim Ralph , who are expected to fight it out for the backup slot. ''Tony has been a great goaltender,'' Pulford said, ''but there comes that time in everybody's career.'' . . . The Rangers announced they had signed Tom Laidlaw , their 26-year- old defenseman, to a contract for the coming season.

1354-> Childen Die in Fire
Two children died in a fire last night when sparks from an electric radiator started a fire in a bedroom of their home in the East Flatbush section of Brooklyn, the police said. The victims were Carlyle Leonidas, 4 years old, and his sister, Lorie, who was 5. The fire started at 11:30 P.M. in the first-floor bedroom of the two- family home at 853 East 46th Street. Three other children escaped from the blaze without injury, the police said.

1355-> OPERA: ENSEMBLE PRESENTS BLITZSTEIN'S 'REGINA'
and another such time may be on the horizon - when the future of American opera seemed to lie in cross-fertilization with the Broadway musical. The foremost surviving examples are ''Porgy and Bess,'' the late works of Kurt Weill, Leonard Bernstein's opera-musicals, and those of Marc Blitzstein. Blitzstein's ''Regina,'' revived by the Opera Ensemble of New York at the Lillie Blake School, provided an interesting and thought-provoking evening at its third performance Wednesday night. ''Regina'' is based on Lillian Hellman's ''Little Foxes,'' a play about the turn-of-the-century South whose message seems to be that all but the weak act out of spite and greed, and that the weak, if they can muster strength at all, use it to strike at the powerful. Regina is a ''number'' opera, which is to say that the action is suspended at various points for reflection or comment in song. The essential problem is that ''The Little Foxes'' consists mostly of shrewd, calculating dialogue. It is not the stuff of arias and soliloquies, and it is rarely within the emotional reach of Broadway's musical style, at least as it existed in the early 1950's. So most of ''Regina's'' musical highlights, the ballads, dance-songs and ensemble numbers, are grafted artificially onto the plot, instead of arising naturally out of it. The dialogue, in turn, must be compressed even further than is usually necessary for opera - often to the point of comic suddenness. This sounds like the recipe for a flop, but in fact Miss Hellman herself liked the wit and bite of the music. As Leonard Bernstein said, it has the effect of ''coating the wormwood with sugar, and scenting with magnolia blossoms the cursed house.'' Still it is an uneven and problematic work, and the rather obvious, hammy delivery of much of the dialogue in the Opera Ensemble production did little to restore what subtlety might have existed in Miss Hellman's play. The cast is led by a strong Regina, though: Susan Marie Pierson has a rich, colorful voice that she does not push, a fine Southern accent, and a commanding presence, appealing and repellent at once as the role requires. She has the hard, grasping charm of the Southern matriarch down to a science. Her enunciation is clear. (A detail worth noting: A glottal stop, the sound a baby makes between the syllables of ''uh-oh,'' is essential to clear English pronunciation - but Miss Pierson employs it so emphatically that it becomes a mannerism.) Robert Osborne, though taxed at the extremes of his range, brought a warm and sonorous bass-baritone to the role of her husband, Horace Giddens. However, he managed to sound Southern only on syllables rhyming with ''nice'' or ''light.'' The rest of the cast was less noteworthy from a vocal standpoint, but Deborah Lazenby as Birdie draws a lifelike, touching study of the slightly scatterbrained, passive Southern lady who hides her pain behind a giggle. The production has a good, functional set by Peter Harrison, and is accompanied by a small, ill-blended and insensitive orchestra. The music director, Ruth Bierhoff, should not bear all the blame, but some very crucial words were covered, and she could have saved them with the right ''shush'' signals to the brass and percussion. The production, directed by John J. D. Sheehan, will be repeated tonight, Wednesday and next Friday at 8 P.M., and Sunday and May 20 at 3 P.M.

1356-> NEW BRAIN STUDY TECHNIQUE REVEALS AN ALZHEIMER DEFECT
Scientists have found that large molecules remain intact in frozen human brains for years after death and, by studying such molecules, have discovered a basic biological abnormality in senile brains destroyed by Alzheimer's disease. A report in today's issue of the journal Science by the two principle researchers, Dr. Charles A. Marotta and Dr. Elizabeth M. Sajdel-Sulkowska of the Harvard Medical School in Boston and McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass., described laboratory conditions under which large molecules will make protein as if in a living brain. Dr. Marotta suggested in an interview yesterday that the technique of analyzing cells from long-frozen brains and studying molecular mechanisms that have gone awry might open up important new areas of investigation for other diseases whose causes are not known. Experts at the National Institute on Aging, which financed much of Dr. Marotta's research, said the discovery of the biologic brain defect was an important step in the search for the cause, treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease. Millions of people throughout the world have Alzheimer's disease, which is related to more than 100,000 deaths each year in the United States. The disease, named for Dr. Alois Alzheimer, who described it 70 years ago, causes loss of memory and confusion and may eventually prevent the victims from taking proper care of themselves. Until now, Dr. Marotta said, scientists have assumed that large molecules such as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA), the biochemical cornerstones of life, were so fragile that they would be destroyed within hours by the usual post- mortem digestion processes. Molecules are the most basic chemical substances that exist above their individual atoms. The large molecules involved in the Harvard study, DNA and RNA, are contained in every living cell and control the production of proteins and other more complex substances. The question arises as to whether the frozen molecules are living or dead. They are in a sense suspended, dead in that they are no longer controlling the production of proteins, but living in that, once thawed, they can be made to resume functioning under conditions of isolation in the laboratory. For centuries doctors have preserved brains in a chemical called formalin for study under the microscope at later dates. But because the formalin treatment destroys enzymes and other substances in the brain, the process limits the biochemical tests that researchers can do on the preserved organ. As doctors have developed newer molecular biological techniques over recent years, they have found new ways to preserve autopsy specimens. Within hours of the death of patients with puzzling neurological disorders, doctors in several medical centers have taken sections of brains and frozen them in so-called brain banks. Researchers have stored entire brains in some cases and single hemispheres in others, depending on the disease and the anatomical areas presumed needed for future study. Years later, when researchers become interested in a particular disease or develop new techniques, they go to the brain banks, thaw the specimens, and then do their studies. Reason for Using Frozen Material The principal advantage of using frozen material rather than fresh specimens from an autopsy is that it can be stored, giving pathologists time to do routine studies to make a diagnosis and giving the scientists much more time for the painstaking research often required to determine the causes of disease. Dr. Marotta said he and Dr. Sajdel- Sulkowska studied samples of frozen brains of six victims of Alzheimer's disease as well as those of four patients of the same ages who died of other conditions. They found that the defect is a biochemical abnormality that leads to a markedly diminished production of new protein in the brain cells damaged by Alzheimer's disease. The body constantly produces new protein in the brain and other organs as part of the so-called turnover and homeostatic processes. The DNA in the nuclei of cells produces RNA, which controls the cell's metabolism and ability to make new protein. The reduction in new protein presumably interferes with brain function in Alzheimer's disease. Doctors have known for several years that the most serious symptoms of Alzheimer's disease correlate closely with the accumulation within cells of abnormal protein structures called neurofibrillary tangles. They also have known that the place of brain cells destroyed by Alzheimer's disease is often taken by structures called neuritic plaques, which are remnants of nerve cells. But several factors have hindered the research efforts of scientists who have been puzzled as to how these changes relate to normal cell function. One factor is that because animals do not develop a condition that mimics the human disease there is no experimental animal model. Also, doctors cannot obtain specimens of living brain in the way they so commonly remove samples of blood and skin. Ethical constraints prevent brain samples from being removed from living people strictly for research purposes. Origin of Technique Dr. Marotta said he began developing the idea for his technique five years ago when he looked at electron microscopic pictures of nerve endings in the post-mortem brain. He said he noticed that even when the brains were frozen several hours after death, he could see that certain structures within cells were surprisingly well-preserved. From that observation Dr. Marotta reasoned that large molecules, too, might be preserved and that they might be used for research. ''Nobody had bothered to look at it from that point of view,'' said Dr. Marotta, who is a molecular neurobiologist. His first step was to perfect a technique of removing molecules from frozen brains and studying them in the laboratory. Then he said he obtained specimens of Alzheimer's patients from Dr. Peter Davies and Dr. Robert Terry at the Albert Einstein Medical School in the Bronx. Because there is no specific diagnostic test for Alzheimer's disease, doctors often have difficulty in diagnosing it. Accordingly, Dr. Marotta said one reason he tested only six senile brains was that he specifically wanted only those from proved cases of Alzheimer's disease - those who had lost their memory and had other clearcut symptoms and whose brains showed both plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Defect Affects 2 Proteins The researchers found that there was a basic biological defect in the Alzheimer brains that affected the interaction of two proteins normally present in the brain. One of the proteins is an enzyme called alkaline ribonuclease, whose function is to break down RNA as part of the normal protein turnover process. The other protein is called the inhibitor of alkaline ribonculease. The inhibitor controls activity of alkaline ribonuclease by depressing its action to break down RNA. Under conditions of normal protein balance, the inhibitor activity is high and the ribonuclease activity is low. But Dr. Marotta found that in the Alzheimer cases his team studied, the activity of the inhibitor was very low and sometimes nonexistent. Thus, the alkaline ribonuclease activity was high. In effect, Dr. Marotta concluded, the Alzheimer brain loses control over its normal protein-making activities because of the overactivity of the enzyme. As a result, the ribonuclease is unchecked, free to destroy RNA, thus leading to decreased protein synthesis in the areas of the brain damaged by Alzheimer's disease. Although Dr. Marotta said he had detected a basic biological defect, he did not know if it was the cause of Alzheimer's disease or simply something that went wrong as a result of the condition. He said determining what was cause and what effect ''would be very difficult to do.'' However, he noted that French researchers working independently and using a technique known as PET scanning, or positron emission tomography, had confirmed the results of the autopsy findings from studies on living people with Alzheimer's. Both Dr. Marotta's team and the French researchers found that the Alzheimer brain made little more than half the normal amounts of protein. Dr. Marotta said researchers elsewhere had adopted his method to study other brain disorders. One group at the Neurological Institute in London, he said, has studied the genetic disorder Down's syndrome. The aim was to learn more about the brain function of older Down's syndrome victims who also develop a condition that resembles Alzheimer's disease.

T. Guthrie Speers, 93, A Presbyterian Pastor The Rev. Dr. T. Guthrie Speers, who served at the First Presbyterian Church in New York City with the Rev. Harry Emerson Fosdick, died Wednesday in the Greater Baltimore Medical Center. He was 93 years old and lived in Baltimore. Dr. Speers, a graduate of Princeton University and Union Theological Seminary and a member of Phi Beta Kappa, began his ministry with The New York University Place Church. He also served as associate pastor at the First Presbyterian Church for eight years, with the Rev. Dr. George Alexander and Mr. Fosdick, who went on to become pastor of The Riverside Church. In 1928 he was called to Brown's Memorial Presbyterian Church in Baltimore as senior pastor, where he remained until he retired in 1957. He is survived by a son, the Rev. T. Guthrie Speers Jr., minister of the First Presbyterian Church of New Caanan, Conn., and four grandchildren.

1358-> BEIRUT TOLL APPARENTLY CURTAILED BY BRITISH AMBASSADOR'S GUARDS; THEY MAY HAVE KILLED TERRORIST SHORT OF GOAL- TOLL IS DISPUTED
The United States Embassy, which was devastated Thursday by a car bomb, appears to have been saved from total destruction and greater loss of life by the chance presence of bodyguards assigned to the British Ambassador. Initial reconstructions of the attack indicated today that the bodyguards may have killed or at least disabled the suicide car driver before he could reach his goal. The vehicle, packed with what the police estimated was 385 pounds of explosives, raced through the defenses of the new embassy compound in the Christian suburb of Aukar and blew up in front of the building, ripping off its facade and scattering debris for hundreds of yards. It was the third nearly identical attack on American installations here in 17 months. Confusion Over Toll Officials said the car bomber was killed or disabled before he could reach a driveway leading underneath the embassy, where an explosion could have caused the building to collapse. There was confusion over the casualty toll today. The Lebanese Red Cross and Lebanese Civil Defense, who are in charge of rescue operations, were said by radio stations of all political and religious persuasions to have put the number of dead at 24. The American Embassy said eight people were killed. (Page 4.) David Winn, the embassy political officer, told reporters at the scene Thursday that there were roughly 40 people in the building, perhaps more, depending on how many Lebanese were waiting for visas. About 25 to 30 Americans are here now, not counting military trainers, embassy officials say. Officials reconstructing the events cautioned that the task was made difficult by the inevitable discrepancies in the accounts of witnesses in a frightening, fast-moving event and by the fact that many of those closest to the car bomber were killed or wounded. ''There are about 15 versions of what happened,'' one official said. Diplomatic Plates on Van Officials - Americans, Lebanese and others - reconstructing the attack believe it happened this way: The vehicle, now identified as a tan paneled van, possibly a Dodge similar in appearance to those used by the American Embassy, drove up the steep, twisting road to the compound from the sea, first passing by a checkpoint. It is not clear what happened at the checkpoint. There were reports that the van was one stolen from the American Embassy section in mostly Moslem West Beirut. It bore diplomatic plates, either stolen or forged. The car then turned around, positioning itself so that it approached the first of three sets of waist-high concrete cubes known as dragon's teeth at an angle. The dragon's teeth form a barricade that force a driver to go in a slow, sharp S-curve. Lebanese security guards, former militiamen hired and trained by the Americans, are on duty in front of and around the dragon's teeth at both the building in Aukar, a predominantly Christian suburb of East Beirut, and at the West Beirut building. In Aukar, they are former Phalangists; in West Beirut, they are former Druse and Shiite militiamen. Killing of Guard Discounted Although the guards are supposed to stop and question all people attempting to drive into the embassy, diplomats say it was common practice for cars with diplomatic plates to be waved through with a smile. Officials discounted reports that the car bomber shot and killed one of the guards at the dragon's teeth entrance point. Instead, according to the reconstruction, the van hesitated as it came to the first of the barricades as though about to stop. But it kept on rolling and the surprised guards shouted at it to halt. One guard in front of the van was knocked to the side, then began pounding on it as it went by, shouting, ''Stop, stop, stop!'' The guards, apparently uncertain because of the diplomatic plates, were said to have hesitated, then shot into the air and then at the van itself after it had passed. Britons in Parking Lot Two Lebanese guards walking on the roadway leading toward the embassy, one about 10 yards past the dragon's teeth and one about 50 yards away, opened fire at the oncoming van, which sped past them. In a parking lot up a slight hill to the left of the speeding van, about four bodyguards of the British Ambassador, David Miers, were waiting by his specially reinforced and armored Minster limousine and the Land-Rover they use as a following car. Mr. Miers was visiting the American Ambassador, Reginald Bartholomew, at the time of the attack. The British guards, believed to be members of the elite Special Air Service commando unit, opened fire with their machine pistols. It was these guards, according to Western diplomatic sources, who are presumed to have killed the suicide car bomber. At least one of the highly trained and experienced British bodyguards is certain that he hit the driver and saw him slump over in his seat. The van then careered into a parked truck on the right side of the road, bounced off and exploded. It left a crater more than six feet deep. Seconds before the van exploded, the embassy's chief security officer, Al Bigelar, charged out of the front door of the building toward it. Mr. Bigelar was thrown about 20 yards backward into the building by the explosion and is hospitalized with head wounds. He is the most seriously wounded of the four Americans with major injuries. Because he has not been able to talk, it is not known whether he was able to shoot at the van before it exploded. As far as can be determined, American Marine guards at the embassy did not shoot at the van. In normal embassy deployment, the marines are on duty inside the building and local guards outside. Driveway Under Building If the van had been able to continue to the end of the building and make a left turn, it would have entered a driveway that runs beneath the building. A car bomb going off in such a space would probably bring down the building, trapping all those inside in the wreckage. The destructive impact of the truck bombing of the American Marine compound last Oct. 23, in which 241 servicemen were killed, came largely, experts say, because the truck got under the building. The old American Embassy in West Beirut was destroyed by a suicide truck bomber on April 18, 1983, with the loss of 63 lives, including 17 Americans. After that, the American diplomats shared cramped quarters in the British Embassy. The embassy moved most of its operations and American personnel to East Beirut for safety last July. Despite the previous bombings and the precautions now taken, security has been noticeably lax. Although it has been occupied since mid-July, workmen in the West Beirut building were still installing the antirocket steel netting on the roof this morning. And although American journalists who live in surrounding buildings have pointed out repeatedly to American officials that the embassy lies under an unprotected bluff and hillside that is an ideal vantage point for attack, it was not until this afternoon that the embassy asked the Lebanese Army Sixth Brigade to post an armored personnel carrier on the hill.

1359-> A CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION ON 102D
When Ralph Samuel Townsend built his two-story brick and sandstone house on West End Avenue in 1884, it was the first private home on the street. A hundred years and dozens of dwellers later, the house is dwarfed by the apartment buildings around it, but it survives. Next Sunday, the current owners of the house - now two stories taller and situated around the corner on 102d Street between West End and Riverside Drive - will celebrate its centennial at a block party with birthday cake and champagne. ''It's such a lovely little house,'' said Marilyn Buckland, a board member of the 102d-103d Streets Block Association, which is organizing the party. ''We decided we should really do something.'' The idea for the celebration goes back to 1978, when the four owners of the cooperative at 302 West 102d Street commissioned Christopher Gray, the architectural historian, to write its history. Using city records and the original blueprints, Mr. Gray found that Townsend, an architect whose work includes the Kenilworth apartments on Central Park West at 75th Street, had designed the house as his personal residence. Nine years after it was built, another owner moved the house from its orginal location on the west side of West End Avenue around the corner to 102d Street. In the process, the building was raised, putting the former basement at street level, and a fourth story with a mansard roof and dormer windows was added. Over the years, the house passed to a variety of owners, including the New York Public Library. It was eventually converted to four apartments, one on each floor, and went cooperative in 1954. ''After we had the history done, we talked about how we should really throw ourselves a party,'' said Margaret Ryan, a social worker who has owned the fourth-floor apartment since 1977. ''Then the block association called us and offered to do it. They're getting a plaque to go on the building, and they got permission from the city to close off the street for two hours. All the neighbors are asked to bring picnic baskets and we'll share the food.'' The party is not the first of its kind in the neighborhood, which residents say has the feel of a small town. Two years ago, the block association held a party for 316 West 103d Street, the town house where George and Ira Gershwin lived from 1925 to 1931. ''We're trying to keep track of all the buildings now so that we can watch and have a little celebration when they come a hundred years old,'' Miss Buckland said. Mr. Gray described the Townsend house as Victorian Gothic or Queen Anne in style and said there were no older structures originally built as private homes on the Upper West Side. He said it was the only existing masonry building in the city to have been moved from its original site. ''It's bizarre,'' he said. ''Frame buildings are moved - that's not all that remarkable. But I don't know of any other masonry building surviving in Manhattan that has been moved.'' MR. GRAY said the house was apparently moved because contemporary building regulations, which permitted higher buildings on avenues than on side streets, made the West End site more valuable. Miss Ryan said she wished there were more information about the history of her century-old building. ''I wish we had more details about who lived here, because it's pretty spotty,'' she said. ''I would love to have ghosts if I could build a fantasy around some names.'' William Esbit, a real estate broker who bought the ground-floor apartment in 1973 and now uses it as an office, said residents of the neighborhood had told him stories of gangsters holed up in the building during the Prohibition era. He said one man had tried to point out bullet holes in the facade. Whatever its past, Mr. Esbit said he is sure the building has a long history ahead. ''This building will outlive me and everybody I know around me,'' Mr. Esbit said. ''All I can say is I wish they built buildings now as well as they did then.''

1361-> FORMER JACKSON AIDE INDICTED
A Cuyahoga County Grand Jury today indicted Arnold R. Pinkney, former manager for the Rev. Jesse Jackson's Presidential campaign, on four counts of having an unlawful interest in a public contract. The indictments stem from business dealings between Mr. Pinkney's insurance agency and two Cleveland businessmenn, Gilbert Singerman and Joseph LoConti, who negotiated a lease for a warehouse with the Cleveland- Cuyahoga County Port Authority while Mr. Pinkney was a member. According to the indictment, Mr. Pinkney voted for the lease and later received $40,000 to $50,000 in commissions on insurance he sold to Mr. Singerman and Mr. LoConti's company. The indictments also involve insurance that Mr. Pinkney's agency sold the port authority while he was a member. Two of the charges are felonies. Conviction could bring a prison term and would mean Mr. Pinkney would forfeit his seat on the Ohio Building Authority, to which he was appointed earlier this year by Gov. Richard F. Celeste. Articles by The Cleveland Plain Dealer that questioned Mr. Pinkney's business dealings led to the investigation by the county prosecutor, John T. Corrigan. Mr. Pinkney reaffirmed his innocence Wednesday in an interview with The Plain Dealer. Mr. Pinkney, a native of Youngstown, has been one of Cleveland's leaders since he came here in the late 1950's. He was an assistant to former Mayor Carl B. Stokes and ran unsuccessfully for Mayor in 1971 and 1975. He was also President of the Cleveland Board of Education.

1366-> Roosevelt and Churchill
To the Editor: I was surprised to read in Alistair Horne's review of ''Churchill & Roosevelt: The Complete Correspondence'' (Oct. 21) a quotation supposedly gleaned from the work in which the author is quoted as saying: ''It is hard to imagine any resuscitation of the British-American partnership if Churchill had lived.'' (Emphasis added.) The text of the book, however, correctly states, ''if Roosevelt had lived.'' In the next sentence, moreover, Mr. Horne muses on how cold war history might have altered had Truman succeeded Roosevelt in 1944. Truman was the junior Senator from Missouri in 1944, not having been inaugurated as Vice President until Jan. 20, 1945. Had Roosevelt died in 1944, Henry Wallace, whose capacity to stand up to Stalin is more doubtful than F.D.R.'s, would have become President. The speculation is simply irrelevant. FREDERICK L. WHITMERMorristown, N.J.

1367-> Oil and Supplies
To the Editor: ''Reshaping O.E.C.D.'s Oil-Sharing Plan,'' (Nov. 4) is based on a fundamental misconception about the role of the International Energy Agency in an oil-supply emergency. The authors wrongly state that the governing board of the I.E.A. ''would determine price through a weighted voting system that favors crude-poor countries.'' On the contrary. Article 10 of the agreement on an international energy program clearly states that in insuring fair treatment for all participating countries, the price for allocated oil shall be based on ''the price conditions prevailing for comparable commercial transactions.'' Clearly, nobody knows today what commercial prices would be during an emergency. What is certain is that the I.E.A. member governments intend that allocated oil should not be paid for at artificial prices. I.E.A. actions and concerns in an oil supply emergency include alleviating physical shortages and its economic consequences. This may be done by restraining demand, sharing available supplies, and drawing down stocks. We are confident that the system will perform if it is needed. The I.E.A. has a weighted voting system to govern its activities. The weights are based on prior oil consumption, not on available supply during an emergency. For the purpose of voting, the authors' concept of ''crude-rich'' or ''crude-poor'' is irrelevant. LIONEL WALSH Head of Public Information International Energy Agency

1368-> HOW THE POLL WAS DONE
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Oct. 31 to Nov. 3 with 2,875 adults around the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii, of whom 2,075 indicated they were registered to vote. The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were chosen so as to insure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted residential numbers. The results have been weighted to take account of household size and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region, race, sex, age and education. The findings are reported in terms of an overall ''probable electorate,'' which uses responses to questions dealing with voter registration, past voting history and likelihood of voting in 1984 as a measure of the probability of particular respondents' voting in November. In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on samples of such a size will differ by no more than two percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by interviewing all adult Americans registered to vote. The error for smaller subgroups is larger. For example, the margin of sampling error for men or women voters is plus or minus three percentage points. In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Assisting The Times in its 1984 polling is Helmut Norpoth, associate professor of political science at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.

1371-> IN IOWA, A NEGATIVE SENATE CAMPAIGN
Like many Iowans, Wendell Watson, who raises cattle, deplores the quality of the campaign for the United States Senate in this state. ''There are too many half truths,'' said Mr. Watson, who used to work at John Deere, the farm machine company that laid off more than half its 12,000 employes in the last four years. ''Each candidate picks out the worst thing about his opponent.'' This is a year of negative campaigning in Senate races from North Carolina to Texas. Voters in Iowa say they have never seen such mudslinging. Although such tactics are publicly deplored by both candidates, both campaigns acknowledge that the negative strategy appears to work. Last summer Senator Roger W. Jepsen, a 55-year-old Republican seeking a second term, trailed his opponent, Representative Tom Harkin, 44, by as much as 17 percentage points in The Des Moines Register's Iowa poll. Then Mr. Jepsen began personal attacks on Mr. Harkin, 'Have You No Honor at All?' The Senator's attacks culminated in a television debate Monday evening when he called the Congressman a liar. A new Jepsen television commercial berates Mr. Harkin for accusing the Senator of seeking to cut Social Security benefits. ''Have you no decency, Mr. Harkin?'' an older person asks. ''Have you no honor at all?'' Similarly, Mr. Harkin was nine points behind the Senator last month before he initiated negative television commercials. He swiftly moved to a five-point lead in the seesaw battle. One commercial shows Mr. Jepsen sweating profusely, while another shows a hog snorting loudly while an announcer intones, ''When two Iowa farmers drove a tractor all the way to Washington to talk to him about farm debt, Roger Jepsen fell asleep.'' Senator Jepsen justifies his negative campaign by saying Mr. Harkin is a ''liberal activist'' in Washington who masquerades at home as a conservative. The Senator attacks his opponent as free-spending, soft on defense and pro-abortion, and accuses him of selling out the interests of Iowans in his support of legislation requiring a portion of domestic content in the manufacture of certain goods and his opposition to nitrites used to preserve meats. Mr. Harkin accuses Mr. Jepsen of being ''the biggest-spending Senator in Iowa's history,'' voting for ''every gold-plated Tinker Toy that the Pentagon and defense contractors have ever wanted.'' Personal Character as an Issue The personal character of the two candidates may be the sleeper issue of this campaign. Mr. Harkin's campaign slogan, ''A Senator Iowans can be proud of,'' is a veiled reference to Mr. Jepsen's personal difficulties. The most publicized was the Senator's membership, early in 1977, in Leisure Spa Ltd., a Des Moines brothel patronized by some of the state's political and business leaders before it was closed by the police. The incident occurred before Mr. Jepsen became a ''born again'' Christian and initiated his successful senatorial campaign. Mr. Harkin will not discuss the Leisure Spa incident, but he says a candidate's character is always an issue in a political campaign. He also said, ''The most important thing that a Senator or Congressman can have in Washington, D.C., is the ability to keep his word,'' noting that Senator Jepsen had led and then abandoned opposition to the sale of AWACs planes to Saudi Arabia, and had changed positions on a dairy bill. The Senator replied, ''My word and my relationship with my peers and colleagues is a matter of record.'' Mr. Harkin, who was quoted as having said that he flew ''combat air patrols'' in the Vietnam War, was accused by Senator Barry Goldwater, Republican of Arizona, of having fabricated his combat record. The Congressman acknowledged that he actually flew planes from Vietnam to Japan for repairs. Shirttail Factor Ruled Out Mr. Jepsen had to explain his war record, too. Although he once said he was a paratrooper in World War II, he did not enter the service until 1946, a year after the war ended. He replied that the Veterans Administration considered the war as having been ''technically ended in 1946.'' Unlike other states with close Senate races in which President Reagan's lead could provide shirttails for Republican candidates, the President leads his Democratic opponent, Walter F. Mondale, by less than 10 percentage points in Iowa, primarily because of the depressed farm economy. Moreover, unlike many other campaigns in which the Democratic candidate does not identify himself with the top of the ticket, Mr. Mondale and his running mate, Geraldine A. Ferraro, have campaigned in Iowa in behalf of Mr. Harkin, while Mr. Reagan and Vice President Bush have campaigned for Mr. Jepsen. Both senatorial candidates have spent about $2 million. ''It's a very tight race, a neck-and-neck race,'' said Rolf C. Croft, the state Republican chairman. ''It's going to go down to the wire.''

1372-> VIETNAM AIDE SAYS POLITICS CAME UP AT TALKS ON ENEMY STRENGTH
Under relentless cross-examination, a witness for Gen. William C. Westmoreland in his libel suit against CBS testified yesterday that political and public relations concerns had been injected into a high-level 1967 discussion on enemy troop strength in South Vietnam. But the witness, Brig. Gen. George A. Godding, denied that these concerns had influenced his presentation of figures on enemy troop strength as General Westmoreland's chief delegate to a conference that year at Central Intelligence Agency headquarters in Langley, Va. David Boies, the CBS attorney - drenched with sweat as he pressed his interrogation - elicited further acknowledgements from General Godding: - That contrary to General Westmoreland's decision, he believed that Vietcong self-defense and secret self- defense forces should have been counted and their numbers made known to American troops. - That while those forces were no longer counted ''when they were alive,'' they were sometimes numbered among enemy casualties, thus reducing the size of the enemy in official statistics. - That wide distribution was given a 1967 report that said the enemy was losing more forces than it could replace. Rapid Cross-Examination Typical of Mr. Boies's rapid-fire cross-examination, which was tougher than at any time previously during the trial, was an exchange that followed General Godding's admission that he did not know how many of the enemy's self-defense and secret self-defense forces were armed. Q. Do you know approximately? A. Somewhere around 10 percent. Q. Is that based on any study you have ever seen, sir? A. No. Q. Have you ever talked to anyone who told you that? A. No. But in combat, in a similar situation, very few of the old men, women and children were armed and I went through the European war. Q. Are you saying that you are basing your answer on what you saw in the European war, sir? A. That is one I am drawing on, yes. Q. Was the European war a guerrilla conflict, sir? A. It was not. But General Godding, who was director of intelligence production in Vietnam for seven months in 1967, likened the Vietcong self-defense forces to elements of the German home guard. 'Made Aware' of Concerns On the stand in Federal District Court in Manhattan, General Godding testified that political concerns should not have been an element of official discussions of the size and capabilities of the enemy. But he said that while serving as General Westmoreland's chief delegate to the August 1967 conference at the C.I.A. headquarters in Virginia, he was ''made aware'' of those concerns by his superiors. The 1982 CBS Reports documentary that led to General Westmoreland's $120 million libel suit maintained that the military command in Saigon had imposed an arbitrary ceiling of 300,000 on enemy strength in 1967 to give the appearance that the United States was winning the war. Between May and August 1967, the official military listing known as the order of battle carried enemy strength at a total of 297,000: 120,400 regular North Vietnamese and Vietcong troops; 24,800 administrative personnel; 39,000 political cadre, and 112,800 irregulars - including about 70,000 self-defense and secret self-defense forces who planted mines, set booby traps and served as ''fifth columnists.'' In May, however, General Westmoreland's chief of intelligence, Maj. Gen. Joseph A. McChristian, had concluded that the political cadre, the guerrillas and the self-defense and secret self-defense forces had been heavily underestimated. The self-defense and secret self-defense forces alone, he said before his departure from Vietnam in June 1967, were in the neighborhood of 117,000. C.I.A. Sought Estimate Around this time, the C.I.A. decided to prepare for President Johnson a special national intelligence estimate on enemy strength, which would also affect the figure in the order of battle. And the August meeting attended by General Godding was intended to set a figure on which the C.I.A., General Westmoreland's command, and other intelligence agencies could agree. But a dispute arose because General Westmoreland wanted to eliminate from the order of battle a figure for self-defense and secret self-defense forces - he said they lacked offensive combat capability - and some C.I.A. officials wanted to include an even higher figure for them than General McChristian had arrived at. Moreover, the C.I.A. wanted to include in the total as many as 90,000 political cadre, while General Westmoreland wanted that category enumerated but not continued as part of the order of battle total. At the Langley conference, which did not resolve the dispute, the total advanced by General Godding was 298,000, perhaps 200,000 less than the total sought then by the C.I.A. Last Thursday, on his direct testimony, General Godding said he had taken the military's ''best estimates'' to the conference. And he adhered to that position yesterday. Showed Deposition But Mr. Boies showed him a deposition he made last year in which he said he was unaware before the Langley conference of a dispute over the figure to be included in the order of battle and the estimate for the President. At another point in his deposition, General Godding said that no one had told him of ''political or public relations aspects'' surrounding the figure either before, during, or after the Langley meeting. General Godding, who completed his testimony yesterday and will be followed by Everette S. Parkins, a former military intelligence officer in Vietnam, said he had been mistaken in the deposition. The general now said he had received no ''political or presentational restrictions or guidance'' from General Westmoreland or anyone else before the meeting. But once he was at Langley, Gen. Phillip B. Davidson Jr., who had succeeded General McChristian as chief of intelligence, had alerted him to such concerns. General Davidson, he said, had also vetoed his request that the military negotiate a range for enemy strength rather than a single figure. General Godding acknowledged that General Davidson had sent him a cable at Langley saying that a figure of 420,000, including the self-defense and secret self-defense forces, had ''surfaced'' in Saigon and ''stunned the Embassy and this headquarters'' and was completely ''unacceptable.'' The cable said the military would ''not accept'' a total in excess of the one then ''carried by the press'' - 297,000. Mr. Boies closed in on the witness, his voice rising. Q. Did you understand that it was your obligation and the obligation of others to come up with your best estimate? A. Yes. Q. Did you understand that it was your obligation and the obligation of others to come up with your best estimate unaffected by political or public relations concerns? A. That's correct. Mr. Boies then showed General Godding a July 1967 cable from George A. Carver, the chief of Vietnamese affairs for the C.I.A., to Richard Helms, the director of Central Intelligence. In the newly declassified cable, which concerned a possible accord on an enemy strength figure, Mr. Carver said General Davidson's ''chief problem was political and presentational one of coming out with brand new set of figures showing much larger Communist force at time when press knew'' that General Westmoreland was seeking more troops. ''You see that?'' Mr. Boies said. ''I do,'' said General Godding, still insisting that, whatever had passed between General Davidson and Mr. Carver, he was unaware of it before August. On redirect examination, General Godding said that General Westmoreland had never instructed him to consider press or public relations concerns in determining intelligence estimates, nor had they governed his actions. To Mr. Boies, on recross examination, he said that ''the political impact and the press impact'' were things for General Westmoreland, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the C.I.A. ''to handle. That was not my problem.''

1373-> ST. JOHN'S RALLIES TO UPSET HOFSTRA
After trailing by 16-0 in the second period, St. John's rallied behind Mike Burrell, its quarterback, and upset previously undefeated Hofstra, 19-16, yesterday at Hofstra Stadium in Hempstead, L.I. The defeat left the Flying Dutchmen, ranked fifth in the nation in Division III of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, with a 9-1 record. St. John's, which had lost its first two games, is 8-2 and in contention for a bid to the Eastern College Athletic Conference playoffs. The picture for the N.C.A.A. Eastern Regional playoffs is not as clear as a result of yesterday's results. In addition to Hofstra being upset, Union College (9-1), No. 2 in the country in Division III, was upset by Hamilton. Plymouth State (10-0), an easy winner over Curry, and Ithaca (9-1), which defeated the Merchant Marine Academy, are the other contenders. In yesterday's game, Burrell completed 19 of 37 passes for 200 yards. He connected on a 19-yard pass to Jim Weisenburger and a 2-yarder to Tony Sas for the game winner in the third period. Burrell also plunged into the end zone from the 1-yard line. Montclair State 34, Glassboro State 7 - Walter Briggs threw three touchdown passes, two for 19 and 6 yards to Jim Paulsen, as the Indians (7-3, 6-0) won the New Jersey State title. Ithaca 24, Merchant Marine 10 - After the Mariners took a 10-0 lead, Steve Kass ran for two second- quarter touchdowns of 1-yard each. Chris Fiore of the Mariners (6-2-1) rushed for 115 yards on 23 carries and scored on a 1-yard pass from Skip Azzarita. Wagner 40, Kean 13 - Troy Jemison sprinted 39 and 5 yards for touchdowns and wound up with 106 yards in a dozen carries as the Seahawks finished with a 6-4 record. Tony Fischetti of Kean (5-4-1) passed for a touchdown and ran for another. Fordham 21, Pace 0 - Chip Kron scored on runs of 1 and 49 yards and finished with 151 in 36 carries. He wound up with 1,263 yards to set a Rams one-season rushing record. Ramapo 19 Trenton State 17 - The Roadrunners (5-3-1), who trailed, 9-0, at halftime, held the visitors to minus 29 yards rushing. Tim Cummings threw a pair of touchdown passes. Southern Connecticut 49, William Paterson 16 - Jim Sirignano tossed touchdown passes of 53 and 7 yards to Travis Tucker, and Mike Newton scored on runs of 5 and 19 yards as the Owls raised their record to 6-3 with one game to play.

1374-> JAMES PETRILLO DEAD; LED MUSICIANS
James C. Petrillo, a colorful, combative man who as president of the American Federation of Musicians exercised immense authority in the American music world, died Tuesday at the age of 92. Mr. Petrillo died at St. Joseph Hospital in Chicago, his home, after suffering a stroke earlier this month. A round-faced, bespectacled man, he was one of the most controversial and best known of the nation's labor leaders. His most noted fight came in World War II, when he defied President Roosevelt - music was regarded as important to national morale - by calling a strike against recording companies to protest a lack of royalties to musicians. Mr. Petrillo won that bitter strike with the record companies agreeing to establish a royalty fund with contributions from each record sold. It Provides Free Concerts The fund continues today, providing free concerts across the country for public events, schools, hospitals and settlement houses. The union says it is one of the nation's largest providers of musicians' jobs. The fight by Mr. Petrillo is still regarded in the American labor today as a watershed effort to protect a measure of gains from new technologies for workers. Mr. Petrillo for years held immense power in New York because of the city's importance in the nation's music and dramatic life: he could put a musical show or night club on the union's ''unfair'' list and prevent union members from playing there. Victor W. Fuentealba, now the union's president, says: ''If you stop the average man on the street and ask him who is president of the American Federation of Musicians, he'll say James C. Petrillo, he got that much publicity.'' In Mr. Petrillo's heydey, radio listeners were often reminded when, at the end of radio broadcasts a voice said the music was provided through the cooperation of the American Federation of Musicians, ''James C. Petrillo, president.'' He Played Duet With Truman Mr. Petrillo once engaged in a duet at a union convention with President Truman, Mr. Petrillo on trumpet and Mr. Truman on piano. ''We played 'The Gang's All Here,'' Mr. Petrillo said. ''Truman played in one key. I played in another, and the delegates were falling on the floor laughing.'' A man of many idiosyncracies, Mr. Petrillo was phobic about germs, and shook hands gingerly, with a curled little finger. Mr. Petrillo was born March 16, 1892, the son of a Chicago sewer digger who had emigrated from Italy. His middle name was Caesar and he was later often called the ''Caesar'' of the music world. He began playing music when he was 8 years old, using a trumpet his father bought for $24. He played at Hull House, the settlement house founded by Jane Addams, and with Wild West shows, wearing chaps and a cowboy hat. He Formed a Band He left school for work at the age of 14, driving a horse and wagon for an express company and working as a railroad sandwich vendor. He also continued his music, forming a four-piece band known as Petrillo's. In 1918, he joined Local 10 of the American Federation of Musicians, and was elected local president in 1922. He continued as president of Local 10 for 40 years. These were often difficult times for musicians. Prohibition threw hundreds of cabaret and saloon musicians out of work. And many musicians opposed unions. ''They thought they were artists,'' Mr. Petrillo said with scorn. But Mr. Petrillo, quick to ''pull the boys'' when he thought a strike would be useful, built Local 10 into a strong, tightly disciplined, organization, and many people feared to tangle with him. Elected Chief in 1940 Mr. Petrillo was elected president of the American Federation of Musicians in 1940, a time of change because of new technologies. Talking pictures had thrown thousands of theater musicians out of work, and juke boxes and radio stations played recordings, or ''canned music,'' costing the jobs of studio musicians. He took his biggest step in 1942, taking union musicians out of the nation's recording studios and demanding a royalty on every record sold. President Roosevelt asked Mr. Petrillo to relent and an end of the strike was ordered by the War Production Board. Mr. Petrillo refused. After 27 months, the big record companies gave in and agreed to pay royalites of 1 cent to 2 1/2 cents per record to the union; a 10-inch 78 revolutions-per-minute popular record then cost about 50 cents retail. The royalty fund, with royalties varying over the years, is called the Music Performance Trust Fund and is ''his legacy to the nation's music world,'' Mr. Fuentealba said. Broadcasters were incensed by Mr. Petrillo and pressed Congress to act against him. Congress passed the Lea Act, or the ''anti-Petrillo'' law, which forbid the hiring of musicians to stand by while recordings were played, or other acts that could be regarded as coercive. He Organized Orchestras Mr. Petrillo was always a vigorous organizer, bringing, for example, a number of large symphony orchestras into his union and with them classical artists. ''They're mine,'' Mr. Petrillo said. ''What's the difference betweeen Heifetz and a fiddler in a tavern?'' A highly paid union leader, Mr. Petrillo came to enjoy luxury, wearing expensive shoes, shirts and double- breasted suits. When he was in New York he lived at the Waldorf-Astoria, and maintained a summer home, a gift from his union, on Lake Geneva in Wisconsin. In 1958, facing a revolt by some Los Angeles union members, who believed his policies were blocking jobs in television, and believing that new labor laws necessitated more polished, educated labor leaders, Mr. Petrillo resigned the union presidency but remained on the board for a while. In retirement, he worked to end the segregation that existed in some union cities, with musicians often segregated into black and white locals. Mr. Petrillo suffered a stroke on Oct. 9 and underwent treatment for cancer while in the hospital. He is survived by two sons, James and Lee, and a daughter, Marie De Rosa. .

1375-> LETTERS TO THE WESTCHESTER EDITOR
On Volunteer Needs Of the Red Cross It was interesting to note in the article, ''Some Opportunities for the Volunteer'' (Oct. 23), that no mention was made of the American Red Cross. The Westchester County Chapter of the American Red Cross has an ongoing need for volunteers in almost every service. Receptionists and console operators are needed to answer the phone and direct calls to the proper offices, as well as to greet visitors to the chapter; also drivers to deliver urgently needed blood to area hospitals and take shut-ins to medical appointments; Bloodmobile aides to assist at bloodmobile sites throughout the county (must have own transportation). Instructors are needed to teach all First Aid and Water Safety courses. Disaster volunteers will be trained in all forms of casework, shelter management, mass feeding and damage assessment. All are needed to keep ''Red Cross Ready.'' In addition, the American Red Cross has a Westchester High School Student Council with representatives from schools throughout the county. The council meets to provide, promote and participate in community service volunteer programs.

1376-> Miss Murphy to Wed Glen D. MacGillivray
Announcement has been made by Mr. and Mrs. Joseph M. Murphy of Scarsdale, N.Y., of the engagement of their daughter Patricia Ann Murphy to Glen Donald MacGillivray, the son of Mr. and Mrs. Donald C. MacGillivray, also of Scarsdale.

1377-> A CONSERVATIVE WITNESS
Lieut. Gen. Daniel O. Graham, who took the stand in the CBS-Westmoreland trial today, has been associated since his retirement from the Army with several conservative organizations. General Graham, whose book, ''A New Strategy for the West,'' was published by the conservative Heritage Foundation, now heads an a nonprofit corporation called ''High Frontier'' that is attempting to promote a space-based defense system. Although General Graham defends the Reagan Administration's so- called ''Star Wars'' plan to put missile defenses in outer space, he believes the plan can be developed more quickly. The Adminstration's plan is to develop interception methods that are still far in the future. But High Frontier says it is plausible to use ''off the shelf'' technology to create a reasonably effective immediate defense against ballistic missiles. General Graham, who spent most of his career as an intelligence officer, was a colonel in Vietnam in 1967 and 1968. He went on to attain the rank of lieutenant general and to become the chief of the Defense Intellligence Agency, He left in 1976 when one of his mentors, James R. Schlesinger, resigned as Secretary of Defense. General Graham told friends he felt strongly associated with Mr. Schlesinger and believed he should step down with his chief. General Graham testified against the second treaty on the limitation of strategic weapons, in 1979, along with other conservative retired officers, calling it an unequal and nonverifiable treaty. He has spent the years since his resignation in positions with several conservative think tanks.

1378-> 2 NUCLEAR ARMS RACES IN THIRD WORLD FEARED
A specialist on the spread of nuclear weapons cautioned today that India and Pakistan as well as Argentina and Brazil might be on the verge of engaging in nuclear arms races that would stimulate the spread of such weapons elsewhere. Leonard S. Spector, who helped write the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 1978 when he was chief counsel of the Senate Subcommittee on Energy and Nuclear Proliferation, says in a book published today, ''Pakistan and India may be poised on the brink of a major nuclear arms race.'' Mr. Spector, who is at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a research organization here, said that ''Argentina and Brazil pose the only serious risks of proliferation in Latin America'' and that nuclear competition between them ''appeared to be intensifying.'' Mr. Spector said China had been active in spreading the technology and materials of nuclear arms, Libya had been trying to acquire nuclear weapons and South Africa might have built 15 to 25 nuclear weapons. ''Despite unrelenting turmoil in the Middle East,'' Mr. Spector said, ''the danger of further nuclear proliferation in the region appears to have receded, at least temporarily.'' He said that was partly because of Israel's destruction of an Iraqi reactor in a 1981 air raid. State Department officials said they had not studied Mr. Spector's book but cast doubt on the likelihood of the nuclear arms races he mentioned. One official said: ''At this time, Pakistan does not have the capability to manufacture nuclear weapons. India, if it has the capability, has made a political decision not to do so.'' Officials concerned with Latin American affairs declined to comment on Argentine or Brazilian capacities. The officials also noted that Secretary of State George P. Shultz was scheduled to discuss the Administration policy on the spread of nuclear arms in an address to the United States Association for the United Nations at the New York Hilton Hotel on Thursday. The Carnegie Endowment said that Mr. Spector's book, called ''Nuclear Proliferation Today,'' was the first of what would be annual reports on the issue. The project was paid for by the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. In a briefing for reporters at the Carnegie Endowment this morning, Mr. Spector asserted that a nation could build a reliable nuclear weapon without testing it, given modern computer simulations and help from other nations. From mid-1983 to mid-1984, the period covered in his book, Mr. Spector said, Pakistan ''may have acquired the capability for manufacturing nuclear weapons.'' He cited technical aid from China, financial help from Libya and Pakistan's announcement in February that it could produce enriched uranium, which is used in nuclear weapons. In Latin America, Mr. Spector said, Argentina and Brazil have refused to renounce nuclear arms and have rejected requests that they submit to international safeguards. ''Today, Argentina is possibly five years ahead of its northern rival and can probably achieve a nuclear weapons capability in the next several years if it diligently pursues its present course,'' he said. ''Brazil is unlikely to complete the requirements for building nuclear arms before the early 1990's.'' The reasons for the competition, Mr. Spector wrote, were not clear. On China, Mr. Spector said that it, ''alone among the nuclear supplier countries, is known to have sharply deviated from accepted norms for nuclear transfers by making unsafeguarded sales of nuclear materials'' to South Africa, Argentina, India and Pakistan. Mr. Spector said that Libya had been eager to acquire nuclear weapons and that while that capacity had not been reached, ''open nuclear assistance from Belgium, Argentina and the Soviet Union is helping Libya create a nuclear infrastructure.''

1379-> AROUND THE NATION; Illinois Governor Gets Mandatory Seat-Belt Bill
The Illinois Senate has approved legislation requiring drivers and front- seat passengers to buckle their seat belts or face a $25 fine. The bill was sent to Gov. James R. Thompson Wednesday. The measure, if signed, would take effect on July 1. The Senate vote was 32 to 26, two votes more it needed for passage. The Senate rejected the plan by one vote only two weeks ago. Mr. Thompson, a Republican, has not said whether he would sign the bill, which would make Illinois the third state in the nation with a mandatory seat belt law. New York and New Jersey are the other two states with seat- belt requirements. The automobile industry has lobbied heavily for the bill. It would be forced by Federal regulation to install costly air bags unless individual states approve seat belt legislation. The Federal Government has said it would require passive restraint systems unless states with two-thirds of the nation's population enact mandatory seat-belt laws before the end of the decade.

1380-> MUSIC TO MATCH THE BEAT IN EARLY SHEPARD
Alto saxophone in hand, Peter Jay Fernandez strides across the La Mama Theater's Great Jones Street rehearsal loft, declaiming ''The story of Niles, from the top!,'' a monologue by a character named Petrone in Sam Shepard's play ''Suicide in B-Flat.'' Jeremy Kahn punches out gospel- organ chords from his synthesizer, Stephen Mellor and Raul Aranas - as Louis and Pablo, the play's pair of philosopher-cops - snap their fingers, the director George Ferencz nods in time. Between phrases Max Roach, the master jazz drummer, responds ''Tell it! Tell it!'' as he might to a gospel preacher or a blues singer. This bit of impromptu music theater is the transition from lunch break back to rehearsal for ''Shepard Sets,'' a mini-festival of three Shepard plays. Mr. Ferencz's company will perform ''Suicide in B-flat'' (1976), ''Back Bog Beast Bait'' (1971) and ''Angel City'' (1976), which opens tonight, in repertory through Dec. 16 at La Mama. In most plays with background music, the composer presents the director with the score in time for the final technical rehearsals. Then, the musicians and lighting crews synchronize their work to the actors' performance. But for these three Shepard plays, Mr. Roach and four jazz musicians have been rehearsing with the actors for the last two weeks, eight hours a day - evolving the score in tandem with the rest of the performance. The jazz group includes the saxophonist and flutist Bobby Watson, an alumnus of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers; Curtis Lundy on bass, Eddie Allen on drums and Mr. Kahn on keyboards; Mr. Roach directs the group and occasionally plunks a mbira - an African thumb piano - or adds extra percussion. ''There's a sense of creating an ensemble using the jazz sensibility,'' Mr. Ferencz said, ''a sense that there are certain structures you work with and within those structures you have a certain amount of freedom.'' The three plays are steeped in music. In ''Angel City,'' a careening meditation on movies and art, the characters onstage include a saxophonist and a tympani player; in ''Back Bog Beast Beat,'' about a monster in the bayou, a character plays Cajun fiddle. ''Suicide in B-flat,'' subtitled ''A Mysterious Overture,'' revolves around the disappearance of Niles, a fictional jazz pianist and composer who is, Mr. Roach said, ''as phenomenal as Art Tatum, as profound as Charlie Parker, as strong as Miles Davis, as eccentric as Thelonious Monk.'' ''Music's there , it's part of the chemistry, the makeup of the piece,'' Mr. Ferencz said. ''The play sends out reverberations, and its images create resonances. In musical theater, so often what's musically behind the actors is redundant. It does the same thing they're doing and it supports them. A lot of times, the music in this production is counterpointing them, and that's tricky stuff; the idea is not to enhance the pieces, but to inform them, which is a different responsibility. But it makes wonderful theater dynamics.'' In 1979, Mr. Ferencz directed five Shepard plays at La Mama, including ''The Tooth of Crime,'' in which rock music was a consistent metaphor and backbeat. Since then his own tastes have moved in the direction of jazz, and his familiarity with Mr. Shepard's work led him to the three plays of ''Shepard Sets.'' ''The idea was to take a high entry point with the music,'' he said. ''I had to find someone who had a nice wide scope, a very strong understanding from the blues to something more abstract.'' Enter Max Roach, a major figure in the history of jazz drumming. Along with Kenny Clarke, he helped invent the light, precise attack that propelled be-bop, the foundation of modern jazz. Mr. Roach was first heard with the saxophonist Coleman Hawkins and in pioneering be-bop groups with Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Bud Powell and others. But he never typecast himself as a be-bop drummer. He has led his own groups through the years, among them a quintet with the trumpeter Clifford Brown and the all-percussion band M'Boom, and worked with such avant- garde musicians as the pianist Cecil Taylor and the saxophonist Anthony Braxton. He is also no stranger to the stage, having composed music for dances, movie soundtracks and theater scores. ''Max's presence wasn't just to compose the music,'' Mr. Ferencz said. ''It was his head I was after, in a way, to get an even closer understanding of where Sam was at. Sam was a drummer, and his father was also a drummer. Ellen Stewart of La Mama told me that Sam used to set up his drums and play through the night in La Mama's basement, then hit the typewriter. Sam's knowledge of music is strong, and I could not overestimate to what degree that worked its way into the sensibility of these particular shows.'' ''Sam himself in his poetry was not just polyrhythmic,'' Mr. Roach said. ''He had no bounds. He must be a super drummer, because rhythm sections have to accommodate any kind of situation. When I grew up I would play be-bop on 52d Street with Charlie Parker and that crowd, then take a gig with Larry Clinton, one of the old oompah big bands, then play with Louis Jordan, which was a shuffle band. Sam's poetry is not just rock - it swings, it's avant-garde, it's oompah, it's all of those things. With the plays, each one is a different monster.'' Mr. Roach has composed backwoodsy music, complete with accordion, for ''Back Bog Beast Bait.'' ''Suicide in B-flat'' vamps along to modal, late-1950's-style jazz - in the key of F minor, not B-flat. For ''Angel City,'' in which the tympani player is trying to discover ''that one, special, never-before-heard- before rhythm which will drive men crazy,'' Mr. Roach has come up with ominous, abstract music in a complex rhythm. Nor does his contribution to ''Shepard Sets'' end there. For ''Suicide in B-flat,'' he coached Akin Babatunde, who plays Niles, in how to walk and talk like a jazz titan. ''I'm supposed to be the embodiment of all these great musicians,'' Mr. Babatunde said. ''So Max and I talked for about three hours about them. One thing he showed me was how Charlie Parker used to smile - or, actually, he would look like he was about to smile, but he'd never do it. I use that for Niles.'' ''When people are innovative, most of them let something go,'' Mr. Roach said. ''With Shepard, he doesn't let anything go - he adds, he adds, he adds, he adds. It's not a matter of displacing something old with something new; you keep what you have that's good and you add on to it. For me, there's a lesson to that.'' ''There are times in the rehearsal,'' Mr. Ferencz said, ''when the actors say, 'Was it good? Was it bad?' I say, I don't know - I've never seen anything like it before. Let's just see if we can make it live.' ''

1382-> NOT THE FATHER OF THE MAN
Daniel Goleman writes about science for The New York Times. THE NATURE OF THE CHILD By Jerome Kagan. 309 pp. New York: Basic Books. $22.50. I remember the excitement with which Jerome Kagan announced to a Harvard University colloquium one afternoon in 1971 some startling results from a research project in Guatemala. The Mayan Indians of northwest Guatemala, he told the group of colleagues and students, swaddle their infants in pieces of cloth and leave them suspended in a hammock in the darkness of their houses for many hours of the day. Yet despite spending much of their earliest years hanging in a dark room, by later childhood these same children are as alert and psychologically well-developed as children from other cultures who spend these same hours of infancy in what we think of as a more beneficial manner. At the time, I was a graduate student in clinical psychology, not in Mr. Kagan's area, child development. It was clear that his findings had radical implications for both his field and mine - and that those implications accounted for a good deal of his excitement. The Guatemalan infants were a direct challenge to a psychological principle that remains firmly entrenched in both clinical circles and the culture at large - in such early deprivations are the makings of later psychological crises and developmental setbacks. That dictum is one of several commonly held assumptions about children and their growth to which Mr. Kagan, a professor of developmental psychology at Harvard, lays siege in ''The Nature of the Child.'' Mr. Kagan, a hard thinker about these topics and one of today's most eminent child experts, enunciates the developing edge of consensus in his field. What is startling about his book is its strong challenge to a number of beliefs about children that are so widely accepted - by parents, therapists and even some of Mr. Kagan's colleagues - that they are taken as givens. These include some treasured notions - the notions that a certain set of essential experiences in children's home life allows them to grow into healthy and happy adults, that the temperament of the infant foretells the character of the child, that the child's personality foreshadows the adult's and that the child's psychological traits are shaped by what happens between parent and child. It is not, Mr. Kagan argues, that the parent-child bond does not matter - just that the specifics of parenting are not so crucial to the child's future as parents would like to think. While some lay readers may be taken aback by Mr. Kagan's questioning of such golden tenets of modern parenthood, many therapists no doubt will be upset by his assault on some basic premises of their calling. Foremost among these is his attack on the notion that, as he puts it, ''a mother's love for her infant is necessary for the child's future mental health,'' or, more technically, that a bond of secure attachment to a parent during the first three years of life leaves the child less vulnerable to later psychological disorders. In ''The Nature of the Child,'' Mr. Kagan confronts the issue in terms of a key underlying assumption - ''connectedness,'' the assumption that what happens in one stage of development shapes those that follow. In that framework, the Guatemalan infants are a telling case in point, for their time alone in those huts should somehow have had damaging effects on their later life. Mr. Kagan persuasively describes several important studies to show that, indeed, the evidence for any strong connection from phase to phase is weak. One of the best known of these is the New York Longitudinal Study, in which more than 100 men and women have been interviewed every few years from early infancy. When those who had been referred for psychological problems to a child guidance clinic were assessed as adults, the later evaluations found no lingering signs of the childhood disturbance. ''The fact that one behavior always occurs before another,'' he writes, ''does not mean that the earlier behavior is necessary for the later one.'' That the facts of human development, as Mr. Kagan reviews them, seem to suggest a weak link between stages of life will come as a mixed blessing to many parents. On the one hand, it means unfortunate facts of a child's life - the loss of a parent, a divorce, even a childhood depression - do not dictate a blighted adulthood. On the other hand, it also means that the efforts parents make for their children to assure them of the ''very best'' upbringing may not, above a certain basic threshold, make all that much difference either. There does not, for example, seem to be some ''perfect'' infancy that will guarantee a child's intellectual and emotional future. While such tidings will trouble some parents, others will find that message a relief. A major conceptual foundation of Mr. Kagan's approach is the primacy of biological clocks in child development. The milestones of maturation, he argues, depend on a biological unfolding - as the brain matures, new cognitive abilities emerge. As cognition evolves, the various emotions arrive in due course. These biological givens, he says, interact with the formative effects of experience, fixing an often unpredictable limit on its effects. Thus he rebuts the idea - popular in some advice-to-the-parent circles - ''that almost anything is possible if adults are clever enough in the way they handle children.'' Even so, Mr. Kagan is a firm believer in the plasticity of children - biology is primary but is not destiny. The single personality trait that he grants may be set by genetic givens is shyness. His careful review of the evidence for any and all other biologically set traits finds them lacking. Two things distinguish ''The Nature of the Child'' from other works in the child development genre. First, Mr. Kagan is among those rare men of science who have also mastered the essayist's art. Second, with an exceptional breadth of vision, he elegantly blends intellectual history, anthropology and philosophy with his consideration of psychological issues. We seem to be in a time when such wider views are on the decline in the behavioral sciences. Meanwhile, those with parochial minds - who define their portion of the human condition in ever smaller and more jealously guarded professional turfs - are on the rise. This sorry state of affairs in itself elevates Mr. Kagan's intellectual stature in psychology to that of a giant among dwarves. If Mr. Kagan has a blind spot, it is in not seeing (or perhaps owning up to) the ideology inherent in his own view of man. The position he argues for - that there is no telling connectedness from epoch to epoch in development - bespeaks a humanistic faith that man can make himself anew, that the past need not limit the possiblities of the present. Man cannot look at himself without bias. As Mr. Kagan notes, ideology guides science, particularly the human sciences. Thus he attributes to the uncertainties of modern times the current appeal of such ideas as those expressed by the eminent psychologist Erik Erikson (the human infant needs ''basic trust'') and the psychologist Harry Harlow (infant monkeys need love, even if only in the form of a surrogate mother made of wire and terry cloth). ''Every society,'' Mr. Kagan writes, ''needs some transcendent theme to which citizens can be loyal.'' The inviolate sanctity of the parent- infant bond is ours. WHILE Mr. Kagan's message that the misfortunes of childhood do not doom adulthood is well supported by his evidence, he neglects to weigh in the balance clinical studies that show convincingly that groups of adults with psychological problems have had a higher proportion of childhood troubles - neglect, abuse and the like - than have groups of adults without such problems. Clearly, for some a troubled childhood does predict problems in adulthood. In serving as a bearer of good news, Mr. Kagan rights an imbalance left by those who dwelled on the sad news from the clinic. He is right to argue that one cannot base a science of child development on clinical evidence alone, for the pathological cases offer a skewed base for generalization. On the other hand, no view of development that ignores this facet can be complete either. The clinical evidence that connects childhood trauma to adult troubles may have the advantage of dealing with units that are measurable by the gross instrument available to this corner of science - observation of behavior. That few other such continuities from child to adult have been observed may not mean they do not exist but, as Mr. Kagan concedes, simply that we have yet to find them. Mr. Kagan's arguments will be most unsettling and least convincing to that legion of therapists whose day- to-day work is predicated on tracing delicate threads linking past to present. The clincial data they offer is, for Mr. Kagan, more bias than science, a self-validating assumption in action. An experimental scientist par excellence, Mr. Kagan finds clinical conclusions far less compelling than artfully constructed and repeated results from the laboratory. But in the transfer from life to laboratory, much can be lost. By limiting himself to the one source and bypassing the other, he is occas ionally left with some pallid conclusions. ''Scientists,'' Mr. Kagan writes, ''have been unable to discover many profound priniciples that relate the actions of mothers, fathers, or siblings to psychological characteristics in the child.'' That seems to say less about parents and children than it does about scientists. B

1383-> OUTDOORS; In Search of Asia's Mighty Mahseer
IF you are well-heeled and have become somewhat jaded with catching the usual species of game fish, you might wish to have a go at the mighty mahseer. A giant Asiatic member of the Cyprinidae, or minnow family, the mahseer, or barbus tor , has long been prized as a challenging quarry, and the unofficial rod and reel record for the species, set in 1946, is 120 pounds. The mahseer's range includes Nepal, India and Pakistan. In years past in India, the mahseer was avidly pursued by viceroys and maharajahs, and Rudyard Kipling once observed that it is a game fish ''beside whom the tarpon is as a herring, and he who catches him can say he is a fisherman.'' To so downgrade the tarpon, which grows to double the size of the mahseer and typically engages in more leaping after being hooked, seems a bit unreasonable, but, admittedly, I have neither sought nor caught a mahseer. Kipling was not alone in his reverence for the fish. In his ''The Rod in India,'' published in 1887, H. S. Thomas, an Englishman, wrote ''pound for pound I believe the Mahseer is superior in sporting qualities to the lordly salmon of my native land.'' Coming from a dedicated Atlantic salmon angler, that obervation must be given considerable weight. My vague awareness of the mahseer was sharpened when Bob Howitt, angling consultant for a Swiss firm, Tiger Tops Mountain Travel SA, talked with me during a visit to this country earlier this fall. Mr. Howitt, one should add, caught a 95- pound mahseer this spring, the largest landed in recent times. Tiger Tops has arranged for a mahseer world angling championship tournament in southern India next spring. The goal is to assemble five groups of six anglers each who will fish for eight days on the Cauvery River, which the agency describes as the world's finest mahseer stream. The entire visit in India will last 14 1/2 days, include a three-day trip to the Kabini National Game Park, and cost each angler $4,800. The air fare is extra, and the round trip cost between New York and Bombay would be about $1,700. Tiger Tops reports that the mahseer stocks in many of India's rivers have been severely reduced by pollution, netting and dynamiting. Although the mahseer is not particularly palatable, it is eagerly sought for food to help feed India's huge population. Several years ago, Tiger Tops and Jungle Lodges and Resorts, an Indian Government company, took over - thereby establishing it as an angling preserve - a section of the Cauvery that still holds big mahseer. Early this spring, Tiger Tops and Jungle Lodges mounted an expedition to the portion of the Cauvery under their control to see if its fishing warranted its being a site for a world championship mahseer event. In 16 days, nine fish over 50 pounds - including Mr. Howitt's 95-pounder - were taken. All were released, as will be those taken in the tournament. The Cauvery is big, wild and fast in the stretch where the fishing took place and along its banks the anglers saw elephants, jackals, sambar and chital - both members of the deer family - wild boar, monkeys and an occasional leopard. Stephen Halliday, a Manhattan travel agency executive who accompanied the expedition as a photographer, says that the mahseer hits hard and usually makes an initial run of 100 yards or more. The group, Mr. Halliday said, found that a drifted, dead minnow fished deep with a small sinker was probably the most effective way to catch mahseer, but they were also taken on spoons, spinners and plugs. Medium heavy, or heavy bait casting tackle was most commonly used, although heavy spinning gear is also employed. Wondering whether the species had ever been caught on a fly, I called a friend, Al McLane of Palm Beach, Fla., one of the world's best-known and most widely-traveled anglers. He had, it turned out, caught mahseer on both lures and flies. ''They are a terrific game fish,'' he said, ''very strong, and that first run is often difficult to handle, particuarly in fast water.'' Large spoons are the usual mahseer lure, he said. Noting that he had also caught them on flies, Mr. McLane added that they were not as effective as lures. ''The fish are in fairly heavy water, quite deep ... but in the days I was doing it - I haven't been in India for about 18 years - we didn't have the high density sinking flylines we have today.'' He agreed with the notion that large saltwater flies, such as those used for tarpon in the 100-pound class and above, might do the job. Remotely related to the carp, the mahseer bears a certain resemblance to that fish and to the tarpon, and is long-lived. Mr. Halliday said that examination - by the Bombay Natural History Museum - of scales from a mahseer of about 80 pounds indicated that it was probably over 30 years old. The mahseer's scales are huge, as large as a playing card on big fish, and are often used for such things as menu cards and luggage tags. Those interested in taking part in next spring's masheer tournament should communicate with Tiger Tops. The firm's address is Lautengartenstrasse 6, Basel, 4010, Switzerland; telephone 0-61-373029.

1386-> AROUND THE NATION; Mother and Son to Seek Counseling for Incest
A mother and son who married each other today pleaded no contest to incest, conceding that they knew of their relationship when they married and agreeing to seek counseling in return for staying out of jail. ''They entered pleas this morning in a surprising development,'' said Dan Cook, assistant district attorney general for Dickson County. The pleas were accepted in Dickson County Circuit Court by Judge Leonard Martin. Both defendants received suspended five-year sentences. Robert Spencer, the lawyer who represented Mary Ann Garton Bass, 45 years old, said she and her son, Danny Bass, 26, felt ''more of a relief than anything'' at the resolution of the case. Mr. Cook said that Mrs. Bass pleaded guilty to felonious bigamy, admitting that she had married her son while she was still married to her fourth husband. Mr. Bass pleaded guilty to perjury, admitting that he lied to a grand jury when he said he did not know at the time of the marriage that his bride was also his mother, Mr. Cook said.

1388-> SECOND CHANCE FOR A 70'S MUSICAL
When ''Pacific Overtures'' opened in 1976, it had all the dimensions of a big Broadway musical - a cast of 34, a Boris Aronson set, a 1,500-seat theater and a $650,000 price tag. Once, that was a lot of money for Broadway. What ''Pacific Overtures'' did not have were the familiar conceits of the Broadway musical. It fused Kabuki and American theater styles, Oriental and Occidental musical traditions. It employed an Asian-American cast to tell the story of the opening of Japan to the West. And in a season dominated by another new musical titled ''A Chorus Line,'' ''Pacific Overtures'' deeply divided critics and played a modest six months. Recently the Stephen Sondheim- John Weidman show reopened, in the more intimate confines of the Promenade Theater - 385 seats - and to perhaps more aware audiences. The production represents a collaboration between one of the best-known names in theater, the Shubert Organization, and one of the more obscure, the York Theater Company. While it is rare for a Broadway musical to be revived so soon Off Broadway, ''Pacific Overtures'' has found that, critically speaking, smaller is indeed better. ''It's made the relationship with our audience much more personal,'' said Ernest Abuba, one of four cast members to have played both in the original production and the current revival. ''The first time, we did this show at the Winter Garden, at the Kennedy Center, at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. You're talking about stadiums. The intimacy was lost. This time, it's almost like story- telling, one to one.'' For the creators of ''Pacific Overtures,'' the revival has offered that rarity in commercial theater, a second chance. Mr. Weidman has cut some scenes - particularly those about the intricacies of 19th-century Japanese politics - and has rewritten several speeches by The Reciter into active scenes. Mr. Sondheim rewrote a few lyrics and added underscoring. Another factor in the success of the revival, particularly with audiences, is simply the passage of time. Since 1976, such shows as ''Sweeney Todd'' and ''Sunday in the Park With George'' have attuned listeners to Mr. Sondheim's scores. At the same time, the subject of Japan itself has become less foreign to Americans. ''Awareness is the key word,'' Mr. Weidman said. '' Eight years ago, Japanese restaurants were rare here. Now you can't walk down the street without tripping over sushi.'' For all that, ''Pacific Overtures'' still would not be running now except for the efforts of the York Theater Company and of a 34-year-old director, Fran Soeder. Mr. Soeder directed ''Pacific Overtures'' in Cleveland in the summer of 1983. ''I didn't know much about Kabuki or Japan,'' he said. ''I did it for a very selfish reason - to grow as a director.'' The show earned glowing reviews, which Mr. Soeder sent to Mr. Sondheim. Mr. Sondheim in turn put Mr. Soeder in touch with Janet Hayes Walker, the producer of the York Theater Company. The York mounted its production last spring in a converted gymnasium in Manhattan with 99 seats. The entire show cost $25,000. The creators and actors received only token payments, $250 apiece. Cast and crew members often paid for their own props and makeup, and the costumes were rented from the Cleveland production. ''Talk about no frills,'' Mr. Soeder said. But in its physical and financial limits, ''Pacific Overtures'' found a charm and a connection with audiences that it had not enjoyed on Broadway. The three-week run sold out and Mr. Soeder and Miss Walker began getting offers to move the production to a larger house. They eventually signed an agreement with the Shubert Organization and Elizabeth McCann and Nelle Nugent, an independent producing team, to bring the show to the Promenade for $400,000. Even at that price, the revival costs about one-third what the Broadway production did in terms of real dollars. And the Promenade production carries over Mr. Soeder, 14 actors and the simplified staging from the York company's version. ''For me, the essence of 'Pacific Overtures' is that any culture changes, that progress is inevitable,'' Mr. Soeder said. ''But there is a price to pay for progress. Sometimes that price can be losing a culture. I don't think the show is about Japan specifically as much as about Japan as an example of a culture. The play is not a musical about larger-than-life characters. It is about ordinary characters in a larger-than-life situation.''

1389-> OPPOSITION VOWS STRONG CHALLENGE TO SANDINISTAS
Opposition leaders who won seats in the new National Assembly said in interviews this week that they intended to present a strong challenge to the governing Sandinista Front. ''When the Assembly convenes in January, the Sandinistas will be facing a strong and belligerent opposition, most of which was elected on explicitly anti-Communist platforms,'' said Adolfo Evertsz Velez, a leader of the Socialist Party of Nicaragua. ''They are going to have to make concessions.'' The opposition's determination to press its demands indicates that the Assembly will reflect a relative diversity of views. But key decisions that will determine the power of the Assembly, such as whether it will have the power to approve the national budget, remain to be made. The Sandinista Front did not fare as well in the election as some of its leaders had predicted. It took 61 seats in the 96-member Assembly, and its presidential candidate, Daniel Ortega Saavedra, won 63 percent of the vote, less than his aides had predicted. One- quarter of the registered voters stayed at home, while 6 percent of the ballots cast were spoiled. 'We Have Problems' ''The results show that we have problems in some areas,'' said Rafael Solis Cerda, a Sandinista specialist in electoral and parliamentary matters. ''A significant number of Nicaraguans obviously do not understand or support what we are doing. We will have to take this into account.'' The three non-Marxist opposition parties - the Popular Social Christians, the Democratic Conservatives and the Independent Liberals - won a total of 29 seats in the Assembly. Their leaders said the opposition's first priority would be to assure that Nicaragua's new Constitution is traditionally democratic in character. The opposition is also expected to press for revision of the military draft and for major changes in other important Sandinista programs. ''The first thing we bear in mind is that we were elected as critics of the Sandinista Front and as a party with a program different from the Sandinista program,'' said Luis Humberto Guzman, a 31-year-old graduate student who will head the bloc of six deputies from the Popular Social Christian Party. Compromises Predicted ''The election showed that the Sandinistas are vulnerable in electoral terms,'' Mr. Guzman said. ''They must recognize that political democracy is not incompatible with a regime of advanced political and economic achievements.'' Mr. Guzman, who is writing a doctoral thesis on Nicaraguan-American relations during the Nixon Administration, said he expected the Sandinista leadership in the Assembly to be open to compromise. The Popular Social Christians, Mr. Guzman said, will propose a sweeping new educational code ''to end the ideological manipulation of our youth through teaching methods that portray the Sandinista Front as the vanguard of the people.'' He said his party would also favor a law that would offer guarantees to encourage foreign investment. The Democratic Conservatives, the most pro-capitalist party that will be represented in the Assembly, with 14 deputies, will be the largest opposition force. Vow to Fight Marxist Proposals ''We will fight any proposal that is Marxist in nature or that limits people's freedom to produce and sell as they please,'' said Gustavo Mendoza Hernandez, a deputy-elect from Managua. ''There will never be another Cuba here, never.'' ''We are good friends of the United States,'' said Mr. Mendoza, who owns cattle ranches in the provinces of Boaco and Leon. The Independent Liberal Party won nine seats in the Assembly, but its leaders quit the campaign shortly before election day in protest at what they said was harassment by the Sandinistas. They have not yet decided whether they will accept the seats. If the Independent Liberals take part, they would be likely to support some anti-Sandinista proposals made by other parties. In the past, the Sandinistas have shown flexibility on many points when dealing with opposition parties. They accepted major changes in the law governing political parties, and they withdrew their proposal for press regulations after it provoked an uproar. Inflexibility on Some Points They appear, however, to consider some of their programs sacrosanct, and at least one, the draft, is likely to come under strong debate in the Assembly. The Democratic Conservatives want to abolish conscription altogether, and there is strong sentiment in other parties for substantial revisions. Mr. Solis, a Sandinista deputy-elect who is expected to play an important role in the Assembly, warned that the opposition should use ''political tact'' in deciding how strongly to attack the draft while the country is at war. ''It would seem to be a political mistake,'' he said, ''to walk into the Assembly on the first day and demand repeal of the draft law. On this matter, there is not much chance of reaching an agreement. The Sandinista Front will close ranks and maintain a firm position on this.'' Budget An Issue Leaders of every opposition party that will hold seats in the Assembly said they believed the national budget should be submitted to the Assembly for approval or rejection, but Mr. Solis said the nine-member Sandinista National Directorate had not yet decided whether to support this idea. Doing so would mark a major shift for the Sandinistas, who have treated budget figures as virtual state secrets. With the Sandinistas so close to the two-thirds majority they will presumably need to get approval for major proposals in the Assembly, they are expected to look for occasional support from Marxist deputies or from renegade members of the non-Marxist opposition. One deputy elected on the Democratic Conservative ticket, Rafael Cordova Rivas, is a member of the outgoing Sandinista junta and is considered responsive to the National Directorate. Sandinistas Are Varied The Sandinista deputies are also a varied group. Among them are several businessmen, clergymen and landowners. Mr. Solis said that about 15 are not full-fledged members of the Sandinista Front, but he said he expected them to support the party's program. The Socialist and Communist Parties, each of which has two Assembly seats and defines itself as Marxist- Leninist, believe Nicaragua is not ready for social revolution. ''The truth is that Nicaragua is a capitalist country, and the Constitution we write is going to have to reflect that,'' said Ariel Bravo Lorio, one of two Communists who will sit in the Assembly. The Popular Action Movement- Marxist-Leninist, which accuses the Socialists and Communists of revisionism, is apparently the only party that will fight the Sandinistas from the left. One of its two deputies-elect, Isidro Tellez Toruno, a bricklayer, said he opposed efforts to maintain a mixed economy in Nicaragua and would vote against ''laws of capitalist tendency.'' Ortega Seeks Talks With Reagan MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Nov. 17 (UPI) - Mr. Ortega, insisting that Sandinista leaders are ''not enemies'' of the United States, called Friday for a meeting with President Reagan to ease heightening tensions between the two nations. ''We are ready to meet anywhere,'' Mr. Ortega said in an interview. ''We are ready to visit the United States or receive President Reagan here in Nicaragua or meet in any other place.'' ''We have been insisting that we are not enemies of the U.S. Government,'' Mr. Ortega said. ''We are not enemies of the American people. We are not enemies of President Reagan. ''We say the United States has a mistaken policy toward Nicaragua and that this demands effort and comprehension by American leaders to find a reasonable and civilized and peaceful solution, not a brutal one.''

1391-> SCOUTING
Gate Dancing Major league baseball, which set an attendance record of more than 45.5 million in 1983, is up again this season. After Sunday's games, the American League, which last year set a record for any sports league with a total attendance of 23,990,910, had drawn 10,155,931 fans for 484 dates, an increase of 680,462. And the National League, which set its own record 21,539,946 in 1983, was 257,613 ahead of that pace with a figure of 9,162,272 after 407 games. The Tigers, who have excited Detroit fans with a sensational start, are 488,196 ahead of last year's attendance pace and 332,146 in front of their club record 2,031,847 in 1968. Toronto, Baltimore and Chicago are also well ahead of club record attendance figures in 1983. In the National League, the biggest increases are at Wrigley Field and at Shea Stadium where the Cubs and Mets are suprisingly in pennant contention. Chicago is 321,009 ahead of last year's attendance and may threaten its 1969 record of 1,674,993. The Mets, who drew 1,104,138 last year, are 179,971 ahead of that pace and the Yankees, who drew 2,257,976 in 1983, are only 30,494 off that pace, despite a woeful start.

1392-> NETS TRIUMPH DESPITE SHORT'S 59 POINTS
The Nets overcame a 59-point performance by Golden State forward Purvis Short, the highest single-game output in the National Basketball Association this season, to defeat the Warriors tonight, 131-114. Golden State trailed by 3 points at 109-106 with 4 minutes 56 seconds to play when New Jersey began a 14- point spurt that sealed the game. The Nets capitalized on a balanced scoring attack led by Buck Williams' 24 points. Five other Nets scored in double figures, including Mike O'Koren with 21 and Otis Birdsong with 19. Short's total not only bettered his career mark of 57, which he gained against San Antonio last season, but it was also the third time in four games that he has scored more than 40 points. The Nets outscored Golden State, 35-29, in the first quarter despite Short's 14 points, but the Warrior captain scored 21 in the second period to lead the Warriors to a 62-61 halftime edge. Pistons 124, Mavericks 110 DALLAS (UPI) - Kelly Tripucka and Isiah Thomas combined for 26 points in the fourth quarter as Detroit overcame a 17-point deficit. It was the second consecutive game in which Dallas let a big lead slip away in the second half. They surrendered a late 11-point advantage Thursday night against Golden State. Both Tripucka and Thomas finished with 24 points - Tripucka scoring 16 in the final period and Thomas 10. Vinnie Johnson added 23 for Detroit and Bill Laimbeer had 19. Mark Aguirre paced the Mavericks with 30 points. Rockets 141, Spurs 133 HOUSTON (AP) - Ralph Sampson scored a career-high 43 points to lead Houston. Sampson's previous high was 41 points on Feb. 8, 1984, against the Philadelphia 76ers. George Gervin led the Spurs with 28 points to give him 24,017 career points and place him 10th on the career N.B.A.-American Basketball Association scoring list. Artis Gilmore and Mike Mitchell had 27 and 26 points for the Spurs. The triumph snapped a two-game losing streak for the 9-2 Rockets. The loss was San Antonio's fourth straight, dropping the Rockets to 6-6. Sampson and Lewis Lloyd scored 13 points each in the first quarter to stake Houston to a 38-20 lead. Houston led by as many as 22 in the quarter and outshot the Spurs - 54 percent to 36 percent from the field. Gervin, who was held scoreless in the first quarter, scored 17 points in the second quarter as the Spurs cut the Rocket lead to 76-70 at the half. 76ers 109, Bulls 100 CHICAGO (AP) - Moses Malone, gettin a game-high 39 points, and Julius Erving combined for 21 fourth- quarter points to lead Philadelphia. The 76ers (7-2) dominated the game after the eight-minute mark of the second quarter as Malone and Erving contributed 10 points each to send Philadelphia into a 54-48 halftime advantage. Malone scored 6 points early in the third quarter as Philadelphia outscored the Bulls, 12-2, in a five-minute flurry. With Erving hitting from long range, the 76ers opened up a 20-point lead at 82-62 with 2:13 left in the third quarter. Hawks 118, Pacers 108 ATLANTA (AP) - Dominique Wilkins scored 29 points as Atlanta defeated Indiana. Atlanta did not trail after Kevin Willis hit a jumper to give the Hawks a 26-25 lead with 1:41 left in the first quarter. Wilkins got 13 of his points in the second quarter, including 7 points in a streak in which Atlanta outscored Indiana by 12-2 to move to a 51-39 lead. The Hawks also scored the final 8 points of the half, including 4 by Wilkins, to take a 64-50 lead. Indiana turned a 12-2 streak in the fourth quarter to pull to 106-98 with 3:07 left, but could draw no closer. Jim Thomas led Indiana with 22 points. Clark Kellogg added 20. For Atlanta, Doc Rivers scored 17 points and Mike Glenn had 13. Jazz 108, Suns 94 SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - Mark Eaton sparked a big Utah third quarter, scoring 8 of his 14 points, as the Jazz blew open a tight game. Eaton, the 7-4 center, also had 14 rebounds and six blocked shots. The Jazz improved their Midwest Division record to 6-5, and the Suns are now 8-4 in the Pacific Division. The leading scorer for Utah was Adrian Dantley with 22 points, Darrell Griffith added 18 and Rickey Green 16. The Suns, who shot only 32 percent in the deciding third period, compared with 70 percent for Utah, were led by James Edwards with 17 points and Larry Nance with 15. Maurice Lucas had 14 and Rod Foster 13. Utah led by 48-45 at the half after Dantley had scored 19 points. In the third quarter, Eaton and Green combined for 14 points as the Jazz raced to a 77-64 advantage going into the final period of play.

1395-> ACCIDENT LINKED TO IMMUNE DISEASE
British doctors say a nurse developed an infection from the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome after she stuck her finger with a needle on a syringe that contained blood from an AIDS patient. The physicians said the nurse developed temporary symptoms of the disease, and her blood tests showed antibodies to the AIDS virus. Thus, they suspect that she may have the disease itself, although she is well now, according to a report on her case in the Dec. 15 issue of the medical journal Lancet. The AIDS patient from whom the nurse acquired the condition died, the journal said. The nurse is not a member of any known risk factor for AIDS - homosexuals, hemophiliacs, drug users and Haitians. Health Workers Concerned Although scores of American health workers have stuck themselves with needles while caring for AIDS patients, no documented case of AIDS has developed among such workers, according to epidemiologists at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. But health workers have been deeply concerned about their risk of getting AIDS. Earlier this week, epidemiologists began investigating a case in Boston involving a laboratory worker who stuck himself with a needle and who has developed AIDS although he is not a member of any known risk factor. The Lancet editors called the nurse's accident ''worrisome'' and urged that health care workers take ''the utmost care'' to avoid self-inoculation when handling blood and blood-products from patients with AIDS. The accident occurred in an unidentified British hospital where the nurse was caring for a white woman who had lived with her husband in central- southern Africa for six years. She had never visited the United States, the Caribbean or Zaire, three areas where many AIDS cases have been reported. An Equal Sex Distribution Studies have shown that there is an equal sex distribution of AIDS cases in Zaire and other central African countries, suggesting to some researchers that heterosexual transmission may be the prime means of spreading the disease in those areas, although insects and other vectors might be an important source. In the United States, heterosexuals are not listed as among the main groups at risk. A ''disturbing feature'' of the British nurse's case, the Lancet editors said, is that ''there may be differences in infectivity and other characteristics between the viruses of American and African origin.'' The Lancet editors said they believed the woman acquired AIDS from heterosexual transmission in Africa. They said that 13 days after the British nurse was stuck by the needle, she developed a severe, flu-like illness, a mild sore throat, headache and muscle pains. Four days later, a rash appeared on her trunk and spread to her neck and face. The rash lasted seven days. A fever of up to 102.2 degrees persisted until the 20th day of the illness, then disappeared. Lymph nodes swelled throughout her body, a reaction that occurs in most AIDS patients; the lymph nodes eventually shrank. The nurse was not reported to have developed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia or any other opportunistic infection that characterize AIDS infections. Antibodies Gradually Developed Researchers believe that a retrovirus called LAV/HTLV-III causes AIDS. Tests showed that the woman was infected with the AIDS virus at the time the nurse stuck herself with the needle. Tests of blood samples taken from the nurse at various stages of her illness showed that, over a period of time, she developed antibodies to the AIDS virus. Antibodies are the protective substances the body forms to fight off viruses and other micro-organisms. Specifically, a blood sample drawn 27 days after the needle injury, or two weeks after the onset of the illness, did not show antibodies to the AIDS virus. But blood samples drawn 49 and 57 days after the injury did show evidence of such antibodies. Scientists call the process by which the blood tests turned from negative to positive seroconversion. The test results were confirmed by British experts as well as by virologists at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. The Lancet editors emphasized that the British nurse did not receive ''an ordinary needlestick injury'' because she was working with a syringe containing fresh blood drawn from an artery. Thus, she may have been injected with much more blood than is the usual case with such an injury. The editors also said the case ''will cause many observers to reconsider the adequacy of the precautions taken both in nursing of AIDS patients and in handling of laboratory specimens. In view of the known epidemiology of AIDS in drug addicts, we should not be surprised that small volumes of blood are capable of transmitting'' AIDS.

1396-> 4 Army Men Killed in Crash Near Foggy Field in Virginia
All four servicemen aboard an Army airplane died Wednesday when it crashed in woods near Washington while trying to land at an airfield shrouded in fog, the authorities said. The dead were identified as the pilot, Chief Warrant Officer Richard Blunt, 44 years old; the co-pilot, Chief Warrant Ofiicer John Hensley, 39; Lieut. Col. James Palmer, 44, and Master Sgt. William Reeves, 46. All were assigned to Fort Bragg, N.C., where the twin-engine plane, an Army U-21, took off at 5:34 A.M. on a routine flight. The plane crashed at 6:47 A.M. near the runway at Davison Army Airfield at Fort Belvoir. The Army U-21 is a 15-passenger, military version of the Beech Kingair used for general cargo, passenger traffic and air ambulance service.

1397-> FOREIGN AFFAIRS; BRINK OF ARMED SPACE
If the United States goes ahead with planned testing and production of anti-satellite weapons (ASAT's in the jargon), this will be the command center for using them. The surprisingly ordinary-looking buildings set deep in the gutted innards of Cheyenne Mountain are no longer just the headquarters of Norad, the North American Aerospace Defense Command, whose job is to give immediate warning of any incoming attacks. The site also houses the little- known Air Force Space Command, not yet two years old. But it is growing fast. It is soon to have its own headquarters and operations center nearby. Naturally, Space Command wasn't a bit pleased with the House of Representatives vote last week, by 238 to 181, to block ASAT tests for a year provided the Russians continue their two-year abstinence from such tests. The purpose of the House action, on a proposal by Representative George Brown of California, was to push for negotiations with Moscow before it is too late to prevent a full-scale arms race in space. Both advocates and critics of adding space as a fourth dimension of the Soviet-American battlefield recognize that this year is a watershed. An unusually well-informed debate preceded the vote. The Congressional Record dated May 23, No. 69 Part II, provides the critical arguments on this momentous issue for citizens willing to brave the technical complexities. The crux of the immediate question is this: The Soviet Union has a satellite-killer, admittedly crude but probably capable of knocking out some American satellites in low orbit. Should the United States go ahead with its superior but not fully tested system so as to be one up, for now? Or should America investigate Soviet offers for talks on dismantling its weapon and banning all interference with satellites? A treaty would also head off most current ideas for the Star Wars concept of shooting down missiles from space. Some ASAT techniques are crucial to Star Wars plans. If there are no talks and no agreement, both sides will press ahead. Eventually, that will unravel the existing SALT I treaty against antiballistic missiles and with it any hope for maintaining, let alone advancing, missile arms control. The sky is already crowded with military satellites. The most important are in very high orbit, far beyond the current reach of either side's ASAT's. But they will be endangered if both sides keep going. They are crucial to verifying arms control, warning of attack and identifying its source, assuring navigation and communications in time of crisis. Anti-satellite weapons provide no defense for these vital eyes and ears. Satellites are vulnerable, though they can be made better able to survive. They are not weapons, but they can guide earth-based weapons. Sponsors of American ASAT's want them to destroy Soviet satellites that can target American ships and planes, that is to attack in time of crisis and to respond tit for tat in case the Russians attack American satellites. Critics point out that the United States relies more on its satellites than the Russians do on theirs, and stands to lose more than it could gain in an exchange. The urgency comes because tests of ASAT's, scheduled this fall, are easily verified. But it will be practically impossible to verify inventories once tests are completed and production begins. It is a case of whether to lock the barn doors or let the horses stampede. President Reagan's science adviser, George Keyworth, has said, ''We do not want any negotiations for a couple of years or more in order to get our programs going full blast.'' And that is the underlying argument, as lengthy talks with many people involved have shown. The questions ASAT advocates put are revealing. Do you believe the Russians will stand by any treaty? Control of space will dominate force on earth, so shouldn't we try hard to get there first? Why should space be different from land, sea and air where we have to enforce our position? The questions they provoke are disturbing. If it is impossible to agree on mutual restraints, can the arms race ever be curbed? Is it possible to ''control space,'' and how long would it last before it brought a leapfrog retort? Would such a challenge subdue the Russians or drive them to furious risks? The House vote isn't law. The Senate has yet to act. Even though a leaky defense against nuclear missiles is probably a generation away, if it can be done at all, the decisive choice between launching a race for control of space or blocking United States-Soviet confrontation on the ''high frontier'' is at hand.

1400-> PUTTING A NEW SHINE ON A CHANDELIER
SINCE chandeliers are usually electrified and made of fragile crystal or glass, their cleaning and repair is delicate business. ''Chandelier maintenance requires a rare combination of talents,'' said the lighting specialist Michael Pell of Custom Lamp Mounters in Manhattan. ''The person must understand how it works electrically but also must be good at cleaning.'' At some of New York's top chandelier dealers - Nesle, Charles J. Winston & Company, Marvin Alexander and Newell Art Galleries - there are in-house workshops or referral services that will provide maintenance for longstanding clientele. For those who have purchased their fixtures elsewhere or who prefer not to risk cleaning their own chandeliers, there are specialists who will do the job. Cleaning does not just mean a quick spray and wash or light dusting. Along with refurbishing and repairs, it is a complicated task that often requires the fixture to be disassembled. Since many of the parts that make up a crystal or glass chandelier are pinned together, for full cleaning and restoration these must be removed and repinned so that each transparent piece catches the light properly. If the electrical wiring is old it must also be replaced. In cleaning and polishing metal chandeliers, the fixture is usually disassembled outside of the home, polished (by machine or hand), relacquered if needed, rewired and reassembled. In either metal or glass chandeliers, the wiring might be tacked along the outside of the solid arms or threaded through the hollow arms of converted gas or modern electric fixtures. Some chandelier cleaning and refurbishing specialists who regularly work on the huge chandeliers of commercial establishments are insured against breakage and accidents. Others are not covered. If a chandelier is valuable, it is wise to check on insurance coverage before contracting for a cleaning or refurbishing job. Most chandelier specialists work by appointment only and they often have long waiting lists for service. The following are some of the New York area's specialists: Anthony Bazza Restorations, 315 East 62d Street, 755-1179. Monday through Thursday 8 A.M. to 4 P.M. Friday 8 A.M. to 3:30 P.M. By appointment only. Anthony Bazza specializes in many types of restoration. He will clean, refurbish and rewire metal (iron, tin and brass) and crystal chandeliers. His cleaning charges are determined by the size of the chandeliers and the amount of repinning needed and can run from $100 to several thousand dollars. He will replate silver chandeliers and polish brass and copper in his workshop. Mr. Bazza also designs and makes custom chandeliers. Most charges are determined by the job. For cleaning, estimates are given within a week, based on a photograph and measurements. He has a three- to four-month waiting list. City Knickerbocker Inc., 781 Eighth Avenue, between 47th and 48th Streets, 586-3939. Hours 8 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. Monday to Friday. This 78-year-old light store will clean and refurbish all types of chandeliers. According to the owners, Kenneth and Madeleine Leroff, 75 percent of their refurbishing work is on brass and Victorian chandeliers. They do not make house calls, so fixtures must be brought in for cleaning. They will take apart metal chandeliers, strip off old paint or lacquer, repolish and refinish. Jobs begin at $45 per arm. For crystal chandeliers they will rewire and repin the pieces. Jobs begin at $25 to $35 per arm. They also have a large stock of old crystal pieces. Work can be done within one week. They can give rough estimates from photos and measurements but prefer to see the fixtures themselves. Crystal Maintenance Company. 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, 582-2207 Monday through Friday 11 A.M. to 3 P.M. The owner, Zenny Deblinger, has a staff of eight and specializes in cleaning crystal chandeliers in embassies, hotels, stores and homes. Usually, the chandelier is carefully taken down on the premises, cleaned and rehung. If a chandelier has been hanging for more than 10 years Mr. Deblinger will usually recommend rewiring. Charges for large jobs are figured on a contract basis only. Small jobs are done when his schedule allows. Cleaning can run $150 to $4,000. Restringing the crystal pieces begins at $150 and charges are based on time and materials. Charges for restoring metal areas of a chandelier, rewiring or replacing pieces are determined by the job's size. Generally there is a one-month wait for service. Michael J. Dotzel & Son Expert Metal Craftsman Shop, 402 East 63d Street, between First and York Avenues, 838-2890, Monday through Friday 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. This shop specializes in antique chandelier care and restoration of metal and crystal chandeliers. Brass chandeliers are disassembled, stripped, machine-polished and lacquered. Charges are based on the fixture's size. According to Michael J. Dotzel, once a metal chandelier is taken apart it must be rewired, which costs $18 to $35 per arm.

1401-> OFFICIALS IN PURSUIT OF TOXIC WASTES LEARN FROM MOCK RAIDS
Law enforcement and environmental officials from several states staged mock raids on a fake toxic-waste site this week as part of a state course designed to show them how to seize evidence without getting contaminated. As Pennsylvania officials broke through the locked gate of a site in this Trenton suburb, officials from Maine and New Hampshire inspected an abandoned trailer where drums of hazardous waste were emitting smoke. Officials in white protective gear gingerly inspected the sites before they told prosecutors it was safe to collect evidence and question suspects. Dry Ice and Water The waste site, at a State Transportation Department yard here, was the creation of the New Jersey Attorney General's office. The smoke from the trailer was produced by dry ice and water. ''Last year we went through this course,'' said Keith Welks of the Pennsylvania Attorney General's office. ''It's superb.'' He was watching investigators from his state round up and begin questioning ''employees'' of the mock waste-storage center. To add a touch of realism, one of the employees - played by an official in the New Jersey Division of Criminal Justice - tossed papers into a burning drum. A colleague from Pennsylvania kicked the drum over and snatched the papers from the fire. The simulated raids were part of a three-day training course that the State Attorney General's office has provided for the last four years to nearly 1,000 environmental regulators and lawenforcement officials from 13 states. F.B.I. Agent Participates Last year, officials of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency took the course, and this year, a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent participated, said Linda Dunn of the Northeast Hazardous Waste Coordination Committee, which oversees the training with New Jersey officials. ''We are teaching criminal-justice people to be sensitive to environmental considerations,'' said Steve Madonna, the environmental protection chief in the State Division of Criminal Justice, ''and teaching environmental people - who are most often the first to respond to a site - to be sensitive to the needs of the criminal-justice system.'' Unique Program ''Police learn that environmental crime is not just a traditional police matter,'' said Jim Lyko of the Maryland Attorney General's office. ''And environmental officials learn there is a need for traditional criminal investigative techniques.'' But Mr. Lyko said the main benefit is that both groups learn the need to pool their expertise and coordinate their activities. ''There's nothing like it in the country,'' Mr. Madonna said of the course. ''There's no place you can get this training.'' Miss Dunn said that the training courses, which began Nov. 5 and ended today, were financed with $153,000 from the Environmental Protection Agency and $90,000 from the 13 states. The classroom courses began in 1981, but last year the state added the mock raids, said Thomas Cannon, a spokesman for Attorney General Irwin I. Kimmelman. The states in the hazardous-waste committee include Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Virginia.

1402-> O'NEILL REFLECTS DEMOCRATIC STRATEGY ON BUDGET CUTS AND TAX REVISIONS
In his most conciliatory remarks since the election campaign, House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. has set out the prospect of bipartisan cooperation on the budget and taxes but has insisted that President Reagan take the political risk of publicly initiating controversial policy changes. The Speaker's approach, said his aides and other Democrats, is designed both to open the possiblity for legislative compromise and to protect Democrats by making the President and Republicans in Congress take the main responsibility for deep budget cuts or tax revisions that may subsequently become unpopular. With Mr. Reagan being strongly urged by White House advisers to cut back the Defense Department's budget, Mr. O'Neill specifically offered cooperation if the President accepted this advice. ''If the President is willing to reduce the growth of defense spending,'' the Speaker said, ''then he will find that we will be helpful in nondefense areas of the budget.'' He gave no details. Support for Regan Tax Plan Mr. O'Neill also indicated a positive response to the tax revision plan advanced by Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan, which surprised many Democrats by reducing the tax burden on lower income families while increasing the burden on corporations. ''If the President is sincere in his desire to make the tax system fairer, we will help him do it,'' Mr. O'Neill said in a speech Tuesday night at the annual banquet of the Center for National Policy, a nonprofit Democratic policy institute. Earlier, however, the Speaker noted that Mr. Regan had not signaled his own tax revision plans. More broadly, Mr. O'Neill told the House Democratic caucus on Monday, ''We will be constructive and open to compromise just as we have been for the last two Congresses.'' But he quickly added that if the President ''wants our help, he must ask for it.'' In corridor comments and in interviews, many leading Democrats in Congress have made it clear that they are wary this year of being lured into bipartisan compromises and later being attacked by the President as the initiators of unpopular budget cuts or tax increases. Bitter Over G.O.P. Attacks ''You've got a lot of Democrats who are very bitter about Republican ads attacking them on the tax issue,'' said Kirk O'Donnell, the Speaker's political adviser. ''Here they voted in '82 and '84 for bipartisan tax increases and they got bludgeoned for it. They want the President to take the first step so they don't take the blame later on that the Democratic Party wants tax increases but the President does not.'' But Democrats are also sensitive to the public's fatigue with the partisan combat of this year's election campaign and are concerned about being cast by Mr. Reagan or by White House strategists as obstructionists bent on frustrating the will of a man who who has just won the largest electoral majority in the nation's history. ''This country is in a very nonpartisan mood right now,'' said Christopher Matthews, a spokesman for Mr. O'Neill. ''People have had enough of the partisan battle in the election. So anything that looks like partisan behavior is not going to go over well at this point. The public is not in the mood for anyone taking shots at the President right now.'' In this situation, Democratic leaders have concluded that their best political strategy is to avoid any appearance of premature opposition, to declare their willingness to work with Mr. Reagan and to refrain from taking a partisan position on the various proposals now being considered by the Administration until the President takes his position publicly to the nation. Focus on President's Choices Although Mr. Reagan has moved rapidly by specifying strong budget- cutting instructions to his Cabinet and by having Republicans in the House briefed by David A. Stockman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, Democratic leaders decline to come back with specific reactions. Their tactic is to not to specify their own legislative agenda or counterproposals, thus permitting the public to focus on the substance of the difficult choices the President will have to put before the nation. Their theory is that Mr. Reagan will find it hard to summon sufficient support from the public and Republicans in Congress for the kinds of deep cuts and revisions that Mr. Stockman and his budget-cutting advisers have in mind for such political sensitive programs as Medicare, student loans, veterans benefits, Federal pay and retirement and farm subisidies. For the time being at least, they do not want to divert attention from the likely impact of the Administration's plans with partisan bickering. No Interest in Partisan Battles ''If the public sees it as a partisan battle, the public doesn't pay much attention to the personal impact of his programs,'' Mr. Matthews said. ''They look at it as a Washington battle and they're not interested.'' Even such Democrats as Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, newly elected chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, decline to push their own proposals at this stage. Mr. Gephardt is the co-author, with New Jersey's Senator Bill Bradley, of a Democratic tax revision bill similar to the Treasury plan except that it includes some increase in revenue. ''I'm interested in tax reform and others are, too,'' Mr. Gephardt said in a telephone interview. ''But Democrats will be unwilling to suggest a tax increase unless the President does it first.'' Democratic leaders in the Senate, including Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the minority leader, and Alan Cranston of California, the minority whip, take the same position. Political Balance Sought Some, like Senator Cranston, hope that compromises will emerge eventually. They suggest that such Senate Republican leaders as Bob Dole, the majority leader-designate, will see that deep cuts in domestic spending have to be balanced politically by tax increases and cuts in the growth of military spending, and will press the President to give ground on these issues. Others are more skeptical that Mr. Reagan will give significant ground. They are prepared to push for votes on the severe cutbacks in domestic programs that the Administration is discussing. Their argument is that such votes will prove an embarrassment to Republicans in the 1986 elections. ''Timing is everything - not to get ahead of the public,'' Mr. Matthews said. ''The Speaker wants the President to bring the bad news to the people. The President has been telling the people for a year, 'You can have your cake and eat it, too.' Now he has to bring them the bad news that they can't. And the Speaker doesn't want to get between the President and the people on this.''

1403-> FLORIDA WASTE COMPANY CLEARED OF U.S. CHARGES INVOLVING PCB'S
A Jacksonville waste disposal company and two of its past officers who were charged with defrauding the Government were found not guilty by a Federal jury Tuesday. The defendants, the American Electric Corporation, Maxwell Cobb, its former president, and D. Michael Hamm, its past vice president, were found not guilty of 21 felony counts of false statement and mail fraud. The case was one of the biggest criminal suits involving environmental laws brought by the Federal Government. Most of the charges concerned 425 electric power transformers from 54 military bases around the country that the company had agreed to dispose of. The transformers contained polychlorinated biphenyls, a toxic pollutant. 44 Contaminated Machines Federal investigators found about 44 transformers with 500 or more parts per million of PCB's in the company's yard in Jacksonville after company records indicated the machines were supposed to have been buried in Federally licensed landfills. The Government said that company officials had removed identification tags from the machines to make toxic levels hard to trace and that they had intended to sell the copper inside the contaminated machines illegally. The company did not contest that the transformers were in its yard but said the Government had kept poor records of which transformers were highly contaminated and which were not. The defense further argued that company officials repeatedly asked officials at the Federal Environmental Protection Agency to clear up the record disputes but had received no reply. The transformers used polychlorinated biphenyls as coolants, but the Government banned the manufacture and sale of PCB's in 1979 after it was found to cause cancer in animals. Government Ineptitude Alleged Under the Federal Toxic Substances Control Act, coolant mixtures that contain PCB levels exceeding 500 parts per million are considered highly toxic and must be incinerated in Federally licensed plants. The machines that used the coolants must be buried in licensed landfills. On Tuesday, the closing day of the two-week trial, the lawyers for Mr. Hamm and Mr. Cobb attempted to paint a picture of two responsible men caught in a trap of Government ineptitude and pressure. Edward Booth, one of the lawyers, told the jury: ''Mr. Cobb saw to it that 397 of these transformers were legally disposed of. With the E.P.A., the F.B.I. and all these Federal agents investigating him, why would he leave some 40 transformers in the yard if he knew they were there illegally? He didn't know.'' Federal District Judge John H. Moore 2d moved the trial to Ocala after defense attorneys argued that it had received too much attention in Jacksonville for a fair trial there.

1404-> RIGHTS COALITION SEEN AS REVIVING IN NEW YORK CITY
Organizers of the daily protests in front of the South African Consulate in Manhattan say they believe that the apartheid issue has suddenly unified the city's black community and revitalized an old coalition of civil-rights leaders, union activists and a variety of religious groups. ''There is every indication that this effort is broadening quickly,'' said City Clerk David Dinkins, a black leader who on Monday was one of the first prominent city figures to be arrested at the consulate, at 425 Park Avenue, between 55th and 56th Streets. ''It is an issue that is so crystal clear that people of all disciplines and ethnic persuasions are becoming involved.'' But those involved in the protests appeared divided yesterday over whether that coalition would be able to stay together on other issues. Political Coalition Some black leaders have said privately that they hope the protests will be the catalyst for whites, Hispanic people and others whose support is needed in any electoral challenge to Mayor Koch next year. Others say that alliances formed against the apartheid system of racial segregation in South Africa will have little effect on local political efforts. ''Right now, we are focusing on South Africa, and South Africa alone,'' said Harriet R. Michel, chairman of the New York Support Committee for Trans-Africa, which has organized many of the protests at the consulate. ''There is no other agenda. Of course, it never hurts when the leadership of these groups gets together behind any issue.'' Prominent People Arrested Since the protests, which began in Washington on Thanksgiving Eve, were started in New York Monday, more than a dozen have been arrested. Among those arrested yesterday afternoon for blocking the door to the consulate were Bishop Emerson J. Moore, the only black Roman Catholic bishop in the city; Hazel N. Dukes, state chairman of the N.A.A.C.P., and Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, president of Bronx Community College. Also arrested were Dr. George W. Webber, former president of the New York Theological Seminary, and Melvin Lowe, president of the student center at City University. While protest organizers have said their efforts cut across racial boundaries, so far all of those who have blocked the door and been arrested - with the exception of Mr. Webber - have been black. ''That will change,'' said Mrs. Michel. ''Initially, we wanted to have black leadership come forward, to show solidarity. But in the next few days you will see whites and union leaders and others.'' Strain of Jackson Campaign In fact, some religious groups - particularly Jews - say they have seized upon the South Africa issue to repair their ties to the black community. In New York, those ties were especially strained last summer, during the Rev. Jesse Jackson's Presidential campaign. ''There is no question that the apartheid issue is an issue on which we are right, and which we must speak out,'' said Rabbi Balfour Brickner of the Stephen Wise Free Synogague on West 68th Street. ''But it has ancillary values. It is good for black-Jewish relations. It is important for blacks to see that Jews are concerned about issues important to blacks, just as we expect blacks to be concerned about issues important to Jews.'' Rabbi Brickner is one of a number of rabbis and clergy members who have agreed to deliver sermons about South Africa this weekend. But he admitted that Conservative and Orthodox Jewish groups, many of whom have noted Israel's trade ties to South Africa, would not join in the protests. ''I couldn't bring a resolution on this issue to the Synagogue Council of America,'' he said. ''The right wing would veto it before it got off the ground.'' Uncertain Strength Still unclear, members of the various protesting groups said yesterday, is how long the alliance will last. ''I am certain this is a starting pont,'' said James H. Bell, president of the New York chapter of the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists, which is sponsoring a protest at the consolate today. ''We can use it to strive toward the goal of a minority mayor for 1985.'' But Victor Gotbaum, executive director of District Council 37 of the Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, said talk of making the South Africa coalition a potent factor in the election ''is really silly.'' ''There is no relationship,'' he said. Nonetheless, Mr. Gotbaum said, he will join the protests on Monday, which is International Human Rights Day.

1405-> NITZE IS APPOINTED ADVISER TO SHULTZ IN GROMYKO TALKS
President Reagan announced today that Paul H. Nitze would serve as the adviser of Secretary of State George P. Shultz for next month's arms talks with Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko of the Soviet Union. The decision opens the way for Mr. Nitze, a 77-year old specialist on national security affairs, to become the negotiator if Mr. Gromyko agrees to a proposal for a permanent ''umbrella'' forum for arms control issues, a State Department official said. Mr. Nitze, who was the negotiator in the suspended Geneva talks on medium-range missiles in Europe, is to help work out a negotiable set of proposals on banning space weapons, reducing strategic arms, and limiting medium-range missiles, all of which are to be discussed with Mr. Gromyko. Impasse in Interagency Group The United States has been trying to develop a unified negotiating position within a Senior Arms Control Group, an interagency committee headed by Robert C. McFarlane, the White House national security adviser. Officials said that Mr. Shultz, as a result of working with Mr. Nitze, may now be in a position to discuss proposals directly with Mr. Reagan with a view to breaking an impasse that has developed within the Government. The idea that Mr. Shultz would go directly to the President has troubled Pentagon officials and conservatives in Congress who believe the State Department is too eager to win an accord. In an effort to ease that apprehension, the White House and the State Department said Mr. Shultz would invite all the members of the arms control committee to go to Geneva with him for next month's talks with Mr. Gromyko. But a senior State Department official said this did not mean Mr. Shultz would invite all of the agency representatives in the committee to sit in on his meetings with Mr. Gromyko. Mr. Nitze and some of his aides have already moved to a new office on the seventh floor of the State Department near Mr. Shultz's suite. The President's announcement, read by Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, was deferential to Mr. Shultz, who is to meet with Mr. Gromyko on Jan. 7 and 8. It said: ''At the recommendation of the Secretary of State, I have today asked Ambassador Paul Nitze to serve as the adviser to the Secretary for the Geneva talks. Ambassador Nitze has a long history of distinguished service to this country and I am very pleased that he has accepted.'' The announcement left unclear the status of Kenneth W. Adelman, the director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, and of Edward L. Rowny, the negotiator in the suspended Geneva talks on reduction of strategic, or long-range, nuclear arms. Mr. Adelman, by law, is supposed to be the arms control adviser to the President and the Secretary of State, but has not been close to Mr. Shultz. Mr. Rowny, as the negotiator in one of the two parallel sets of arms talks that were being held in Geneva until a year ago, was regarded as Mr. Nitze's equal. But now Mr. Nitze is perceived as ranking above Mr. Rowny. Mr. Nitze, who has served in Government posts since before World War II, has a reputation of being tough toward the Soviet Union. He was an advocate of more military spending in the 1950's. But he has also been regarded as committed to equitable arms accords. Because of these dual perceptions about him, he has been acceptable both to conservatives and to liberals. In an effort in 1982 to end an impasse on medium-range missiles in Europe, Mr. Nitze secretly worked out with his Soviet counterpart, Yuli A. Kvitsinsky, a compromise proposal during a walk in the woods outside Geneva. Under that proposal, the Russians were to reduce the size of their SS-20 force to 75 missiles, each with three warheads, and the United States would deploy 75 cruise missile launchers, each with four missiles, instead of the planned 464 cruise-missile launchers and 108 Pershing 2 ballistic-missile launchers now being deployed. Neither negotiator won the backing of his Government for that proposal. In November 1983, after the North Atlantic Treaty Organization went ahead with plans to begin deployment of the new American medium-range missiles in Europe, in the absence of a negotiated agreement, the Soviet side suspended negotiations. The Russians also cut off the strategic arms talks. Last month the United States and the Soviet Union announced that Mr. Shultz and Mr. Gromyko would hold talks on the suspended talks as well as on banning space weapons, a subject of concern to the Russians in light of American plans to develop defensive weapons for use against satellites and incoming missiles. Chernenko Hopeful on Talks MOSCOW, Dec. 5 (AP) - Konstantin U. Chernenko said in a letter published today that he hoped the renewed arms talks with the United States would lead to ''mutually acceptable understandings'' on nuclear and space weapons. Replying to a letter from the International Physicians for Prevention of Nuclear War, an antiwar group, the Soviet leader alluded to the scheduled meeting between Foreign Minister Gromyko and Secretary of State Shultz. (In Washington, the State Department reacted promptly to Mr. Chernenko's latest statement, saying that the United States affirmed its commitment to ''reaching a common understanding'' as a basis for future agreements. The State Departemnt reiterated the American view that ''the most urgent problem is reductions in existing nuclear weapons.'') Mr. Chernenko's letter, as made public by the Tass press agency, said: ''The Soviet Union, firmly determined to achieve a major breakthrough in reducing the danger of an outbreak of war, looks to the forthcoming Soviet-United States negotiations with a view to achieving mutually acceptable understandings on the entire set of questions related to nuclear and space weapons.''

1406-> SAME CHEMICAL INJURED 31 PEOPLE IN UPSTATE SPILL
About 30 students and a teacher suffered eye irritation when the same chemical that killed more than 1,000 people in India spilled three weeks ago from an FMC Corporation plant in Middleport, a small town in western New York. The spill, which took place on Nov. 15 at 9:45 A.M. led to the evacuation of the plant and of the 438 students and 40 staff members of the Middleport Elementary School, located about 500 yards from the plant. James Minsker, the employee relations manager at the plant, said that the major reasons why the spill did not cause greater injury was that only 30 gallons of methyl isocyanate were involved. He said a team with respirator masks was immediately sent to the site of the spill to begin a cleanup. He also said the company alerted its staff and the school district, which has a radio donated by the company connected with the plant. Geraldine Lupo, the school principal, said in a telephone interview that when she heard some children had eye irritation she called the school district and was told there had been a spillage at the plant. Children Were Evacuated She immediately began to put into effect procedures worked out three years ago with the safety director of FMC in case of an emergency. She said all the children were taken out of the rooms and all the vents leading to the outside were turned off. She said that nurses from the company came to the school within minutes to begin washing the eyes of affected pupils and teachers. She added that men from the company came to inspect the building and although they determined the contamination was not serious they recommended that the building be evacuated as a precautionary measure. She recalled that within about 25 minutes all the students and teachers had been evacuated in school buses. Of the company she said: ''I cannot criticize them at all. They were quick in their reaction and not concerned about their public relations image.'' Criticism of the Company Those that needed further treatment for eye irritation were taken to a nearby hall of the volunteer fire department. Criticism of the company came from two leaders of the fire department, Scott Kempton, the fire chief, and George Homesberger, the first assistant chief. Both said the company should have notified them earlier of the spill, which would have given them more time to alert companies from surrouding districts for help. Mr. Minsker said the company notified the fire department about 20 minutes after the spill. He said procedures were now being worked on to deal with the complaint of the fire chiefs. He said the spill was the only one at the plant during which it has been handling the highly toxic chemical for 15 years. He said that the spillage was caused when a maintenance crew installed a pump and it failed when it was turned on.

1407-> SCOUTING ; Commuter Coach
There could be no better illustration of the way the sports world has changed over the years than the story that Bob Davies told yesterday at a Madison Square Garden luncheon. Davies, an all-America basketball player at Seton Hall in the early 1940's, returned from service in the Navy in World War II to a job as a guard for the Rochester Royals in the old National Basketball League. But helping get a league started was not the only mission for Davies, who has long been considered the model for Clair Bee's prototype sports hero in the Chip Hilton series of books. His alma mater had dropped basketball during the war, and its coach, Honey Russell, had left to direct the program at Manhattan. So when the Seton Hall Pirates restored basketball, they turned to Davies to lead them. But, Bob, weren't you playing for the Royals? ''I took a lot of overnight sleepers,'' he said during his visit to New York, where he was honored as a member of a 13-player team of the greatest players in 50 years of college basketball at the Garden. ''We won our first 20 games,'' Davies said. ''One game I missed was against Rider. We never expected to lose to them, so I didn't come down for that one and let Bobby Wanzer and Pep Saul, two of our players, coach the team. We won - by a point.'' The Pirates weren't hurt by their coach's occasional absence, winning 24 games and losing 3. But there was no postseason bid - luckily for Davies, who was busy. The Royals went to the league final, where they lost to George Mikan's Chicago Gears team. And Davies had one more responsibility: You see, Seton Hall had this baseball team. . . .

1410-> DUTCH PARLIMENT BACKS A PROPOSAL TO DELAY MISSILES
The Dutch Parliament concluded a 17- hour debate early today by approving a Government plan that will delay the stationing of United States cruise missiles on Dutch soil for two years beyond the scheduled 1986 deadline. In a show of hands, 79 legislators supported the plan, intended to avert a rupture in the coalition Cabinet of Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers. Seventy-one legislators opposed the plan. There were no abstentions. The vote came a day after the Foreign Ministers of seven Western European member nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, including the Netherlands, met in Paris to discuss ways to strengthen the alliance. Plan Was Announced on June 1 The Dutch Government's Christian- Democratic-Liberal coalition, in a six- point plan announced June 1, pledged to accept cruise missiles in 1988, two years later than the original schedule, if the Soviet Union continues deploying SS-20 missiles. The Government said the number of missiles, planned at 48, would depend on whether an accord on limitation was reached between the United States and the Soviet Union. The talks have been suspended since late last year. It was the first time that the Dutch had formally agreed to accept the missiles under the alliance's 1979 plan. But it was also the first time a member nation backed away from the deployment schedule. In a final appeal for support before the vote, Prime Minister Lubbers said the plan was intended to gain more time for a possible Soviet-American agreement limiting medium-range missiles in Europe. Shortly before the vote, the police dispersed a crowd of several thousand demonstrators, who hammered and drummed rhythmically around a bonfire in the courtyard of the Binnenhof, the Parliament building. At one point during the debate, a demonstrator managed to get into the chamber, leaped on the Prime Minister's desk and shouted, ''Stop this comedy - the missiles will not come!'' The Government plan was generally supported by the Liberal Party and most of the Christian Democrats, and opposed by the Labor Party and the Christian Democratic defectors. The Government sought support in the 150- seat lower house from conservative Protestant splinter groups that fear that a legislative defeat would pave the way for new elections and a Labor Party victory. Double Dealing' Charged During the debate, Joop den Uyl, the leader of the opposition Labor Party, called the plan ''double dealing'' and said the offer not to deploy if the Russians halted the stationing SS-20's was ''not seriously prepared and cannot work.'' Bert de Vries, the Christian Democrats' legislative leader, echoed that concern while calling for support of the plan. He asked that Foreign Minister Hans van den Broek be sent to Moscow to explain what the Netherlands expected and to urge the Russians to return to the Geneva arms talks. Britain, West Germany and Italy have begun to deploy nuclear missiles as part of a plan to install 572 medium- range cruise and Pershing 2 missiles over five years as a counterweight to Soviet SS-20 missiles already in place. The Soviet Union broke off the talks after Britain and West Germany began their deployment in November. Moscow has said that it will not return to the talks until the status quo before the Western deployment is restored. Western diplomats said the Dutch decision would not shake the resolve of other governments to stick to the deployment schedule. Of the five countries that agreed to accept missiles, Belgium has not yet voted approval. But some Western officials fear that the Dutch decision will encourage the Soviet Union to rely increasingly on resistance to the missiles in the West instead of seeking an arms agreement. Manfred W"orner, the West German Defense Minister, said last week that the Dutch decision would send the ''wrong signal'' to Moscow and ''raise doubts about the determination and unity of the Western alliance.''

1411-> No Headline
Mending the Medicaid Quilt A patchwork of Federal and state programs pay medical insurance for America's poor - but the patches fail to cover some important health problems. For three especially needy groups, coverage may be an accident of geography: single women's first pregnancies, women in couples whose principal wage earner is unemployed and infants up to one year old are not covered by various states. Congress can supply the missing patches with the Child Health Assurance Program now before a House- Senate conference committee. The Federal Medicaid program pays bills for the poor jointly with the states, which set eligibility criteria. Coverage for pregnant women and infants is deficient in 35 states. The House version of the child health bill would close that gap, making up to 300,000 persons eligible in the first year. The Administration and Senate conferees resist, on the ground that this would burden the Federal deficit. But denying benefits to poor pregnant women and their babies only generates greater costs later for ailments arising from inadequate prenatal and infant care. One especially expensive problem is mental retardation, whose costs spread far beyond the hospital. Aid for the mentally retarded is one of the fastest-growing Medicaid expenses. The price of the proposed program is not onerous. House conferees offer a compromise costing $200 million in the first three years. They understand that insuring better health for poor mothers and their infants is a sound, affordable investment. Their Senate colleagues and the Administration should reach the same conclusion.

1412-> SCOUTING; Abner Brothers Have Big Week
This is a big week for the Abner brothers of Mechanicsburg, Pa., at least as far as New York baseball is concerned. For one thing, Shawn Abner, whom the Mets made the top choice in the recent draft of amateur players, has been working out all week with the rookie team at Kingsport, Tenn., and will make his professional debut tonight, against Bristol, as the Appalachian League season gets under way. ''He looks outstanding,'' said his manager, Dan Radison. ''Everything he does, he does well. I think we picked the right guy.'' The 17-year-old Abner played the outfield at Mechanicsburg Area High School, and Radison plans to start him in center field tonight. But the Mets hope that he will develop into a shortstop, and so, after a break-in period of a few games, the manager will begin giving him some time in the infield. Meanwhile, Abner's older brother, Ben, a power-hitting outfielder who is a junior at Georgia Southern and who was drafted by the Montreal Expos, is touring the country with the United States Olympic team. The Olympians play the South Korean national team Saturday afternoon at Shea Stadium, and, if Ben's performance Tuesday night was any indication, New York fans could see some fireworks. Against a squad of Pittsburgh-area collegians, he hit a shot that cleared the fence of Three Rivers Stadium, a three-run homer that was the biggest blow in the Olympians' 10-2 victory.

1415-> TV REVIEWS; 'THE LIONS OF ETOSHA,' WILDLIFE DOCUMENTARY
''THE LIONS OF ETOSHA: King of the Beasts'' is about as good a wildlife documentary as you will see on television and almost certainly a better film about lions than you are likely to see again. It tell us everything we wanted to know about lions except, perhaps, how dangerous they are to people. Blame this on the film makers' enthusiasm for their subject. The one-hour documentary will be seen on CBS at 8 o'clock tonight. ''The Lions of Etosha'' is about a single pride of lions, filmed over five years, in Etosha National Park in Namibia. The pride, like all prides, is matriarchal, made up of six adult lionesses, their cubs and two resident males. The lionesses are all related to one another; the lions are brothers, although not related to the lionesses. Male lions stay with the pride until they are displaced by other male lions. Lionesses stay forever. Meanwhile, much of the beautifully photographed film is of lions hunting, marauding and killing. Lions, James Earl Jones, the very solemn narrator says, are ''literally without peers, the deadliest, most efficient hunters in Africa.'' On the other hand, it is the technique of the hunt, rather than the tearing of flesh, that most interests Des and Jen Bartlett, the film makers. This will be a blessing if you are watching with small children. They will be unhappy to see the lions bring down zebras and graceful springboks, but the screen is never drenched with gore. Thus, we see lions circling their prey, or else sitting quietly, waiting for the prey to come to them. The lions appear to be tacticians. They center their lives on the hunt. When they are not hunting, they are either being gregarious and familial - the only members of the cat family to act this way - or else they are dozing. Lions, Mr. Jones says, may be the laziest animals in Africa. The film also has nice footage of other animals, especially elephants. The film makers made their documentary with the aid of a camera blind - an imitation termite mound buttressed with steel plates - that they erected next to a water hole. The elephants, who are also matriarchal, were unaware they were being filmed. In one lovely sequence we see a six-ton elephant carefully stepping over a very small tortoise. Happily, the film doesn't sentimentalize or anthropomorphize lions. Some of the background music may be a little cute; some of the narration may be a little awe-struck. Still, you can't have everything, and ''The Lions of Etosha'' is rewarding television.

1416-> CUBS SEND HALL TO INDIANS IN 7-MAN DEAL
The Chicago Cubs, first in their division, and the Cleveland Indians, last in theirs, made a seven-player trade today in which the Cubs acquired the pitcher Rick Sutcliffe and the catcher Ron Hassey, and sent the outfielders Mel Hall and Joe Carter to the Indians. The Cubs also got the reliever George Frazier and sent two minor league pitchers, Don Schulze and Darryl Banks, to Cleveland. Sutcliffe (4-5) will fill in for Dick Ruthven, who is on the disabled list because of arm surgery, and Scott Sanderson, who has been sidelined with back spasms. Hassey will fill in for Steve Lake, who has been out with hepatitis. Hall has a .277 batting average with 4 home runs and 22 runs batted in. ''We hate to give away good players,'' said General Manager Dallas Green with his arm around Hall, after the Cubs beat the Montreal Expos today, 7-4. ''But we ran into a situation we could do very little about.We got two pitchers who are necessary additions to our staff, and the making of the trade rested on Hall being part of it.'' Hassey is hitting .255 with no homers and 19 runs batted in. Frazier, a former Yankee, has a 3-2 record with a 3.65 earned-run average and 1 save in 22 relief appearances. In today's game at Wrigley Field, Leon Durham doubled home one run and Jody Davis doubled home two runs in the sixth, leading the Cubs to victory. Tim Stoddard (4-1) won in relief. Gary Lucas (0-1) was the loser. Durham and Sandberg each got three hits for Chicago in a game that was delayed 1 hour 47 minutes by rain in the fourth inning. Lee Smith pitched the last two innings and earned his 12th save. The Cubs did not make an error, setting a club record of nine consecutive errorless games. Giants 10, Dodgers 5 LOS ANGELES (UPI) - The Giants scored seven runs on eight consecutive hits in the fifth. Mike Marshall had a grand slam for Los Angeles. After Bob Welch, the Dodger starter, and Manager Tom Lasorda were ejected in the fourth, the Giants shelled Carlo Diaz, Burt Hooton (0-2) and Orel Hershiser. Randy Lerch, the third San Francisco pitcher, raised his record to 3-1. Phils 4, Cardinals 1 PHILADELPHIA (AP) - Jerry Koosman pitched a five-hitter and his first complete game in 13 starts as Philadelphia beat St. Louis. Koosman evened his record at 6-6 as he struck out four and walked one. The St. Louis starter, Dave LaPoint (6-7), was the loser. Koosman last hurled a complete game with the White Sox just one day more than a year ago. On June 12, 1983, he went the route in beating Oakland. It was the first victory for the Phillies over the Cardinals in six games this season. The game was delayed 56 minutes by rain in the bottom of the fifth. Reds 5, Astros 4 HOUSTON (AP) - Dave Concepcion's two-out run-scoringsingle in the 11th inning lifted Cincinnati over Houston. Bob Owchinko (3-2), was the winner in relief for the Reds, while Frank DiPino (1-5) was the loser. Gary Redus led off the 11th with a walk and moved to second on Eddie Milner's sacrifice bunt. After an intentional walk to Cesar Cedeno and Dave Parker's fly out to center, Concepcion lined his single over the head of the shortstop Craig Reynolds to score Redus. The victory broke a five- game losing streak for the Reds and a three-game winning streak for the Astros. The Astros loaded the bases in the ninth with none out but failed to score. Jerry Mumphrey led off with a double and moved to third on n errant pickoff attempt by the Reds' reliever, Bill Scherrer. Scherrer then intentionally walked Terry Puhl and Phil Garner to load the bases. But the Reds escaped trouble when Ted Power relieved and struck out two pinch-hitters, Denny Walling and Kevin Bass, and then got Bill Doran to ground out to second.

1417-> EARLY JUNE AUTO SALES UP BY 0.3%
The six major American auto manufacturers reported today that sales of new cars edged up only three-tenths of 1 percent in early June from the 1983 period. The sales are figured on a daily selling rate basis. The companies - General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, American Motors, American Honda and Volkswagen of America - said sales totaled 187,482 units in the June 1-10 period, or 23,435 units a day, compared with 210,188 and a rate of 23,353 daily a year earlier. There were eight selling days in the 1984 period versus nine last year. The seasonally adjusted annual selling rate fell to 7.8 million from 8.6 million in May, but was up slightly from the level of 7.4 million in the 1983 period. Some analysts said the slow start in June was a ''payback'' for stronger-than-expected sales in May. Many analysts have predicted that the annual rate could swing widely in the next few months. Cars Seen in Short Supply ''This certainly does not indicate that sales will be off for the rest of the year,'' said Arvid Jouppi, an industry analyst. ''Mostly it is due to a shortage of automobiles. The companies just scheduled too few cars into the model year.'' Mr. Jouppi also said that rising interest rates are now having some impact on sales and that exports from Japan were up sharply in April, indicating that those cars may just now be reaching the retail customer. The import car companies report sales only at the end of the month. In the first selling period of June, the General Motors Corporation reported a 5.2 percent decline, to 111,037 units from 131,729 last year; daily sales fell to 13,381 from 14,636. The No. 1 auto maker has been particularly hard hit by shortages of its best-selling cars, ending May with a 38-day supply. An inventory of 60 days to 65 days is considered desirable. Ford Up 13.1 Percent The Ford Motor Company said its sales were up 13.1 percent in the period, to 46,218, or 5,777 a day, from 45,951, or 5,106 a day last year. The Chrysler Corporation reported sales of 23,345 in the period, or 2,918 a day, up 4.2 percent from a daily rate of 2,800 a year earlier and total sales of 25,197. The American Motors Corporation estimated its sales at 3,250, or 406 a day, up 1.5 percent from 3,600, or 400 a day last year. Volkswagen of America said its sales plummeted 55.2 percent, to 831 cars, or 104 daily, from 2,093, or 232 a day, last year. In contrast, the American Honda Motor Company sold 2,081 units, or 260 a day, up 44.4 percent from last year, when it sold 1,618, or 180 daily. A year ago, the company was just reaching full production for the first time at its Ohio plant. Total domestic sales in the Jan. 1-June 10 period, with 136 selling days this year and last, were up 29.2 percent from a year earlier, to 3,706,455. G.M. sales of 2,208,666 were up 27.5 percent; Ford sales rose 38.2 percent, to 876,208; Chrysler delivered 444,218 new cars, up 18.7 percent, and A.M.C. sales fell 6.4 percent, to 82,806 units. Volkswagen sales in the year-to- date period were up 9.4 percent, to 38,133, and American Honda reported sales of 56,424.

1420-> LISTEN TO 'MR. ICE CREAM' AND YOU'LL LICK YOUR LIPS
When pressed for the source of the best ice cream, the man known around here as ''Mr. Ice Cream'' finds he must tell the truth. ''I'd have to say it's the University Creamery,'' said Philip G. Keeney, head of the department of food science at Pennsylvania State University, as well as the creamery's overseer. Dr. Keeney's word on this subject is not taken lightly. For 30 years he has been teaching the basics of ice cream science both to students and to businesses, many of which send executives and production employees to his annual ''short course,'' in January. Certainly, there was no one at the campus shop the other day who would disagree with his judgment. Not Ethel Johnson, an 81-year-old visitor from Altoona, and certainly not 20-month-old Devon Swancer, who licked her lips as her mother, Laura, spoon fed her from a cone. ''It's absolutely the best,'' said Mrs. Johnson. ''Nobody else comes close.'' ''It's been one of my favorites all my life,'' said Mrs. Swancer. Generations of Penn State graduates have agreed, and many alumni and other visitors order half-gallons to take home. The whim is costly, however. The half-gallon costs $2.60, but the maximum packing in dry ice, for 12 hours, costs $4.10 more. The only place to buy the creamery's ice cream is at the creamery itself, although the formula may be obtained by writing Dr. Keeney in care of Borland Laboratories, University Park, Pa. 16802. About 100,000 gallons are produced every year, including 400,000 to 500,000 cones. The quality of ice cream, Dr. Keeney said, is usually judged by its richness, the butterfat content, and by its density, the amount of air pumped into it. The ''super-premiums,'' he said, usually contain about 16 percent butterfat and the ''overrun,'' or air content added, is 20 to 70 percent of the original volume. ''You pump the air in and meter it,'' Dr. Keeney said. ''To be ice cream, it has to contain air.'' Any air content lower than 20 percent would make ice cream begin to taste like ice cubes. Some compromises are necessary, Dr. Keeney said, to keep prices low enough for students, 60 cents for a large cone. The ''overrun'' in the creamery's ice cream is about 80 percent and the butterfat is about 14 percent. Freshness is a major reason for the popularity of the creamery's ice cream, he said. The milk is produced by cows used in Penn State's agricultural program, and most of the ice cream is eaten within four days of production. ''We had a fellow who used to say, 'Four days ago this was grass,' '' Dr. Keeney said as he sampled a cone of butter pecan.

1421-> TERRELL STOPS HIS SLIDE
An evening after the Mets' most important power hitter hit his first home run in more than a month, the pitcher the team most depends upon ended a five-week-long losing streak in extraordinary fashion tonight. Walt Terrell, the loser of his last four starts, pitched a complete game, scattered 8 hits and had 2 hits himself for a 3-0 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates. It was Terrell's first shutout of the season, the third of his two-year career and his second complete game this season. Monday, Darryl Strawberry, the 22-year-old right fielder, went 3 for 3, after having gone 25 for 96 in 26 previous games, and drove in three runs - two on the home run - as the Mets won, 4-2. Strawberry, who also had a double, had not hit a home run since April 27. Terrell had not won since April 29. ''Before the game I made up my mind that win or lose I was going to forget about it,'' Terrell said of his losing streak. In that span he pitched 25.2 innings and gave up 14 earned runs. ''It's a relief,'' the 26-year-old right-hander said. ''I was getting frustrated, and I was beginning to feel the pressure.'' So was Manager Dave Johnson, who is counting on Terrell to be the stabilizer of a young pitching staff that includes Ed Lynch (5-1), the 19- year-old Dwight Gooden (4-3) and Ron Darling (4-3). Terrell (4-5), who won three of his first four starts, was a key to the Mets' fast start this season. Asked if Terrell's performance tonight was as significant as Strawberry's on Monday, Johnson answered emphatically, ''No question. No question about it.'' Terrell escaped from three jams with either a strikeout or one of the Mets' four double plays. ''Actually I felt in a groove after the first inning,'' he said. ''That usually doesn't happen. Usually it takes three innings - if I'm around that long.'' The Mets and Pirates combined for eight double plays tonight - one short of the National League record. But the Mets' double plays proved more timely. With Johnny Ray on first base with none out in the ninth inning, Tony Pena lined Terrell's pitch toward right field. But the second baseman Wally Backman snared the drive, then wheeled and tossed out Ray at first for the double play. Benny Distefano flied out to end the game. Two innings earlier, with a runner on first and none out, Backman jumped and caught Lee Lacy's liner. Backman wheeled and tossed out Pena at first. ''I needed all the help I could get,'' Terrell said, admitting that he had gotten tired in the eighth inning. ''Double plays, strikeouts, anything.'' Terrell, who was batting .042 before the game, the lowest among the Met pitchers, went 2 for 3 and helped himself with a sixth-inning double that led to the second run. After the Pirates threatened by loading the bases in the fourth but failing to score, the Mets scored in the fifth with the help of an unusual play. George Foster walked and went to second when a tight pitch that Hubie Brooks was trying to avoid, hit his bat and skipped in front of the plate for a sacrifice bunt. Foster went to third on a passed ball and scored on Mike Fitzgerald's sacrifice fly to center. The Mets made it 2-0 in the sixth after Terrell led of with a double to left-center. He moved to third on a bounce out to second by Backman. Mookie Wilson hit a routine grounder to the mound, but the losing pitcher, Jose DeLeon (3-3), held the ball too long and Wilson beat the throw for a single. Hernandez followed with a smash to second that bounced off Ray's glove, allowing Terrell to score. The Mets scored their final run in the eighth inning when Backman singled, stole his ninth consecutive base and scored on Hernandez's double. Third Complete Game for Staff Terrell gave the pitching staff only its third complete game this season, compared with eight for Pittsburgh. Dwight Gooden has the other. Two of the Pirate pitchers - John Tudor and Larry McWiliams have seven between them. Tudor (4-2) has four and McWilliams (2-3) three. DeLeon has the other.

1423-> CHICAGO 'COUNCIL WARS' DRAG INTO INTERMISSION
The special City Council meeting on Thursday was to have been the final curtain call before Chicago's longest-running political show, known locally as ''Council Wars,'' shut down for the summer. But a majority of Council members, 28 to be exact, boycotted the meeting, prompting Mayor Harold Washington to call for another showdown today. Today only 18 of the 50 aldermen showed up. After meeting for less than 10 minutes, the pro-Washington and anti-Washington factions left, each accusing the other of being pigheaded. And so the show was postponed until the actors were available for another performance, presumably after the Democratic National Convention in San Francisco next week, for which many of them are departing. Alderman Clifford P. Kelley, a Washington ally, said of the goings-on: ''It's a ridiculous effort on their part to just either make it look as though he cannot run the city or simply a power play to take his authority. Neither will happen.'' Seeks to Read Statements As Mr. Washington looked out over the nearly empty Council chambers this afternoon, he began to read a statement. Immediately Alderman Edward M. Burke, a copy of the Council bylaws in hand, tried to shout him down. Mr. Washington plunged ahead, as those assembled laughed. Mr. Burke shouted ''This is a joke!'' threw up his hands in exasperation and sank into his seat. The Mayor read: ''I, as Mayor, cannot allow this city to slide back into antiquated, politicized contract letting. This city can only prosper and grow by establishing a climate of honesty and fairness for business. I am, therefore, calling on business, labor, civic, religious and all other reform-minded groups of citizens in this city and perhaps beyond, to join me in convincing the City Council majority to withdraw its demands for control of city purchasing, which it is not by right entitled to.'' On its face, what is at issue is whether this Mayor, unlike his predecessors, will have to submit for Council approval every contract worth more than $50,000 in three public works projects that total more than $800 million. Mr. Washington has threatened to veto ordinances authorizing the sale of bonds to finance them. The projects are a rapid transit line for the Southwest Side, improvements of a second one, and another runway at O'Hare International Airport. Change Made in 1955 James D. Montgomery, the Corporation Counsel, said a 1955 law removed the awarding of public works contracts from a Council that was perceived as being very corrupt. ''It is not unheard of that aldermen in the city of Chicago have shaken down business people,'' Mr. Montgomery said. ''It seems we should not go back to that archaic system in which that kind of situation was rampant.'' As in most issues that that have arisen since Mr. Washington's election last year, what is at stake is the allocation of power between a Mayor who came into office promising reform and a recalcitrant Council that has been attempting to flex its own muscle. To give the Council veto power over contracts, Mr. Montgomery said, would ''blackjack'' the Mayor and stymy city business. ''It's a bottom line issue on which the Mayor can't bend,'' Mr Montgomery said. ''If he did, he may as well throw in the towel.'' But Mr. Burke has accused Mr. Washington of engaging in ''phony reform'' while actually trying to avoid Council scrutiny so he can award contracts to his own cronies. The latest variation on the ''Council Wars'' began Monday with a vote that went strictly along factional lines. It was ''the 29,'' as the majority led by Mr. Burke and Edward R. Vrdolyak is known, against ''the 21,'' as Mr. Washington's supporters are known. For several months now Mr. Burke has played the leading role for the majority while Mr. Vrdolyak has remained in the background. City Hall watchers have said he is staying out of the spotlight to avoid angering blacks before November. Black votes will be crucial then in not only the Presidential election but also in the Senate race between Charles H. Percy, the Republican incumbent, and Representative Paul Simon, his Democratic challenger, and in the Cook County State's Attorney's race that will have the Democratic incumbent, Richard M. Daley, facing a tough race against Richard J. Brzeczek, a Republican. Among citizens who came to watch today's session, however, there was a growing impatience with ''the 29.'' ''This insults our intelligence,'' Joe Alden, a spectator, said. ''There were in here yesterday for, what was it? Five minutes. They ought to get down to business now. I think it stinks. I think they should give the Mayor a chance.''

1424-> BETHLEHEM STEEL POSTS A PROFIT
The Bethlehem Steel Corporation, the nation's second-largest steelmaker, yesterday reported net income of $24 million, or 40 cents a share, for the second quarter - its first profit since the fourth quarter of 1981. Bethelehem had a loss of $70.7 million in last year's second quarter. Donald H. Trautlein, Bethlehem's chairman, attributed the turnaround to cost-cutting and to slightly higher prices and shipments in the latest quarter. Bethlehem's revenues increased to $1.51 billion, up 22.8 percent from $1.23 billion a year before. Despite the profit, Mr. Trautlein said Bethlehem's results ''continue to be severely impaired by the effects of record steel imports'' and by low demand for construction-related steel. He predicted that his company, which has filed a petition asking President Reagan to restrict steel imports, would barely break even in the third quarter because of a recent sharp drop in steel orders. He said higher imports, a seasonal downturn and reductions of steel inventories had caused the decline in orders. ''In the third quarter, they'll be affected by the same general slowdown that the rest of the industry is seeing,'' said John C. Tumazos, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Company. ''Given the tough environment they 're in, they're doing a pretty good job.'' Mr. Tumazos estimated that Bethlehem's steel shipments, which totaled 2.52 million tons in the second quarter, would be 15 percent less in the third quarter. The steel industry is doing better after two years of losses. In the last week Inland Steel reported a profit of $24.7 million, National Intergroup $24.6 million and Wheeling-Pittsburgh $5.3 million. Armco had a net loss of $14.1 million, despite a profit from steel operations. United States Steel, the nation's No. 1 producer, is scheduled to announce its results early next week and is expected to report a profit. Bethlehem ''appeared to be operating profitably in steel in the latter part of the second quarter,'' said Wendy Beale, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. She noted that Bethlehem's steel division had operating income of $21 million in the quarter, including $20 million from inventory liquidation. ''When you see relatively strong spending on construction and machine tools and you don't see it translated into orders for heavier steels,'' she said, ''you have to conclude that much of it is going to foreign steel and equipment.'' Phelps Dodge The Phelps Dodge Corporation, the nation's second-largest copper producer, announced a loss of $20.7 million for the second quarter, in contrast to a profit of $300,000 a year earlier. The New York-based company, which is involved in a long and bitter strike in Arizona, reported sales of $255.8 million for the second quarter, down 9.3 percent from $282.1 million. Phelps Dodge, which has joined in a copper industry petition seeking relief from imports, said consumption was stronger in the latest quarter but was offset by extremely weak prices. The company said copper prices on the New York Commodity Exchange averaged 64.3 cents a pound in the second quarter, down from 76.6 cents a year before. ''After accounting for inflation, prices are the lowest they've been in 50 years because of world oversupply,'' said David B. Healy, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ''We're well into a recovery, and there's good demand for copper. Yet copper prices are so low that even Phelps Dodge, which has some of the nation's lowest-cost mines, can't make money.'' AMAX AMAX Inc., the diversified mineral company based in Greenwich, Conn., reported net income of $9.8 million, or 6 cents a share, for the second quarter, in contrast to a loss of $21.2 million a year earlier. The company said its sales were $651.4 million in the latest quarter, up 14.7 percent from $567.8 million. AMAX said its earnings improved mainly because aluminum prices and shipments were above the levels of a year earlier and because lower costs and higher shipments had reduced its molybdenum losses.

1430-> COMMODORE TRADE SECRETS
A Pennsylvania judge today temporarily extended an injunction that prevents four former employees of Commodore International Ltd. from revealing any Commodore trade secrets at their new jobs with Atari Inc. Judge M. Joseph Melody Jr., who issued the original injunction earlier this week in response to a Commodore suit, said the order would be ''extended in full force'' pending further notice. No new hearing date was set. The suit charged that the four former employees had stolen trade secrets with an intent to divulge them to Atari, a rival home-computer maker that was recently acquired by Commodore's former president, Jack Tramiel. The suit, filed Tuesday, contends that the defendants possess copies of specifications for products that are ''unique to Commodore'' and provide an advantage over the competition. Neither Mr. Tramiel nor his new company was named in the suit.

1431-> IRAN SAYS IT WILL RETALIATE IF EGYPT HARASSES ITS SHIPS
Iran warned today that it would delay ships in the Persian Gulf if Egypt or its Western allies continued to stop and search Iranian ships in the Suez Canal. The warning was issued by Hojatolislam Hashemi Rafsanjani, Speaker of the Iranian Parliament, during a weekly Friday prayer meeting at Teheran University, according to reports from the Iranian capital by The Associated Press and Reuters. Hojatolislam Rafsanjani's remarks came as the Shreveport, an American ship carrying four minesweeping helicopters, began searching at Egypt's request for mines and underwater explosives in the southern part of the Gulf of Suez off Egypt's Red Sea coast. Hojatolislam Rafsanjani made his remarks two days after Egyptian officials disclosed that six Iranian ships and other vessels from ''suspect'' nations had been stopped and searched before they were permitted to cross the canal. 17 Ships Reported Damaged The Iranian warning also came four days after President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt backed away from his earlier charge that Iran might have been responsible for laying mines in the Red Sea and Gulf of Suez. Earlier in the week, the Egyptian President said he suspected that both Libya and Iran might be involved. A few days later, Mr. Mubarak said that he viewed Libya as a key suspect. He added that he ''hoped'' that Iran was not involved. Underwater explosions in Red Sea waters have damaged at least 17 ships, according to Lloyd's of London, the insurance exchange. In his address today, Hojatolislam Rafsanjani repeated that Iran had not been involved in mining the Red Sea, nor did it wish to do so. But, he told a crowd estimated at 500,000, ''if our ship is delayed in the Suez Canal under the pretext of searching, and if our needed goods are delayed, one ship belonging to your gang will be delayed in the Strait of Hormuz in retaliation.'' ''If you have the sensitive Suez Canal and we have to pass through it, we have the Strait of Hormuz and many have to go through there,'' the Hojatolislam said, according to a translation of his provided by Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency. Egyptian officials said this week that about 100 Iranian ships pass through the canal each year. The Hojatolislam's use of the term Egypt's ''gang'' was interpreted here as a reference to the United States, France and Britain, which are participating in the minesweeping operation at the request of Egypt and Saudi Arabia. The Strait of Hormuz, about 50 miles wide, links the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. About 20 percent of the Western world's oil supplies pass through the strait. U.S. Vows to Keep Strait Open Iran has repeatedly stated that it does not wish to close the strategic waterway but would retaliate if its own oil exports were blocked, or its major supply terminal at Kharg Island was attacked by Iraq. Since late March, Iraq has stepped up its air attacks on ships loading oil at Kharg and other Iranian oil terminals in an effort to force Iran to negotiate an end to the war, which began in September 1980. The United States has warned that it would not permit the Strait of Hormuz or other vital international waterways to be closed to commercial shipping. Because Hojatolislam Rafsanjani represents Iran's poltical and religious leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, on Iran's powerful Supreme Defense Council, his statements are closely followed by diplomats in Iran and the few Western reporters permitted to travel there. Ayatollah Khomeini denied last week that Iran was involved in the mining incidents, asserting that such acts were incompatible with the spirit and teachings of Islam. Hojatolislam Rafsanjani, in his remarks today, said retaliation was consistent with Islamic principles. ''We believe that our continued life and the evolution of our society depends on not forgetting this Islamic principle and not letting our enemies be in peace without it,'' he said. Egypt Backs Iraq in War Egypt has supported Iraq in its war with Iran. But it has also tried to play a mediating role by promoting an initiative aimed at resolving the war through negotiation. Iran has repeatedly refused to negotiate an end to the protracted conflict until President Saddam Hussein of Iraq is removed from power. Egyptian officials could not be reached for comment tonight on Iran's warning. A Suez Canal Authority spokesman interviewed on Wednesday said Iranian ships were being stopped and searched automatically before entering the canal because Iran, like Libya, was on a list of ''suspect'' countries. But, the official added, inspection of the Iranian ships had revealed no irregularities. He did not suggest that any Iranian ship had been denied entry to the canal, or that any Iranian vessel had been significantly delayed because of the inspection. But the Hojatolislam's remarks appeared to imply that one of its ships had been detained or delayed. The Iranian Speaker did not elaborate.

1432-> JETS LIFT MEHL'S PAY TO $650,000
The Jets, hoping to reverse last year's disappointing season and perhaps feeling the competition from a rival league, are continuing to grant extraordinary salary increases to keep the players they believe they need the most. The latest beneficiary of the Jets' policy is Lance Mehl, who won no league honors last season but who Walton believes is one of pro football's top linebackers. The fifth-year player has become the second-highest salaried linebacker in league history - behind only the Giants' Lawrence Taylor - by agreeing yesterday to a five-year contract that will reward him with about $650,000 this season. That is more than seven times his 1983 salary of $88,000. The figures were confirmed by a source familiar with the negotiations. Mehl had been going into the option year of a contract that called for about $100,000 this season, after which he would have been a free agent. His agreement came a day before the Jet veterans were scheduled to report to camp. Joe Klecko, a key player on the Jets' defensive line, this week reached agreement on a contract that was believed to have given him a $300,000-a-year increase and put him on a level with his linemate Mark Gastineau at about $700,000 a year. However, three other key Jets - all of whom are clients of Mehl's agent, Gary Wichard - will report to camp without contracts and may play out their options. They are Darrol Ray, the starting free safety; Mickey Shuler, the starting tight end, and Derrick Gaffney, who had been the No. 1 backup receiver. Wichard would not confirm the terms of Mehl's contract. The Jets' administrative manager, Steve Gutman, who handled the Jets' negotiations, confirmed only that Mehl had signed. Wichard, though, said of the deal: ''The New York Jets have showed they appreciate what Lance Mehl has done for them. He should be at this level - among the top-paid in pro football - based on what he's done. The only way a team can show any appreciation for a player is reflected in his contract.'' It is likely that the leverage of being able to go to the United States Football League next season - an option many outstanding players in the N.F.L. now enjoy - played a role in Mehl's new contract. Several teams in the U.S.F.L. were interested in acquiring Mehl. Coach Joe Walton talks often of Mehl, the right linebacker from Penn State who was a third-round draft choice in 1980. He consistently leads the team in tackles. He was voted by his teammates as the club's most valuable player in 1983, the first time since 1971 a defensive player had been honored. Taylor, the Giants' all-pro player, renegotiated a contract after last season - and after signing a futures deal with the Generals' owner, Donald Trump. In his new Giants' deal, Taylor will average about $950,000 a year, for five years, including the interest on a million-dollar loan. The Jets have been upgrading salaries remarkably since the team finished the 1983 season at 7-9. The club was stung when it learned before last season's opening game that the cornerback Jerry Holmes, a Wichard client, would be jumping to the U.S.F.L. after the season. Another key Jets' defensive back, Johnny Lynn, signed with the Los Angeles Express of the new league. With Holmes gone, the Jets surprised many after the season by helping Lynn exercise an unusual buyout clause in his U.S.F.L. contract. For $50,000, he was able to return to the Jets, who more than doubled his salary in taking him back. Lynn, the nickel back who plays about half the downs in the Jets' scheme, is another player whom Walton considers crucial to the team's success. The club also extended Gastineau's contract, nearly doubling his salary. The club will get a considerable portion of their increased salaries back because of the increased revenue at their new home, Giants Stadium. While season-ticket sales have not been announced, Gutman has said he expects to open with 76,000 people in the stadium. The Jets, who have increased their ticket prices, expect to gross about $1.1 million for each home game. The average gross at Shea Stadium last season was about $780,000 a game. That translates to more than $2 million in increased ticket revenue this season. Rookie Suffers Concussion The rookie fullback Ronny Cone suffered a concussion yesterday during a morning drill. It has not known whether Cone will practice today. . . . Russell Carter, the Jets' first-round draft pick this year, is still bothered by a hamstring pull and did not practice. Dave Roberson, a wide receiver from Houston, sprained his ankle during the afternoon session. . . . Three players left camp after the morning session: Pete Corrigan, a running back from Purdue; George Kelly, a linebacker from Ball State, and Jamie LaBelle, a running back from Hofstra. A fourth player, the running back James Rickenbacker, left camp Wednesday night.

1433-> MOPEDS BAFFLE ISLAND VISITORS
On a sunny day in late July, the Bonanno family of St. James and their friend Jim Spero of Setauket were visiting the scenic resort community of Block Island for the first time, and they were anxious to rent mopeds. ''The more ground you cover, the more you'll see,'' Estie Bonanno said, as she and her husband, Dom, children, Tara, Linda and Paul, and Mr. Spero walked up and down quaint streets looking for a moped rental shop that still had enough of the motorized two-wheel vehicles left to accommodate the six of them. The Bonannos had gone to the Rhode Island community for the day on one of the two ferries that originate in Montauk. Up to 230 Long Islanders a day take this journey during the summer. Many other Long Islanders visit Block Island by private boats and still others fly to the resort from various airports on Long Island. But for the Bonannos, the voyage from Montauk to Block Island over the 13-mile stretch of the Atlantic Ocean had taken two hours, and they were anxious to see as much as they could before the return trip some five hours later. However, the Bonannos weren't aware that by renting mopeds on Block Island they would become active participants in a controversy that has received worldwide publicity in the last two months. In May the renting of mopeds on the island became a cause cel ebre, when one local councilman suggested that Block Island secede from the Rhode Island because state government precluded Block Islanders from drafting their own laws restricting the use of mopeds on the island. According to Jack Gray, First Warden of the Town of New Shoreham (Block Island's official name), rental mopeds and tripeds had proliferated to the point where there were 350 to 375 rental mopeds on the island in June 1983. He estimates that there are even more this summer. Block Island is seven miles long and three and a half miles wide, and its residents had become concerned with problems of safety (15 accidents have been reported with bikes or mopeds so far this season, Mr. Gray said), so officials tried to limit the use of mopeds on the island. Residents put ''NOPED'' bumper stickers on their cars, and the situation reached the height of controversy in the last two months. However, the controversy has been put on hold for the summer because the Rhode Island State Legislature recently passed a law permitting Block Island to enact an ordinance to license and regulate mopeds. It would go into effect Jan. 1, 1985. Officials of New Shoreham are setting up a committee to draft the ordinance. But the moped problem is still on everyone's mind. ''Summer residents want to run this island,'' charged Mac Todd, owner of the Old Harbor bike shop, who says he brought the first mopeds to the island about 1977. Mr. Todd lives all year round on the Island but said he was not considered a true Block Islander. ''You're only a Block Islander if you were born here,'' he said. He is one of the larger dealers of rental mopeds, and the fate of his business hangs in the balance while local officials decide what the future allocation of rental mopeds will be. And would a restriction on mopeds on Block Island hurt the two Long Island ferry businesses that take visitors there every day? ''Almost everyone who comes to our ticket window asks, 'Do they have mopeds?' '' said Barbara Power, president of the Block Island Ferry. ''But people can bring their bikes. It's a quaint little island. People enjoy going there for many reasons.'' Paul Forsberg, owner of Viking Landing, where Jigger 3, the other Montauk-to-Block Island ferry, docks, said: ''Businesswise they'd be hurting themselves. It wouldn't hurt our business. Twenty percent of our passengers bring their own bikes.'' The Block Island moped problem is far from over. And as more Long Islanders visit the community this summer (both ferry companies say that early August is the busiest time), they can join Long Islanders like Bruce Mallory and his wife, Patricia, of West Islip, who joked as they rented mopeds on Block Island, ''We've been catapulted into the midst of a major controversy.'' Or they may take the view of Estie Bonanno: ''If they want tourists to come here, they have to have the mopeds. If they get rid of them, theyre not going to survive.''

1435-> KOCH NOW A COLUMNIST FOR THREE NEWSPAPERS
With his debut this week in The Staten Island Advance - splashed across the front page - Mayor Koch is now a regular columnist for three daily newspapers in New York City. Once a week, readers can find ''The Koch Column'' in The Advance, circulation 73,000, and ''Edward I. Koch'' in The New York Tribune, the newspaper founded by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon. Every two weeks, they can read ''Mi Opinion'' in El Diario-La Prensa, the city's major Spanish-language daily. Beyond the exposure, the Mayor receives no compensation. Mr. Koch's strong views have also appeared in Noticias del Mundo and more than a dozen smaller local papers. He would have himself in the pages of The New York Amsterdam News, too, if its chairman and editor in chief, Wilbert Tatum, had not turned him down. ''It's an opportunity to get across my point of view,'' the Mayor said yesterday. ''I don't expect that reporters covering City Hall could devote the time and newsprint to covering what I think is important as it relates to major issues.'' 'I've Reached My Quota' ''I don't pretend to be the equal to Bill Safire or Bill Buckley or Max Lerner,'' Mr. Koch said. ''I'm just someone who's written one book.'' Nor, he said, was he likely to expand beyond the three papers for which he now writes. ''I'm sort of running out,'' he said. ''I think I've reached my quota.'' Beginning with Mr. Koch's idea for a topic, the columns are drafted by Leland T. Jones, an assistant press secretary. The Mayor dictates a revised version, Mr. Jones does additional polishing, the Mayor gives his final approval and the column is sent off. The Mayor writes different columns for each newspaper. Mr. Koch said he had a few ground rules that other newspaper columnists might envy. No. 1: ''I not be told what columns have as their content.'' No. 2: ''I not be edited.'' No. 3: ''If they said, 'We don't like what you're saying,' then I wouldn't write for them again.'' An informal survey turned up other mayoral columnists. In Boston, Raymond L. Flynn writes each week for small neighborhood newpapers. In Houston, a column by Mayor Kathy Whitmire can be found each week in two small publications. Opinion Pages Open to Everyone ''As far as subject matter of the columns,'' said Robert J. Morton, the editor in chief of The Tribune, ''I wouldn't say we were always in complete agreement with him. But the reaction I've gotten has been very favorable.'' ''Granted,'' Mr. Morton said, ''in most newspapers politicians wouldn't regularly appear, but our Commentary section features four pages of opinions daily. It's open to everyone from the Governor to taxi drivers.'' Mr. Morton said the newspaper might reconsider the column as the 1985 mayoral race neared. It has run the column since June. Les Trautmann, the editor of The Advance, also said his paper would ''rethink'' the column ''if and when'' the Mayor became a candidate next year. He also said the column would appear on the front page in the future only if it were a ''blockbuster.'' Mr. Koch's front-page column this week was about the Navy's Atlantic Surface Action Group coming to a new home port in the Stapleton section of Staten Island. 'Like to Run My Column?' ''We try to present all points of view,'' Mr. Trautmann said. ''He was elected by both major parties. At this time, it is not inappropriate to hear what the Mayor has to say. ''We met at a public ceremony,'' Mr. Trautmann recalled, ''and he said, 'How'd you like to run my column?' and I said, 'Yes.''' The Mayor's most recent effort for El Diario - on the Simpson-Mazzoli immigration bill - was so long that it was run in two installments. A call to the editor, Manuel de Dios Unanue, was not returned. The half-inch-tall headline in The Advance this week read, ''Home Port Boosts Defense, Economy.'' As one who had supported the project all along, the Mayor wrote warmly about the subject. ''We all won when the Navy chose Staten Island,'' he said. At some points in the long piece, a reader could almost hear Mayor Koch talking: ''Since ships in the group may be armed with nuclear weaponry, critics argue that we are inviting a nuclear holocaust to New York Harbor. The argument is foolish.'' Mr. Koch did not seem too concerned about his future in journalism. ''I'm sure if the columns are boring or not of publishable quality,'' he said, ''that they would very quickly find someone else.''

1436-> Lynn C. Field Is Bride Of Craig Alan Jacobson
Lynn Carol Field, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Herbert S. Schlosser of New York and Saltaire, L.I., was married yesterday to Craig Alan Jacobson, a son of Mr. and Mrs. Herbert R. Jacobson of Kansas City, Mo., and Palm Springs, Calif. The civil ceremony was performed at Lake Tahoe, Nev. The bride, who will retain her name professionally and whose previous marriage ended in divorce, is an associate director in the CBS entertainment division in Los Angeles. She graduated from the University of Southern California. Her father, formerly president and chief executive officer of NBC, is an executive vice president of the RCA Corporation. Her mother, Judith Schlosser, is an interior designer. Mr. Jacobson, who graduated from Brown University and received a law degree from George Washington University, is an associate in the Los Angeles law firm of Pollock, Bloom & Dekom. His father is vice president of the A. D. Jacobson Company, a mechanical-contracting concern in Kansas City founded by his grandfather.

1437-> AROUND THE NATION; Washington's Mayor Subject of Criticism
Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. of the District of Columbia had ''a personal relationship'' with a city employee much of the time she admits selling cocaine, according to Mr. Barry's lawyer. In an interview published today in The Washington Post, Herbert O. Reid Sr., the lawyer, said, however, that Mr. Barry did not know that the employee, Karen K. Johnson, was involved with drugs and never bought drugs from her. She is serving a four-month sentence after pleading guility to charges of selling cocaine. Mr. Reid was quoted as saying that the relationship lasted 12 to 18 months and ended in the autumn of 1982. Over that period, Miss Johnson worked in the District Energy Office and also did campaign work for Mr. Barry, Mr. Reid said. Mr. Barry has said he knew her only in passing. Mr. Reid said United States Attorney Joseph diGenova had failed to gather evidence against Mr. Barry and was now seeking to discredit the Mayor with disclosures to the press. Mr. diGenova refused to comment,

1439-> ; NOT COVERED BY ECONOMIC RECOVERY: A CASE IN POINT
To the Editor: As a New York City crime widow and welfare mother, I would like to speak for those of us whose lives remain unaffected by the improvement in the economy and the decrease in unemployment: single mothers and their children. I lost my husband a year ago in a street shooting and robbery. Since then, after my one child started attending kindergarten, I have been seeking work through the mandatory job counseling provided by the New York State Department of Labor's WIN (work incentive) program. I am literate, well-educated, able to write and spell and use a typewriter. I am also skilled in the graphic arts, and I have written a nonfiction manuscript (at present, I am at work on a science-fiction book - easier to sell, I hope). Not surprisingly, the WIN program is ill-equipped to market manuscripts; its specialty is finding poverty-level jobs for females. I was further handicapped by my utter lack of dress-for-success attire, precluding my chances of being sent out for interviews. Finally, in the spring, I was sent by WIN to the Federation Employment and Guidance office in Manhattan. There I was given a qualifying exam for a secretarial training program. The exam consisted of sixth-grade- level reading and math comprehension tests. I completed each in 10 minutes; the others in the session used the entire allotted hour. All were women, and most were exceedingly well attired. I could not hope to compete with them in my borderline tatty dress and flat shoes. (Bulletin boards outside classrooms showed collages, culled from fashion magazines, devoted to the ideal business costume.) I was accepted for the training program, only to learn that the spring session was already overcrowded and that I might be admitted in the fall. Weeks afterward I read that the federation's Federal funding for free job training had been halved for this year; therefore it can only accommodate a fraction of those in need. This unhappy experience left me with the distinct impression that female secretarial workers are hired first for their ability to please the (male) eye and secondly for intelligence and literacy. The WIN program seems cognizant that welfare mothers sometimes lack corporate attire: there is an ''emergency clothing grant'' of $55 - hardly enough to arm an indigent against the competitive fashion show that the search for (female) jobs has become. The welfare/job-training system has not been able to assist me, in spite of my qualifications; what about those numerous failures of the city school system who lack both clothes and literacy? For them, as for me, the required visits to WIN will be cruel charades. Meanwhile, I can take comfort from the fact that single mothers who work and make less than $10,000 a year are even worse off than I. A good friend of mine got off welfare by attending college for two years and obtaining a job in a large Manhattan bank. Now, after three years in the job, she supports herself and her son on $600 a month, of which $350 goes for rent and $30 a week for child care. For routine doctor's visits not covered by medical insurance she pays $50 to $100. She gets no child support and does not smoke, drink or use drugs; literally every penny goes for necessities. Hot dogs and 25-cent packages of noodles and sauce are frequent meals; not exactly a healthy diet. (According to a recent report, people in her tax bracket lost an estimated $400 in Government benefits; tax cuts favor the consumer class, not the survival class.) I feel fortunate indeed for my rent- stabilized ghetto flat, which rents for the exact maximum housing grant for two people ($227). I don't have to eat hot dogs; medical care is free, and my son is healthy and in the gifted rank of his school. It is often said that the ''underclass'' poor prefer to work out of a desire to attain dignity through self-sufficiency. This may explain my friend's holding on to a job without rewards, doggedly enduring eviction and other humiliations while being able to say, ''I am not on welfare.'' I see no moral difference between taking welfare and working for a life of indignity. For the poor single mother, there is hunger and degradation on both sides of the coin.

1440-> BRIDGE; ENDPLAY WITH A HUNGARIAN ACCENT
In their attitude toward bridge, the countries of Eastern Europe vary widely. Poland encourages the game and the country's experts earn some useful foreign exchange. The Soviet Union virtually bars organized bridge outside the Baltic States where it has roots. And the other countries are somewhere in between. There are some small indications of progress. In March the Hungarians announced the formation of a national federation, toward which they have been working for many years. It is under the auspices of the Ministry of Culture and therefore has some government support. The Hungarians have competed in two world championships, in 1976 and 1980, and many European events, holding their own against the world's best. They are expected to compete in Seattle this October in the World Team Olympiad. A great deal of Hungarian talent was scattered around the world, even more so since the exodus resulting from the events of 1956. Tim Seres, long Australia's greatest player, is one example. Another is Ivan Erdos, who died at the early age of 43 after pursuing a professional bridge career in both England and California. Erdos came close to becoming a world champion in 1965 in Buenos Aires, where he aided the American cause with his play of the diagramed deal. As shown, his partner had ventured to double a weak two-bid and he reached four spades. The opening heart lead was ruffed in the closed hand, and a spade was led to the jack. East made a good play by ducking, and a club was led from dummy. East ducked again, and South won with the king and continued with the queen. East now took his ace and shifted to the diamond queen, won with the ace in dummy. Erdos threw a diamond on the heart ace, ruffed a heart and cashed the club jack. He had reached this position: NORTH S K 5 2 H - D 9 8 C - WEST S - H Q 8 7 D K 6 C - EAST S A 10 8 H J D 10 C - SOUTH S Q 9 H - D J C 7 4 The lead of the diamond jack now endplayed West in an unusual way. He could not prevent Erdos from scoring three trump tricks and his contract. If he played a heart, South could ruff in dummy and then ruff a diamond with the trump nine. And if he led a diamond and East ruffed low, South would have a choice after overruffing. He could simply lead the spade queen, or, more elegant, ruff a club with the spade king. The defenders on this deal were Benito Garozzo and Pietro Forquet of Italy, who were generally regarded as the world's best partnership in the 60's. But they had the last laugh: They held on in the final session to beat the United States and take the world title. NORTH S K J 5 2 H A 9 2 D A 9 8 3 C 9 3 WEST S - H K Q 8 7 5 4 D K 6 5 4 C 8 5 2 EAST(D) S A 10 8 3 H J 10 6 3 D Q 10 C A 10 6 SOUTH S Q 9 7 6 4 H - D J 7 2 C K Q J 7 4 Both sides were vulnerable.

1441-> THE EXILE ALTERNATIVES TO THE DEATH PENALTY
To the Editor: Proposing alternatives to capital punishment is laudable, but I question the wisdom of permanent imprisonment under present prison regimes (editorial July 5). Lifelong incarceration offers no hope - a punishment that could be convincingly argued to be crueler than death. More to the point, contending with violent prisoners who will never again know the outside world would strain overburdened state prison systems. These inmates, having nothing to lose, may constantly challenge the prison: opposing the system could become their raison d'^etre. The odds of making them even marginally productive seem negligible, and their turbulent microcosm would invite inhumane treatment as a means of control. The idea of permanent separation of violent criminals from society, short of killing them, does have obvious merit, but what is needed is an alternative to current prison systems. One such alternative, with historical precedent, is exile to isolated islands. Once such an island, with potable water and arable land, is identified and made available, the state would be responsible for providing each prisoner with a plentiful variety of seeds, a short-term supply of food and simple farm implements. The prisoners would then be left to themselves and the land, their survival being their responsibility. Prisoners' islands would effectively remove violent criminals from society while offering them the opportunity to live as well as to control their destinies. Punishment that incorporates these objectives seems worthy of serious consideration, especially when the present penalty is death at the hands of the state. KENNETH A. WEAVER New York, July 6, 1984

1447-> EGYPT SAYS EFFORT TO CLEAR MINES IS EXPECTED TO END THIS MONTH
Egypt said today that the multinational search for mines that damaged 18 ships this summer in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Suez would end this month. No mines have been found. ''The naval units searching for mines in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Suez will leave during the second half of September, but probably some French units may remain and continue the search,'' the Defense Minister, Field Marshal Abdel Halim Abu Ghazala, said. ''We have not found any mines.'' Mr. Abu Ghazala's statement was the first official indication from Egypt that the French may continue to search for mines for an indefinite time. Other vessels and craft involved in the search are four British mine-hunters and a support ship, three Italian minesweepers and their support ship, four United States Sea Stallion helicopters aboard the U.S.S. Shreveport and an oceanographic ship, the U.S.S. Harkness. Aim Was to Trace Mines A major objective of the sweep was to retrieve an intact mine to learn where it was manufactured and, if possible, to trace it to those who planted the mines. But it appeared likely that the identity of the mine layers will remain a mystery. At first, Egypt accused Iran and Libya of sowing the mines but later focused its suspicions on Libya alone. Egyptian officials conceded they had only circumstantial evidence to back up the accusation. The Sudanese Government, meanwhile, postponed a conference on security in the Red Sea that had been scheduled for next Sunday in the capital, Khartoum, according to the Middle East News Agency, an official press agency run by Egypt. The Sudan made plans for the conference after the series of explosions damaged 18 ships between July 9 and Aug. 15. The Middle East News Agency quoted a Sudanese Foreign Ministry statement as saying the postponement was ''in response to the wish of some countries which need more time to ensure sound preparation and effective participation.'' The coastal countries that agreed to attend, in addition to the Sudan, were Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, North Yemen and Djibouti. Israel was not invited and South Yemen and Ethiopia declined to take part. The session was to discuss ways of insuring the security of navigation in the Red Sea and working out a joint formula for preventing the recurrence of the blasts. U.S. 'Winding Down' Effort WASHINGTON, Sept. 13 - The Defense Department said today that the search for mines in the Red Sea and Gulf of Suez area ''is continuing but winding down,'' and that American vessels engaged in minesweeping operations would probably be finished ''before the end of the month.'' ''As we complete the search in the area that has been assigned to us, our activities in and around Saudi Arabia will be completed probably before the end of the month,'' Michael I. Burch, the Defense Department spokesman, told reporters at the Pentagon's daily briefing. On Sept. 4, State Department officials said that the mission would likely be completed in about 10 days and that United States vessels would leave the area.

1449-> NEW RECORDING OF 'WEST SIDE STORY'
Leonard Bernstein conducting a cast that includes Kiri Te Kanawa, Jessye Norman, Jose Carreras and Tatiana Troyanos would be starry enough for any opera. In fact, they will appear in a Deutsche Grammophon recording of Mr. Bernstein's hit musical, ''West Side Story,'' being recorded in Manhattan this week and due for release next September. How did such a remarkable convergence of operatic talent and Broadway come about, and what will it sound like? Mr. Bernstein and Deutsche Grammophon officials provided some answers this week, and a recording session Wednesday at the midtown RCA Studios offered a hint of promising results. ''West Side Story,'' a gang-war reworking of Shakespeare's ''Romeo and Juliet,'' ran for 724 performances on Broadway starting in 1957, and received even wider distribution with the 1961 movie version, starring Natalie Wood, which won an Academy Award for best film. ''When Deutsche Grammophon said they wanted to record 'West Side Story,' I said, 'Oh, no, not again,' '' recalled Mr. Bernstein, wolfing an order of sushi in a side room between sessions. ''They pointed out that I had never done it - never recorded it, never conducted it in the theater.'' 'Difficult to Cast' The idea to use opera singers apparently evolved slowly. '' 'West Side Story' is very difficult to cast,'' Mr. Bernstein explained. ''It's hard to find people who can dance, sing and act - and look 17 years old. When I knew we were going to have a recording, I decided to go for sound. For the first time in my life, we can have exactly the singers we want.'' Miss Te Kanawa, the New Zealand soprano, was the first to be signed up. ''I couldn't believe it,'' the singer recalled yesterday. ''This was music I'd grown up with, music I'd always wanted to sing.'' Mr. Bernstein, in turn, was excited by the prospect. ''When I heard Kiri was interested in doing Maria, I was just thrilled,'' he said. ''Gee, Dame Kiri singing 'I Feel Pretty.' '' One oddity, however, is that Tony, the Romeo to Maria's Juliet, is supposed to be a member of the ''Anglo'' gang, the Jets, which fights the Puerto Rican Sharks. That means, as Mr. Carreras put it yesterday, that ''the only Spaniard in the cast is the one who must have the most American accent.'' And in truth, during Wednesday night's session, Mr. Carreras's Spanish accent sounded pronounced. Mr. Bernstein conceded the difficulty, but said that diction coaching, and the fact that actors will speak the dialogue for the principal singers, should minimize any accent confusion. Familiarity With the Style Opera recordings are rarely made in New York because of union costs. In this case, however, it was decided that New York musicians had an invaluable familiarity with the style. ''I expect it is more expensive for us to do it here,'' said Alison Ames, who heads Deutsche Grammophon in the United States. ''But we would have had far higher rehearsal costs in Munich or wherever.'' This recording, which is being overseen by Mr. Bernstein's longtime producer, John McClure, will be more complete than either the original cast album or the film soundtrack. It will contain some 75 minutes of music, and additional dialogue (although the overture heard in the theater, a medley not composed by Mr. Bernstein, will not be included). As usual with opera recordings, the cast jetted in from around the world. Mr. Carreras sang Jose in ''Carmen'' in Verona, Italy, Sunday night. Miss Te Kanawa came from the south of France, where she had been vacationing, by way of London. But as soon as she arrived, that bane of all singers, air-conditioning, did her in. ''I told them, 'I congratulate you for mucking up my voice in 24 hours, after I'd been saving it for five weeks,' '' she said cheerily yesterday, when her throat felt better. But by then, Miss Troyanos was under the weather. Traumas aside, Wednesday's session sounded exciting. Yes, the voices were bigger than what one is used to for this music, but they also handled Mr. Bernstein's inherently operatic writing with rare beauty and confidence. And Mr. Bernstein's conducting - as he propelled the ''Tonight'' quintet forward with swaggering lyric energy - was incomparable. Miss Te Kanawa and Mr. Carreras - and Miss Norman, when she gets around to overdubbing her contribution to the project, the song ''Somewhere,'' later this year - are not called upon to sing anything radically different from what they are used to. Miss Troyanos, however, must achieve a far more raucous, verbally inflected performance; Chita Rivera was Anita on Broadway. But Miss Troyanos has an advantage. She was born in a West Side tenement on the site of Lincoln Center - the exact spot where ''West Side Story'' takes place. The questions remain, though: Is ''West Side Story'' in some sense an opera, or will it sound weighed down with all this vocal opulence? ''I say it is not an opera,'' Mr. Bernstein offered. ''It's a work on its way toward being one. Some parts are operatic, but it isn't one.'' Still, Mr. Bernstein professes himself more than satisfied with his casting. ''Kiri's voice is a little dark, if you're thinking of a 17-year-old,'' he said. ''But Maria is very mature, and she should be mature-sounding. Kiri is absolutely terrific. It's like dreaming the voice of Maria.''

1450-> CAMPAING NOTES; Jackson Says Coalition Still Waiting for Party
The Rev. Jesse Jackson said today that the ''Rainbow Coalition'' he had built in an unsuccessful drive for the Democratic Presidential nomination was still waiting for the party to make a commitment to blacks and other minorities. ''We must relate to the party, but the freedom movement can't get locked to politics,'' Mr. Jackson told several thousand people at a voter-registration rally on the steps of the Capitol. He said his followers must ''change the Democratic Party - not just join it.'' Mr. Jackson added that although he won 22 percent of the votes cast in the Presidential primaries, ''there is no black in a policy position'' in the Mondale-Ferraro campaign. ''The Democratic Party has a mission we identify with,'' he said. ''Our mission is to defeat Reagan in November. But the absence of Reagan is not the presence of jobs, peace and justice.''

1451-> METS OVERCOME PIRATES BY 4-3
The Mets, who career from one streak to another, won their second straight game tonight when they brushed past the Pittsburgh Pirates, 4-3, on a walk with the bases loaded in the eighth inning. They still had to escape a crisis in the ninth inning, when the Pirates loaded the bases against Jesse Orosco with one out. But Orosco, who had blown two games earlier this week, pitched clear this time, and the Mets survived. In a strange sequence in a strange season, the Mets have won seven straight games, lost seven straight and now have won two straight. But the Chicago Cubs also won today, so the Mets remained a half game out of first place in the National League East, with the teams on a collision course with four games in Wrigley Field starting Monday. Wants an Easier Way ''I'd like to find an easier way to win them,'' said Dave Johnson, the manager of the Mets. ''It seemed the Pirates started every inning late in the game with a double. And our pitching is short these days.'' The pitching was especially short in the bullpen, where Orosco and Doug Sisk have saved a total of 36 games. But both have been struggling lately. Sisk has been troubled by a tender right shoulder, and has not pitched in a week. And Orosco let games slip away in the late innings twice this week before his adventure tonight. ''I had to live or die with Orosco tonight,'' Johnson said. ''But, starting Monday, I'll use Sisk in any situation.'' The Mets and Pirates ran a meandering course for seven innings, and were tied at 3-3 going to the eighth. The Mets took the lead briefly off Rick Rhoden in the third inning after Rafael Santana singled and Junior Ortiz outran a high chop wide of first base. And, when Rhoden was late covering and then dropped the ball, Santana made it to third. He then scored on a groundout by Wally Backman. A Fearsome Batter But Rhoden proved again that he is a fearsome man with a bat. He entered the game hitting .255, and got three hits tonight for the second time this season, starting with a double in the bottom of the third off Bruce Berenyi. He crossed on a single by Johnny Ray, and the Met lead was gone. Half an inning later, they recaptured it with two runs on two walks, singles by George Foster and Ortiz and a forceout grounder by Santana. But Rhoden led off the fifth with a single and later scored on a wild pitch by Berenyi. And, in the sixth, Berenyi squandered what was left of his lead when he was tagged for singles by Jim Morrison, Rhoden and Marvell Wynne. So, they were tied when the Mets faced Rod Scurry in the eighth. But Scurry walked Keith Hernandez with one out and Darryl Strawberry looped a pop-fly double into short left field, sending Hernandez to third. Foster drew an intentional walk, loading the bases, and the Pirates called for Kent Tekulve, the ace of their bullpen for 10 years. Walk Forced in a Run But Tekulve, who is 37 years old, did the unthinkable by walking Hubie Brooks on five pitches, forcing in the run that put the Mets in front again, 4-3. But the Mets, living dangerously, wasted a chance for more. Rusty Staub pinch-hit a foul fly behind third base, and Morrison grabbed it on the run. Strawberry tagged up and scored, but was called out for leaving the bag too soon. So Orosco pitched with a one-run lead, and nearly blew that in the bottom of the ninth. Lee Lacy, who beat the Mets with a two-run triple Thursday night off Orosco, opened with a double. Johnny Ray, trying to bunt, was struck on the leg by an inside pitch. Then, with trouble on all sides, Orosco went to a 3-0 count on Benny Distefano, who also was trying to bunt. Finally, on 3-2, Distefano flied deep to left-center, and the runners advanced anyway. Up came Bill Madlock, pinch-hitting for Tekulve. The Mets walked him intentionally, loading the bases with one down. Then, with the game on the line, Orosco retired Morrison on a weak pop fly outside first base. And Pena, who doubled in the eighth, hit a forceout grounder to third to end the threat. Every Reliever Is Human ''I've had a couple of rough outings,'' Orosco said, ''but every reliever is human and will go through a stage like this.'' . . . ''He pitched well to two guys in the ninth,'' Johnson said. ''Morrison and Pena. He had to.'' . . . In the finale, the Mets will pitch Sid Fernandez, who has won three of his four starts with no losses.

1452-> Bus Leased by Mission Hits A Truck in Arizona, Killing 3
A bus carrying 47 people, mostly young missionaries, collided with a gravel truck in northern Arizona today, killing three people and injuring about 20 others. The bus driver and the truck driver died at the scene about eight miles north of Flagstaff on Route 89, a highway that leads to the Grand Canyon. The bus driver's wife died at Flagstaff Medical Center, according to Sgt. Allan Schmidt of the state's Department of Public Safety. The names of the dead and injured were not immediately reported. The authorities said two people had been admitted to the hospital in serious condition. The bus was one of two leased by the Teen Mission of Merritt Island, Fla., an interdenominational organization that annually sends groups to do mission work throughout the world.

1456-> Superior Takeover By Mobil Backed
The Superior Oil Company's shareholders overwhelmingly approved the Mobil Corporation's $5.7 billion takeover of the large independent oil business, with 82.7 percent of the ballots cast favoring the cash and stock buyout, Superior said. Mobil had earlier purchased about 60 percent of Superior's stock. Superior said that it expected the merger to become effective on Sept. 28, when final documents are filed in Nevada, where Superior is incorporated. In May, Mobil estimated that interest expenses associated with financing of the takeover would depress earnings through 1988. But it said the merger would increase its worldwide petroleum reserves by 18 percent.

1457-> History, and Tears
''Waitresses grab the Mondale-Ferraro button off your shoulder. Men come up and say, 'Go for it.' ''The reaction has been so extraordinary that you have to wonder: Why was there any question about it in the first place? People are excited about politics for the first time this year.'' Alice Travis, a sometime California officeholder and political professional, knows what she's talking about. The Democrats are going through the rest of their convention business in San Francisco earnestly. It is on the subject of Geraldine Ferraro that they ignite. They are, as the convention banners say, making history. The first woman on a major-party Presidential ticket is an event that provokes the most intense feeling. Women, a week after Walter Mondale announced his choice, are still incredulous. ''It's just starting to soak in,'' said Roberta Hollowell, an English teacher from Santa Rosa, Calif., at a caucus meeting. A woman from Washington saw an old friend and asked, ''When the nomination finally happens, will it be all right to cry?'' Representative Barbara Kennelly, the Ways and Means Committee member from Connecticut, ended yesterday by formally placing in nomination the name of her House colleague from Queens. But she did it informally all day long. ''We have dreamed, we have planned, we have worked, we have supported each other, and tonight I'm going to stand there and say I nominate Geraldine Ferraro! Tonight it happens!'' The idea of a woman Vice-Presidential candidate accelerated with startling speed. It's been just a year since the idea was pressed at a National Women's Political Caucus meeting in San Antonio. That was the first time, one of the organizers recalls, that all the Democratic candidates appeared. Before then, they sent telegrams. Startling speed, and reach. There are plenty of men who say, well, the Democrats chose a woman because they're behind and have to gamble, but who really think the country isn't ready for a woman in such a position of influence. But there appear to be plenty of other men who not only accept but applaud the choice, men who know that it's right and liberating for all of American society. There's obvious partisanship in some of the feelings for Geraldine Ferraro, but there's also more. There's obvious provincialism in the pride many New Yorkers feel in her nomination, but there's also more. There's history, and those joyful tears.

1458-> BRIEFING; Spin the Cabinet
At President Reagan's seat in the Cabinet Room of the White House for several weeks has been a handy device given him by an admirer. At first blush it appears to be a decision maker: a small, four- sided wooden sign that rotates and, when spun, comes up ''Yes,'' ''No,'' ''Maybe'' or ''Scram.'' Reagan associates report, however, that the President does not use the gadget to make up his mind but chooses the side of the sign he wants and uses it to respond to requests or suggestions from members of his Cabinet in meetings. When a Secretary becomes long-winded, for example, Mr. Reagan can reach over and turn his reaction sign so the speaker gets the message ''Scram.'' More frequently these days, an aide says, he gets the desired effect just by reaching for the device and spinning it.

1461-> HONDURAS BARS TRAINING OF SALVADORANS AT BASE
Honduras has suspended the training of Salvadoran troops by United States military instructors at a key base in Honduran territory, a high-level Honduran official said today. The official, Foreign Minister Edgardo Paz Barnica, said in a telephone interview from San Jose, Costa Rica, that the training had been stopped while Honduras negotiated new economic and security agreements with the United States. A spokesman for the American Embassy in Tegucigalpa confirmed that the United States had been in discussions with Honduras ''for the establishment of a permanent Regional Military Training Center.'' ''No additional foreign military personnel will be trained at the R.M.T.C. pending final agreement,'' he said. Border Issue Is Cited Honduran officials said an additional factor in the decision to halt the training of Salvadorans was El Salvador's reluctance to negotiate a border treaty with Honduras. Honduras has expected the United States to press El Salvador to enter into negotiations on the border dispute. But a Western diplomat in Honduras said that the border issue had been a ''minor factor'' in the decision and that the action was ''directed at the United States.'' Nevertheless, he said, the Honduran action ''in no way'' altered the United States' alliance with Honduras and would not affect the presence of some 1,200 American military personnel now in the country. Training of Hondurans Goes On The American Embassy spokesman said the 150 Special Forces instructors at the base, in Puerto Castilla, would continue to train Honduran troops ''for the immediate future.'' The base has been the main training center for Salvadoran and Honduran troops in Honduras. A Honduran official said that Honduras was insisting on having veto power over any country's access to the base while the United States maintained that if it financed construction of the base, then all nations receiving American military aid should be permitted to send soldiers there. The Honduran military has announced new joint military maneuvers with the United States that will run from Sept. 30 to Oct. 21. The manuevers, which will focus on counterinsurgency techniques, will include 150 to 200 United States military personnel from Fort Bragg in North Carolina and from Fort Gulick in Panama, according to Western diplomats. A Honduran military source said that the maneuvers were a sign of Honduras's close ties with the United States. The Puerto Castilla base was established in June 1983 to provide military training for countries receiving United States military aid, but its primary purpose was to train Salvadoran soldiers. Since the training programs were instituted, about 4,500 Salvadorans and 3,500 Hondurans have received instruction. The next class with Salvadoran soldiers was scheduled to begin next Monday. 'Given Up Too Much' Critics charged that the base circumvented the Congressional limit of 55 military advisers in El Salvador. The presence of Salvadoran soldiers also alarmed Hondurans, who still view El Salvador as an enemy because of the 1969 war between the two nations. The base was strongly supported by Gen. Gustavo Alvarez Martinez, the former chief of the Honduran armed forces. But General Martinez was ousted in March and his successor, Gen. Walter Lopez Reyes, quickly advised the United States that the agreement governing the base was not acceptable and that he wanted more Honduran troops trained in proportion to Salvadorans soldiers.

1462-> THE EVENING HOURS
The ''Amadeus'' premiere ended with a Viennese flourish, New York style. Some 350 guests, who had paid a minimum of $350 each to benefit Columbia University's School of the Arts, went from the movie theater to Tavern on the Green, where they dined on a meal prepared by a team of chefs who had flown in from Vienna. Among those on hand were Bess Myerson, Osborn Elliott, Tony Randall, Henry Morgan, Timothy Forbes, Samuel J. LeFrak and Schuyler G. Chapin, dean of Columbia's School of the Arts. Also at the dinner were Milos Forman, director of ''Amadeus,'' and the film's three stars - F. Murray Abraham, Tom Hulce and Elizabeth Berridge. ''Viennese food is my very favorite!'' exclaimed Warner LeRoy, Tavern on the Green's owner, who could have played a supporting role in the dinner jacket he was wearing, which was woven with silver metallic thread. ''All of my weight was gained in Vienna,'' he said. That was 20 years ago. Before that, I was thin.'' State Senator Roy M. Goodman said he, too, was a fan of Viennese food, and added: ''My father got his postgraduate training in Vienna, and I first went there at the age of 4. Also, my wife and I honeymooned in Vienna, so this whole thing has a sentimental flavor to it.'' John Chancellor, a co-chairman of the evening, was talking not about food, but music. ''I'm a Mozart freak,'' he said. ''I belong to the Wolfgang Club. We keep order at concerts.'' Dinner consisted of pheasant terrine, semolina dumpling soup, medallions of veal Belvedere and berries in strudel leaves. Sam Bronfman, president of the Seagram Classics Wine Company, smiled as a waiter poured Mumm Extra Dry, his company's Champagne. ''There is a double-digit growth in Champagne,'' Mr. Bronfman said happily. ''It is definitely the hot wine category in the U.S. today.'' After dinner, Werner Matt, the executive chef of the Vienna Hilton who had created the meal, told a guest that he had brought the strudel dough into the United States. He was asked how he managed to get it through Customs. Mr. Matt pretended to frown. ''I looked serious,'' he replied. THE hangar deck of the aircraft carrier Intrepid - a cavernous room with a helicopter and lethal-looking missiles suspended from the ceiling - was the site of Diana Ross's party after her opening-night concert at Radio City Music Hall. About 500 guests had been expected, but a third of the tables were empty when Miss Ross, wrapped in a red silk toga, made her entrance to a muted round of applause. ''This reminds me of the Navy - when I was in the Army,'' said Lewis Rudin, who was shouting to make himself heard above the sound system blasting Miss Ross's songs at a near-deafening level. Glancing at his watch, he added, ''Now, I want to go home and go to bed.'' ''I've been on aircraft carriers before, but never anything like this,'' said Don Hewitt, also shouting. ''I was a war correspondent in the Pacific in World War II.'' Also at the party were Cheryl Tiegs, who stayed long enough to be photographed; Dustin Hoffman, Lauren Bacall, Bob Fosse, Diane Von Furstenberg, Steve Rubell and Susan Sarandon, who was with Richard Gere. Miss Sarandon lost her escort when he stalked out after a photographer took his picture. ''LIFE begins at 40,'' Marvin Feldman said exuberantly, ''and I really mean it.'' Mr. Feldman was referring not to himself, but to the school he heads, the Fashion Institute of Technology, which celebrated its 40th birthday with a party and fashion show. Among the guests were many F.I.T. alumni who have gone on to successful careers, including Sal Cesarani, Morton Myles, Tracy Mills, Mary Ann Restivo, Tamotsu, and Evelyn de Jonge. ''I just saw someone I graduated with who told me he has a daughter 31 years old,'' George Samen, who designs for Mollie Parnis, said. ''I'm going to have a heart attack.'' A member of the class of 1949, Mr. Samen went to F.I.T. in the days when the school was tiny and occupied the top two floors of the Central High School for the Needle Trade. ''We were only 50 people,'' he said. ''Now, they have thousands. I don't know what they will do with those thousands.'' One of the recent graduates on hand was Kenneth Bonavitacola, a designer who was wearing a rhinestone bow tie. ''I graduated in 1975, but I can't remember that far back,'' he said. ''I'm so involved with today.'' Carol Lawson

1464-> OBSERVER; THE WRONG COURSE
The so-called age issue being used against President Reagan rests on the ridiculous argument that you have to be 73 years old before you don't know what you're talking about. I'm not 73 yet, but, as even the most casual reader must notice, I frequently don't know what I'm talking about. Nor is this a newly acquired talent of mine. In fact, watching President Reagan floundering on the TV screen Sunday night brought back fond memories of someone long forgotten, the physics student I had been at the age of 17. Mine was a 17-year-old mind as poorly wrought for the science of physics as Ronald Reagan's is for the complexities of the Presidency. Yet, like Mr. Reagan's, my deficiencies went generally unnoticed for a long time. It was easy to get lost among 150 students in a lecture hall - this was in college - but hard to stay hidden in twice-a-week section meetings in which a professor dealt with 18 or 20 scholars. Thus, early in the semester I was horrified when the professor called my name and asked an extraordinarily difficult question. I forget what the question was. ''How many dynes make an erg?'' or ''Which came first, the chicken or the erg?'' You can tell I was not cut out for physics, but believe me, it was a hard question. Some transient demon passing through me spoke out with an answer. It was the correct answer. The entire class gazed at me with awe; the professor with a respect I have never since seen on a professor's face. It was one of those triumphal moments in life, a moment comparable to that in which Ronald Reagan turned to Jimmy Carter and said, ''There you go again.'' I believe my professor told his colleagues in the physics department that he might have a budding Fermi, Szilard or Teller on his hands, for other members of the physics faculty nodded now and then when I met them in the halls of the dreaded physics building. The semester advanced smoothly. I had learned that an erg was a unit of energy and that a dyne was also a unit of energy. I could not understand why physics needed both the erg and the dyne, but feared to ask because I knew instinctively the question was so stupid that the professor would never forgive me for asking it. Three weeks had passed since my triumph and he had not asked me a question since. I suppose he thought it would be a shame to trouble a mind like mine with such routine questions as he put to the rest of the class. I knew there would be an awful reckoning, of course. Eventually there would be a written examination that would expose my ignorance of dynes and ergs. Hoping to save myself, I read desperately about physics, but the more I read, the more baffled I became. So an apple had fallen and Isaac Newton had noticed it, and so what? I was sitting in class puzzling about apples on a day when the professor discussed a phenomenon called ''adiabatic expansion.'' His usual questions to the class were producing unsatisfactory answers when, in disgust with the rest of them, he called my name and said, ''Tell these people what an adiabatic expansion is.'' I stood, just as President Reagan stood for his ordeal last Sunday night. And just as President Reagan started to utter words in sequences that made very little sense, so did I start explaining ''adiabatic expansion.'' I knew less about ''adiabatic expansion'' than President Reagan knew about the history of his own Administration. This did not stop me. I talked. I remember nothing of what I said. All I remember is talking on. And on. And on. It was like Captain Queeg breaking down on the witness stand. I could see the insolent grins of classmates smug because they knew the importance of falling apples. I could see the professor's face registering disappointment, amazement, incredulity, shock, horror - Two weeks passed before he spoke to me. To avoid academic catastrophe, he said, I should drop physics and avoid all other sciences. It was some of the best advice ever given me. I tell this story to expose the foolishness of the age issue used against President Reagan. It isn't being 73 that keeps you from knowing what you're talking about. I could do it at 17. B

1465-> BUCKS BEATEN BY 106- 100
ROY S. JOHNSON MILWAUKEE, April 29 - When the Milwaukee Bucks discovered that their opponents in the Eastern Conference semifinals would be the Nets and not the Philadelphia 76ers, they were relieved for two reasons. The 76ers had eliminated them from the playoffs in each of the last three seasons. And against the Nets, they would have the home-court edge, something they would not have had against the 76ers, who had a better record during the season. Bob Lanier, the Bucks' center, who is 35 years old and in his 14th season, said it ''would be nice to see some new faces.'' It didn't take long for the Nets to wear out their welcome. Proving again that the home-court edge is a tenuous one for their opponents, they showed little respect for the playoff- hardened Bucks or their sellout crowd of 11,052 at the Mecca this afternoon by gaining an impressive 106- 100 victory. The Nets won for the fourth time in four road games during the playoffs and took a 1-0 lead in this 4-of-7-game series. The second game will be played here Tuesday night. Only 7 Net Turnovers The victory was the epitome of team effort. After playing sluggishly at the onset - ''We were just waiting for something to happen,'' said the Nets' coach, Stan Albeck - they took advantage of the foul-plagued Bucks and made few mistakes. The Nets committed only 7 turnovers, a season-low. That helped to atone for abysmal 36-of-92 shooting from the field, their worst effort of the season. ''We didn't try to squeeze the ball into too many small openings,'' Otis Birdsong said of the Nets' minimal turnovers. ''We just didn't gamble offensively.'' Of all of the performances, the most critical one came from Darryl Dawkins, the Nets' center, who achieved a career-playoff high with 32 points, including 8 of his team's final 9 as the Nets fought a Bucks rally. Dawkins hit 8 of 17 shots from the field and 16 of 18 from the free- throw line. He also added 8 rebounds. ''You just witnessed the best playoff game that Darryl Dawkins has played in his career,'' said Albeck. The Nets took control near the end of the third period. They sliced a 50-44 halftime deficit to 69-68 on two free throws by Dawkins with 2 minutes 7 seconds left in the period. Then Buck Williams grabbed a rebound off a missed shot by the Bucks guard Paul Pressey and started a fast break that culminated in a jumper by Birdsong from the left basline. Albert King grabbed a rebound from an errant shot by Lanier and started another fast break that ended in another Birdsong jumper. That surge and a free throw by Williams gave the Nets a 73-69 lead near the end of the period. The Nets took a 77- 73 advantage going into the final period when King, who had missed 9 of his first 11 shots, hit a running 18- footer at the buzzer. Big Blocks by Gminski The Nets rode that wave to an 88-77 lead early in the last quarter. They were buoyed by two key plays by the backup center Mike Gminski, who blocked shots by Lanier on two successive possessions. That was the Nets' peak. And from there it was just a matter of whether the desperate lineup changes by Don Nelson, the Bucks' coach, would fluster the Nets. His most dramatic move occurred in the middle of the period when he used a lineup in which no player was taller than Marques Johnson, at 6-7. It was a group designed for speed. But the Nets have shown that they can also run, which they did in increasing their lead to 10 on two Dawkins free throws with 3:42 remaining. Lanier fouled out on that play. After the Bucks had pulled to a 4-point deficit, Dawkins hit his second consecutive 3-point play on a dunk and a foul to give the Nets a 103-96 lead with 45 seconds left. Three Bucks were disqualified on fouls - Lanier (6 feet 11 inches), Lister (7-0) and Mike Dunleavy, a guard - which Nelson said was a critical factor in rebounding. The player who most took advantage was Williams, who grabbed 13 of his game-high 17 rebounds in the second half, including 6 off the offensive glass. All told, the Nets had a 19-7 edge in offensive rebounds and 54-41 over all. ''At halftime, coach said that there were two guys in this room who weren't participating in the first half,'' said Williams. ''He didn't name any names, but I took it personally.'' The other player who took Albeck's words to heart was the guard Micheal Ray Richardson, who was only 1 for 7 in the half. He finished only 5 for 17, but had 8 assists and 6 rebounds. Birdsong had 18 points and had 6 rebounds. But his biggest contribution was on defense where he helped hold the all-star guard Sidney Moncrief to a single basket. Moncrief, who averaged 21 points during the season, finished with 10 after failing to score a basket until the middle of the final period. ''I think he just had an off night,'' said Birdsong. Ransey Late Kelvin Ransey did not arrive until 45 minutes before the game because he failed to set his clock ahead. . . . Bill Willoughby did not dress because of the flu. . . . The game did not sell out until 30 minutes before the tipoff. The sellout averted a local television blackout. . . . Albeck evened his career playoff record at 17-17.

1466-> HAITI BANS ALL POLITICAL ACTIVITY
-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, May 10 (AP) - The Government decreed an immediate halt to all political activity and pamphleteering today, a day after a second opposition newspaper began publishing. The measures came less than a week after President Jean-Claude Duvalier reiterated guarantees of freedom of the press and respect for human rights in a Press Day speech May 5. On Monday the United States Congress plans to review a $54 million annual aid package for Haiti, the hemisphere's poorest nation. The aid is tied to the Duvalier Government's human rights performance. Two decrees were issued today by Interior Minister Roger Lafontant, second-in-command to President Duvalier. One orders the immediate halt of all political activities except ''those of the President's party.'' The second decrees a halt to all political pamphleteering. Parties Resume Activities In March Mr. Duvalier issued a series of directives ordering that total press freedom and respect for human rights be guaranteed. In an apparent test of the President's promises, two formerly banned political parties announced they were resuming activities in Port- au-Prince. On April 28 the Haitian Social Christian Party published the first issue of a weekly newspaper, Fraternite, openly critical of the Duvalier regime. An even more outspoken weekly, La Conviction, appeared on newsstands here Wednesday, published by Silvio Claude, president of the Haitian Christian Democratic Party. In its first issue, La Conviction printed a letter from Representative Gary L. Ackerman, Democrat of New York, to the Haitian Ambassador to the United States, Fritz Cineas, in which the Congressman charges fraud in legislative elections here Feb. 12. In an article, Mr. Claude, wrote of being tortured and harassed for political activity. A newspaper with the same name published by Mr. Claude in 1980 was shut down when he and 21 other men, virtually the entire membership of his small political party, were sentenced to six years in prison for insulting the President and for sedition. The paper had published a poster distributed by a Venezuela-based trade union federation that suggested Mr. Duvalier should be the world's next deposed dictator. Mr. Claude was granted amnesty on Sept. 22, 1982, the 25th anniversary of Duvalier family rule, but was held under virtual house arrest until he went into hiding. The publisher of Fraternite, Gregoire Eug ene, was expelled from the country on Dec. 2, 1980. He returned from exile last Feb. 22 under an amnesty declared by Mr. Duvalier. The decrees issued today would appear to ban both newspapers as political publications.

1474-> GERMAN SPURNS PAYOFF CHARGES
Rainer Barzel, the Speaker of the West German Parliament, today rejected as ''infamous'' suggestions that money paid by the giant Flick holding company had helped persuade him to step aside as leader of the Christian Democratic Party in 1973. Testifying for three and a half hours before a packed session of a parliamentary subcommittee investigating Flick's payoffs to West German politicians, Mr. Barzel denied published reports that he had been indirectly paid about half a million dollars by Flick through a Frankfurt law firm. The 60-year-old politician, whose position makes him the second-ranking figure in the West German political system, denied having received money from Flick and insisted that the fees he was paid by the Frankfurt law firm between 1973 and 1982 were in return for consultations. While Mr. Barzel listed a number of instances where he had done work for the law firm, he was unable to produce a copy of the contract that regulated his part-time employment with it. The head of the law firm, Albert Paul, also testified that Mr. Barzel had worked for him, and denied funneling Flick money to the Christian Democratic politician. Stepped Aside as Leader Mr. Paul said that Mr. Barzel had been paid 1.6 million marks while Flick had in the same period paid 1.8 million marks to the firm for its services. The sudden storm around Mr. Barzel, a relatively isolated figure in his party despite his high office, has deeply angered lower ranks of the Christian Democrats, who face a series of difficult local and state election campaigns and fear that the scandal will hurt their chances. The feeling against the Speaker is intensified by the implication of the press reports - which are based on documents apparently obtained from the Flick subcommittee - that the money allegedly paid to Mr. Barzel was for his personal enrichment, not for the party. Last June, Economics Minister Otto Lambsdorff resigned days before he was indicted on charges of accepting Flick payoffs in return for significant tax waivers. But the Bonn prosecutor made it clear that he believed the money given to Mr. Lambsdorff was intended for his Free Democratic Party and did not enrich him personally. Mr. Barzel, who was elected Speaker in March of last year, cannot be removed from his position by a vote of the Parliament and he has indicated that he does not wish to resign and effectively admit guilt to the charges against him. But Mr. Kohl and other party leaders have given him little visible support and, according to some accounts might press for his resignation on Thursday.

An official of Walter Mondale's campaign here for the Democratic Presidential nomination said today that he is challenging the selection of a national delegate pledged to Gary Hart who was chosen by a cut of the cards. Richard Pinaire, Mondale's deputy state campaign coordinator, said he appealed to Democratic party officials the selection of Sarah Elder, of Lawrence, Kan., as a Hart delegate from the 2d District convention held in Topeka April 14. Mr. Hart and Mr. Mondale tied 69 to 69 among delegates attending the 2d District convention. Five delegates to the national convention were at stake, and the tie was broken by cutting a deck of cards to see who would get the odd fifth delegate. Mr. Pinaire said one of Mr. Hart's 2d District delegates did not have proper Hart credentials.

1478-> ADVERTISING; Ally & Gargano Prevails At Clio Awards Again
The annual Clio Awards, an always showy event in adland, reached new heights last night in celebrating its 25th anniversary at an expensively mounted extravaganza in Radio City Music Hall. The big agency winner for the fourth year in a row was Ally & Gargano, with six Clio statuettes. The big individual commercial winner was ''Fluffy Bun,'' better known as Wendy's ''Where's the beef?'' The major production house victor was Sedelmaier Film Productions, which did the Wendy's spot. It won four altogether and also had one of its early Federal Express spots entered in the Clio Classic Hall of Fame. Most of the 68 domestic Clio winners, chosen from among 5,411 entries, were named in categories of advertised products or services or for production values. Ally's winning clients, in addition to Federal Express, which took two, were Dunkin' Donuts, MCI Telecommunications, Travelers Insurance and National Distillers' Keller Geister wine. The two Federal spots also brought Clios to the production house of Kelly Pictures, New York, operated by Patrick Kelly, formerly the writer on the account at Ally and now running his own production facility as a director while continuing to write Federal copy freelance. Sedelmaier in Chicago formerly did all the Federal spots. Wendy's agency, Dancer Fitzgerald Sample, got a Clio. So did Clara Peller, who delivered the once- memorable line, as best actress. Ogilvy & Mather, with contributions from its New York, Atlanta and San Francisco offices, won four, with spots for American Express, Brooklyn Bridge Centennial, the Atlanta Ballet and Cornnuts, a toasted corn confection. Double agency winners included the Leo Burnett Company, which made it with Nestle and McDonald's; Doyle Dane Bernbach, with Volkswagen and Atari; Young & Rubicam, with a Dr Pepper spot that was best nonalcholic beverage and best performer for Chuck McCann as the Hunchback of Notre Dame; D.F.S., with KQED, San Francisco, in addition to its Wendy's spot; Fallon McElliott Rice of Minneapolis for the Minnesota Business Partnership and the Knox Lumber Company, and Chiat/Day, with a TV spot for Nike shoes and a cinema advertising variation of the ''1984'' spot for Apple's Macintosh computer.

My building is going to be converted to cooperative ownership. I am physically incapacitated due to poor vision and phlebitis and I know nothing about this subject. Can you tell me how to find a lawyer and other information? . . . R. E. S., Brooklyn Answer: The New York State Attorney General publishes a ''Cooperative and Condominium Conversion Handbook'' that discusses the rights of the disabled. For a free copy, write Attorney General Robert Abrams, 2 World Trade Center, New York, N.Y. 10047. The Brooklyn Bar Association, at 624-0675, can recommend a lawyer, including some who make house calls. Its hours are 10 A.M. to 12:30 P.M. and 2 P.M. to 3:30 P.M. The consultation fee for the first half hour is $15. Old School Ties Question: I have lived in the same apartment for more than 30 years at Columbia University, where my late husband was a professor. I travel to Europe for the summer and spend more than half the year there. My daughter attends the university and also is employed there part-time. Will she be able to move into the apartment if I leave next year? Or if I decide to keep the apartment, can I continue to live there less than half the year and still maintain rights to it? . . . E. M., Manhattan Answer: If the apartment is subject to rent control or stabilization, you may spend time in Europe and still keep the apartment so long as you maintain it as a primary residence, but if you leave permanently, your daughter would have to have lived in the apartment with you for a period of time before she can claim rights to tenancy, according to Nathaniel Geller, the state's assistant deputy counsel for rent administration. If your apartment is subject to rent regulations, it would be because your husband's tenancy predated his affiliation with Columbia or predated Columbia's purchase of the building. If the apartment is not subject to regulation, due to its ownership by a nonprofit educational institution, you can remain in the apartment as the widow of a faculty member as long as it is your primary residence. But the lease cannot be assigned without approval of the university, according to Martha McAndrew, a leasing specialist at the university's real-estate management office. The university probably would be sympathetic to your daughter's bypassing the waiting list and assuming the lease if she were a full-time affiliate of the university - a member of the student body, the faculty or the staff. Mrs. McAndrew says that as a part-time affiliate, she would not be eligible. Widow's Right to a Lease Question: My husband, who died recently, always signed the lease on our rent-stabilized apartment. Will I have trouble getting a renewal lease next year? . . . V. McQ., Jackson Heights, Queens Answer: As long as you were married and occupied the apartment with your husband, you are entitled to a renewal lease, according to Martin A. Shlufman, the state's deputy counsel for rent administration. If the landlord refuses to give you a lease, you can complain to the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal.

1481-> WOLCOX STOPS ROYALS AS TIGERS WIN PENNANT
The Detroit Tigers bolted to the ninth pennant in their 84-year American League history tonight when Milt Wilcox and Willie Hernandez held the anemic Kansas City Royals to three hits to complete a stunning three-game playoff sweep. The 1-0 victory put the Tigers in the World Series for the first time since 1968, gave Sparky Anderson a chance to become the first manager in baseball history to win a World Series championship in both leagues, and vindicated a team that believed it had been underrated despite a 104-58 record. Wilcox's performance was dazzling. After a 17-victory season, the finest of his major league career, the right-hander held the Royals to two singles and two walks, while striking out eight. Before yielding to Hernandez in the ninth, Wilcox threw 108 pitches, 78 of them strikes, despite the pain of a chronic arthritic condition in his right shoulder. As a rookie exactly 14 years ago, Wilcox also closed out a playoff sweep, that one for the National League Cincinnati Reds when Anderson was their first-year manager. Savoring the MomentsAs a guy gets older, he needs the exciting times to get the adreneline going,'' said the 34-year-old pitcher who nearly left the Tigers as a free agent last winter. ''I don't know how long I have left to pitch, so I have to savor these moments. I can't really explain the satisfaction I feel, for myself and all the guys on this team.'' ''With a 1-0 lead in the playoffs, you have to have some kind of guts to do what he did tonight,'' said Roger Craig, the Tigers' pitching coach, who is reconsidering retirement. ''With his arm the way it is, a lot of times he's pitching on guts alone.'' Charlie Leibrandt, the Royals' pitcher who was promoted in midseason from Class AAA ball, pitched almost as well as Wilcox, handcuffing the hard-hitting Tigers after their second-inning run, allowing three hits in eight innings and striking out six. ''Charlie's kept us in games all year,'' Manager Dick Howser of the Royals said, ''and anytime you give up one run, you expect to win.'' ''I did everything I hoped to do,'' Leibrandt said. ''I honestly didn't expect to throw that good a ball game.'' ''That's one of the best games I've seen pitched against us all year,'' Wilcox said. ''I haven't seen too many guys keep us off balance like that.'' .170 Batting AverageThe Royals' three hits gave them a total of 18 for the series, during which they batted .170, and showed them to be as weak a team as their 84-78 record indicated. For Howser, the series extended his playoff misfortunes: In three league championships, one with the Yankees in 1980 and two with the Royals, the last in 1981, Howser has directed his teams to nine consecutive losses. Detroit's lone run scored largely because of a slight defensive failing by the second baseman Frank White, who muffed a chance at a double play. Over all, the Royals committed three errors tonight, two by Don Slaught, the catcher, and one by Steve Balboni, the first baseman. For the series, the Royals had seven errors, a record for a three-game championship series. The Tigers, by contrast, played flawless defense tonight, with two plays in particular backing up Wilcox's pitching. In the seventh inning, the third baseman Marty Castillo made a back-handed stop of a liner by Darryl Motley for the out at first. In the eighth inning, with Slaught on base with a single, Darrell Evans dove for a shot toward first base, snared the ball and slid into the bag ahead of the speedy Willie Wilson. Leibrandt's strength all season has pitching out of trouble with a double-play ball, but White betrayed him in the second inning. With runners at first and third after Barbaro Garbey's infield single, Chet Lemon's force play at second and a base hit by Evans, Leibrandt's changeup to Castillo seemed to provide the ground ball the Royals needed to halt the Tigers. Onix Concepcion fielded the ball at shortstop and tossed to White for the second out. White seemed to lose his footing as he pivoted for the throw to first and his weak relay was not in time, with Lemon scoring and 52,168 Tiger Stadium spectators howling approval. Stunning Night's WorkThe run was all the Tigers needed, although they could not have guessed it at the time. ''Nobody ever dreamed one run would hold in this ballpark,'' said Anderson, who won four National League pennants and two championships with the Reds. Once Wilcox had finished his stunning night's work, however, and Hernandez had earned his save, the manager was permitted some wholehearted jubilation. ''I honestly believe that this is as good a group of people to get in the pits with as I've ever had,'' Anderson said. ''I'm so proud that they're able to represent the American League, and especially themselves, in the World Series. To see the look on my kids' faces when they walk out for their first World Series game - I know what it's like, but they'll be shocked. They think this is something, but it's four times what this is. I'd like to be inside each and every one of them to feel the thrill. It's something all the money in the world can't buy.'' 3 New Umpires Three of the umpires who replaced the strikers in Kansas City remained in the same positions at Tiger Stadium tonight. Bill Deegan, with 10 years of major league experience, was again behind the plate, Jon Bible was at first base and Randy Christal at second. They were joined by three local umpires with collegiate experience: Doug Cossey, Richard Runchey and Richard Zivic. The three umpires who worked both parts of the series will receive $10,000, the same fee the striking umpires would have gotten. The three additional umpires here in Detroit will receive $4,000 and the six who worked one game apiece in Kansas City $2,160. . . . Several hundred policemen lined the field at game's end, ably preventing the sort of carnage that occured here when the Tigers clinched the American League East. . . . The Tiger locker-room celebration was relatively mild, similar to the ones in Cincinnatti during Anderson's tenure there.

1482-> ACCORD ON STOLEN OBJECTS
The Guatemalan Foreign Minister, Fernando Andrade, said today that he and Secretary of State George P. Shultz had signed an agreement on Monday that commits the United States to the recovery and return of stolen Guatemalan cultural and archeological objects. The agreement, similar to others this country has with Central American nations, is aimed at impeding the sale of stolen art and archeological objects, which have immense value to collectors. Mr. Andrade was present at a press conference at the National Geographic Society headquarters today at which George E. Stuart, staff archeologist of the society, described the finding of the Mayan tomb in Guatemala on May 15.

1484-> POLITICS; POLITICAL FOCUS SHIFTS TO KEAN AND 1985 RACE
TRENTON WHEN Governor Kean told Republican campaign workers Tuesday night that they had helped to build a G.O.P. majority in the country that would last for a long time to come, some of them said it was time to start Mr. Kean's re-election campaign. The Governor was pleased by the expressions of support, but he has said that he will not announce his plans until after the first of the year. With the Presidential election over, however, Mr. Kean becomes the focus of attention as the gubernatorial election takes center stage, and he appears to be in as strong a position to win a second term as President Reagan was. Like Mr. Reagan and Senator Bill Bradley, the Democratic incumbent who also easily won re- election Tuesday, Governor Kean has become a public figure whose personal popularity transcends party identification. Indeed, if there is a lesson to be drawn from the election results, it is that party labels mean very little in statewide elections in New Jersey. More than a 1.5 million voters split their ballots between President Reagan at the top of the column and Senator Bradley in the second spot. The words ''Democrat'' and ''Republican'' appear in smaller print on campaign literature these days, if they appear at all. The candidates and their ability to get their messages across and establish a pleasing public image usually carry the day. New Jersey's two United States Senators, Mr. Bradley and Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of Montclair, never ran for public office before they won election to important national posts. Both men had the wherewithal to mount successful campaigns without seeking the blessing of important party leaders or ''paying their dues'' by first running for lesser elective office. The days when it was impossible to seek high office without party backing are over. The parties are no longer the chief sources of information for voters, nor of financing for candidates. Most voters get their information about candidates from televised campaign commercials. In addition, public financing in gubernatorial elections and the ability of individuals to raise money from a variety of sources, including a growing number of special- interest Political Action Committees eager for access to public officials, has lessened the importance of the party organizations. Public-opinion surveys have indicated that many people do not know which party Governor Kean belongs to, a fact that shows the information is not important in their decisions about whether they will support him or not. Indeed, Mr. Kean's popularity with Democrats, more than anything else, may limit the field of Democratic candidates for their party's nomination for Governor in next June's primary. The Governor would have to suffer some political setback in the next few months to make him anything but a strong favorite for re-election, should he decide to run again. If he does run - and it would be a major surprise if he demurred - Mr. Kean will hardly have to lift a finger to get his campaign off to a fast start. When he ran in 1981, Roger Bodman of Frenchtown, an aide to Representative James A. Courter, Republican of Hackettstown, directed the successful Kean campaign. Mr. Bodman was later appointed the state's Commissioner of Labor by Mr. Kean, and when the Reagan-Bush campaign geared up in New Jersey, he resigned to become its director. Mr. Courter was chairman of the President's re-election effort in New Jersey. In effect, the Kean campaign organization became the Reagan campaign apparatus, and is now in place and tuned up to continue functioning if Mr. Kean needs it. Like President Reagan, Governor also has developed a rapport with Democrats in the state, especially those, like Mayor Gerald McCann of Jersey City, who believe in helping those who help in return, regardless of party labels. Mayor McCann has received assistance in redevelopment of the city's valuable Hudson riverfront from both the Federal and state administrations, and Mr. Kean has said he wants to make the riverfront the focus of economic growth for years to come.

1485-> MONDALE SEEKS APOLOGY FROM BUSH ON LEBANON
An angry Walter F. Mondale demanded an apology today from Vice President Bush for making what the Democratic Presidential nominee called an ''unpardonable'' comment Thursday night about Lebanon. Speaking in a strong voice before a crowd of at least 25,000 in Madison, Wis., his largest rally of the campaign, and in remarks elsewhere through the day, Mr. Mondale attacked Mr. Bush for saying in the debate with Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro that the two Democrats believed American marines died ''in shame'' in Lebanon. Mr. Mondale's attack on Mr. Bush, in a day of campaigning in Miami and Madison, reached its angriest pitch in Minneapolis when the Democratic Presidential candidate arrived here and learned that Mr. Bush had refused to apologize for the remark. Bush 'Ought to Be Ashamed' Mr. Mondale described himself as ''very, very angry,'' and said that Mr. Bush ''ought to be ashamed of himself.'' In the debate with the Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee, Mr. Bush termed the bombing of the United States Embassy in Beirut ''a wanton terrorist action'' and said American troops had helped bring about a ''government of reconciliation.'' He added: ''For somebody to suggest, as our opponents have, that these men died in shame, they had better not tell the parents of those young marines.'' A total of 241 marines and other Americans died in the explosion at the marine barracks on Oct. 23, 1983. Earlier, with Mrs. Ferraro seated behind him on the State Capital steps in Madison, Mr. Mondale said, ''Now we all make mistakes in campaigns but that one is unpardonable. Mr. Bush, we love this country as much as you do. And, Mr. Bush, we honor our men and women who die in the service of our country, and we grieve for their families as much as you do. ''Mr. Bush, apologize today for that remark,'' said Mr. Mondale to thunderous applause. Ferraro Also Asks for Apology Later in Chicago, Mrs. Ferraro herself called on Mr. Bush to apologize, saying she was more concerned about receiving an apology for that statement than for an unflattering predebate description of her by Mr. Bush's press secretary. The aide, Peter Teeley, told The Wall Street Journal that she was ''too bitchy.'' In Minneapolis, Mr. Mondale said, ''I decided to spend the night to see if I would cool off, and I'm getting more angry every time. There's no excuse for this. ''He should be ashamed of himself,'' said Mr. Mondale. ''If Mr. Bush thinks as Vice President of the United States he can tell the American people that I either stated or implied that our marines in Lebanon lost their lives - lost as a result of shame, when he knows utterly and absolutely that's an appalling and atrocious misstatement of the facts and won't apologize, he ought to be ashamed of himself. ''And if he thinks this is the end of it he hasn't seen anything yet,'' said Mr. Mondale. Spending Weekend at Home Mr. Mondale flew to Minneapolis to spend the weekend at his home in suburban North Oaks, to prepare for his debate on foreign policy with Mr. Reagan in Kansas City on Oct. 21. In Miami Beach, Mr. Mondale's first stop of the day, he assailed Mr. Bush at a fund-raising breakfast. ''Mr. Bush, if you don't apologize, in my debate with the President on the 21st I'm going to bring it up and demand that he take responsbility for what you've done,'' he said. Later Mr. Mondale and his aides voiced exuberance about the size of the rally in Madison. Crowds packed downtown streets to welcome Mr. Mondale and Mrs. Ferraro. Mr. Mondale took the unusual step of speaking before Mrs. Ferraro and introducing his running-mate to the enthusiastic crowd. Mrs. Ferraro said, ''Today's paper reported that Senator Laxalt said that the President was, and I quote, brutalized by a briefing process which smothered him with facts. Now I ask you, since when is it considered cruel and unusual punishment to expect the President to learn the facts he needs to govern.'' The crowd cheered and applauded the remarks in reference to Senator Paul Laxalt, Republican of Nevada. With Mr. Mondale's crowds increasing over the past few days and a note of optimism in his campaign, Mrs. Ferraro said: ''This is a brand new race. It's getting hot. And they're feeling the heat. It's getting close. And they're getting worried. Walter Mondale and I have just begun to fight.'' In the past few days Mr. Mondale has voiced anger at Mr. Reagan and derided him for repeatedly paying tribute to such Democratic leaders as Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman and Lyndon B. Johnson. Today, with Mr. Reagan on his whistle- stop tour in Ohio, Mr. Mondale used some of Truman's words against Mr. Reagan. Mr. Mondale recalled that in the 1948 campaign Mr. Truman said, ''The Republicans who live in the past remind me of a toy all of you have seen. This toy is a small wooden bird called a floogie bird. And around the floogie bird's neck is a label reading, 'I fly backwards. I don't care where I'm going. I just want to see where I've been.' ''

1486-> Congress Unit Concurs In 6-Year Bias Ruling
A Congressional investigative agency has agreed to a ruling by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that said the agency ''discriminated intentionally and unlawfully'' against blacks in promoting employees from 1976 to 1982. The commission's hearing examiner, Chester Relyea, announced the decision Wednesday, saying blacks were significantly disadvantaged in the promotion process at the agency, the General Accounting Office. According to a civil rights legal group, his 152-page decision documents numerous defects in the agency's promotion system and cites ''repeated evidence that managers were able to and did regularly manipulate'' that system.

1487-> PANEL FINDS RACISM IN A TOLEDO HIGH SCHOOL
Black students at a public high school have been placed in entry-level courses and white students have been placed in honors classes regardless of their grades, and the school superintendent says he will discipline whoever was responsible. A school district panel's three-week investigation of class scheduling at DeVilbiss High School also found that teachers were assigned to the entry- level courses as punishment. Hugh Caumartin, superintendent of Toledo's public schools, said: ''There are classrooms at DeVilbiss that are racially isolated beyond what is acceptable, and those students were assigned to certain teachers based on punishment. Why? We don't know.'' Freshmen Were Most Affected Officials of the Toledo school district, which has 43,000 pupils, appointed a committee to investigate complaints of racial segregation at the school. The committee reported that a disproportionate number of black students had been assigned to the basic, entry-level classes. The segregation, which Mr. Caumartin called ''serious,'' occurred particularly among freshmen at DeVilbiss. Enrollment at the four-year high school is 1,137 students, and almost half are black. Thirty-eight percent of the white freshmen were assigned to honors classes, as against 5 percent of the blacks. Twelve percent of the whites were in basic courses, and 56 percent of the blacks were. Grades were apparently not considered, the report said. Freshmen were assigned to classes by school administrators rather than by computer, the method used at the other seven public high schools in the district, school officials said. Brought to Light by Complaint Mr. Caumartin said he would meet with administrators and lawyers on the situation and ask checks on all high schools in the district. The situation came to light early last month when Constance Robinson, assistant superintendent, got a letter from a black teacher who complained of being assigned to teach a disproportionate number of basic-level courses. Teachers are normally given a mix of class levels. The assistant superintedent said school officials would try to correct the problem in a way that would be least disruptive to students. ''Maybe we can't get a racial balance this year, but beyond a doubt by next year,'' she said. The Rev. Floyd Rose, head of the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, who is a consultant on the fact- finding committee, said he was convinced the situation was limited to DeVilbiss High School.

1488-> P.B.A., COMMUTER AIRLINE IN EAST, GROUNDED BY AGENCY OVER SAFETY
The Federal Aviation Administration yesterday ordered the emergency grounding of Provincetown-Boston Airline, which carries more passengers than any other commuter airline in the nation. The agency said P.B.A. had committed ''fraudulent'' actions in qualifying pilots to fly its planes and had violated numerous other safety rules. The airline's 105 planes were carrying about 4,000 passengers a day on more than 500 flights, largely in the resort areas of New England and South Florida. The agency said P.B.A. was evidently the largest carrier ever to have its flights halted by Government order. The shutdown order leaves a number of the communities served by the line without scheduled air service. In a companion move, the aviation agency revoked the pilot's license of the airline's chairman, J. C. Van Arsdale Jr., for personally operating a flight ''in a reckless manner endangering the lives'' of passengers and crew. ''I'm so shocked right now,'' Mr. Van Arsdale told United Press International. ''I just can't believe it's happening. We're throwing 1,500 people out of work. When you revoke someone's certificate, it's pretty much permanent.'' ''We had offered to cooperate with them in any way they wanted, but the F.A.A. didn't feel that was an adequate response,'' he said. ''Now we're trying to get a feeling about what our options are.'' An airline vice president, Maurice P. Morisette Jr., said company officials would have no official comment until they had had a chance to study the matter. Calls to an airline reservation office in Massachusetts were answered with the recorded message: ''P.B.A. apologizes for the temporary cancellation of all our flights. The F.A.A. has unjustifiably grounded us and we feel they are being insensitive to the needs of the communities we serve.'' A key charge included in a 13-page list of alleged safety violations was that the company had made ''fraudulent or intentionally false statements'' about successful completion of flight checks to qualify pilots on specific types of aircraft. In one of a dozen specific examples, the company was said to have qualified a pilot, Connie Brinton Scharr, to fly a DC-3 although no flight to check her proficiency had been made. Airline pilots must be given check flights by supervisory pilots every six months. Miss Scharr was one of several pilots said to have given depositions to the aviation agency on the company's operations. Among other alleged violations were that training of pilots and flight attendents had not met requirements, planes had not been inspected within required intervals and unauthorized personnel had done maintenance. Mr. Van Arsdale, the chairman, was charged with failing to land a plane promptly when he encountered hydraulic problems and with insisting on completing the trip after a switch was belatedly made to a second type of plane, even though neither he nor the other pilot aboard were legally qualified to fly it. Yesterday's action went into effect at noon, although passengers hoping to fly out of New York's La Guardia Airport were told of the disruption earlier. ''As of 12 noon we ceased operations. said Kim LaForge, a manager for the airline at La Guardia. ''We explained to the passengers we are not operating.'' ''Many were upset,'' she added. ''Many have flown us for years and they couldn't understand why we weren't operating.'' Flights to Massachusetts Some 10 flights a day have been operated out of La Guardia, from the old Eastern Airlines Terminal, to four points in Massachusetts: Hyannis, Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket and New Bedford. The Florida operation, based in Naples, was even larger than the one in the Northeast, operating to most of the important resort areas in South Florida as well as to New Orleans. Vice Adm. Donald D. Engen, the retired Navy pilot who heads the aviation agency, emphasized in his official statement accompanying the list of alleged violations that his agency stood ready to assist the airline ''in a constructive effort'' to get its house in order so it could get back into business. However, agency officials and safety specialists said that this could consume a lot of time and that it might well require significant changes in the management structure. The airline was to hold a board meeting yesterday to decide what might be done to salvage the company, which had reported revenues of $24.7 million in the third quarter of 1984 and a profit of $2.4 million. The company sold its first public shares in September 1983. Mr. Morisette said in an interview: ''Our intent is to do whatever is necessary to keep going. The problem is that, when you're shut down for an extended period, it can be very devastating.'' Investigation in SeptemberThe F.A.A. began looking closely into the airline's operations in September, according to an agency spokesman, Jack Barker. The inquiry was precipitated, Mr. Barker said, when a pilot who had been dismissed by the airline contacted the agency and accused his former employer of multiple violations having to do, among other things, with pilot training and the way planes were loaded. The former pilot was Carlo Giammette, 25- years old, who was dismissed in December 1982 and says he could get no more work as a pilot for 16 months. He has recently been flying as second officer of a DC-8 jet for another scheduled airline, he said in an telephone interview. Mr. Giammette stressed that he was in no way trying to disrupt the lives of any of the 1,500 airline employees but hoped to correct a situation that was a threat to air safety. Mr. Morisette said, on the other hand, that the pilot got into a lot of fights with colleagues and ''wasn't a good employee.'' The airline began operations between Boston and Provincetown, at the tip of Cape Cod, in the 1940's. It later moved into the Florida market to complement the seasonal nature of its resort business. Mr. Van Arsdale bought the company from his father, the airline's founder, in 1980. It has expanded rapidly since the industry was deregulated in 1978. The airline has had a good safety record over the years, but an accident in September killed one passenger and injured five others when a small piston plane carrying the wrong kind of fuel crashed near Naples. The company's fleet includes nine 55- passenger YS-11's, which are turboprop craft built in Japan, 11 Martin 404 piston planes carrying 44 passengers, 12 30-passenger DC-3's, 20 Brazilian Bandeirantes carrying 19 passengers, and nine small twin engine Cessnas carrying nine passengers. Especially hard-hit by yesterday's grounding, said one F.A.A. official, were the promoters of the International Power Boat Championships being held in Key West, Fla., this weekend. They were said to have complained that the stoppage of flights would seriously inconvenience many of the 25,000 people expected at the boating events. Other Recent Suspensions Several other airlines have been suspended or grounded outright by the F.A.A. in the last year or two. Among them were Air Illinois, which came under scrutiny in the wake of a crash that killed 10 people; Guy America Airways, which flew mainly between New York and Guyana and was grounded for numerous safety violations, and South Pacific Island Airways, which had a charter flight wander 500 miles off course recently and come close to intruding into Soviet airspace. After being grounded for four weeks, Air Illinois resumed operations in January but in April it announced it was suspending flights. It has since filed for reorganization under the bankruptcy laws. Guy America was grounded in March 1983 and never resumed operations. South Pacific Island Airways has been grounded for several weeks and is appealing it's grounding order.

1489-> U.S.-SAUDI RELATIONS: NOT BY OIL ALONE
To the Editor: It would be a sad commentary on United States-Saudi Arabia relations if oil revenues alone were the measure of that relationship as Stanley Reed seems to suggest in his ''Saudis' Ties Loosen'' (Op-Ed Sept. 27). Instead of discerning the economic changes taking place and contributing to a more rational and durable relationship, Mr. Reed dwells on isolated cases of business failures and increased competition for United States companies, to announce the beginning of the ''distancing,'' albeit ''gradual,'' as he kindly puts it, of the two countries from each other. Despite the decline in oil revenues since 1981 and the consequent retrenchment in public spending, Saudi Arabia's trade with the United States registered a surplus of over $4 billion last year in favor of the United States. And although this year's surplus should be somewhat lower, the Saudi market remains one bright spot in an otherwise growing United States trade deficit with the rest of the world. Admittedly, American companies are losing some of the advantages of yesteryears. But far from being the result of any erosion or decline of political or economic ties, it is the result of economic and social progress and growing self-reliance. The establishment of infrastructural installations and basic industries, including petrochemicals and steel, has altered considerably the once one-sector economy. Even in agriculture, Saudi Arabia has now achieved self-sufficiency in wheat and grain. The maturing of domestic financial and investment institutions, such as the Saudi Basic Industries Corporation and the Saudi Industrial Development Fund, and the establishment of local Saudi and joint Saudi-foreign construction and contracting companies staffed by an increasing number of Saudis with professional and managerial skills are important new elements in the country's fast-evolving condition. And in recognition of these developments, legal and administrative enactments have changed some of the old ways of doing business in the country. The introduction last year of the open-tender rule put an end to the previous practice of restricting bidding to companies with ''prequalification.'' In addition, Ministerial Resolution 124 requires that non-Saudi companies assign 30 percent of Government contracts to Saudi contractors (or joint Saudi-foreign ones, if they are locally domiciled). These new regulations have naturally led to greater competition from nontraditional sources, primarily Saudi and Asian companies, such as Korea's Hyundai, which recently won a $574 million construction contract, and Saudi Arabia's Binladen Organization, with a $266 million contract. If these changes signal anything to United States-Saudi relations, they signal the start of a new era of cooperation based on the sharing of American companies with Saudis in the economic development of their country, just as Saudi investors now participate in joint ventures with American enterprises in a more healthy and durable two-way cooperation.

1490-> LETTERS TO THE LONG ISLAND EDITORS;
The wind just changed - you could literally see the cold front in the sky as the temperature dropped. I think of Matthew with the fresh earth over him, dried leaves of autumn through which we walked, blowing all around. When his family lights the winter fires, he will lie two miles away with the snow drifting against his stone, forever 16. Matthew didn't die of a lingering illness; a drunken driver struck him. It will be a measure of Suffolk County's seriousness about its drunken-driving laws if, next November, that drunken driver is not out and around to walk through the autumn leaves but, instead, is in jail listening to them blow dryly against the outside walls.

1491-> LETTERS ON TRAVEL; Kerouac
To the Editor: I read Herbert Mitgang's review of ''A Guide to Writers' Homes in New England'' (Travel Bookshelf, Oct. 21) with hope of some mention of Jack Kerouac's birthplace (and burial site) in the fastly reviving mill town of Lowell, Mass. Although his homes on Moody Street, Sarah Avenue and Lupine Road are not open to the public, they and their surroundings offer enormous and valuable insight into this most American of authors. Echoes of his oft-described childhood in Lowell come to vivid life as one ambles down the streets and through the alleys that, some 50 years later, are frequented by present-day youths, as Kerouac himself most surely did during his adolescence in the lean Depression years. As Kerouac's influence and reputation begins to gain a proper place in literary America, a brief respite in Lowell may prove valuable to the traveling literati. DONALD D. ADLER New York

1493-> The President And the Press
The illustration on the opening page of Steven R. Weisman's article ''The President and the Press'' (Oct. 14), suggests one remedy for the unhappy situation he describes. Look at all those soup-can- sized zoom lenses used to create the impression that the news media and the President are in close proximity. An honest lens would reveal that the President is in fact standing 30 to 40 feet away from the press. If the President does indeed operate at such a distance from the press, then camera lenses and reporting should reflect this reality. As for the continual ducking of questions by retreat into the shelter of noisy helicopter blades, etc., let the press report, on camera and in print, a fair share of the questions ducked, rather than concentrating solely on the set-piece remarks. To me, Mr. Weisman's article describes a press corps that seems far too eager to appear to be doing a close-up job of reporting, one that would rather look good (and make the President look good in the process) than to reveal that it is, in fact, being kept at several long arm-lengths and permitting itself to be manipulated like high-school journalism students.

1495-> PRINCIPALS SWAP EDUCATION IDEAS
THE nominal point of the meeting was a presentation on ''cooperative learning'' techniques, in which a group of three or four pupils work together in cheerful if seemingly chaotic competition with other groups of classmates. But the real business of the session last month came after the lecturers had put their materials away, and the roomful of elementary and secondary school principals turned to the matters closest to their hearts. Some of the 60 educators, gathered in the Schwartz Library of the C. W. Post campus of Long Island University, talked of meddlesome school board members, others of the new state mandates about programs. One principal was worried about structuring classes for gifted students; others compared notes on finding foreign- language teachers. The occasion was the year's first meeting of the Long Island Principals Center, a two-year-old venture in educational self-support that is part of a growing national movement. Most recent studies of educational problems have said that schools should be more autonomous and that principals should do more than they have to define what students are being taught. While many principals agree with the conclusions, many say they are not sure how to sell the redirection to their superintendents or staffs and want practical advice from their peers. To get that, they have established more than 40 academies and centers, like the one here, where they can hear presentations on educational techniques and swap ideas on making changes within the limits set by state rules, district budgets or union contracts. The center here is a collaborative effort beween the college's school of education and the Nassau County Association of Elementary School Principals. Last year the state provided $20,000, which paid for planning the center and conducting four large workshops on topics such as handling declining enrollment and creative uses of school space. This year the center is expanding to include secondary principals and school administrators from Suffolk. John E. Owens, the director, said its programs would be open to all 622 public school principals in the two counties as well as 250 private and parochial school administrators. There is no charge for the sessions, which principals attend after regular school hours. The sessions are held roughly once a month. Principals said they could read about new management techniques, but that they needed the center to arrange the face-to-face conversations with experts. Thus, for example, the center has lined up specialists at Grumman headquarters in Bethpage to show the principals how to use computers both in classrooms and in the administrative offices. Another session will explore ''quality circles,'' a management technique originally devised to raise manufacturing productivity but increasingly applied to service industries. The center also arranges ''collegial circles,'' in which seven or eight principals visit a school to, in the words of Vernon Gokey, principal of Hempstead's Fulton Street School, ''see what they are doing that we can steal.'' In one typical exchange at a recent eeting, Maria Aquilina, newly named as assistant principal of the Northside Elementary School in Farmingdale, wanted to know what to do about scheduling ''pullouts,'' the special classes in arts or music or remedial writing that break up the teacher's normal schedule. Is it better for the students to have all the pullouts on a single day or regular time slot? she wondered. And which makes the best use of the teachers' time? ''There is very little literature on this,'' Mr. Gokey said. Miss Aquilina would be welcome to see what his school has been doing to eliminate morning pullouts for first, second and third grades, he said, adding that she should also take a look at what Great Neck has been doing with the problem. Joan Urbas, principal of the Covert Avenue School in Elmont, said she had been able to schedule a meeting in which the teachers told the superintendent about the classroom impact of the pullout interruptions. Even within a single school, the problems range from abstract theories of pedagogy to the intractably concrete. Rosalie Samuels, the principal of the Northside school, said she wanted to get more programs for the facility's personal computers. ''We bought PET's,'' she said, ''and that's bad, because everybody else bought Apples.'' Mr. Gokey said he would like to help, but he was one of those ''everybody elses.'' But he said if he found another school using PET's, he would call her. Later, over dinner, Mrs. Samuels worried out loud about an offer she had from a business executive who had volunteered to teach a regular class. She would like the addition to the program, she said, but was concerned about whether it might be an inappropriate commercial intrusion into the school day. The issue set off a spirited debate about ethics and costs, about the need for community and business support of schools versus the dangers of orienting a curriculum so closely to what parents think their children will need for career success that the schools may slight broader needs for encouraging children to think. The principal did not get an answer, but she did take away some new perspectives and understanding of what her peers thought was appropriate action. And that is the major point of the center, said Thomas Lovett, the principal of the Guggenheim School in Port Washington and one of the founders of the center. ''Principals don't get out too much,'' he said, ''and they don't get to see each other. Sometimes a principal thinks he or she is the only one who had the problem. This helps the quality of the local schools by showing how much we have in common.''

1496-> LISZT'S REQUIEM -A DEFINITE RARITY
Franz Liszt, who took four minor church orders in 1865 and thenceforth called himself an abbe, did seem to have a strong religious feeling. That is part of his eternal fascination. Liszt's curiously lopsided path through life saw him Europe's greatest pianist, whose career as a touring virtuoso lasted only some eight years. It saw him admired as one of Europe's great lovers; and yet from the beginning he had a mystical, religious bent. It saw him vain and spoiled, yet extraordinarily kind and helpful to his colleagues. He made a big thing about being Hungarian, but could never speak the language. A complicated man, Franz Liszt, and there have been those able to see only one side of his profile. The great English critic Ernest Newman was one, and his study of Liszt remains one of the all-time hatchet jobs. In the last half of his life, Liszt, who wore his cassock like a military uniform, composed a great deal of religious music. Not much of it is heard, probably for good reason. Liszt, so daring in his piano music, so Mephistophelean in such works as the ''Faust'' Symphony and ''Dante'' Sonata, could be downright stuffy when he bent his music to religion. It is true that there are great moments in his oratorio, ''Christus,'' and such works as the Requiem have sections that illustrate how Liszt was probably the greatest harmonic innovator of the 19th century, Chopin and Wagner included. But the great moments in Liszt's religious music pass quickly and the half-hours are long. As much a hero in today's Hungary as Chopin is in Poland, Liszt is lavishly represented in the Hungarian catalogues. Among recent issues are the Requiem, three symphonic poems and some piano music. It is the Requiem that should be of most interest to Liszt collectors. In the West, one will not normally encounter it in a lifetime of concert-going. Liszt scored his Requiem for male chorus, backed by organ and tympani. It is a fairly late work, completed in 1871. Not much information about it appears in the Liszt literature. The liner notes, written by a Hungarian, state that the writing was influenced by the Cecilian movement of the 19th century - which means an avoidance of operatic-sounding or ornate music in favor of simple lines. In the Requiem, Liszt merged the archaic Roman style, which looked back to Palestrina, with elements of chant. The writer points out, correctly, that this Liszt Requiem has harmonies that anticipate ''Parsifal,'' and also harmonies reminiscent of Gesualdo. The Gesualdo reference is hard to believe. It seems highly unlikely that Liszt could ever have heard or even seen the music of that amazing but - in Liszt's day - altogether forgotten composer. Anyway, the long Requiem is ambitious, devout and, alas, rather boring. With all of its ventures into unorthodox harmonies and experiments with the whole-tone scale, the score sounds dutifully religious rather than inspired. On this disk it is sung by Alfonz Bartha and Sandor Palcso, tenors; Zsolt Bende, baritone, and Peter Kovacs, bass, with the chorus of the Hungarian People's Army directed by Janos Ferencsik (Fidelio FL 3356). The vocal soloists are competent, the chorus rather edgy, the conducting firm and precise. Ferencsik and the Hungarian State Orchestra can be heard in three of Liszt's symphonic poems - ''Tasso,'' ''Orpheus'' and ''Les Preludes'' (Hungaroton SLPD 12446). Fifty years ago ''Les Preludes'' was one of the staples of the orchestral repertory. Then the tastemakers decided that it wqas bombastic and outsized in its rhetoric, and the piece all but disappeared. In recent years it has been making a comeback, and it should. It is much better than its reputation. But there are better performances than those found on this recording. The orchestra is not one of the majors, and Ferencsik here is more a routinier than an imaginative leader. The recorded sound is tubby and not well defined. Those who admire the Liszt symphonic poems can get all 13 in a five- disk Philips album conducted by Haitink. And ''Les Preludes'' is the filler in the new version of Liszt's ''Faust'' Symphony conducted by Riccardo Muti and the Philadelphia Orchestra (Angel DSB 3928, two disks). Unlike the Hungarian disks, these represent state of the art recorded sound. Muti conducts with a literalism that verges on pedanticism, but is saved by his rhythmic drive and by the great orchestra under his baton. He uses the choral ending, with the male chorus of the Westminster Choir and G"osta Winbergh as the tenor soloist. Liszt's B minor Piano Sonata remains one of the supreme tests of a pianist, and most have rushed to get ''their'' interpretation on records. Latest to join the mob is the young (19 years old) Italian, Andrea Lucchesini, who fills out the disk with the ''Ricordanza,'' ''Paganini Etude'' No. 4, ''La Campanella'' and the Sixth Hungarian Rhapsody (Angel DS 38099). Technically, Lucchesini handles everything. Musically he is an innocent. He thinks he can make the music ''expressive'' with stop-and-go pianism. All he does is break up the lines. He has very little idea of the color, the sweep or the organicism of the piece. So one must turn to the recordings of such veterans as Horowitz, Bolet or Arrau to get a real idea of the Sonata, or to the work of such younger pianists as Martha Argerich or Horacio Gutierrez. From Hungary comes a delightful disk of Liszt piano music or, to be more accurate, Rossini-Liszt - the ''Soirees musicales,'' played by Jen"o Jando (Hungaroton SLPX 12361). In his years of retirement, Rossini composed songs for soirees held in his own home or in aristocratic salons. Some are simple, some are irreverent, all have the heartbeat of Italy in them. In 1835, 12 of the songs were published under the title of ''Soirees musicales.'' Liszt transcribed the set for solo piano two years later. He must have had fun with it. The writing has its difficult sections, but so skillful a transcriber as Liszt realized that he had to maintain the songlike nature of the originals, and many of them are well within the grasp of skilled amateur pianists. Jando is a 34-year-old Hungarian pianist whose name is not yet internationally known. But he is a skilled artist, and he plays these pieces with spirit, color and a lovely arched melodic line. The recorded sounds needs considerable bass cut. Hungaroton has some wonderful things in its catalogue, and it is a pity that the quality of its engineering and pressing does not come up to international standards.

1497-> EVERYBODY WAS WRONG ABOUT COOKIES AND PRAYERS
To the Editor: This is to set the record straight in what must be the most misquoted law case of the election campaign. Your Nov. 4 editorial ''Five Reasons to Vote for Mondale'' referred to a prayer decision cited by President Reagan in correspondence with Norman Lear and in his first debate with Walter Mondale. You state that on both occasions Mr. Reagan said the court forbade voluntary prayer. You go on to say that the President was incorrect and that in the case referred to the court had upheld voluntary prayer. Both are incorrect. The case is Stein v. Oshinsky, decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on July 7, 1965. The case involved children in an elementary school in New York City (Whitestone, Queens) in grades from kindergarten to the sixth, where teachers instructing kindergarten classes permitted the organized recital of nondenominational prayer before taking cookies and milk. The principal ordered the teachers instructing those classes to stop such group recitals. He also ordered his teachers to stop the saying of such prayers in other classroom situations. The prayers involved were said out loud, in organized observance and under teacher supervision. The issue for the court to decide was whether it was within the power of the principal of the school to decide that such group prayer would not be permitted during school hours. The court held that the principal had the lawful power to stop such prayer. It analogized that just as a court would not have to allow interference with a trial or an argument any time that spectators or witnesses or jurors desired to indulge in collective oral prayer, a school does not deprive pupils of their right to pray by enjoining such prayer during school hours. The court expressly said that its ruling does not cover cases where pupils have obligatory religious requirements, for example, that of a Moslem obligated to prostrate himself five times daily in the direction of Mecca, or the child whose beliefs forbade his partaking of milk and cookies without saying the blessings of his faith. The Court implied that in such cases school authorities would permit individual momentary observances. The court also noted, although it did not decide, that in the context of the state-mandated education of young children, group voluntary prayer is illusory since any organized prayer activity requires the active participation of teachers.

1499-> DOW SURGES 29.49; BOND PRICES CLIMB
Bond prices climbed sharply in the credit markets yesterday, as falling oil prices and the Federal Reserve's reluctance to prop up a key interest rate sent traders on a buying binge. The belief that interest rates may drop was reinforced late in the day, when the Fed announced that the nation's basic money supply measure, M-1, fell $2.9 billion in the week ended Oct. 8, to a seasonally adjusted average of $545.6 billion. The notion was further buttressed in the futures markets, where Treasury bond futures posted their biggest one- day gain in three months. The surprising drop in money supply put M-1 near the lower end of the Fed's long- term growth targets for the year, which call for an increase of 4 to 8 percent. Since the start of the year, M-1 has grown at a 4.8 percent annual rate, putting it $3.7 billion above the 4 percent level. Increase Was Forecast Analysts had expected M-1, which consists of currency and all kinds of checking accounts, to increase $800 million to $1 billion. The decline helped sustain a rally touched off earlier, when the Fed chose not to support the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market by draining reserves from the banking system. Traders were also encouraged by the news that Nigeria had cut its oil prices in response to reductions announced earlier this week by Britain and Norway. As a result of these factors, ''there has been a shift in the attitude of investors,'' said Maria Fiorini Ramirez, a money market economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert. ''They are now thinking that we are in a low inflationary atmosphere, that the pressure on prices will be on the downside rather than the upside, and that the next move by the Fed will be one of accommodation rather than firming,'' she said. After closing at around 10 1/8 percent on Wednesday, Fed funds opened the day below 10 percent. ''The Fed could have done something to keep the funds rate from falling,'' said Philip Braverman, chief economist at Briggs Schaedle & Company. ''The fact that they didn't do that today, at the beginning of a statement week, is saying to a lot of people that they don't want it higher.'' Fed funds firmed somewhat after falling to as low as 9 1/2 percent and ended the day at 9 3/4 to 10 percent. If anything, the falling oil prices may have been even more encouraging to market participants. ''The drop in oil prices has resurrected the deflation argument, which had sort of died away,'' Mr. Braverman said. ''Whenever that word crops up, people get very enthused about these kinds of bond yields.'' Yesterday's gains were recorded throughout the maturity spectrum, but particularly in the long-term end. Traders said that foreign investors, mainly Japanese, were among the most enthusiastic buyers of long- term Government securities. As a result of the heightened demand, the Government's bellwether 30-year bond, the 12 1/2's of 2014, rose nearly 2 points yesterday, or almost $20 for each $1,000 face value, to 105 20/32, to yield 11.80 percent. Short-Term Rates Off SharplyMeanwhile, the Treasury's 20-year, 13 3/4 percent bond rose about a point and a half, to 113 27/32, to yield 11.90 percent. And short-term interest rates fell sharply. The Treasury's six- month bills finished the day at 9.67 percent bid, down 24 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. If there was any disquieting news in yesterday's report from the Fed, analysts said it was that borrowings by member banks from the Fed's discount window rose $175 million from a week earlier, to $916 million. ''Generally speaking, people were expecting borrowings to go down, to below $750 million, not up,'' Mrs. Ramirez said. In addition to the Fed's report, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said yesterday that commercial and industrial loans at major New York City banks rose $194 million in the week ended Oct. 10, compared with a gain of $744 million a week earlier. The further softening in interest rates lends credence to the view that reductions in rates such as the prime are likely to be forthcoming soon. However, analysts cautioned against expecting too much of a drop. ''Rates won't drop any more than 100 basis points from where they are now,'' said Bernard M. Markstein 3d, senior financial economist at Chase Econometrics. ''The economy seems to be slowing down, but it still remains strong, and further down the road these lower rates will restimulate it again.'' An indication of how the pace of the current expansion has slowed comes today, when the Commerce Department is scheduled to release its report on ''real'' economic growth in the third quarter. The Government's ''flash'' estimate, released last month, showed that growth had slowed to an inflation-adjusted 3.6 percent. Such analysts as Mr. Markstein suggest that figure may be too low, and say that upward revisions in inventory and construction spending as well as an improvement in foreign trade could push the figure to 4 percent.
