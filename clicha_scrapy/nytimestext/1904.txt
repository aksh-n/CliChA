In your editorial on "Negroes and the Pullman Cars," in your issue of the 12th inst., despite your apparent fairness, I fear that you do not quite understand the situation in regard to the abominable "Jim Crow car" system and its attendant circumstances.

America is the greatest consumer of shoddy in the world, and in spite of our vaunted prosperity and high wages, the workingmen of America are wearing the world's old clothes.

With a gold standard Democrat in the field, upon a gold standard platform, made by himself and accepted in a resolution adopted by the convention, sound money Democrats have at last a welcome opportunity to vote for a Presidential candidate of their own party.

330-> THE FINANCIAL MARKETS; Resume of the Business of the Year's Best Week. Substantially Universal Improvement Among Both Stocks and Bonds -- Particulars Regarding the Advance.

--------
331-> M. COMBES AND THE CARTHUSIANS.
The use of inkstands as projectiles in a French deliberative body indicates not only an excitable temperament, "the blind hysterics of the Celt," as Lord TENNYSON amiably put it. It denotes also an exciting theme of discussion. And upon this latter point the cable leaves us in the dark.

There was a rumor current yesterday that the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad had put back the trains about which the commuters have been making such a fuss, but the rumor was not based upon fact.

346-> THE FINANCIAL SITUATION
Wall Street has changed its year but not its market.

--------
359-> A NOVEL RUSSIAN.
It is by "the stairway of surprise," to borrow a phrase of EMERSON, that the foreign student of Russian affairs arrives at a conception of the real condition of that puzzling country. No contrast could be more striking than that between the late Russian Minister of the Interior, as he was known to the world, and his successor, Prince SVIATOPOLK-MIRSKY, as he presents himself in his recent public utterances.

--------
361-> THE FINANCIAL MARKETS; Stocks Irregular; Call Money 1 3-4 @2 Nominal. A Characteristic Saturday Market -- The Traction Group Weak -- An Indifferent Bank Statement.
Yesterday's stock market was of the sort with which this season's Saturdays have familiarized Wall Street's habitues. In part it was a reflection of disagreeable anticipations of Monday's bringing the Northern Securities decision.

--------
364-> MILITARY RULE IN COLORADO.
The appeal of the union miners of Teller and San Miguel Counties in Colorado to the President of the United States to order an investigation of the way in which the power of the military arm of the State Government is being used to break up labor organizations is perfectly natural and apparently entirely proper.

Bernard Schuelbach, two years old, who lives with his father and mother at 608 East Fifth Street, had a piece of custard pie for his breakfast yesterday morning, and he washed it down with milk.

367-> HOMES FOR THE COMPETENT.; Suggestion That Aid Be Given to Other Than Human Failures.
Why does not some broad-minded philanthropist call into life a home for the very best class of working people?

Cooper, thirty-eight years old of 954 Lorimer Street, Brooklyn, was arrested by detectives from the Adams Street Police Station, that borough, last night. 
--------
371-> WAR ON CHEAPNESS.
If the workmen of the country can be persuaded to take Mr. SHAW'S assumption as true they may possibly find his conclusion true also. The assumption of the Secretary of the Treasury is that when the Republican Party in power "universal and constant employment at reasonable wages" is secure. 
--------
372-> THE GERMAN EMPRESS.
The kindly feeling with which the German Empress is regarded by the German people needs no other explanation than that she is a good woman, unspoiled of fortune.

--------
374-> FORESEES A YELLOW PERIL.; Present Conflict Might Lead China Against the Anglo-Saxon.
Flushed with preliminary victories, Japan's statesmen are doubtless dreaming of a great Mongolian empire in the Far East; but Russia's enormous reserve strength, which her diminutive but plucky antagonist cannot match, must win in the end, even if by the "attrition" tactics, so much relied upon by Gen. Grant in the American civil war.

376-> THE NEW JERSEY R.R. SUBWAY.
The proposal of the New York and New Jersey Railroad Company to build a deep tunnel to connect Sixth Avenue at Twenty-third Street with the tunnel under the Hudson River to New Jersey is one which, in its present shade, should receive consideration with every disposition on the part of the Rapid Transit Commission to make such consideration favorable.

NEWARK, N.J., July 16. -- Through the medium of interviews and announcements by his personal organ here, ex-United States Senator James Smith, Jr., is insisting that Judge Parker's sound-money dispatch to William F.

386-> A House in St. Petersburg; How an Upper Class Russian Furnishes His Home -- What He Eats, and How He Sleeps.
THE anteroom of a Russian house has an aspect altogether singular. The wraps hung on the racks, with their flabby sleeves and rigid folds, figure vaguely human bodies; the overshoes placed below simulate feet, and the effect of this furriery in the doubtful light of the small hanging lamp is fantastic enough, and reminds one of the wives of a Russian Bluebeard.

'he fashion of putting glass over canvases is one that has been severely criticised, and not without reason, but the present exhibition of the National Academy of Design at the Fine Arts Building, 215 West Fifty-seventh Street, indicates that there has been a losing fight, for never were there so many glazed pictures to be seen.

397-> FUTILITY OF STRIKES.; The Ultimate Loss Is to the Men Who Go Out.
Who benefits the most between the two, the labor organization or the workingman? This is an important question which to-day in the midst of our strike is being discussed.

400-> MAINE BIRDS.; WITH THE BIRDS IN MAINE. By Olive Thorne Miller. 16mo. Pp. 300. Boston and New York: Houghton, Mifflin & Co. $1.10 net.
This addition to the already long list of books which have served to endear the name of Mrs. Miller to all lovers of birds must strike any intelligent reader as being first a remarkable record of patient, although interesting, endeavor. The author may quote Emerson, but the fact remains that these observations of feathered friends (some of whom are to be seen all too seldom) were made by no "lubberly member of an awkward race."

PINEHURST, N.C., Dec. 31. -- Perfect weather, brilliant golf, and several surprises were the features of the first round of match play in the tournament here today, and, though the champion, W.J.

The stanchest fighters in the defense of freedom of commerce in England are the more intelligent of the labor leaders, and of these JOHN BURNS, the Member of Parliament, is the most active and efficient.

There was less news upon the Stock Exchange yesterday, and naturally there was also a contraction in the volume and range of business done. It cannot be said that there was a corresponding diminution in the interest felt Upon the contrary, the perception that the condition of the market is critical and dependent upon the market for staples in unusual degree enlists all the attention it should.

Five thousand pushcart peddlers held several meetings on the East Side yesterday and made as many protests against the latest orders of Street Cleaning Commissioner Woodbury that they must occupy stands under the Williamsburg Bridge.

--------
420-> "A LOT OF FOOLISH QUESTIONS."
Nothing in the remarkable proceedings of the convention at St. Louis was more remarkable than the plainness of speech with which BRYAN'S adherents, who had stood by him through deservedly evil report, told him that his factiousness had become mere self-seeking. Senator DANIAL washed his hands of his late leader, in the Committee on Resolutions, when BRYAN tried to inject his discredited heresies into the party platform.

Predictions made early in the year that during the first six months of 1904 stocks could be bought cheaper than at any time in 1903 were looked upon as pessimistic to an extreme, and since then the course of the market has been pointed to as disproving entirely the predictions that the low prices of 1904 would be below those of the previous year.

Really this is a charming book. It is a sort of Sentimental Journey tangled with a mellow Spanish Romance and cunningly interwoven with a thread of political satire. Regrettable and marring the whole are some clingings of the sort of stuff which used to be called "American" humor. But that is a detail. 
--------
439-> THE BANK STATEMENT.; High Record for Cash -- Decrease in Loans and Deposits.
Apparently the creation of new high records in the bank statement is coming to an end. Receipts of currency from the interior are falling off, and there is a prospect that more than the equivalent of the gold coming from Australia, Japan, and the Klondike will be sent to Europe and to Cuba.

441-> How Shakespeare Spells Ruin
IN a season of failures almost without example, no venture has failed more disastrously than the gorgeous spectacular production of "A Midsummer Night's Dream," with Nat Goodwin starred as Bottom. The old managerial saying that "Shakespeare" spells "ruin" was on the lips of the man in the street; and many remembered how Sir Henry Irving once remarked that Shakespeare had cost him a princely fortune. 
--------
442-> CURRENT COMMENT.; Views of Experts on Matters of Interest Relating to the World of Books.
HENRY HARLAND'S STYLE. -- Mr. Henry Harland has a style of his own, a style so individual, so peculiar, so characteristic, that it seems part and parcel of his own literary effectiveness. He has a style of his own -- and for the life of us, after we have read him, we cannot help reproducing some of its jingling effects.

Easter ducks and chickens, the genuine article, stuffed, can be had at reasonable prices -- 23 cents each, and some of them with an Easter greeting in the bill.

444-> METAL STAIRS AT STATIONS.
Your editorial in to-day's paper on the metal plates on the elevated railway stations in this city is correct enough so far as it goes, but it is, I think, liable to misconstruction. Those who are not familiar with the subject might draw the conclusion that the treads of the stairs were simply covered with sheets of steel. 
--------
445-> THE MERGER DECISION.
Until the Supreme Court has handed down its decision in the Northern Securities case, and it may be handed down to-day, the public will have no certain knowledge whether the decision of the Circuit Court declaring the so-called merger to be a violation of the anti-trust act will be sustained or reversed.

ONE paradox of the theatres somehow or other is always with us. Again and again the actor and manager will be heard to deplore the fact that in these days the personality of the player is of more importance to the public than his art, and many a well-seasoned character actor has been heard to declare that if he had been less versatile his chances for public favor would have been greater.

CHICAGO, Sept 17. -- A through passenger train on the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Road from Toledo to Chicago was wrecked this afternoon at the crossing of the tracks and Root Street.

450-> CAVALRY TACTICS.
The British Army is well known to be one of the most inertly conservative institutions this side of China, one of the most incapable of reform from within, and of the most obstinately obstructive of reform from without. The lessons taught by changes in the material and methods of war are more slowly accepted there than in the military service of any other civilized country.

WILLIAM H. TAFT, son of a Secretary of War and himself soon to be Secretary of War, for three years Judge of the Superior Court of Ohio, for eight years a United States Judge in the Sixth Circuit, and Civil Governor of the Philippine Islands for more than two years just past, would be beyond question the strongest candidate the Republican Party could put in nomination for the Presidency.

WEST POINT, Oct. 22. -- With the score tied at 6 to 6 and only seven minutes left to play, a sensational run of 105 yards by Torney, the Army full back, ending in a touch-down, enabled West Point to defeat Yale to-day for the first time in the history of the annual games between the two institutions, the final score being 11 to 6.

ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 26. -- The cause of the extreme deliberation in the Japanese advance on Mukden was explained by a dispatch received from Gen. Kuropatkin this afternoon, which indicates that Field Marshal Oyama has not yet concentrated his forces. Fresh troops are constantly arriving at Bentsiaputze, while others, which recently reached Liao-Yang, are marching up the Tai-Tse River to Sian-Chan, (about sixty miles southeast of Mukden.) These reinforcements presumably come from Japan.

461-> WEIGHING MACHINE'S SEASONS.
COLD weather is hard on outdoor weighing machines. Their internal mechanism is probably in just as good running order as in seasons of higher temperature, but they are badly off in a financial way. Few people contribute to their support. High winds and a bleak sky are not conducive to experiments in avoirdupois, and most people are too anxious to get in out of the cold to stop to bother about their weight.

--------
480-> A SHRINKING VIOLET.
WHOEVER before heard of an actor who refused to get into the limelight of publicity? Julian Mitchell says he has discovered him, in Stephen Maley, who plays the high-voiced old villain, Sir Wiley Gile, in "The Wizard of Oz." But Mr. Maley's aversion to the centre of the stage is not the result of mere modesty, as one might suppose; it is based on scientific deductions. 
--------
481-> THE GRAND REPUBLIC.; Life Preservers Out of Reach of the Passengers.
The terrible catastrophe in the East River which cost this community so many innocent lives, and which costs nothing to the Knickerbocker Steamboat Company for they are fully insured, will probably cause a better inspection of the various excursion steamers which leave daily for the different Summer resorts, carrying often several thousand human beings and giving to passengrs not even sufficient room to reach the ice water if a drink is wanted. 
--------
482-> MYSTERIOUS INVALID HERE.; J.P. Morgan Said to be Interested in Case of Gardner, Who Arrived on Liner.

491-> BOSTON NOTES.; Lilian Bell's New Story; John Boyle O'Reilly's Poems; S e Fall Books; and Books for Girls.
THE spirited and voluble American girl who, in Miss Lilian Bell's "Abroad With the 'Jimmies,'" reduced the haughty foreigner to meek submission, appears in "At Home With the Jardines," the author's coming book, so agreeably transformed by marriage, so gently adoring her clever husband, as to seem unnatural, until it becomes apparent that she retains sufficient wickedness to devise a scheme whereby janitor and house agent are brought to the feet of the tenant. 
--------
492-> THE BANK STATEMENT.; New High Records Again in Loans, Cash, and Deposits.
The bank statement again made new high records in loans, cash, and deposits. The average system covered up completely the week's gold exports. Evidently the preceding statement did not disclose the entire gains in cash for the week ending April 23, and the rising averages for the early part of last week offset the loss of gold in the latter part of the week.

GALES FERRY, Conn., June 24. -- All the orsmen at Red Top spent a quiet day today partly on account' of 'the rough water -this morning and because it is believed, by Coach' Colson that the men have been worked pretty hard of late.

A COLLECTION of letters written by Robert Browning to Alfred Domett, between the years 1840 and 1877, are offered for sale, and, so far as I know, not a single person has mentioned the fact that Mr. Domett was the "Waring" of Brownings poem beginning:

--------
499-> FOUGHT IN THE RED ROOM.; Waldorf-Astoria Traditions Shattered by Row Over a Shirt.
Hallboys and attaches of the Waldorf-Astoria tiptoed softly and with bowed heads yesterday as they passed the historic Red Room, for, regardless of the traditions of the house, two persons had been so rash as to desecrate the sacred precincts by engaging in a fist fight within its confines.

BELVIDERE, N.J., Jan. 19. -- There is a rumor that the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad Company contemplates some important changes in the running of its freight trains.

Still another record for auto boat speed in America was made yesterday when the Standard, in the second 32-mile race for the Challenge Cup, offered by the American Power Boat Association, covered the course on the Hudson River at an average of 20.53 nautical miles an hour. This is equivalent to 23.61 statute miles, and the Standard's average for the entire distance was 2 minutes 55 seconds per nautical mile. 
--------
507-> Vertical Titles.
A correspondent of The Engineering News in a recent issue of that journal discussed the question of the vertical printing of titles on the backs of thin books and pamphlets, advocating the printing of such titles from the bottom of the volume upward. In the comment by the editor of The Engineering News he seemed to agree with his correspondent, and I differ from them most emphatically.

TUXEDO PARK, N.Y., Sept. 17. -- The delightful Autumn days in the Ramapo Valley are now at hand and a large crowd of well-known society folk are gathering in the colony.

Clark, the all-round athletic champion of America, made the announcement that he has decided to throw aside his work this Spring and give his attention to coaching the Harvard team.

CHICAGO, Sept. 4. -- Chicago defeated St. Louis to-day in a free hitting and loose fielding game by bunching hits and superior base running. Barry and Chance led in the batting and Evers and Tinker in the fielding. The score: 
--------
516-> THE PAVING OF A STREET.
Any decision respecting the repaving of Park Row is likely to lead to much contention. This is no less true in view of the fact that it is so effectually covered with car tracks that it really makes very little difference how it is paved. Borough President AHEARN, however, seems to take the matter quite seriously. 
--------
517-> RACING TO HEAD RUSSIANS OFF.; Japanese Converging from East and West -- Reports from Kuropatkin.

It was in the height of the hot season that the British steamer Glenogle set sail from Singapore bound for Shanghai with a load of returning coolies. 
--------
524-> ITALIANS AND THE LAW.
It would be interesting to know what has become of the movement started a few weeks ago looking to the co-operation of law-abiding citizens of Italian birth with the civil authorities in the detection and suppression of crime in our Italian colonies. When the plan was proposed a number of leading Italian citizens were enthusiastic in its support.

--------
536-> FRENCH NOVELS.; A Glance at Seven of Them Recently Published.*
FOR the last ten years the novel in France has been almost purely social -- studies of classes, developments, or states of society rather than narrations of passion or adventure. And quite of late, under the influence of M. Anatole France, the novel, in the hands of the younger men, has become philosophical, fantastic, and crudite. 
--------
537-> COCKRAN SPEECH IGNORED.; Report That Congressman Has Protested to Democratic Committee.
WASHINGTON, June 8. -- Friends of Bourke Cockran have to-day made use of his presence in Washington to give currency to a report that he came here to protest to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee against the decisions of the committee not to circulate his famous speech in the last days of the recent session as a campaign document.

CHE-FOO, June 12. -- I have just returned from Niu-Chwang, where the Japanese have established a strict blockade. I was stopped twice and searched. 
--------
545-> ALDERMEN AND LABOR LEADERS.
The essential viciousness of deciding great questions of public policy with reference to the wishes and at the dictation of the trades union leaders is seen in the threat to tie up work on the Pennsylvania and New York Central terminal improvements because the contractors are reluctant to pay more money for a shorter day's work than is necessary or desirable in existing circumstances.

--------
548-> Doctors and Dueling.
The congress of doctors at Oxford were provided with a thoroughly interesting and novel entertainment in the gardens of Wadham College yesterday afternoon, where the ceaseless energy of Mr. Doyne, the famous oculist, had provided a fencing match between Oxford and Cambridge veterans, with the object of demonstrating the speed of the human retina in moments of peril, and the number of fatal wounds a man might receive before he succumbed. 
--------
549-> BLUECOAT STOPS RUNAWAYS.; Fash Cheered by Rockaway Crowd -- Act Saves Two.
Endangering his own life, Policeman Arthur F. Fash yesterday afternoon threw himself before a team of runaway horses drawing a wagonette in the Boulevard, Mehrten's place at Rockaway Beach, L.I., and, though knocked down and dragged over a block, stopped the animals.

554-> THE FINANCIAL MARKETS; Stocks Irregular; Call Money Easy, 1@1 1-4. The Passing of Wabash A Interest Fails to Unsettle the Rest of the List.
The market yesterday had an opportunity to show what stability there was to the recent era of good feeling, and it must be said that the test was passed in a gratifying manner. The Wabash is not a system to whose finances the market can be indifferent, as it has been to the passing of the dividends of minor properties. 
--------
555-> HURST PARK WON EASILY; The Successful Favorite of the Day Made All the Pace.
Just as a change from the monotony of having all the favorites win, results went very near the other extreme at the Gravesend race course yesterday, and favorites were beaten with such regularity and precision that until Hurst Park galloped home for the last event of the day the followers of public form were in a state closely akin to panic. 
--------
556-> TRADE UNION BANKING.
The first Union Labor Bank has been incorporated as an Illinois State institution, and will establish itself in Chicago. It begins business with a capital of $200,000. What should be the characteristics of a Union Labor Bank different from any other bank is left to the imagination, but probably the incorporators have new views on this subject, and will proceed to carry them into application. 
--------
557-> RUSSIAN ENTHUSIASM GROWS.; Daily Patriotic Demonstrations by Enormous Crowds -- Czar and Czarina Respond to Cheers.
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 13. -- For the first time since the beginning of hostilities in the Far East the Government to-night gave the Russian newspapers permission to publish the accounts received from abroad of the naval engagement off Che-mul-pho, in which the warships Variag and Korietz were destroyed.

--------
561-> ONE VIEW OF EDUCATION.; Demand for More Common Schools Where the Masses May Be Taught.
In a Government like ours it is absolutely necessary to its permanency that there should be some intelligence among the voters. With the exception of "criminals and women" -- ominous conjunctions -- every one has a voice in the Government, and if it were possible at this late day to do so, the ability to read and write the English language should be the only qualification. 
--------
562-> TOPICS OF THE TIMES.
-- According to the audacious reporter who describes football games for The Woodstock (N.H.) Age, a team from White River Junction went to Woodstock on Saturday and "liaoyanged the locals." The reader who has called our affrighted attention to this strange consequence of the tragic conflict in the Far East only says of it that "war may impoverish a nation, but it enriches our vocabulary." 
--------
563-> Francis of Assisi's Writings.
Mr. Montgomery Carmichael, the British Vice Consul of West Tuscany, author of several books, the last of which was a fictitious life of William Walshe, published in 1902, has acquired the rights to publish the English translation of the first critical edition of the writings of Saint Francis of Assisi. 
--------
564-> WALL STREET TOPICS.
Net losses were general in yesterday's stock market. In most instances the losses were not of great importance, but the disposition of the market to sell off as soon as the advance had gained even modest proportions was once more exemplified and resulted in many adopting the opinion that nothing good could be expected of the market as long as it remains as professional as it is at present. 
--------
565-> ARCHITECTS' FEES IN THE SENATE.
The debate in the Senate on the purchase of a site for a building to house the Departments of State, Justice, and Commerce showed one thing: an amazing ignorance on the part of distinguished Senators of the necessity of paying architects of repute as much as they earn when designing and superintending the erection of great buildings for private corporations. 
--------
566-> THE ANTI-SOCIAL SPIRIT.
Writing to Secretary HAY from Bogota on April 5, 1903, Minister BEAUPRE said: 
--------
567-> TIMID AND SENSIBLE CONGRESSMEN
When Mr. ROOSEVELT was the President of the Civil Service Commission he discovered that there was one provision of the civil service law that had not fully been appreciated and had hardly at all been enforced. It was the section that requires that, as nearly as practicable, appointments in the departments at Washington shall be made from the several States in the ratio of their population. 
--------
568-> U.S. MINISTER TO KOREA; Dr. H.N. Allen's Long Residence in "Hermit Kingdom." Saves Life of King's Nephew and Assists in Sending First Korean Representation to Washington.

He said he had been clubbed by Detective Germershausen of the Bedford Avenue Station early Sunday morning without the slightest provocation. 
--------
571-> THE PANAMA EXPOSE.; Suspicions Justified by the Publication of the Roosevelt Letter.
Senator D.B. Culberson's expose of President Roosevelt's foreknowledge of the projected Panama revolution and sympathy with it merely serves to prove what has been more than suspected by well-informed Spanish-Americans and those Americans who have paid any attention whatever to the whole process of calling into being a new Republic more pliant than the original owner of the coveted rights and land. 
--------
572-> Charles Reade.
" Charles Reade as I Knew Him,'' by John Coleman, announced some time ago, is finally to be published by E.P. Dutton Co. next week. The delay of its appearance might form an interesting commentary on international copyright and customs exigencies. The book contains recollections told by the novelist to Mr. Coleman, which the latter has recounted, as far as possible, in the exact words of his friend. 
--------
573-> RECEIVER'S COUNSEL DEFENDS WOODEND; Mr. Lenney Says Fugitive Is Not So Bad as He Is Painted. HIS LAWYER LEAVES TOWN Sudden Call for Mr. Warner -- Mr. Marsh to Make Further Inquiry Into Mortgages on Fugitive's Property.

--------
576-> A PASTELLIST OF NOTE.; Works in Pastel, Oils, and Water Colors by the Late J. Wells Champney.
As a medium for the expression of thoughts or emotion in art pastel has never reached in this country the point when an independent society could devote itself to its cultivation. The temporary triumphs of the Painters in Pastel were confined to so small a circle of admirers that the brief, sweet life of that infant art organization cannot be taken seriously. 
--------
577-> RUSSIANS MARCH TO SEOUL.; It Is Thought the Japanese Railway Was Unable, Not Unwilling, to Transport Them.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 7. -- United States Minister Allen at Soul has cabled to the State Department under to-day's date that the Russian marines who were landed at Che-mul-pho, and to whom transportation to Soul over the Japanese railway was refused, have reached the capital, marching overland.

578-> PENNSYLVANIA CO.'S LOAN; Bond Issue of $50,000,000 Arouses Interest in Wall Street. Rumors of a Settlement of Trouble with Gould Lines -- May Acquire the Western Maryland.
Announcement was made yesterday that the Pennsylvania Company had arranged a loan of $50,000,000 for purposes which were only partially revealed.

TOKIO, March 19. -- The British Minister refuses to indorse the application of H.

--------
592-> COMMENCEMENT WARNINGS.
It is refreshing to read the address of President WILSON of Princeton to the seniors of that conservative and highly intelligent university. Baccalaureate sermons are not sources of undiluted delight as a rule to men of experience, who hear or read them with an uneasy comparison of their teachings and those which mature life has brought. 
--------
593-> CHINESE COURT MAY FLEE.; May Go to Sian-Foo in the Event of War -- Viceroy Yuan Urges Alliance with Japan.
LONDON, Feb. 6. -- In the event of war, says the Peking correspondent of The Times, the attitude of the Chinese Court is problematicI. Its flight to Sian-Foo for the second time is possible.

594-> CAUSE OF EMPTY CHURCHES.; Ascribed to "Cold, Formal, Artificial Service the Clergy Permit."
That the attendance upon church service is decreasing there is no doubt. We are therefore ask the question: Is it entirely the fault of the people, or are the clergy also responsible?

ALBANY, March 9. -- Ex-Senator John Ford to-day submitted to the Assembly Railroads Committee a bill which is a consolidation of the Elsberg Rapid Transit bill and the bills which the Rapid Transit Commission asked Senator White to introduce. 
--------
596-> EUROPEAN BANK STATEMENTS.; What Can Be Read Between Their Lines -- Significant Changes at a Critical Time.
Under ordinary conditions the weekly statements of the great European banks are of comparatively little general interest in this market. This week, however, the completion of the settlement in Paris which had been looked forward to and dreaded ever since the bad break on the Bourse a week ago, awakened considerable interest in the changes reported by the Banque de France. 
--------
597-> Review 6 -- No Title
Probably we are all egotists at heart. "Well, they know what I think about it anyway" carries a freight of satisfaction and relief, as when "Taxpayer" airs his opinion in a letter to the press. To a student of human nature it is curious to find how largely the average opinion expresses the speaker more than the subject of which he would speak. 
--------
598-> CORTELYOU MEETS PERKINS.; In Philadelphia, Safe from Prying Eyes, to Consider Ways and Means.
PHILADELPHIA, July 21. -- When George B. Cortelyou, Chairman of the Republican National Committee, came to Philadelphia from Washington yesterday much speculation was set afloat as to the object of his visit. Before he returned to Washington in the evening Mr. Cortelyou said to the reporters that he had come to Philadelphia to meet a New York friend on personal business. 
--------
599-> ASIA, THE MOTHER OF IDEAS.; Kakasu Okakura's Book on the Art of His Native Land and the Ideals of the East.*
MR. OKAKURA made so pleasing an impression when he came to New York eighteen years ago with the Art Commission from Japan that it scarcely needed the general interest roused by the war with Russia to give a fillip to memory and recall a Japanese of a type never met before outside the bounds of Nippon. 
--------
600-> "The Trail of Lewis and Clark."
The new book on Lewis and Clark, "The Trail of Lewis and Clark," by Olin D. Wheeler, has been postponed for publication by G.P. Putnam's Sons for a fortnight or so.

601-> TURF STARS FARE BADLY; Notable Horses Shelved by the Accidents of the Campaign. BIG EVENTS OF THE WEEK Delhi to Have His Next Trial in the $15,000 Saratoga Derby -- Champions May Meet for Cup.
With the decision of the $50,000 Great Republic Stakes at Saratoga on Saturday, racing affairs for the horses of the handicap division reached a stage that, to the last degree, is perplexing. The victory of Delhi was positive enough to satisfy even the most doubtful that the colt is something more than simply a fast three-year-old, but how much more it remains for time to decide. Regarded from the Standpoint of the handicapper. 
--------
602-> REUNITED AFTER 39 YEARS.; Old Ship Draughtsman, Now Eighty-one, Finds Daughter.
As if risen from the dead, George W. Friend, eighty-one years old, but hale and hearty, returned yesterday to his old haunts in Brooklyn, from which he disappeared thirty-nine years ago. Few of the friends that used to know him at that time, when he was living at India and Franklin Streets, are alive to-day, and of his family only one daughter, Mrs. James Lockwood of 676 McDonough Street, is still living. 
--------
603-> A Romance of the Soudan.; THE EFFENDI.
Many and varied are the scenes in Florence Brooks Whitehouse's romance. "The Effendi." Opening with the death of Gordon at Khartoum, the story leads to England's tardy homage to her hero. So much for the historical setting; the romance proper is as exciting as the most exacting dare wish for. 
--------
604-> FLOOD MAROONS METHODISTS.; Boats Took Food to 400 Passengers in Kansas -- Death from Exposure.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., May 31. -- Three through trains marooned near Quenemo, Kan., on account of the flood which had washed out portions of the Santa Fe and Missouri Pacific tracks, reached here today. A majority of the passengers were east-bound, many of them coming from the Methodist General Conference at Los Angeles and others from El Paso. 
--------
605-> OUR TASK AT MOROCCO.
It is a curious coincidence that in the opening of the twentieth century the United States should be called on to do police duty on the shores of the Mediterranean and to protect its citizens against the violence of descendants of the North African pirates whom it punished in the early years of the nineteenth century. 
--------
606-> FACILIS DESCENCIS.
Expanses of snow of the smoothness of glass and firmness of marble, sloping away from a Massachusetts Normal College populous with female pupils, were sure to form the arena of a sudden and irresistible outburst of tobogganning. That is what befel at Westfield, a town of the ancient and famous Commonwealth, the other day, bringing about consequences which the young lady participants in the sport could hardly have foreboded. 
--------
607-> The Care of Infants.; THE MOTHER'S MANUAL. A Month by Month Guide for Young Mother.
Dr. Coolidge's book provides directions for most infantile contingencies from the moment of birth to the seventh year of the child's life. For the first year these directions are given month by month -- that is, the mother may learn from the "manual" how to adapt her care to the swiftly changing conditions of extreme youth. 
--------
608-> FIELDS AN INGENIOUS SWINDLER, POLICE SAY; Many Cleverly Executed Forgeries Laid at His Door. SMALL DEALERS THE VICTIMS All Forger Needed Was a Business Letter Head and a Small Check for Returned Goods.
The police say that William J. Fields, who was arraigned for forgery in the Tombs Police Court yesterday, may have defrauded shopmen and small merchants out of several thousand dollars in a rather extraordinary way which he had of forging checks. Fields was arrested on Thursday evening "on speculation" at Wall and William Streets by Detective Pepperted of Inspector McClusky's staff. 
--------
609-> FREDERICK THE GREAT.; Mr. W.F. Reddaway Discusses the Character and Influence of Prussia's Greatest Monarch.*
THOMAS CARLYLE was fully cognizant of the difficulties of his topic when he wrote concerning Frederick the Great that he was "a man politely impregnable to the intrusion of human curiosity." Mr. W.F. Reddaway, the Cambridge lecturer in history, acknowledges the many difficulties, for he writes that even to his intimates "Frederick remained an enigma all his life." 
--------
610-> HERE'S ALL ABOUT MINTON; EVER HEAR OF HIM BEFORE?; Did You Know That He Nominated Parker for President?
Now that the Democrats of the Nation in convention assembled have declared for Chief Judge Alton B. Parker of New York State as their choice for the Presidency, there will be brought into the limelight a new President maker. 
--------
611-> JUDGE PARKER PITCHES HAY FOR TWO HOURS; Gives Two Farmhands Holiday, Helps Out Himself. WORKS UNDER BROILING SUN Then He Entertains Friends Indoors, Rides Horseback, and Shows Politics Questioners His Polled Gown.
ESOPUS, N.Y., July 4. -- Judge Alton B. Parker, with the date of the nomination by the Democrats of their choice for President of the United States less than a week away, spent two hours to-day in the fields with his men, pitching hay. 
--------
612-> THE AJAX OF SOPHOCLES; Performed by Members of East Side Greek Colony. A BOOKKEEPER AS AJAX Incorrect in Many Details, but Simple, Sincere, and Convincing.
Those wise people who did not expect much of the production of the "Ajax" of Sophocles last night (at Clinton Hall, Clinton Street, near Grand, on the lower east side) were rewarded by being pleasantly disappointed. With an Attic tragedy in a modern scenic production and a band of New York Greeks speaking Sophoclean numbers and dancing through pagan choruses there was sure to be many discrepancies. 
--------
613-> THE PHOENICIA NEARING PORT.; Liner Which Was Said to be Drifting Passes the Lizard.
PLYMOUTH, England, Aug. 31. -- The Hamburg-American liner Phoenicia, which left New York on Aug. 20 for Hamburg, and which was reported by the North German Lloyd liner Kronprinz Wilhelm, at Bremen yesterday, to have been sighted on Aug. 27 apparently drifting, passed the Lizard at 7 A.M. to-day. 
--------
614-> CAPITALISTS WON HIS MONEY.; So New York Lawyer, Victim of Dice Manipulators, Ordered Their Arrest.
CLAYTON, N.Y., July 20. -- Warrants of arrests for three guests at the Thousand Island House, Alexandria Bay, were sworn out last evening by Aaron C. Shapiro, a New York attorney with offices on Broadway, who claimed that they had fleeced him out of $400 at cards and dice. 
--------
615-> TURKEY WORRIED ABOUT CRETE; Hears Another Attempt Is to be Made to Secure Annexation to Greece.
PARIS, Aug. 31. -- The departure of Prince George of Greece from Crete, of which island he is Governor, on a mission which is said to be with the object of inducing the powers to consent to the annexation of Crete to Greece, has aroused Turkey to energetic diplomatic action. 
--------
616-> Buffalo Bill.; THE ADVENTURS OF BUFFALO BILL.
How Buffalo Bill killed his first Indian, and how he did several other things are told here in Col. Cody's own words. He was trailing along at the rear of a party of cattlemen who were running away from a superior force when he shot one of the pursuing braves. 
--------
617-> The Fourth Dimension.; THE FOURTH DIMENSION.
The presentation of the "higher dimensionality of space" to non-mathematical readers in untechnical language is a task that might well cause dismay to the bravest. Mr. Hinton has gone at it courageously, and with no little skill and ingenuity. The subject is certainly one of the most abstruse, intertwined with metaphysical conceptions, and requiring a constructive mathematical imagination that can scarcely me imparted to those untaught in mathematical conceptions. 
--------
618-> SECRETARY LOOMIS'S THEORY.; He Believes His Brother Accidentally Fell Overboard.
WASHINGTON, July 16. -- Assistant Secretary of State Frank B. Loomis accepts the identification of his brother's body found near Plymouth, England, as authentic. He has, however, received no more news than that contained in the press dispatches that came during the day. 
--------
619-> TOPICS OF THE TIMES.
-- In all the interviews with high, but still subordinate, railway officials that are now appearing, there are evidences of resentment that the public and the public's spokesmen, the newspapers, should so often have ascribed to incompetence or indifference delays and interruptions in the service of the roads that really were due to other and very different causes, familiar only to the servants of the companies. 
--------
620-> JOHNSON KILLING DELIBERATE.; Minister Powell Reports That Insurgents' Act Was Unprovoked -- Damage to American Property.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 13. -- The State Department has received a report by mail under date of San Domingo, Feb. 2, from United States Minister Powell, of the killing by insurgents of J.G. Johnson, the second-class machinist of the American cruiser Yankee, on the morning of that date. 
--------
621-> MUSIC IN COLLEGES.
Prof. MACDOWELL'S resignation of his chair at Columbia upon the ground that it had not attained the results he expected from it was calculated in any case to attract attention. It attracted more because it was accompanied by an indictment, if not of Columbia in particular, yet of Columbia in company with other American institutions of learning, as lacking in "idealism." 
--------
622-> BOARD OF EDUCATION ECONOMY.
The Board of Apportionment last Autumn granted to the Educational Department $500,000 more for 1904 than was spent by that department in 1903. This interesting fact appears to be entirely ignored in the clamor intended to compel the city to increase the school allowance.

623-> "Physiological Economy in Nutrition."
The F.A. Stokes Company will publish in October a book by Prof. Russell H. Chittenden on "Physiological Economy in Nutrition." 
--------
624-> WOULD WASH CITY STREETS.; Proposal to Heat Hydrant Water in Order to Remove Snow.
The recommendation of Mayor McClellan in regard to the use of river water for fires in New York should receive prompt attention. This is a plan the has been often suggested and its development would not only provide the city with an abundant supply of water for fire purposes, but, which is almost as important, would provide a vastly improved method of street cleaning, at little comparative cost. 
--------
625-> RUSSIA AND JAPAN -- A PARALLEL.
There is a curious parallel in the recent history of the two Powers locked in what for one at least is accepted as a life-and-death grapple in the Far East. Each has been impelled toward foreign war by the expansion of its population, the need of new fields of activity, and secular tradition as to adjacent territory, and they have now met in pursuance of forces which each deems irresistible.

NAPLES, Sept. 23. -- Frank R. Shattuck, the Philadelphia lawyer, who was shot on board the liner Prinz Oskar by an insane passenger, proceeded to-day to Genoa on that vessel. The bullet, which hit his left, shoulder, is imbedded in the muscles of Mr. Shattuck's back.

627-> TOPICS IN WALL STREET.; Sharp Recovery in Union Pacific -- Many Traders Work on Bull Side Again.

--------
628-> BRANCH SAVINGS BANKS.; Proposed Plan to Solve Problem for Small Communities.
ALBANY, Oct. 23. -- In financial circles there has been talk for some time of securing legislation which will make it easier to extend the operations of savings banks. Small communities have been debarred the privilege of having such institutions by the necessary law for the protection of depositors. Thus to organize a savings bank requires that the organizers shall file a bond sufficient to protect the depositors during the formative period.

LONDON, Feb. 18. -- Dispatches published in London newspapers this morning continue to give descriptions of the embarking of Japanese troops.

--------
632-> GOV. ODELL CONFIDENT OF POWER TO CONTROL; May Allow Early Adjournment of the Legislature. EXPECTS STATE CHAIRMANSHIP Local Leaders Busy Preparing Slate of National Delegates for His Approval.
ALBANY, N.Y., March 14. -- Gov. Odell is not worrying over the prospect of Senator Platt putting up a fight to recover his lost laurels. In fact, so sure are the Governor and his friends that they now have a hold on the organization which cannot be shaken that there is talk of an adjournment of the Legislature early in April.

637-> AMERICA'S PORCELAIN.; Output Will Soon Equal Entire Demand of the People.
Your recent interview with Mr. William Carr regarding the making of porcelain equal to the French seems to be not complete without reference to the fact the there is now made in a number of potteries in this country a porcelain that is "hard" like the French and in use by nearly all the restaurants and hotels in this good land.

638-> COLUMBIA FOOTBALL.; Spring Practice To-day -- Good Material for Vacant Positions.
Columbia's football candidates will meet to-day for annual Spring practice. Capt. R.S. Stangland has requested all the men of last year's squad now in college to report for work, and several other good players who for various reasons were ineligible last year will also be out. Capt. Stangland and former Captain Richard S. Smith will speak to the candidates before practice begins.

639-> THE PANAMA PAYMENT.
So far as the effect of the payment for the Panama Canal upon business and financial interests is concerned, those most competent to judge are agreed that it will be very slight and easily met. It is true that it comes at a time when the rate of exchange favors gold exports, and these have attained an unusual level for the season.

LONDON, March 15. -- A correspondent of The Daily Mail at Niu-Chwang says that after the removal of the battleship Retvizan four Russian steamers, the Harbin, the Hailar, the Ninguta, and the Sungari, were anchored at the mouth of the entrance to Port Arthur in proper position and sunk, leaving only a small channel available, Vice Admiral Makaroff having previouly ordered the whole fleet to remain outside with steam up, economy in coal being unnecessary.

641-> GIANT POSTMAN ARRESTED.; Six-Foot-Four Carrier Confesses to Taking Money from Mail.
Martin N. Sullivan, who is known as "the giant of the letter carriers," and who stands 6 feet 4 inches in his stocking feet, is in trouble. He was arrested on Saturday night by Post Office Inspectors Jacobs and Meyer on a charge of abstracting money from the mails. The Inspectors say that they found on him marked bills sent in decoy letters. 
--------
642-> FRIARS IN THE PHILIPPINES.
Father CHIDWICK, some time Chaplain of the Maine, who in that capacity became known and liked by all his countrymen, has been delivering a lecture about the friars in the Philippines which seems to indicate that upon that subject his churchmanship has been getting the better of his patriotism.

Three liners, the Cedric, the Umbria, and the St. Paul, brought among their passengers yesterday a large delegation of distinguished Englishmen, who came to this country to participate in the American meeting of the Iron and Steel Institute, of which Andrew Carnegie is the first American President.

645-> MANHATTAN BRIDGE.
It is at last officially announced, in a communication from the Commissioner of Bridges to the Art Commission, that entirely new plans have been prepared for what is officially known by the meaningless name of the "Manhattan," but would have geographical and historical significance if it were known as the Wallabout, Bridge. 
--------
646-> Senator Tillman's Throat Better.
WASHINGTON, March 13. -- Senator Tillman, who for a week has had serious trouble with his throat, is reported to be very much improved to-night. The improvement is due to the relief experienced from the lancing of another abscess, which operation was performed to-day. 
--------
647-> Review 9 -- No Title
Your two correspondents, E.T.R. and G.C.D., have, between them, given me a great deal of pleasure in referring to Miss Daskam's "Baby," and incidentally to "Bruvver Jim's Baby," by Mr. Philip Mighels. Of the two authors, I should say the man has far the better grasp on that subject. His baby is normal: there are no pseudo-psychological gibes, no explanations of satire in his annals of a helpless little boy.

648-> "G.C." A LADY TERRAPIN; Louis the Chef Was Mistaken in Naming His Pet. Excitement in the Gregorian When Two Eggs Are Hatched by a Home Made Incubator.
Louis, the night chef in the Gregorian Hotel at 42 West Thirty-fifth Street, woke up the house at 4 o'clock yesterday morning by dancing around the kitchen and yelling like a South Sea Islander. The night clerk ran into the kitchen to see what had happened, and found Louis shouting and laughing and hugging himself and shaking hands in Chinese fashion.

The police reserves of three stations were called out yesterday afternoon to quell a riot among Italian and negro asphalt pavers, who were at work at Twenty-fifth Street and Tenth Avenue. The riot started from a small fight. The negroes comprised one side and the Italians the other.

653-> THE FINANCIAL MARKETS; The Year's Record Week in Volume and Buoyancy.
Last week's business was memorable. For a parallel to the trading in shares it is necessary to revert to the week preceding the Northern Pacific corner, when the total was 15,419,637, against 9,334,855 last week. Last week's business in bonds makes a better comparison, the values being $39,229,500 last week, against $40,830,500 for the week of May 4, 1901.

--------
656-> AN "IMPUDENT ASSERTION."
Mr. CLEVELAND'S letter to the Tammany Committee is by no means the stereotyped and perfunctory sort of utterance which we have grown accustomed to looking for from public men on such occasions. The yearning for a reversion to the days of "plain living and high thinking" from these days of high living and plain thinking is doubtless a counsel of perfection. 
--------
657-> SUBMARINES IN THE WAR.
There are many indications that Japan and Russia will use submarine torpedo boats as freely as the limitations of these craft will permit. One was recently shipped from this port aboard a tramp steamer, which cleared for Cork, Ireland, but which was subsequently sighted steering for Gibraltar. 
--------
658-> GRASS AND ITS SIDE DISH.
Nothing develops a more pronounced type of "crank" than a dietary fad. In itself harmless and wholly inoffensive when practiced in the seclusion of one's own home, which others will be careful to avoid, it attains the proportions of a public nuisance the moment the faddist discovers that his mission in life is to convert others to his way of thinking.

659-> GAS OVERCOMES FIREMEN.; Many Rescues During Fight with West Side Tenement Fire.
Two firemen were overcome by gas and two more slightly burned in a fire to which they were called early yesterday morning at 803 Ninth Avenue. The house was the home of about twenty families. Smoke from the blaze, which started in the cellar, poured through the house and made egress difficult for the residents. Many had to be carried out by firemen and policemen.

According to Prof. William H. Burr, one of the experts employed by the city to devise a plan for averting a water famine in the near future, Gov. Odell's approval of the Smith Dutchess County Water or so-called "Ramapo bill" has set back the City of New York three whole years in its struggle for an adequate water supply, unless something should happen to cause the repeal of the new law.

Although many of the big men of Tammany and many of the rank and file were at St. Louis yesterday, Tammany's celebration of the Fourth was not perceptibly marked by lack of enthusiasm. There was the usual flow of oratory, and the big talks and the short talks alike drew forth much applause and enthusiasm. 
--------
667-> THE SMOLENSK.
The extreme irritability of the British over every new exercise of the right of search by Russian cruisers is quite intelligible. The greatest trading nation in the world, when she herself is not at war, has the greatest interest in maintaining the rights of neutrals, which are most seriously threatened by the all-comprehensive Russian enumeration of articles contraband of war.

After racing at a lively rate for four blocks on Fifth Avenue yesterday afternoon a runaway horse attached to an express wagon was stopped by Bicycle Policeman Anthony Debes of the West Thirtieth Street Station, who jumped from his wheel, caught the bridle, and brought the animal to a stop.

671-> NATIONAL LEAGUE.; Rowdy Features Mar Games Between New York and Chicago Teams.
CHICAGO, Aug. 24. -- New York and Chicago played for four hours and a half today, and when it became too dark to continue New York had won a 3 to 0 victory and the second game was a 2 to 2 draw in ten innings. The afternoon's sport was sadly marred by a lot of rowdy features, in which the players of both teams and the spectators were equally to blame.

PARIS, June 1. -- To further the peace programme of which he is, barring the Czar, the most illustrious exponent in Europe, Baron d'Estournelles de Constant, with whom I had a conversation to-day on behalf of THE NEW YORK TIMES, welcomes anything which can prove more clearly to men's minds the odiousness and stupidity of war.

Six events are to be decided -- horizontal bars, side horse, flying rings, parallel bars, tumbling, and club swinging. 
--------
675-> JAPANESE VIEW OF THE WAR.; Do Police or Public Own the Parks?
Why should people be forced out of Prospect Park before 9 P.M.? Not only that, but the policemen in this park act in a rude and entirely unnecessary manner when asking the people, generally young couples, to "get out." I was the witness of an incident which prompts me to inquire whether the police or the public own the park. 
--------
676-> IN THE BUSINESS WORLD; COAL SHIPPING PROBLEM. Vessel owners and Shippers at Odds Over Discharge of Vessels.
Differences between coal shippers and owners of vessels engaged in the coastwise traffic, originating in the efforts of the owners to advance prices and enforce restrictions upon the time of loading and discharging, are not yet adjusted. The shippers concede that for the moment, owing to the large demand for vessels to deliver anthracite in the period of the heaviest discounts, the owners have the whip hand.

677-> SOLDIERS HERE FOR SPORT.; Regulars and Volunteers in Shape for Big Tourney in Garden.
It was a tired lot of troopers and artillerymen who heard the bugles sound the welcome "taps" last night in Madison Square Garden. Many of them were already rolled in their blankets, while the others had been preparing their kits for the eighth annual tournament of the Military Athletic League, which begins to-night in Madison Square Garden.

TO one to whom the Manassas manoeuvres were mainly an outing, and who had no duty or responsibility in connection with them, it would be hard to imagine a holiday more delightful and interesting than they afforded. To be routed out of sleep at 6, or even at 5, by the signal which the Americans miscall "revelee" and the British "revelly" is no hardship, provided one has turned in actually at "taps."

ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 13. -- The authorities here profess ignorance of the circumstances surrounding the case of the Russian transport Lena, now at San Francisco.

PALM BEACH, Fla., Feb. 13. -- The continued warm, clear weather of the past week has made the social life here extremely gay. The increased number of visitors has added more than anything else to the gayety, but cliques are formed in society here in a marked way. This clique is "golfy," that one affects tennis.

MUKDEN, Oct. 24, (Via PEKING.) -- The Russian forces on the left again crossed the Shakhe River on Oct. 21 and are now pushing forward toward the Japanese positions, intrenching as they advance. At the same time Russian batteries are continually bombarding the Japanese, who can plainly be seen busily engaged in the making of trenches.

-- Dr. W.B. BAILEY of the Yale Faculty has been studying the expenditures of American college students, with especial attention, of course, to those at New Haven, concerning whom he gives many interesting, and, on the whole, reassuring, statistics. At Yale, at least, even the richest boys spend no very alarming sums of money, and many get through the year on amounts amazingly small.

NEWARK, N.J., Sept. 18. -- Three freight cars got away from a crew of switchmen at the Nesbit Street crossing of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad at 3 o'clock this morning and two crashed into the three-story brick residence of School Commissioner James Snape at 76 Sheffield Street. The first car, which was loaded with oats, demolished the front of the structure. Then it tumbled through the parlor floor into the cellar.

685-> WHISTLER'S WRITING.
Messrs. Putnam have issued a third edition of "The Gentle Art of Making Enemies," by the late James McNeill Whistler. It is eminently timely, in view of the recent death of the author. So far as we can see, the new matter in this edition consists of some twenty pages of a catalogue of the painter's wares, highly illustrative of the title and aim of the book, but of little other additional literary importance.

686-> NEW YEAR'S RECEPTION AT THE WHITE HOUSE; President and Mrs. Roosevelt Greet Thousands of Callers. Colombia's Representative a Conspicuous Absentee Among Diplomatic Visitors -- Henry Irving in the Line.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 1. -- Although smaller than on any previous year of the present Administration, the New Year reception at the White House was most successful, inasmuch at it furnished the only opportunity of the year for several thousand visitors to greet the President and Mrs. Roosevelt and see the interior of the always interesting old mansion.

687-> UNCLE SAM'S NEW SPELLING BOOK; Teachers, Scholars, and Mapmakers Will Have a Lot to Relearn
THE Russo-Japanese war has raised a question as to the proper spelling of geographical names that is perplexing alike to the teacher, the pupil, and the general reader. The magazines and newspapers have different spellings of the same place-name, and the condition has become important in an educational sense. 
--------
688-> THE FINANCIAL MARKETS
Yesterday, Washington's Birthday, being a National holiday, no financial business was transacted in the United States. However, not a few houses with foreign connections opened their offices through anxiety to follow the development of the critical situation abroad. Happily the foreign markets over Sunday regained the composure they lost on Saturday.

690-> RECONSTRUCTING THE STATES.; Would Divide New York Into Three for Better Representation.
When I read recently in your valuable paper the witty lines of your correspondent, Mr. J.W. Foley, about the "Passing of the United States," it occurred to me that Secretary Hay's order to change the name of our country abroad was the first step toward its reconstruction in a more sensible and equitable basis than the present one.

691-> CRITICISES TAX SYSTEM.; State Board Says No Just Principle Is Followed on Personally.
ALBANY, March 6. - That there is no just principle of taxation in this and other States, so far as personal property is concerned, is pointed out in the annual report of the State Board of Tax Commissioners. "The personal property situation is anomalous," says the report, "much depending, apparently, upon the Sherlock Holmes qualities of local Assessors.

695-> ASBURY PARK IMPROVEMENTS.
ASBURY PARK, N.J., June 18. -- Cottagers have been flocking to Asbury Park this week, and the hotel patronage has been above the average for June. The regular renting season began Wednesday and on that day over 100 families moved down. The annual encampment of the New Jersey Department of the Grand Army of the Republic, which opened Thursday and closed yesterday, is responsible for the increased hotel patronage.

696-> SCARCITY OF SALT.; Short Supply This Spring and High Prices Expected.
Generally at this sesson the price of salt declines, but according to information from several sources there is not likely to be any material reduction, in prices this Spring.

WASHINGTON, June 5. -- An interesting question has been raised by the Tax Office of this city regarding the exemption from taxation of real estate that is used by foreign legations.

Through one long lane of weeping women, of men who stood with bared, bowed heads and tear-dimmed eyes, and of little children who had, for the moment, put aside childish things in a grief no less real to them because it was but half understood, fourteen hearses were driven yesterday afternoon through the East Side from the Morgue to the Williamsburg Bridge, on their way to the Lutheran Cemetery, at Middle Village, L.I.

MAYOR McCLELLAN'S remark the other day that an automobile was a "great developer of character" did not apply so much to the car itself as it did to the troubles he had had with his chauffeur. The daring chauffeur has always been a thorn in the flesh of the average automobile owner.

AS human nature changed so much during the last 500 years? The acquisition of wealth has always been the incentive.

733-> HIS OTHER TEACHERS.; Why the Schoolboy Talks as He Does Not the Only Offender.
" A Lover of Good English," who writes so disparagingly of the way in which high school teachers do their work, fails, like many well-meaning critics outside the schools, to appreciate the fact that the teacher's influence is only one of the many by which the student is affected.

761-> JAPANESE ARTILLERY.

765-> POLITICAL OUTING HELD UP.; Williamsburg Democrats Were to Go on Valley Stream -- Inspectors Interfered.

788-> THE OPEN SHOP AS A STRIKE PRODUCT.
It is an interesting fact that the important strikes of recent date have all resulted in establishing the open shop in the trades in which they have been brought.

The nomination of Mr. SHEPARD for Governor by the Democrats would impart life and spirit to the somewhat prosy campaign in this State.

Within a narrow range yesterday's stock market fluctuated a good deal. At the opening the selling was sufficient to put the whole list down a little, but recovery followed, and several times after these initial movements the list showed alternately firmness and heaviness, with the final count in favor of the bears. The abandonment of the market to the professionals seems as complete as it can be.

By the death of WALDECK-ROUSSEAU France lost last week something more than a statesman whom recent history had made conspicuous.

ARNOLD DALY is an iconoclast. He cannot deny that, though he expresses himself as emphatically in opposition to an notion that he is a dramatic reformer or the representative of any special high-art cult.

ALBANY, Jan. 8. -- State Committeeman William Barnes, Jr., is known to favor Mr. Platt in the present strained relations in the Republican Party in New York State, and therefore a column article which appeared to-day on the first page of The Evening Journal, his personal organ, under the headlines "Odell to be forced back as State Chairman," is considered significant.

881-> JAIL FOR AUTOMOBILISTS.; Fines Don't Worry Those Who Like to Play Tag with Police.
Your correspondent who asks which is the greater ruffian, the one who stones an automobile or the one who runs an automobile at a reckless pace through a crowded street, hits the point of the whole automobile trouble. The so-called "ruffian" who stones automobiles is usually a half grown boy. 
--------
882-> MAKES POLICE SHAKE-UP; Commissioner McAdoo Announces Changes in the Force. Central Office Men Are Shifted and the "System" Is Changed Around -- Precinct Commanders Moved.
The first police "shake up" was announced by Commissioner McAdoo yesterday. It affected in different degrees seven Captains. With these transfers were ordered changes in commands for subordinate. A feature of the recasting was that the facts of it were public property some time before Mr. McAdoo, who was supposed to hold "shake ups" in disfavor, had planned that they should be known, so that the "leak" system at the Central Office continues. 
--------
883-> ILLINOIS DELEGATES INSTRUCTED FOR HEARST; Pledged to Him as Long as His Name Is Before Convention.

885-> COMMODITY MARKETS UPSET.; Cotton Pit Excited -- Wheat Soared, but Dropped at the Close.
All the commodity markets were in a state of disturbance yesterday. The cotton pit was wildly excited, and the fluctuations were fast and furious. The wheat markets also executed some quick changes, going up and then down with startling rapidity. 
--------
886-> WRONGING THE ITALIAN.; Let Critics Compare His Criminal Record with That of Others.
Do you think the writer who signed himself "For Law and Order" in yesterday's TIMES was justified by any real facts in bringing such sweeping accusations against the "Italian citizen"? 
--------
887-> THE SLAYING OF PING PONG.; Rochelle Park Society Split Over Dog Case -- Animal Disinterred.
NEW ROCHELLE, June 14. -- In order to disprove the contention that her dog, Ping Pong, which was shot and killed a week ago by young Harry Emigh of Rochelle Park, was not licensed, Miss Lillian Pike, the daughter of Fire Commissioner Pike of New Rochelle, to-day had the body of the animal exhumed. 
--------
888-> RUSKIN AND NORTON.
THAT peculiar office of friendship toward an eminent man which is entirely free from flattery and egotism, which confers censure and praise with equal judgment, which maintains a face of frankness toward the public as well as toward the person loved, and which interprets with trueness and honor and sympathy the achievements of the great is perhaps not entirely unknown in the history of literature. 
--------
889-> EMBEZZLER CAUGHT IN BROKERAGE FAILURE; New Haven Paying Teller Used Bank's Funds to Speculate.
NEW HAVEN, Conn., June 2. -- Douglas M. Smith, paying teller of the National Tradesmen's Bank of this city, was arrested to-day, charged with having embezzled $60,000 of its funds, a greater part of which he admitted he had lost in speculation.

--------
891-> AGNOSTICISM.; Sir Leslie Stephen's Arguments Not Altogether Convincing.*
IN an, "Agnostic's Apology," here reprinted, in spite of what to many must be rather unwelcome and often distressing conclusions, there is nothing at which the student of our times can take offense. Sir Leslie Stephen's attitude is not militant, he flaunts no banner, he attacks no one gratuitously, and when his one weapon, sarcasm, is employed at all, it is employed with justice and discretion only against dishonest superstition and complacent stupidity. 
--------
892-> "OLD FITZ."
Thomas Wright, of Olney, in England, Cowper's town, and author of a "Life of Cowper" which has not escaped some harsh criticism, has written a biography of Edward FitzGerald, the discoverer of "Omar Khayyam," the translator of Calderon, which has been well received in England and is likely to be eagerly accepted here when it gets the honor, which it surely deserves, of American republication. 
--------
893-> PHIPPSES IN PITTSBURG; WIFE MAY GET CHILDREN; Lawyers Held Conferences All Day Yesterday. AGREEMENT TO-DAY POSSIBLE Mother Confident of the Outcome -- She Occupies the Phipps Mansion in Smoky City.

--------
895-> SOUTHAMPTON'S FLORAL SHOW
SOUTHAMPTON, Aug. 13. -- The floral parade held at the horse show grounds this afternoon was a great success and fully answered the expectations of all those interested in it. The spectacle was a beautiful one, and much skill was shown in the decorations and arrangements. The large circle of parking places was filled with carriages holding interested spectators and the standing space was also well filled. 
--------
896-> MR. HARDY'S DRAMA.
It must be admitted, to begin with, that Thomas Hardy had an indisputable right to compose a drama, if he chose to do so, and, for that matter, to project it in 100 acts instead of the 19 of his scheme, and to divide the said acts into 1,000 scenes instead of the meagre 130 to which he has limited his muse. 
--------
897-> BOWERMAN STRIKES A 'ROOTER'; New York Catcher Nearly Starts a Riot in Game at Cincinnati.
CINCINNATI, Ohio, Aug. 31. -- There came near being a riot during the first game of the double-header to-day between the New Yorks and Cincinnatis. In the sixth inning Bowerman, who was not playing, left the New York bench and struck a man in "rooters'" row, who had been jesting with him. 
--------
898-> FOR A NEW POSTMASTER.; Complaint of Inefficiency in Non-Delivery of Letters with Slight Error in Address.
Last June 1st I write a long and important letter in reply to certain questions asked me by Mrs. Charles H. Gardner of 607 Fifth Avenue, New York City.

BERLIN, June 14. -- The Empress to-day received at the Schloss twenty-one members of the International Council of Women.

--------
900-> LAKE STRIKE BROKEN.; Masters and Pilots Give In After Six Weeks' Tie-Up.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, June 14. -- After six weeks of tie-up on the great lakes that has directly involved only a couple of thousand men, but indirectly more than a hundred thousand, the strike was broken to-night by the surrender of the masters, who, with the pilots, have been holding out for a more uniform scale of wages this season than was offered by the Lake Carriers' Association. 
--------
901-> LOST EARRINGS OUT OF SHOES.; Mrs. Florence Sutro Left Them There After a Bath.
It is hardly probable that Mrs. Florence Sutro, wife of Theodore Sutro, a lawyer of 320 Broadway, will use her shoes as a safe-deposit vault while bathing hereafter. She tried it yesterday at the Columbia University Gymnasium, and as a result is mourning the loss of a pair of earrings valued at $800. 
--------
902-> S.C. ARMSTRONG.; The Story of the Philanthropist's Life Told by His Daughter.*
MRS. TALBOT has made into a book well, worth the serious reader's trouble the story of the life and work of her father, Gen. Armstrong, founder of Hampton Institute, in Virginia, and in a large sense the founder of negro industrial education. 
--------
903-> THE JUGGERNAUT OF GREED.; The East River Slaughter as a Symptom of a Disease.
Of what use to investigate the cause of the General Slocum horror? There have been others, and public indication availed nothing. Will it avail now? 
--------
904-> RUSSIA IN MANCHURIA.
There is a distinct want, getting to be "long felt," a lacuna in our system of Government publication. This will strike many readers as odd, considering the immense gross output of the Public Printing Office, doubtless by far the most prolific of any similar establishment in the world. 
--------
905-> RUSSIAN ARMY OVERWHELMED.; Literally Swept from Heights of Vafangow by the Japanese.
TOKIO, June 19. -- Scouts having brought news that the Russians were massing a large army at Telissu, (Vafangow,) twenty-eight miles north of Polan-Tien, evidently with the intention of attempting to force the Pitsewo -- Polan-Tien line, which forms the northern gate of the peninsula, Gen. Oku resolved to assume the offensive. 
--------
906-> NO MORE BURLESQUE IRISHMEN.; Production of Yeats's Plays Expected to Kill Old Tradition.
Away with the traditional stage Irishman! This is the cry of the manager who is going to produce the Irish plays of William Butler Yeats in America this Fall. They have never been given here before except in occasional matinee performances. Now Margaret Wycherley, a young English actress, has secured the American and Canadian rights. 
--------
907-> BOSTOCK AND STARS HERE.; " Animal King" Brings Performers and Beasts of Paris Show.

Aurora, the bear trainer, and other performers not so well known. 
--------
908-> THE LONDON MARKET.
LONDON, July 5. -- Notwithstanding considerable repayments to the Bank of England money was in good supply in the market to-day. Discounts had a harder tendency, owing to the uncertainty as to the position of the mone,' market, when all the loans to the Bank are repaid this week. On the Stock Exchange trading was quiet, and prices were irregular. 
--------
909-> ASBURY PARK DIVERSIONS.
ASBURY PARK, N.J., Aug. 13. -- Another week of crowds, social diversions in the Casino and the hotels and outdoor sports galore for the visitors, for Asbury Park's season is now at its height.

Relations between Mayor McClellan and Commissioner Woodbury of the Department of Street Cleaning have become strained of late, culminating in the differences of opinion concerning the street sprinkling ordinance which was before the Mayor for public hearing yesterday, and an open rupture is anything but a remote possibility. 
--------
912-> PROF. WOODBERRY.
The resignation of Prof. George E. Woodberry of his position in the Faculty of Columbia University, however much it may be regretted by the friends of the university, (and the loss to any educational institution of the services of a scholar so richly equipped is not to be taken lightly,) may, nevertheless, have its compensations in the benefit that may accrue to the world at large.

St. PETERSBURG, July 27. -- An Imperial ukase has been issued placing seven merchantmen purchased abroad in the last few months on the navy list, four of them as second-class cruisers.

914-> FLOWER SHOW AT LENOX.; Several Large Functions and the Usual Run of Dinners.
LENOX, Aug. 13. -- So far as general interest went the flower show in aid of Miss Folsom's convalescents' hospital in Lee was the event of the week.

The fruit, sold to the highest bidder, brought $100.

--------
917-> Review 4 -- No Title
The April magazines seem at a glance to be uncommonly interesting. One often hears blase folks say regretfully that the magazines are not so good as they used to be. What nonsense! There are no Dickenses and Thackerays now to provide serials, (though some of the current serials are remarkably good,) but the short story of magazine commerce and the magazine article are better than they ever were before. 
--------
918-> SERIOUS OUTLOOK FOR BRICKLAYERS' STRIKE; Whole Principle of the Arbitration Agreement Imperiled.
The outlook of the strike of the bricklayers appeared more serious than ever yesterday, threatening the very fabric of the arbitration agreement, which the Building Trades Employers' Association took an entire Summer to establish. The arbitration agreement was issued because ninetenths of the strikes during the past six years were on account of the grievances of the unskilled laborers. 
--------
919-> SIR HORACE RUMBOLD.; A Second Volume of Reminiscences by the English Diplomatist.*
WHEN a diplomatist favors the world with his reminiscences public curiosity is excited, for what secrets can there be which he does not know? Sir Horace Rumbold is, however, discreet. Of course, he met many distinguished personages whose business it was to represent the leading European States, and he describes them. 
--------
920-> RACING AT NEW ORLEANS.
NEW ORLEANS, Feb. 23. -- Harry Phillips, Thomas  Shields's jockey, signalized his return to the saddle after a two weeks' suspension by a grand ride on Forsight in the third race to-day, beating Ostrich by a length.

921-> WISCONSIN FAVORITE SONS ARE BOOMED; Spooner, La Follette, Vilas, and Wall Mentioned for President.

--------
923-> MINNEAPOLIS AND ST. LOUIS.; Its Directors Declare the Usual Dividend on Preferred, but None on Common.
Owing to the discontinuance of the traffic agreement between the Minneapolis and St. Louis and the Rock Island, and because of the falling off in earnings of the former road, the Directors of the Minneapolis and St. Louis yesterday decided to pass the dividend on the common stock and at the same time declared the usual semi-annual dividend of 2 1/2 per cent. on the preferred.

925-> BOSTON NOTES.; New Books of History, Biography, and Fiction to be Published This Spring.
ELEGIES of Loveliness are in order, for that very pretty Yorkshire terrier is dead, and Mrs. Elizabeth Stuart Phelps-Ward has a new dog who is called Fay, and not Job, as might have been expected. Loveliness was a useful dog; it is hoped that Fay will not fall behind his predecessors, big and little, in playing a conspicuous part in the daily life of his mistress, to the profit of her readers.

COLUMBUS, Ohio, Jan. 21. -- An almost continuous fall of rain for the last thirty-six hours, carrying off the snow, has caused freshets in practically all Ohio streams. The danger at many places has been greatly increased by the breaking up of ice in the streams and the formation of gorges. 
--------
929-> MAY SETTLE RATE WAR.; Heavy Losses to Steamship Lines on the Steerage Business.
LONDON, June 14. -- There are some indications of a possible ending of the Atlantic rate war. It is reported that terms of settlement were discussed at a conference held at Liverpool to-day.

SEOUL, May 3. -- It has been learned here that after the fighting of Sunday on the Yalu the Japanese yesterday (Monday) morning started to pursue the enemy through the mountains. 
--------
931-> THE SOUTH AND THE CANAL.
There is no very good story that does not carry a moral. The story which a correspondent told in our columns yesterday was a very good one, setting forth how a friendly Indian brought a gift of a deer to the Pilgrim Fathers, and how the Pilgrim Fathers, ascertaining that he had killed the animal on Sunday, proceeded to give him flogging, after which they discussed and enjoyed his venison. 
--------
932-> CRESCENT WON AT HOCKEY; Columbia Outplayed in Lively Game at Clermont Rink. Winners Scored Seven Goals, While Collegians Failed to Earn a Goal -- Weakness in Team Work Apparent.
Columbia and the Crescent Athletic Club played hockey last night in the Clermont Avenue Rink, Brooklyn, and after a lively game, notwithstanding the one-sided finish, the Crescent team won by 7 goals to 0.

--------
934-> Russians Have No News.
ST. PETERSBURG, July 23. -- There is no official confirmation of Gen. Kuroki's report that the Japanese have captured Kiao-Tung. No such place as this is found on Russian maps, the nearest approach to it being Kantziatum, which is only twelve miles from Liao-Yang, on the Sai-ma-Tse Road. 
--------

ALBANY, Feb. 23. -- The Court of Appeals to-day decided that the State Controller, in imposing a 1 per cent. tax on the surplus and undivided profits of savings banks under the so-called Odell law of 1901, must assess at the market value of the securities constituting the surplus when the same is quoted on the market below their par value.

A MOUNTAINEER takes his life in his hand along with his alpenstock right willingly for love of the sport; but the window washer of the New York skyscraper takes his in his hand perforce, compelled by necessity.

938-> FORAKER DEMANDS HIS SHARE OF PATRONAGE; Will No Longer Allow Discrimination Against His Friends. SAYS HE'S BEEN NEGLECTED Declares Gov. Herrick Reminds Him of the Irishman Who Was Afraid He'd Get Justice.
WASHINGTON, March 15. -- Senator Foraker declares that he fully approves the statement attributed to Gov.

942-> MAGAZINE NOTES.
Mr. Wells's grim and grisly serial "The Food of the Gods," becomes more sombre in the installment in the April Cosmopolitan. The "boom-food" babies have grown to manhood ill-treated, dangerous malcontents forty feet tall. The giant rats and earwigs still afflict England, which is shown in the throes of a great political agitation caused by the "boom-food." 
--------
943-> Plans of Some of Them -- Forthcoming New Books.
A NEW novel by Mrs. Everard Cotes (Sara Jeannette Duncan), "The Imperialist," is announced for immediate publication by D. Appleton  Co. This is the first long story in some years from the brilliant author of "An America Girl in London" and "Those Delightful Americans." 
--------
944-> GAS IN THEATRES.
The flooding of a theatre with illuminating gas from a leaky main in the street is of public interest chiefly as calling attention to the fact that gas must be reckoned as among the real fire risks of theatres. This is by no means a new discovery, but it is perhaps new to the general public.

--------
955-> Insane Women at Play; Basket Ball and Other Outdoor Games Enjoyed by Patients on Ward's Island.
IN various reports of athletic games played in and around New York there are two basket-ball teams that do not come in for general notice, though their players have more "rooters" on either side than many such teams, and the prize contests are talked of weeks before and after they occur, and with many critical remarks.

957-> INADEQUATE ELEVATED STATION.

958-> THE FINANCIAL MARKETS; Stocks Firm; Call Money Easy, 1 Per Cent.

--------
959-> Article 8 -- No Title
THE Knickerbocker Sunday was a strenuous one, although not so strict as the New England Sabbath. One of the earliest regulations of the Council of Burgomasters and Schepens was to forbid the selling of "wines, beers, and brandy waters" during church hours, and by implication it may be concluded that New Amsterdam had an excise law similar to that desired by the present District Attorney. 
--------
960-> MR. WILLIAMS ON SILVER.
It is quite idle, though entirely proper, for Mr. JOHN SHARP WILLIAMS of Mississippi to declare that he speaks only for himself and not as the leader of the Democratic Party in the House in his statements as to the silver coinage issue. A man who leads, and whose avowedly personal declarations are received with applause by the Representatives accustomed to follow him, is in fact a leader. 
--------

962-> OPEN SHOP ULTIMATUM ANNOUNCED BY BUILDERS; Striking Unions Given Until Aug. 22 to Relent.
What is considered practically an open-shop ultimatum to the unions was the result of the long, secret meeting of the Board of Governors of the Building Trades Employers' Association on Friday afternoon.

969-> THE EXPENSIVE POLO PONY AND HIS COWBOY TEACHER; How the Little Steed Learns the Ropes in His Far-Off Training School.
POLO is said to be the most expensive game a man can play. That being the case, it is no wonder the colonies of the very rich around about New York have taken to it with enthusiasm, not the less because it entails plenty of risk to the neck. 
--------
970-> NEWS OF NEWPORT.
NEWPORT, R.I., June 2. -- Mr. and Mrs. Pembroke Jones returned to-day in the steam yacht Narada and at once took possession of Inchiquin, which they have rented for the season.

975-> A DISRUPTED DEMOCRACY.; The Parts Played by Cleveland and Bryan in That Result.
It seems quite evident that in the present factional crisis it is as easy to mix castor oil and water as it would be to harmonize Bryanism and Clevelandism in one political party. Such being the case, it is idle to exert any fruitless efforts and waste precious time in that direction.

--------
981-> WALL STREET TOPICS.; Market Advances Sharply.
Transactions in the stock market yesterday were again fairly large, measured by recent standards, but there was very little increase in the commission business. In other words, while the market for the past two days has shown transactions in the neighborhood of 500,000 shares, the increase has been due almost entirely to more extensive operations by the traders. 
--------
982-> "FIRE?" NO, CURIOUS MAID.; Paragon of a Domestic Servant in Short Hills Causes Excitement.
SHORT HILLS, N.J., July 5. -- She is a pearl without price; she neither breaks dishes nor stays out late at night; it is reported that she is not "uppish" to her mistress, and it is even asserted that she has never threatened to leave. But alas! she has one failing, that of curiosity, and her employers shudder when they remember that it was curiosity that killed the cat.

990-> BUTTERFLY HARVESTING.
TRAVELERS in Berlin visiting the adjacent country in the Spring are surprised to see the trees in the woods gayly dressed in gauze as if for a ball. The gauze, which is put around the short branches, is tied up near the trunk of the tree and is not intended for decorative use, but is the work of the butterfly harvesters. 
--------
991-> BROOKLYN, 6; PHILADELPHIA, 3.
PHILADELPHIA, May 3. -- The Phillies made an inglorious attempt to-day to raise the embargo of consecutive defeats, but, the baseball Nemesis is still pursuing them Brooklyn won the second game of the series by the score of 6 to 3. The principal factor in the Quakers' downfall was the indifferent work of McPherson. 
--------
992-> THE FIGHTING ON THE YALU.
The elaborate statement put forth by the Russian General Staff naturally has for its object to minimize the Japanese victory upon the Yalu. According to this statement the Japanese forces engaged numbered 100,000. This seems to be quite absurd, in view of the official report of Gen. KUROKI, which names the troops, all comprised within his own command, the First Army Corps. 
--------
993-> THE FINANCIAL MARKETS; Stocks Weak; Call Money Easy 1 1-2@1 3-4.
For a fortnight, practically ever since there has been a surplus of news, it has been as difficult to discover a tendency in the market as to discover a tide in an inland lake. There were those who claimed to discern a tendency toward improvement despite depressing conditions, and there were those who thought they saw signs of decline despite the encouragement apparent to optimists. 
--------
994-> THE PROSPERITY OF CANADA; Though the Dominion Has Enjoyed Seven Fat Years, It Does Not Expect Lean Ones to Follow.
OTTAWA, Dec. 30. -- It is difficult to write anything of interest in detail about the business of the Dominion, because almost whatever branch, class, or feature were to be taken up, there would be one story to tell, namely, that business has been first class, is first class, and promises to continue to be first class. 
--------
995-> THE FINANCIAL MARKETS
The new year had a stormy reception inside as well as outside of the Stock Exchange. Respecting the snowstorm, it will suffice to say in passing that there has been all too little of nature's protecting covering for Winter wheat, and that in other respects a storm or two more or less is all in the year's business.

996-> BRIGHT OUTLOOK FOR COFFEE; Gloomy View of a Year Ago Have Been Followed by Happy Prophecies -- Growth of the Coffee Exchange.

Jesus of Nazareth, during His Ministry of three years, preached many sermons. Nearly, thirty of them are recorded in the Gospels with considerable fullness.

Politics is business and business is politics. It only requires slight reflection to be convinced of the practical truth of this statement. In the centuries past, ambitious States and ambitious men sought to extend dominion by military conquest; now, every civilized government seeks to advance the material welfare and promote the happiness of its people by fostering manufacturing and extending its commerce. 
--------
1000-> THE FINANCIAL SITUATION
Last week's market began with some resemblance to Boston's best manner, as mentioned last week, but decidedly improved upon it. The Boston idea is that activity is all that is wanted in a market, and that if activity cannot be got in any other way it can be manufactured by paying enough commissions to brokers out of a fund raised by miscellaneous contributions, if necessary. It can be, but to what good purpose? 
--------
1001-> STEAMSHIP NEARLY FOUNDERED.; Big Seas Boarded the Rhenania, and She Had a Narrow Escape.
HALIFAX, N. S., Jan. 16. -- Buffeted by the seas of the North Atlantic most of the way from Ireland to Newfoundland, the German steamship Rhenania came into port to-day considerably the worse for wear. The vessel sailed from Liverpool on Dec. 20, and seven days later encountered the first of a series of westerly gales.

--------
1010-> RESTRICTING IMMIGRATION.

--------
1011-> BEWARE THE COMING BEARD.; Eloquent Barber Raises Protest Against a Threatened Evil.
BARBERS are seriously considering the question whether the present custom of men of being clean shaven has no almost had its run.

THE old adage that 'time and tide wait for no man' will have to be changed to include steamships," remarked an old seafarer a few days age, after a young couple had been placed aboard a tugboat for a chase down the harbor to catch a vessel for which they had bought tickets and which they had missed.

--------
1019-> NEBRASKA LACKS ORATORS.; Downfall of Bryan Makes State Long for New Spellbinders.
LINCOLN, Neb. July 23. -- The political situation in Nebraska is unpromsling to those who delight in a sensational campaign, but even here those who delight in oratorical pyrotechnics find room for belief that present conditions will not prevail throughout the Fall. They believe there will be such a resuscitation of Populism that the heydays of the nineties will be re-called. 
--------
1020-> WATERMELONS AND AFRICANS.
In the earliest study of the natural history of the African his absorptive powers in the matter of watermelons came to the front and has always staid there. It is one of his most salient characteristics, balancing in importance his unremitting and never-satiated appetite for chicken, and is as much a part of him as the kink in his hair or the color of his epidermis. 
--------

ROSEMOUNT, ESOPUS, N.Y., Sept. 1. -- John N.

1022-> BOSTON, 7; BROOKLYN, 3.,
BOSTON, July 5. -- Before to-day's game was called in the seventh inning on account of rain it had grown too dark to handle the ball properly, and Brooklyn gave a ridiculous exhibition of fielding.

Reports from the grape-growing sections received by the domestic wine growers and makers during the last week or two indicate that the crop of wine grapes in all sections of the country is very poor, except in California, where the crop is of fair size and average quality.

--------
1033-> Article 6 -- No Title
I believe that west-bound traffic is likely to show increases during the coming year because the purchasing power of the West and Southwest is probably greater at the present than it has been at any time in the history of the country.

1036-> IN THE REAL ESTATE FIELD

ALBANY, Feb. 1. -- The Republican organization has found a solution of the New York excise problem.

Yesterday's stock market was like Tuesday's, except in details. There was the same sporadic, fitful strength, which suffered by comparison, with last week's whole-hearted buying of anything anybody wanted to sell.

The department stores and large business establishments of New York have taken steps to protect themselves against the poolroom evil.

Their senses are naturally more acute and are further sharpened by their rough-and-tumble existence. 
--------
1400-> A MATTER OF STREETS.
MANY women with a literary bent and a surplus of spare time are now discussing Shaw instead of Ibsen or Browning, and great are the conclusions at which some of them arrive.

--------
1415-> HILL EMBRACED BY HYSTERICAL DELEGATES; Joy at His Nomination of His Old Enemy Overcomes Them.
SARATOGA, N.Y., Sept. 21. -- Out of the conflict, the intense factionalism, and the bitter personal feeling which have marked the deliberations of the Democrats assembled here for the past three days for the purpose of nominating a State ticket, there came to-day an exhibition of party harmony which was almost unbelievable of men.

Buell, in his new historical work, "William Penn as the Founder of Two Commonwealths," which is published this week, gives up much space to Penn's own account of the Colony of Pennsylvania and its Indians, which, Mr. Buell says, "is the only one of his historical writings that may be described as wholly free from a species of cant which his earlier theological career seems to have made second nature with him." 
--------
1427-> WALL STREET TOPICS.
When the stock market opened yesterday with considerable display of strength there were predictions that the day would be a repetition of Tuesday and Wednesday, when, after a strong opening, prices declined sharply.

--------

Over 9,000 persons, including many women, saw the fast Chicago team win its third straight game from the Greater New Yorks yesterday by a score of 5 to 4.

As a former German army officer in the same branch of the service, the cavalry, as the author, no better man could have been found to edit and translate into English "A Little Garrison "than Wolf von Schierbrand, whose reviews of books on German history and other topics are well known to the readers of THE NEW YORK TIMES SATURDAY REVIEW.

1439-> Squeers of Dotheboys Hall.
Referring to your reply to "A.K." concerning the original of Squeers in "Nicholas Nickleby," perhaps I may be permitted to say that in the course of the rambles afterward described in the book, "A Literary Pilgrimage," I visited the place of Dotheboys Hall and carefully examined the matter of the identity of Shaw with Squeers, the "measther" of the school.

--------
1448-> FIGHTING "FUTURES."
Mr. BALFOUR, in his moments of relaxation from the study of abstract metaphysic, has been wont in times past to indulge in the framing of economic theories. His general attitude of "philosophic doubt" has had some queer effects on his mind while engaged in this diversion. It permits, it even tempts, him to treat with light disrespect doctrines accepted by the closest students and sustained by most of the experience of mankind. 
--------
1449-> ENGLISH JUSTICE?
A miscarriage of British justice in the case of ADOLF BECK, an innocent man, who served five years' penal servitude, and was to be again sentenced for thrice that period on a similar unjust charge, when, Providentially, the real malefactor was apprehended, has caused an agitation among the leading English journals for a Court of Criminal Appeal.

Readers of Mr. Albert A. Hertzell's "Alicia" will have little difficulty in tracing the origin of his story to the triple tragedy that agitated Buffalo not so very long ago.

--------
1468-> HURST PARK'S HANDICAP; Toboggan Winner Cleverly Took the First of the Serials.
The first walkover of the year made a tame beginning for the racing at Morris Park yesterday afternoon, but matters shaped themselves speedily and the day was productive of quite as much excitement and uncertainty as was the fair allotment of a day, before the programme, which included an extra race because of the walkover, was finished. 
--------

PITTSBURG, May 9. -- The grievance between the International Bridge and Structural Iron Workers and the American Bridge Company, has been adjusted.

--------
