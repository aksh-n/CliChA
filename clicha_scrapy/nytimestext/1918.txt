44-> FAIRBANKS CAVORTS IN NEW SCREEN PLAY; "He Comes Up Smiling," Gives the Star Opportunity for Acrobatics. RAY IN AN ARCTIC PICTURE Wallace Reid Saves the Spruce Forests far Uncle Sam in"The Source."
The newest of the Douglas Fairbanks pictures, "He Comes Up Smiling," goes along for some 90 per cent. of its length before it permits the star to disport himself in the violently acrobatic way for which he has become celebrated. The film at the Rivoli is based upon the play of the same title, the leading rôle of which was acted by Fairbanks back in the days before his name became a household word, but divers liberties have been taken with the final five minutes to provide the physical fireworks without which a Fairbanks picture is not considered complete.The story, it may be remembered, concerns the adventures of one Jerry Martin, who falls among tramps and eventually becomes one of them. Chance permits him to emerge in the habiliments of one Batchellor, king of the market, and it is in his assumed capacity that adventures begin to befall him. As matters reach a climax he handles four of his pursuers in a way which would insure a long term in prison for any one but a movie hero, but which is considered quite the permissible and even obligatory thing for a film star.The distinctly minor part which physical action plays in the picture, however, leads to the hope that the star may finally leave this field behind him and devote himself to more subtle comedy. Like Chaplin, he has something of a genius for small comedy touches, and now that he is established high in popular favor he should be able to hold his public easily—even to find an additional public—by the selection of subjects which call for treatment more delicate than a blow with an axe. "He Comes Up Smiling," at all events, makes a beginning, and should be encouraged.Two minor stars of the screen, Wallace Reid and Charles Ray, are to be seen at the Strand and the Rialto, respectively. At the former the generally elegant Reid appears as a tramp—although, like the hero of "He Comes Up Smiling," he could boast a higher social position, if he wished. The Reid film is "The Source," written by Clarence Budington Kelland, and tells a fairly interesting story of lumber-camp life, crossed with the omnipresent German intrigue theme.Reid is a bit too anxious to be elegant to appear convincing as a tramp, but as soon as he is permitted to remove his beard his work picks up noticeably. Then, getting down to work in the good old movie manner, he saves the spruce forests for Uncle Sam. The picture enlists the services of several good actors in the star's support, notably Raymond Hatton and Theodore Roberts.Charles Ray's picture departs from the rural settings in which that player is generally to be found, and reveals him as a hero of the Arctic regions. The film, "The Law of the North," is a well told and exciting melodrama, with much excellent photography, and again reveals Ray as one of the most promising young players of the screen.

658-> 'A PERFECT LADY' AT THE STRAND; Madge Kennedy Its Star-- Flagg's 'Independence B'Gosh' Also on the Program. "UNDER 4 FLAGS "--RIVOLI "Too Fat to Fight" at the Rialto-- "After the War" at Broadway --Newman at Carnegie Hall. Out of Army into Y.M.C.A. War's Scenes Return.
There is more than Madge Kennedy to "A Perfect Lady," the featured photoplay at the Strand this week. First, there is the photoplay itself. The stage work of Channing Pollock and Rennold Wolf, which may be remembered as the story of an exceptionally ladylike burlesque queen who rescues the oppressed people of a small town from the tyranny of its Puritanical factions, has been made into an entertaining motion picture comedy, unoriginal and trivial, but sensibly constructed and largely free from the claptrap and crudity (save for the inevitable love scenes) that make many photoplays so utterly impossible. Even if the play is nothing of moment, it is a pure pleasure to watch it, because it is something approaching what a screen comedy should be. Both the work of the author of the scenario and that of Clarence G. Badger, the director, are encouraging.What pleasure there is in the photoplay is added to that afforded by Miss Kennedy's acting. Miss Kennedy is one of the comparatively few screen players who would be a star whether she was advertised as such or not. Though she has never displayed any great versatility, she is a remarkable pantomimist in what she does attempt, and gives the impression that her talent is capable of further development. This impression is strengthened by her performance in "A Perfect Lady," which seems to reach out beyond anything she has done before. And, of course, she is, as always, a delightful person to look upon. Her supporting company is also to be commended, especially Walter Law, Harry Spingler, and Mae McAvoy.James Montgomery Flagg's latest comedy, "Independence, B'Gosh," with Olin Howland and Florence Dixon in the leading rôles, increases the amusement to be derived from the Strand program. Rural life and the "misfortune" of a middle-aged couple in inheriting $89,000,000 are the subjects of Mr. Flagg's wit. The comedy is far from being the best that Mr. Flagg has done, but it provokes laughter.Out of Army into Y. M. C. A.Rex Beach's "Too Fat to Fight," at the Rialto this week, cannot properly be called a photoplay. It is rather a series of animated, but not very animated, illustrations of Mr. Beach's text. And there is nothing startling in the text. The story is about a fat man who went into the Y. M. C. A. because he was too ample for the army, and the spectators are told in sub-titles that he made a wonderful worker, and turned out to be a hero. Frank McIntyre as the fat man does little to make the sub-titles convincing. The whole production apparently was planned for exhibition before the end of the war, when all that was required of a photoplay for paying popularity was that it echo appropriate sentiments.The Rialto orchestra, led by Hugo Riesenfeld, gives a spirited interpretation of Liszt's "Sixth Hungarian Rhapsoly," and Vincente Ballester sings "I Believe" from "Otello" effectively. Gladys Rice's singing of "Till I Wake," from the Indian Love Lyrics of Amy Woodfore-Finden, is enjoyable.War's Scenes Return."Under Four Flags," the Government war film which proved such a success at the Rialto and Rivoli week before last, is filling a return engagement at the Rivoli this week."After the War," with Grace Cunard and Herbert Prior in the principle parts, and "Shoulder Arms," with Charlie Chaplin, in its sixth week, are the offerings at the Broadway.E. M. Newman delivered the third of his course of travel talks, "Wartime Italy," at Carnegie Hall last night, and will repeat it at the same place this afternoon.

746-> WAR VIVIDLY SEEN IN GRIFFITH FILM; "Hearts of the World" Also Tells a Story That Quickly Stirs the Emotions. IT BEGINS BEFORE CONFLICT Germans Advance with Fury Upon a French Village Harboring a Romance of Boy and Girl.
Invited spectators who filled the Forty-fourth Street Theatre last night were stirred as few audiences at war plays and photoplays have been by the private showing of D. W. Griffith's "Hearts of the World," which will have its first public presentation at the theatre tonight. Mr. Griffith's film seeks to make the war a big reality, to bring as much of it as possible within the four walls of a comfortable Broadway theatre; and, if the demonstrations by which those who saw the picture manifested their succession of emotions can be accepted as faithful indications, the motion picture succeeds in its ambitious aim.But the picture is not just a series of photographs of fighting. Mr. Griffith does not plunge his spectators straight into action that would be only confusing and spectacular. His story begins some years before the war, the scene in a quiet French village where the homely people have no thought of war and death and disaster. There is a young girl living with her old grandparents. And there is a young man living with his parents and three little brothers. Monsieur Cuckoo., The Little Disturber, The Village Carpenter, A Deaf and Blind Musician, and many others are village characters with their happiness and little difficulties that do not matter.The Girl and the Boy love each other. The Little Disturber, delightful little devil of a flirt, loves the Boy, but he loves the other Girl and angrily spurns her. The Disturber at last turns to Monsieur Cuckoo, who has been pursuing her from the first. The Littlest Brother of the Boy, as fascinating a little fellow as has been seen on any stage, idolizes his big brother and gives the spectators much amusement with his merry exhibitions of affection. The scenes of this French village suggest all that had been known by travel and books of provincial France before the war. Many times those in the theatre broke into applause just at some particularly beautiful landscape of rural vista.Into such an atmosphere and environment the war bursts. First a German spy inspecting possible fortifications appears with sinister suggestion. Then, just before the set wedding day of the Boy and the Girl, the town crier startles the village with the mobilization order. The whole peaceful arrangement of life is violently shattered. The men rush off to war and the women stay behind to worry and wonder.With the beginning of the war, the film introduces the first of the scenes of actual fighting made by Mr. Griffith at the front with the co-operation of the British and French Governments. These scenes are skillfully worked into others specially made for the play, so that, were it not for the appearance of characters peculiar to the plot of the play, one would scarcely know where the actual ends and the made-to-order begins. Sometimes one does not know whether what he is seeing is a real war or screen make-believe. The pictures of hand to hand fighting in the trenches, the bursting of shells from big guns, the demolition of buildings, the scouting trips and raids into enemy trenches are impressively realistic.Continuing the story, the Germans advance against the village; many of the inhabitants flee in confusion, while shells do their destruction around them; others remain behind and seek shelter in cellars and crypts and vaults. Certain characters in the play are killed; others survive to face the fearful future. After furious fighting the Germans take possession of the town and Prussian brutality reveals itself in a number of vivid scenes.The horrors of German occupation are shown, chiefly as they affect the persons in the play, the Girl and the Disturber, who become companions in misery. There is a great deal of detail, both of actual fighting and of play plot, and finally the Boy, whom the girl had left for dead on a battlefield, enters the village disguised in the uniform of a Prussian officer and finds his sweetheart, who escapes with him from the clutches of a Prussian officer to a garret room, where a struggle that has all of the thrill of melodrama takes place. But this little clash of individuals is not long continued. Soon the French troops retake; he town and more of the action of real war is seen.The conclusion shows the characters of the play, lovers reunited, on a furlough, and as they are dining. American troops pass outside. The Stars and Stripes enter, and at the very end ultimate victory for the Allies is symbolically forecast.All of the actors in the play were frequently applauded. Lillian Gish, as the Girl, moved the people in her biggest moments, and Dorothy Gish, as the Little Disturber, with her bewitching ways, was applauded many times after stepping beyond the range of the camera just as if she had been on the stage in person, retreating into the wings after an effective scene. Ben Alexander as the Littlest Brother was a child wonderful, and Robert Harron as the Boy, Robert Anderson as Monsieur Cuckoo. George Fawcett as the Village Carpenter, and Eugene Pouyet as a Poilu were especially good.Descriptive music, in which the leading characters had motifs that accompanied their appearances, added greatly to the performance.After "The End" had been flashed upon the screen the spectators stood and shouted for Mr. Griffith until he appeared on the stage. He said that he had no speech to make, but only wanted to thank those present. When he attempted to ask the spectators to pray for and support the men fighting in the war, which, he said, the flickering shadows on the screen represented in a small way, his voice broke and he never finished his sentence.Historic meetings of the British Parliament and French Chamber of Deputies, as well as the leading figures in France and England were shown and received ovations. A representation of the Kaiser was eagerly hissed.The scenario of the play was written by M. Maston de Tolignac and translated by Captain Victor Marier. The film is presented under the management of William Elliott, F. Ray Comstock, and Morris Gest.Many officers of the allied armies and navies, public officials, and friends of the producers were present by invitation.
