63-> ' Duel in the Sun,' Selznick's Lavish Western That Stars Jennifer Jones, Gregory Peck, Opens at Loew's Theatres
There's a new sales technique in film business which has been rather cleverly evolved from scientific audience researching. It is this: If the public's "want to see" for a forthcoming picture samples higher than the reactions of test audiences, you sell your picture in a hurry before the curious have a chance to get wise. It follows, of course, the old pitch theory that you can fool all of the people some of the time provided your ballyhoo is super and you don't stick around too long.That, we suspect, is one reason why David O. Selznick's "Duel in the Sun," as much ballyhooed a movie as we've had since "Gone With the Wind," was launched yesterday not only at the Capitol on Broadway but in thirty-eight (count 'em) houses of the Loew's circuit in and around New York. For, despite all his flashy exploitation, Mr. Selznick can't long hide the fact that his multimillion-dollar Western is a spectacularly disappointing job.Those are harsh words for a movie upon which the producer of some memorably fine films has lavished some mighty production and close to a dozen stars. Those are also harsh words about a picture which promises very much and which, even for all its disappointments, has some flashes of brilliance in it. But the ultimate banality of the story and its juvenile slobbering over sex (or should we say "primitive passion," as says a ponderous foreword?) compels their use.Reduced to its bare essentials and cleared of a clutter of clichés worn thin in a hundred previous Westerns, Mr. Selznick's two-hour-and-a-quarter tale is that of a sun-blistered romance involving a half-breed Indian girl and two dagger-eyed Texas brothers, one of them good and the other very bad. That, as a plot, might be sufficient for a sort of O'Neillian frontier tragedy—and, indeed, once or twice it looks faintly as though this might turn into a valid "Desire Under the Sun." Also, the locale of this fable—a baronial Texas ranch, ruled by a scalawag father wed to a faded flower of the Old South—and the incidental details of the raw life are sufficient to a drama of some point.But Mr. Selznick, who wrote it from a novel by Niven Busch (and, we suspect, with occasional reference to Margaret Mitchell's famous tome), seems to have been more anxious to emphasize the clash of love and lust than to seek some illumination of a complex of arrogance and greed. As a consequence, most of the picture is devoted to the romantic quirks of a tawny-skinned Scarlett O'Hara who wants the noble brother with her heart but can't help loving the scoundrel with her notably feeble flesh.Okay. On that elemental level, Mr. Selznick has turned quite a trick of lurid and lickerish illustration, by leave of the Production Code. He has got through some scenes of fancy wooing between Gregory Peck and Jennifer Jones, the bad boy and the half-breed doxy, and he has flashed a few broad suggestions. He—and his director, King Vidor—have also whipped up some eye-dazzling scenes of wide-open ranching and frontiering, all in color of the very best, of course. Indeed, some of the compositions, achieved with color and musical backgrounds, evoke sudden and singular sensations that are conspicuously superior to the whole. Oh, brother—if only the dramatics were up to the technical style!But they're not. Nor are the performances, which are strangely uneven—all of them. The best and the most consistent is that of Mr. Peck, who makes of the renegade brother a credibly vicious and lawless character, and the next best is that of Walter Huston as a frontier evangelist. This is the role to which objection was voiced by elements on the West Coast and which was consequently trimmed by editing, as well as piously excused in an appended foreword. That seems to us unfortunate, for Mr. Huston's pungent thundering in this role is one of the bits of characterization which has real flavor and significance.As the desert flower, cause of all the turmoil, Miss Jones gives occasional glints of the pathos of loneliness and heartbreak, but mostly she has to pretend to be the passion-torn child of nature in the loosest theatrical style. The final scene, in which she punctures Mr. Peck with several well-aimed rifle shots, is wounded herself and then crawls to him across the rocks to die with him in his arms, is one of those chunks of theatrics that ranks with Liza crossing the ice. Likewise, Lillian Gish and Lionel Barrymore are pretty porky as the Texas tycoons, and Joseph Cotten, Charles Bickford and many others are no better—nor worse—than the script allows.However, we don't want to scare you. "Duel in the Sun" is still something to see—provided you understand clearly that it is the bankroll and not the emotions by which you will be shocked.No stage show is being presented at the Capitol during the run of "Duel in the Sun." DUEL IN THE SUN, screen play by David O. Selznick, adopted by Oliver H. P.

366-> ' Magic Town' Film Site Where James Stewart Polls Public Opinion and Courts Radiant Jane Wyman, Bill at Palace
A peculiarly roundabout tribute to the American pot-bellied stove and to the brand of parochial thinking which traditionally surrounds that community hub is paid by Robert Riskin in his first produced film, "Magic Town," a genial comedy-drama which came to the Palace yesterday. At least, that appears his intention, since the film seems to make the ultimate point that the hot-stove league's humble conclusions are more reliable than any public-opinion poll. And, of course, Mr. Riskin is noted as the Hollywood sage of the simple American folk, having been the author of such pictures as "Meet John Doe" and "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town."But somehow his film lacks conviction, for all its humorous reflections of small-town life and for all the loose-jointed, soda-cracker acting of James Stewart in the principal role. And that, we're afraid, is because Mr. Riskin wasn't altogether sure of his point—or, maybe, tried to build a bridge to it with a lot of rather old theatrical boards.At the outset, it looks as though he's tangled with a good-natured travesty on the business of public-opinion taking as he gallops into a small town with a clever young sampler who has discovered that this small town is a perfect composite of the United States. And the humor blends happily with romance as this young fellow, keeping his business in disguise, falls in love with a local young lady who has the community's best interests at heart.But the going becomes a bit heavy when the fellow's true traffic is exposed and the town is publicly lauded as the "mathematical miracle" of the United States. For then Mr. Riskin brings to it a rush of attention and a boom such as one could barely imagine for a place in which they'd struck oil. And out of this fickle prosperity he engineers such an eventual bust, of both a spiritual and material nature, as only Sodom or Gomorrah could have known. Through this humiliation and the regenerated integrity of his boy, Mr. Riskin brings the town back to its senses and to a reliance upon its councils around the stove.However, the author-producer does not bring his picture back to the playful and pleasant disposition it has in its first half or two-thirds. Nor does he succeed in making plausible this lugubrious soul-search of his town. Allowing that pride, even in such a small thing as infallibility, usually leads to a fall, it does not seem reasonabe that the consequence should be so shattering or bewildering as it is here. And Mr. Riskin's device for salvation smacks strongly of a sentimental cliché.Granted that Mr. Stewart's performance is in his nicest old-coat and slouch-hat style (even though it is hardly consistent with the city-slicker role presumed for him) and that Jane Wyman's skeptical surrender as the town girl is romantically sweet. Granted, too, that William Wellman has directed a couple of scenes between the two in a charmingly casual manner which is worth a lengthy wait. The incidental characters, notably those played by Ned Sparks and Wallace Ford, are embarrassingly theatrical and the sets are as phony as a slug.In fact, if a scientific breakdown of public opinion on this film were made, we would fear for its optimism. The hot-stove league will express itself in time. MAGIC TOWN: Based on a story by Robert Riskin and Joseph Krumgold; directed by William A.

433-> A Melodrama in Darkest Africa
"Blonde Savage," at the Rialto, is one of those adventure melodramas in which there is much talk and little action. The setting is darkest Africa; the hero is tall and muscular and the lady of the title is a scantily clad, attractive miss who was brought up in the jungle by the natives when her parents were killed by a couple of greedy white men on the trail of fabulous diamond mine.Since the girl learned to say "xyzabecgru," or something equally unpronounceable, which we gather means kill in jungle lingo, she has led raids on the white men's stronghold down the trail a ways, and the warriors always limp back to their huts nursing gunshot wounds. Then one fine day the hero drops down on the settlement, he didn't mean to but his plane developed engine trouble, and in due time the girl learns to speak English, justice is done and, of course, love finds a way.That's it, folks, and about the only thing left to be said about "Blonde Savage" is that it's depressing, very depressing, indeed.

444-> ' The Unsuspected,' New Warner Mystery, With Joan Coalfield and Michael North, at Strand -- 'Blonde Savage' at Rialto
There is reasonable ground for suspicion that the people who made "The Unsuspected" thought that they were fashioning another "Laura," popular mystery of a few years back. For this Michael Curtiz whodunit, which came to the Strand yesterday, is set amid similar surroundings of worldliness and elegance. Furthermore, it is centered on a character of exceeding literary suavity and it lays much stress at the beginning upon the portrait of a girl, believed dead.But, beyond a brisk flurry of excitement and wickedness at the start, it bears little showmanly resemblance to that previous top-drawer effort in this line. Rather it is much more suggestive, the further along it goes, of a second-rate mystery melodrama upon which too much money and too big a cast has been spent.At the start, as we say, it has promise. A pretty young woman is killed and her employer, a radio raconteur who specializes in crime tales, is curiously aloof. A young fellow turns up with the story that he was married to the radio spieler's ward, supposedly drowned in a shipwreck—but who turns up herself in good time. A niece of the spieler acts oddly. A dark muscle-man is sneaked in. Saving a certain confusion, the yarn gets away temptingly.Once launched, however, it starts leaking, pulling apart at the seams, and generally foundering in a welter of obvious contrivances and clichés. It isn't long before everyone must know who "the unsuspected" is—a mystery which even the writers don't try to push into the stretch. Then they attempt to keep things moving by jumping to the "menace" routine, which only turns out to be ridiculous in a "cliff-hanging" race toward the end.To be sure, Claude Rains is intriguing as the fashionable radio ghoul and Michael North, a new young actor, looks good as the lad who "breaks" the case. However, the rest of the performers—Joan Caulfield, Audrey Totter, Hurd Hatfield, Constance Bennett and a half dozen others—are as patly artificial as the plot.On the stage at the Strand are Joey Adams, Mark Plant, Tony Canzoneri and Blue Barron and his orchestra.

867-> ' Pursued,' a Western Drama by Niven Busch, With Robert Mitchum and Teresa Wright in Leads, Opens at Strand
One of those films which you might better come in on toward the end and then see over from the beginning is Warner's new western, "Pursued," which found an uncertain haven on the screen of the Strand yesterday. For this is one of those pictures in which some dark and desperate apprehension gnaws at the mind of the strangely badgered hero through a good nine-tenths of it. Something is eating on him—something that goes away back into the misty experiences of his childhood—and neither you nor he can figure what it is. And then, toward the end, the recollection comes to him like a bolt. It is not a very startling revelation but, at least, it clears the mystery—somewhat.Without this explanation, the strange and angry actions which occur through the tortuous wanderings of this drama seem decidedly bewildering and absurd. What's so significant about a fellow—even though he may be a foster-child—finding life slightly oppressive on a primitive New Mexican ranch? Why shouldn't he fall in love with his foster-sister and loathe his foster-brother secretly? Why should he think himself a "killer" just because he shoots a guy in self-defense? And who is that slick and savage character who keeps sticking his nose into other people's affairs, making life miserable for an old lady and urging malice? What's all the shooting about?As we say, without the revelation which comes rather patly at the end, the urgency of these weighty questions is hard to grasp as the picture drones along. And it is likewise hard to work up any sympathy for the hero, who seems bored by all his woes. That may be because Robert Mitchum, who plays the latter, is a very rigid gent and gives off no more animation than a Frigidaire turned to "Defrost." Or it may be because Judith Anderson, Dean Jagger and Teresa Wright, alerted to his saturninity, put on an extra lot of fustian show. But we rather suspect it is simply because Niven Busch, who wrote the original script, tried to write a psychological mystery in a western setting and bungled the job. Raoul Walsh's experienced direction is most effective in the shooting scenes.On the stage at the Strand are Louis Prima and his band, featuring Jack Powers, Cathy Allen and Jimmy Vincent, with Frank Marlowe and Jane Wynn added. PURSUED; original screen play by Niven Busch; directed by Raoul Walsh; a United States Pictures Production, released by Warner Brothers. At the Strand.Thorley Callum . . . . .
