Circumstantial evidence, although one of the most indispensable levers in the complicated machinery of justice, is yet chargeable with the destruction or ruin of many an innocent life.

1008-> MYSTERIES OF EVERYDAY LIFE.
Philoso-  phers are proverbially skin-deep only; as a prominent instance of which I may remark, in relation to the present subject, that the inquiring mind which, some time since, led the writer of "Two o'Clock in the Morning" to investigate the causes why at that particular hour, the clock ticked unusually loud, the Wardrobe creaked, and the bedroom-door opened-of itself, might have still further extended its researches with advantage into the mysteries of everyday life.
