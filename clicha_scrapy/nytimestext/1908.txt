District Attorney Jerome and the police will probably be asked to take a hand in the scandal growing out of the forged letters sent to Senators at Albany who voted for the Governor's race track bills at the regular session, asking them to change their vote.

210-> Article 19 -- No Title
WASHINGTON, D.C., Jan. 9 -- The riding under water tests held in the Potomac this afternoon, was interesting from a spectacular point of view, but it is understood, from a source which has a knack of being about while Loeb is soliloquizing, that the major portion of the glory was won not by the United States Army but by the United States Life Saving Corps. 
--------
211-> SAFEGUARDING WARSHIPS.; English Will Keep Magazines Cool with Refrigerating Plants.
LONDON, Jan. 6. -- Orders have been sent to Portsmouth to rush with all possible speed the work of providing the warships of the British Navy with refrigerating plants, designed to keep down the temperature of the magazines.

213-> "THE THUNDERER'S" CAREER.; For a Century It Has Affected the Policies of Great Britain.
The passing of The London Times, as much a family as a national institution, from the control of Arthur F. Walter to that of Cyril Arthur Pearson, representing what Englishmen seriously believe to be the "American type" of newspaper publication, marks an era in journalism.

Louis Bauduy, a clerk in the Ricketts Realty Company, yesterday afternoon lay on an operating table in Roosevelt Hospital with his wrist bound to the wrist of his brother, John Bauduy in such a way that the pure blood of the one could pass from a cut in his artery into the artery of the other.

218-> "LA HABANERA" --- A NEW OPERA BY A NEW COMPOSER; Spanish, in Character as Its Name Suggests, It Is of an Altogether Different Type from the One Made Famous in "Carmen." With This Tragic Story of Old Spain Raoul Laparra Won the Prix de Rome --- To be Given at the Metropolitan Opera House This Fall.
BECAUSE the locale of "La Habanera" is Spanish and because the name suggests a Spanish dance, a more or less general misconception of this new piece, to be done for the first time in America at the Metropolitan Opera House this season, seems to be abroad in the land.

219-> CROTON WATERSHED NEEDS 1,000,000 TREES; Engineer de Varona Declares Forestry Would Improve City's Water Supply. BUT CAN'T GET MONEY FOR IT Expert Care of Woodlands Would Husband Rainfall and Partially Filter It.
Interest in forestry and the effect it can have upon the water supply is beginning to attract the serious attention of the New York city engineers who have charge of the water supply systems for the metropolis.

LONDON, Oct. 31. -- The nomination of Miss "Councillor" Dove to be Lady Mayor of the Borough of High Wycombe under the Parliamentary act of 1907, which made the election of women councilors, Aldermen, and Mayors possible, has already been announced by cable, but now, by a large majority, her election has actually taken place.

WINNIPEG, Man., Sept. 7. -- The Canadian Pacific Railway Company will put the mechanics who are on strike back to work this week in their old positions on the wage scale agreed upon by the majority report of the Board of Conciliation held in Winnipeg, pending further investigation by a second board on some points now in dispute. 
--------
223-> THE MURDER OF MR. CARMACK.
Murders are frequent enough, in all conscience, in all parts of the United States, but it can hardly be denied that the killing of ex-Senator CARMACK in Nashville is of a sort mainly confined to the Southern States, and that it is directly traceable to a general sentiment which does not exist in the same degree elsewhere. 
--------
224-> BRASS MAKERS HOPEFUL.; Connecticut Mills Report a Substantial Increase in Business.
Charles F. Brooker of the American Brass Company, whose manufacturing connections are credited with being the largest consumers of copper in this country, spoke hopefully yesterday of the outlook, at least among the plants of the Naugatuck Valley, Conn., where his companies are situated. He said:

226-> AN ENGLISHWOMAN ON SOCIETY AT THE OPERA
THE other day a little New York girl asked me to tell her "all about the Covent Garden Opera House in London." I could not tell her "all about it," but I told her a little.

228-> BOWERY'S BAN IS ON CHICAGO SHEATH COAT; "Nix on de Hug-Me Frock" It Votes in Regard to That New Garment. IT WON'T BE DE RIGGER HERE Arguments Pro and Con Heard and Considered at an Alligator Hotel Powwow with This Result.
The Bowery and adjacent territory has heard of the "sheath" coat for men, to be put forward this Winter by Chicago as the coat de rigeur -- pronounced rigger -- for human males who would be well dressed. A canvass of the situation in that section of New York, however, discloses absolute scorn for the production advanced in the City of Wind. 
--------
229-> THE LYDIA THOMPSON EPOCH.
Prudery was shocked in New York, gravity upset, the moralists perplexed and theatrical traditions shaken, in the few years after the close of the civil war, by the production of "The Black Crook" and the advent of both the French opera bouffe and LYDIA THOMPSON with her troupe of British blondes.

IN his tragedy, "The Winterfeast," Mr. Charles Rann Kennedy has conceived and created a notable work, one of fine imaginative and dramatic quality, which though sombre in theme, and occasionally slow in movement, is in the main of such force and eloquence that its defects are of minor importance compared with its great merit. 
--------
232-> MR. ADAMS'S TARIFF CATEGORIES.
Facts heretofore abundantly submitted to the judgment of a candid world and continually in process of further submission thereto, give ample warrant to Mr. CHARLES FRANCIS ADAMS for his classification of the beneficiaries of the Dingley tariff. Those persons who are directly and pecuniarily interested in the tariff, Mr. ADAMS declares, "are either thieves or hogs."

233-> SOME MIDSUMMER PHILOSOPHY BY GEORGE ADE; The Thing That Goes Now Is the "Zippy Show," He Says, the Big Idea or the "Big Picture That Fills the Eye," That "Visualizes" Thought and Emotion. Ibsen Is Out of It, and the New Theatre Scheme Is an "Everyday Intellectual Free Lunch."
WHAT New York wants, and for that matter Chicago, and Boston and perhaps Kokomo, too, is the "zippy show," says George Ade. For this reason it is possible that we have temporarily been deprived of the George Ade play, says the author, because, after writing "The County Chairman" and "The College Widow," he finds himself this season concocting "zippy shows." 
--------
234-> Asked to Pardon Van Schaick.
WASHINGTON, April 16. -- A committee representing the New York Maritime Exchange called upon the President to-day to urge a pardon for Capt. W.S.

Prof. James Earl Russell, Bernard Professor of Education at Columbia University and Dean of the Teachers college, is firm believer in the value of college sports. He recognizes their beneficial influence upon the student life, and it is interesting to note that he is not at all hostile to football, even though it be at the cost of a few sprains, bruises, or even broken bones, but, he insists, it must, be "clean sport." 
--------
239-> SHAM STOCK DEALS, HE SAYS.; Lawyer Thinks Coster, Knapp & Co. Had Many Fictitious Transactions.

Olney at 68 William Street. 
--------
240-> THE NEW BANK STATEMENT.
Yesterday is a new dating point for our bankers, comparable only to the establishment of the Clearing House. For the first time since trust companies became competitors with banks we have a statement including the conditions of all financial institutions, and, therefore, as representative as the Clearing House statement was before President NASH, addressing the Clearing House, described it as a "farce," and "unworthy of quotation as an indication of business in our line."

243-> CHRISTENDOM'S CHAMPIONS IN MACEDONIA; Each of the European Powers Wants to Improve the Situation in the Balkans, but in a Way to Help Their Own Interests. Instead of Devoting Their Energies to Their Humanitarian Mission They Are Occupied in Quarreling Over Railway Concessions.
EVERY Spring when the sparks fly upward and the geese and the blackbirds wend their way north, there is sure to be warlike news from the Balkans, and generally when the Winter loosens its grip upon the snow-clad mountains, there is war, the little war or guerrilla, which is fought outside of the rules of the game which peace conferences have as yet not succeeded in suppressing.

244-> HUGHES'S WESTERN TRIP.; To Leave Chicago Sunday for a Whole Week of Campaigning.
CHICAGO, Oct. 2. -- The itinerary of Gov. Hughes through the West and Northwest was made public in detail at Republican National Headquarters to-day.

250-> ROOSEVELT STANDS BY CUPID.; Permits Lieut. Brooks to Resign to Avoid Separation from Bride.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 8. -- President Roosevelt to-day decided to yield to the entreaties of Lieut.

When the Special Grand Jury which has been investigating the American Ice Company, under the direction of Deputy Attorney General James W.

--------
257-> IN THE REAL ESTATE FIELD
Little to relieve a midsummer market or to give it any appearance of activity has come to the surface within the last week. Deals for properties on Lafayette and Centre Streets, the sale of an apartment house at Lexington Avenue and Thirty-fourth Street to an adjoining owner, and a transaction involving a group of apartment houses on Morningside Heights were about the only noticeable departures from business of routine character.

258-> LABOR'S BIG SHARE IN RAILWAY PROFITS; $71 Out of Every $100 Earned Last Year Went to Workers or for Labor-Made Material. 4% FOR SHAREHOLDERS About the Same for Bondholders -- Estimates Made by Vice President Brown of the N.Y. Central.
What became of the $2,585,913,000 gross earnings of the railroads of this country last year is a question which W.C.

The next pickpocket who goes into the Court of Special Sessions as a prisoner may as well know that the most portly of the three Justices is Lorenz A. Zeller. If he be a prisoner he should concentrate all his mind waves on that Justice.

ALBANY, March 5. -- It is expected that the Codes Committee of the Assembly, at its next meeting, will report favorably the Race Track Gambling bills.

--------
270-> EXPECT BETTER SPEED FROM CUNARD LINERS; Lusitania and Mauretania May Develop 27 Knots an Hour. PROPELLER PITCH CHANGED Moderate Speeds Developed So Far Thought to be Due in Part to the Desire to Save Coal.
The statement credited to the Cunard Line officials at Liverpool previous to the departure of the Lusitania last Saturday that the pitch of her propellers had been readjusted, and in consequence the engineers expected her to average 27 knots an hour on her westward passage, has created interest in engineering circles on both sides of the Atlantic. 
--------
271-> The Career of a Journalist.
I have just finished reading William Salisburry's "The Career of a Journalist," and I want to register my appreciation of the book. The more or less unfavorable reviews this book has received in THE NEW YORK TIMES, The New York Evening Post, and other daily papers led me to anticipate a sort of "yellow account of yellow jurnalism," "The Career of a Journalist" does treat of yellow journalism, but not in a yellow manner. 
--------
272-> A NOVELIST COPIES HIS OWN HERO.
The following letter has been received by his publishers, Doubleday, Page  Co., from Eugene P. Lyle, Jr., author of "The Lone Star": 
--------
273-> FINANCIAL MARKETS; Stocks, More Active, Move Irregularly -- Call Money Rates, 1@1 1/4 Per Cent. THE TRADING PROFESSIONAL Public's Share In Market Greatly Reduced -- July Foreign Trade Figures.
Trading on the Stock Exchange yesterday was in larger volume than on Monday, and the range in most of the active stocks amounted to between 2 and 3 points. Prices, however, moved backward and forward meaninglessly during the day, and at the close the net changes were in most cases disproportionate to the fluctuations which had occurred between the opening and closing of the market. 
--------
274-> TRAINING FOR FARMERS.
President HILL of the Great Northern is a little loose in his calculation that $5,000 will "build" an agricultural school and that the cost of a battleship will maintain a thousand of such schools. But his notion of the relative value of the two expenditures is not far out of the way. 
--------
275-> New York Has a Hatband Town -- Who Knows Where It Is?; It Is a Distinctive Feature of the City and in It Live the Students of New York University, Enjoying a Life of Their Own.
IN addition to having its Little Italy, Syrian quarter, Ghetto, and Chinatown, New York -- the all capacious -- now has also a Hatband Town within its boundaries. And its dwellers, although chiefly young Americans, quite like those to be seen in banks and offices, are as clearly differentiated by their headgear as the Celestial New Yorkers are set apart from their neighboring congerers by their pigtails and queer robes.

276-> THE LAST EMPRESS AND HER COURT; Eugenie of France and Her Life Tragedy -- Current Gossip in the Days of Napoleon the Third.
MR. SERGEANT'S handsome volume, "The Last Empress of the French,"* contains two portraits which significantly epitomize the life of a remarkable woman. The first -- an elaborate painting by Winterhalter -- pictures a young and beautiful woman, regally gowned; behind her is a vista of the Tuileries. 
--------
277-> English as a Universal Language.
I find in the REVIEW, Aug. 1, a communication from Arcadius Avellanus, advocating the use of Latin as the universal language. The arguments advanced in this communication seem to me, cogent and unanswerable. We have the universal language, made for us thousands of years ago, and why not use it, instead of concocting a toy language fit only for goblins? 
--------
278-> MAY ASK HUGHES TO DECLINE TO RUN; Republican State Executive Committee Said to be Ready to Consider This Step. TO HOLD MEETING TO-DAY Parsons and Woodruff to See Roosevelt Again Before Convention -- Talk of Cortelyou Revived.
While the question of Gov. Hughes's renomination is not on the official schedule for the meeting of the Executive Committee of the Republican State Committee called for to-day, there is every likelihood that this will be the all-absorbing topic of discussion. Late last night there was a report that a resolution might be introduced calling upon the Governor to withdraw in the interest of party harmony.

This prediction he based on the fact that the conservative Republican Party represents the capitalist class, while the radical Socialist Party represents the working class. 
--------
500-> SCHOOL REPAIRS DELAYED.; 35,000 Additional Pupils Likely to be on Part Time -- Metz Is Blamed.
Unless work on the equipment of new buildings is rushed with all speed it is estimated that at the opening of the coming public school session next month more than 35,000 children, in addition to those already on part time, will have their school privileges curtailed. 
--------
501-> TWO CASES IN POINT.
The first business day of the new year contrasts strikingly with many hopeful forecasts based upon belief that the situation would be allowed to work itself out along normal lines. These forecasts were published concurrently with notice that the Federal Administration was contemplating another Northern Securities prosecution against Mr. HARRIMAN'S roads, and that a leading Southern railway had succumbed to adverse conditions, among which State legislation was prominent. 
--------
502-> TOPICS OF THE TIMES.
When men in the anger and humiliation of defeat explain it by charging unfairness against their successful competitors, nobody pays much attention to them. Unless they have particularly good evidence to present, their stories are dismissed with derision or contempt as the empty imaginings of "bad losers." 
--------
503-> OPERA DIRECTOR BARRED OUT.; New Doorkeeper at the Metropolitan Didn't Know H.R. Winthrop.
H.R. Winthrop, one of the Directors of the Conried Metropolitan Opera Company, was stopped when he sought admission to the opera house last night after the second act of "Madame Butterfly," and for a time it seemed doubtful if he would hear the last act. A new doorkeeper and Mr. Winthrop's failure to take a pass-out check were responsible for the trouble. 
--------
504-> DALY SCORES IN "THE REGENERATION"; Enthusiastic Audience Greets Him in His New Play at Wallack's. FLASHES OF MELODRAMA Text of the Production Deals with the Reclamation of a Leading Figure in Thieves' Den.
Arnold Daly opened his season at Wallack's Theatre last night in "The Regeneration;" a new play on New York settlement work by Owen Kildare and Walter Hackett. Judging by the many rounds of applause he and his company received and the numerous curtain calls he was compelled to answer, he scored a success and his play bids fair to have a long run. 
--------
505-> THE EMPLOYERS'S LIABILITY DECISION.
A bad law for a good purpose. That is practically the judgment of a majority of the Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States as to the National law fixing the liability of employers engaged in Inter-State commerce. No one will dispute that the general purpose of the law was good in the sense that it was humane, though there is room for difference of opinion as to its efficiency and expediency. 
--------
506-> BUSINESS MEN VOTE FOR SHIP SUBSIDY; Chamber of Commerce Accepts Committee Report, with Some Dissenting Voices. NEW OFFICERS ARE CHOSEN President Nash of the Corn Exchange Bank Made Chairman of the Committee on Finance.

TRENTON, Aug. 9. -- The Mercer County Automobile Club has voted to give to the county two carloads of oil for sprinkling roads so as to suppress the dust nuisance. 
--------
509-> TOPICS OF THE TIMES.
Laws against vivisection, hitherto, have always been proposed by persons who from gross ignorance or exaggerated sentimentalism have seen nothing in the practice except the infliction of pain upon animals, and the medical profession and other scientists have contented themselves with opposing the passage of such laws or with securing such mitigation of their restrictions as they could persuade legislators to grant. 
--------
510-> PARKER PREDICTS BRYAN.; Bases His Prophecy on Talks with Many Republicans.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Aug. 28. -- "I believe that Bryan will be elected this time," said Alton B. Parker, the Democratic nominee of four years ago this evening. He was on the way home from a two months' tour through the Western States. 
--------
511-> BOSTON COPPER GOSSIP.; Boom in Coppers Thought to be at Its Top -- Field Notes.
BOSTON, Aug. 9. -- Boston speculators have been enjoying an old-fashioned copper market. The street is now filled with most extravagant predictions concerning dividends and prices which stocks are to reach, which leads some of the wise ones to believe that the culmination of the present movement is not far away. 
--------
512-> HURRICANE LASHES THE COLON.; Three of Crew Are Killed by Gases in Panama Steamship's Hold.
COLON, Sept. 18. -- The steamship Colon, half-masted and showing other evidences of distress, came limping into port early this morning. She had been badly bat tered by the hurricane encountered Sunday noon. Three members of her crew lost their lives while engaged in the hold in repairing a water tank.

513-> THE NOVELS OF LEONARD MERRICK.; Introducing the Work of a Man Who Knows Life in Various Aspects -- A Realist with a Poet's Mind -- Hardship and Struggle Without Bitterness -- Sketch of the Novelist's Life and of a Few of His Characters.
IN attempting to set forth a few reasons why the still comparatively unknown novels of Leonard Merrick should be read by women and men who seek in fiction not only a means of relaxation, but spiritual comfort as well, and an uplifting rather than a mere diversion of the mind, there is no vain idea of introducing Mr. Merrick by name to American readers. 
--------
514-> COLLEGE FENCING HONORS.; West Point, Annapolis, Columbia, and Cornell Qualify for Finals.
Six college teams gave an excellent exhibition of spirited fencing last night in the gymnasium of the New York Athletic Club, the competition marking the preliminary bouts in the annual intercollegiate fencing championship. The teams were divided into three squads of six men each, and the two teams securing the lowest number of victories were eliminated. 
--------
515-> THE MAGAZINES FOR APRIL.; Growing Popularity of Articles of a Reminiscent Character Shown in the Month's Issues -- Important Personalities in the Coming Campaign -- Lists of Contents.
THOSE who have adopted the somewhat depressing theory that mental activity reaches its height at the age of 40, and from that period steadily declines, should read an article in the April Century by W.A. Newman Dorland on "The Age of Mental Virility." 
--------
516-> MIDDIES BACK THEIR TEAM.; Cadet Battalion Raises $2,500 to Cover West Point Money.
ANNAPOLIS, Md., Nov. 26. -- After a lengthy signal practice this afternoon, the last preparation at Annapolis for the Naval Academy team for the game on Saturday was completed and the team is now in as good shape as possible to meet the representatives of West Point Military Academy on Franklin Field.

Ou diable le "cant" de l'axt va-t-il se nicher ? 
--------
518-> NEW ENGLAND'S OBSERVANCE.; Boston Half Deserted by Rush of Thousands to Their Old Homes.
BOSTON, Nov. 26. -- There was little formal observance of Thanksgiving Day in New England this year, but more than ever it was a day of family gatherings in the old homes. The rush of thousands yesterday and last night into the country left Boston a half deserted city to-day. Thanksgiving services were held in some of the churches, however, and charitable organizations provided the poor with some cause for giving thanks. 
--------
519-> ILLUSTRATIONS ON VIEW.; Freedom of Modern Methods Shown at Salmagundi Club.
The exhibition of illustrations at the Salmagundi Club, 14 West Twelfth Street, clearly demonstrates the comparative freedom of the modern illustrator from hampering conventions. In the majority of work done for reproduction the convention of conceiving the illustration as a part of the page decoration, for example, does not exist. 
--------
520-> MRS. COPLEY THAW ARRIVES.; Former Countess of Yarmouth a Passenger on the Adriatic.
Craig Wadsworth, Second Secretary of the American Embassy at London, arrived here to-day on the Adriatic from Europe.

521-> Market Effect of Last Week's $5,000,000 Trade; Pittsburgh Capitalist's Purchases of the Sort to Attract Other Large Investors --- Properties Acquired by Mr. Du Puy Within a Year.
In all the comment which has followed the announcement of the recent large purchases in this city by Herbert Du Puy of Pittsburg one fact stands out as worthy of considerable attention, that is the character of the properties acquired by Mr. Du Puy. 
--------

--------
526-> A VIGILANCE COMMITTEE.
Many millions of sober, industrious, law-abiding, and conscientious citizens are recurrently troubled about their personal responsibility for misgovernment. They see the grafters organized, their methods successful. These good citizens do not attend the party primaries; they have nothing to say about the candidates for whom they vote. 
--------
527-> NOW THE "TUBE WOMAN."; Latest Development of Directoire Style Makes Her Look Like a Stovepipe.
PARIS, Dec. 5. -- The revolution gradually brought about in woman's dress as a result of the Directoire craze is producing some curious consequences. The dress designers and makers, after having gradually brought about what they describe as a straight line in front, have now directed their attention to the back portion of the fashionable attire, and the decree has gone forth that the straight line, both front and back, is to prevail this Winter. 
--------
528-> VIVISECTION AND LIFE SAVING.; Restrictions Would Stop the Work of the Rockefeller Institute.
I have read in your paper this morning the account of the meeting held at Carnegie Hall by the Anti-Vivisection Society and the resolutions passed demanding the suppression of experiments at the Rockefeller Institute; for the restrictions which the society demands would result in the suppression of much of the work of that institute. 
--------
529-> UTILITIES BOARD SUES B.R.T.; Asks $2,400 for Company's Failure to Keep Wrecking Car at Bridge.
The public Service Commission, for the first time in its history, instructed its counsel yesterday to begin suit to collect the penalty provided for by the Public Service Commission's act for failure to obey an order of the commission.

--------
530-> TIMES ART WORK PRAISED.; English Publishers Say Its Christmas Supplement Could Not Be Surpassed.
LONDON, Dec. 26. -- Although it is not customary for THE NEW YORK TIMES to blow its own trumpet, I may be allowed to say that the art section of the Christmas edition, which reached London this week, attracted considerable attention in the English capital. Artists and editors of illustrated papers and others are unanimous in saying that THE TIMES has produced an illustrated paper which stands distinctly alone in its excellence of artistic workmanship. 
--------
531-> DEAR AND UNNECESSARY.
One of the last acts of the Assembly was to pass Senator AGNEW'S bill "authorizing the Board of Estimate to appropriate $75,000" for the Harbor Pollution Commission. This is a misleading statement of the contents of the bill, as the appropriation is "not to exceed $75,000 in any one year," and the life of the Commission is extended to 1910. 
--------
532-> TRIED TO KILL WIFE IN MINISTER'S HOME; Reiss Throttled and Beat Her with Pistol Butt After His Bullet Went Wide. HE KIDNAPPED HER ONCE She Had Left Him Because He Drank and Went to Her Sister, the Wife of a Bronx Clergyman.

--------
533-> REMINISCENCES BY MUSIC CRITIC; George Upton's Recollections of Artists and Celebrities of a Half Century -- Jenny Lind as a Child.
MR. UPTON has occupied a foremost place in the musical journalism of Chicago for a time long enough to cover almost the entire musical experience of the Western metropolis. He declares, in fact, that he wrote "the first musical criticism printed in a Chicago newspaper." 
--------
534-> LAUGH AT LILLEY'S ANSWERS.; Committee May Recommend Action Against Representative.
WASHINGTON, April 24. -- Representative George L. Lilley again was a witness before the House Special Investigating Committee to-day. Many of the questions asked by the committee were of an editorial nature showing clearly the committee's conviction that Mr. Lilley's evidence was lacking in consistency. 
--------
535-> A MERE BOGY.
Little Orphant Annie is abroad again and the theme of her blood-curdling tales now is burial alive. Either the goblins have got the Massachusetts Legislature, or the seed sown by a pseudo-scientific article printed in one of the English reviews last Summer has blossomed in the State House on Beacon Hill. 
--------
536-> RUSSIANS CRUSH KURDISH TRIBESMEN; Rout Them in a Hard Fight and Then Destroy Three Villages. PERSIAN FORCE GATHERING Shah's Government Protests Against the Russian Invasion -- Flood Holds Back Czar's Troops.

--------
537-> FIND USE FOR APPENDIX.; Abused Organ Employed as Tube to Convey Medicine to Lower Intestine.
LONDON, Dec. 18. -- The vermiform appendix, which has been looked upon hitherto as a useless and even dangerous organ, has at last justified its existence, according to a statement made by the surgeon of a London hospital, where the appendix has been shown to be a great help in treating diseases of the lower intestine. 
--------
538-> BAN ON LONGBOAT WEDDING.; Anglican Clergymen Not to Perform Ceremony -- Conversion Too Sudden
TORONTO, Ont., Dec. 26. -- Tom Longboat, world's champion Marathon runner, and Miss Lauretta Maracie, the Indian school teacher, will not be married by a Protestant Episcopal clergyman in Massey Hall next Monday night, according to programme.

Creeggan of Deseronto, who is in charge of the reservation where Longboat met Miss Maracie, and who was scheduled to perform the ceremony, intimating that he must not do so. 
--------
539-> THE REAL ROOSEVELT.
Every man in the country with opinions to express and the capacity to express them has given his judgment of Mr. ROOSEVELT. The judgments are about as diverse as the characters of those who give them. The most interesting opinion of all would certainly be Mr. ROOSEVELT'S opinion of himself. 
--------
540-> THE FINANCIAL SITUATION.; Gloom Lifting in Wall Street -- The Money Position.
By stagnation and a narrow movement of prices the securities market reflected last week the uncertainty which still exists not only in Wall Street, but through trade circles, regarding the immediate future. It is worth noting, however, that while the week brought to light a number of matters unfavorable in character, their effect upon stocks was hardly appreciable. 
--------
541-> CHURCH BARS BRIDGE MONEY.; Stops Plan for Players to Contribute Part of Their Winnings.
LONDON, Dec. 5. -- A great commotion has been created in those circles (they still exist in England) where card playing is looked upon as an invention of the evil one by an appeal issued to bridge players to contribute a portion of their winnings to the fund for building an extra aisle in a Winchester church. 
--------
542-> PROTECT NEW YORK SCHOOLS.; Commissioner Draper Orders an Examination of School Safeguards.
ALBANY, N.Y., March 6. -- Commissioner A.S.

--------
543-> GIANTS HUMBLE PHILLIES.; Three Pitchers All Look Alike to New York National Batters. Wilhelm Baffles Boston.
PHILADELPHIA, Penn., April 17. -- New York easily defeated the home team to-day. All of the three pitchers tried by the Phillies were hit hard, while numerous errors and bad judgment were made behind them. Second Baseman Doyle of New York had his leg hurt in practice and was carried off the field. The score: 
--------
544-> KNOX -- THE MAN WHO WILL BE THE NEXT SECRETARY OF STATE; Elusive Personality Described as a "Triumph of Sanity." A Lawyer Whose Diplomatic Skill No One Doubts.
WHEN the State Department and the Senate swap Elihu Root and Philander C. Knox next March it will be about an even break; neither branch of the Government will have to give anything "to boot." Both are great lawyers, and very much the same kind of lawyers. 
--------
545-> A Contributor Finds Occasion for Saying Nice Things.
Your editorial in this morning's issue, "Letters to the Editor," I read with a great deal of pleasure, for it settled, in a way at least, one or two slight difficulties I had had, and gives me a chance to pay you a deserved tribute. 
--------

The publication within the last fortnight of the August statements of several leading railroad systems showing decided improvement over previous reports not only in net but also in gross earnings, emphasized the fact that a number of railroads, particularly in the West, have recently made important strides toward a return to the heavy gross earnings which were being shown last year. 
--------
547-> DEMAND LOANS.; Oriental Bank Held $2,500,000 Such Loans -- Were Not Call Loans.
In the report of the Oriental Bank issued on Saturday by the State Banking Department there was shown as of Jan. 30, the day on which the Oriental Bank suspended, demand loans amounting to $2,575,168. This item caused considerable comment, inasmuch as it would appear that the suspension of the institution might have been prevented by the calling in of demand loans which amounted to about half the total deposits held by the bank. 
--------
548-> MONEY STILL EASY IN LONDON.; Americans Have Been Brightest Feature of Past Week.
LONDON, Oct. 25. -- The announcement of the issue of Treasury bills hardened the money market at the close of the week, and exactly what effect the payments which must be made for them to-morrow will have is awaited in Throgmorton Street with keen interest. 
--------
549-> THE FINANCIAL SITUATION -- THE MARKETS OF EUROPE.; THE FINANCIAL SITUATION. Improvement in Business and Ease in Money Features.
Foreign markets continued to pay last week some little deference to the Balkan situation as a possible source of further disturbance to financial affairs, but their recognition of its continued presence was negative rather than positive, and as it led to no renewal of the liquidation of American securities in this market the Stock Exchange turned to other matters for inspiration. 
--------
550-> CLEVELAND AND BRYAN.(7); Discussion of the Late President's Letter to Col. Reeve.
The troubles of THE NEW YORK TIMES in making the late Mr. Cleveland speak effectively in this campaign do not daunt it in the least. On the morning after the arrest of Mr. Brandenburg, charged with selling to THE TIMES a spurious article on the Presidential contest by the ex-President, that resourceful newspaper printed an undoubtedly authentic letter, somewhat over two years old, which Mr. Cleveland wrote to a Federal official in Washington.

--------
554-> Rich and Poor Meet At Night School.; Immense Army of Men and Women Study Every Evening After Business Hours.
THE metropolis has a great army of civilians that is drilling, drilling, drilling every night through the Winter -- an army over twice as large as the enlisted strength of the army of the United States to-day. It is a great force constantly growing and recruiting its ranks to defend the city against the incursions of the barbarian hordes of ignorance and mental decay and inefficiency. 
--------
555-> EVIL THOUGHTS OF SIRTORI.; Has Never Seen Such Roads Before -- He Expects Success.
GENEVA, N.Y., Feb. 15. -- Do you ask me to write what I think of my journey from New York so far? That is impossible in a telegram, because my heart is full of evil thoughts about the men who make the roads. In Italy our automobile clubs would have made all good and piloted the contestants through the bad spots and cheered them on their way.

557-> LOOKING INTO THE FUTURE OF THE PHILIPPINES; Plain Presentation of facts Showing That Before Long Americans Will Realize That So-called Philippine Problem Is Only a Bogey Man.
MANILA, Dec. 30. -- Of the conditions which retard progress in the Philippines, the agitation which tends to create uncertainty about their political stability and status, such as suggestions to sell or trade the islands, is probably the most detrimental. 
--------
558-> CLEVELAND FOREST RESERVE.; President Roosevelt Names One for President Who Started Them.
WASHINGTON, July 12. -President Roosevelt has ordered that the San Jacinto forest in California shall be named Cleveland National Forest, in honor of the late President.

PARIS, Aug. 15. -- Upon no commercial field in France has the recent financial depression in America had so disastrous an effect as upon the silk manufacturers at Lyons.

TWO little hills have been discovered in Sioux County, Nebraska, which scientists consider such an extraordinary index to life in the remote past that a number of the important museums have stake them out, just as prospectors would stake out a mining claim. Each of these museums has allotted to itself a section of these hills, and has been busy disinterring from them the remarkable deposits of prehistoric fossils which they contain.

PHILADELPHIA, June 12. -- Mrs. Aubrey Le Blond, who is as well known among artistic photographers for the rarity and beauty of her mountain pictures a she is among readers as an accomplished author and daring mountain climber, has completed a book on "Mountaineering in the Land of the Midnight Sun," which the Lippincotts will bring out in the early Fall. 
--------
725-> DROP IN FRENCH RENTES; Follows Vote of Chamber of Deputies -- Market Otherwise Is Strong.
PARIS, May 31. -- The event of the week on the Bourse was the fall of French rentes. The vote of the Chamber of Deputies rendering the coupons of the national debt liable to the income tax was not wholly expected. This fact rendered the reaction all the sharper, not only to speculators, but to investors who sold rentes heavily and doubtless will continue to do so. 
--------
726-> KITTY WILKES IN FORM.; William Scott's Speedy Mare Wins in Hot Speedway Brushes.
Much to the surprise of the many light harness horsemen who take part in the Sunday brushing on the Speedway, the footing yesterday was fairly good considering the recent heavy rains, especially that of Saturday. The warm, clear weather brought out a goodly number of amateur reinsmen, and a big crowd of interested spectators watched the sport at the finish of the half-mile stretch. 
--------
727-> SUMMER BOOKS.; THE ANCIENT LAND OF THE CAESARS. THE PASSER-BY IN LONDON.
THERE is no lack of readable reading this Summer. The annotated list which occupies so much of this number of THE NEW YORK TIMES SATURDAY REVIEW makes that clear. It has been easily possible to recommend one hundred publications of the season -- it would have been easier to have recommended twice the number -- as well worth the attention which is accorded books in the Summer. 
--------
728-> A PORTRAIT PAINTER OF REAL WOMEN.; An Inquiry Into the Humanity and Femininity of Thomas Hardy's Heroines -- They Are Not Clever, but They Are Women, and Are Often Captivating -- Chiefly Concern Themselves with the Business of Loving and Being Loved.
WHEN all is said and done and the truth told," says Thomas Hardy in his story of Lady Mottisfont, one of the "Group of Noble Dames," "men seldom show much self-sacrifice in their conduct as lords and masters to helpless women bound to them for life." 
--------
729-> PLAY OF "HAMLET" AND ITS GENESIS; Prof. Lewis Holds Shakespeare Tragedy a Conglomerate -- Not a Proper Subject for Logical Analysis.*
THE method employed in this book is suggestive of the process of qualitative analysis in the chemical laboratory. The author, acknowledging the commonly accepted notion that the tragedy of "Hamlet" is not wholly Shakespeare's, likens it to a late reconstruction of an early mediaeval cathedral, wherein the aspiring design of a great Gothic architect is hut half distinguishable among the uncouth piers and arches of his Saxon and Norman predecessors. 
--------
730-> TREASURY BOOKKEEPING.
Not long ago Secretary CORTELYOU was pointing out the advantages of a division of the Treasury accounts into ordinary and extraordinary, with a view of making the ordinary accounts balance. We now have an example in the Russian manner, which shows a surplus of $37,000,000 in the ordinary revenue. 
--------
731-> ENTERTAINING AT LENOX.
LENOX, Mass., July 12. -- Several white birch trees, which have been much admired by visitors to Lenox on Stoneover, the estate owned by John E. Parsons of New York, have been denuded of their bark by vandals driving through the estate, which has always been open to the public. 
--------
732-> STAGE FOLK.; "Good Circuits" and the Chance of Leisure in Carnegie Libraries.
I read with a considerable amount of interest in last Sunday's issue an article contribute to your paper under the heading of "An Actor's Tribute," by Eileen Errol. Her expressions of gratitude to Mr. Andrew Carnegie for placing in the way of traveling stage folk so many blessings in the shape of public libraries are, I suppose, heartily shared by many of her brothers and sister in the profession. 
--------
733-> CORTELYOU CALLS $45,000,000; National Bank Depositaries Must Pay Sum Into Treasury.
WASHINGTON, July 2. -- Secretary of the Treasury Cortelyou to-day announced a further call upon the National bank depositaries for approximately $45,000,000, to be paid on or before the 15th inst. 
--------
734-> MR. AHEARN'S CASE.
Borough President AHEARN was removed by the Governor for official neglect and misconduct. The Aldermen of Manhattan, in electing a successor, chose Mr. AHEARN. Supreme Court Justice McCALL now decides that the reseating of AHEARN is valid, though it nullifies the effect of the law relating to removals of Borough Presidents. 
--------
735-> DOUBLE DEFEAT FOR YANKEE TEAM; Similar Fate for Washington Saves the New Yorks from Last Place. TIGERS NOW AT THEIR BEST Donovan Wins His Ninth Straight Game -- Shakeup in Local Batting Order Brings Poor Results.
Kid Elberfeld shook up his batting order yesterday, and sent Newton and Manning in to pitch the first game, and the Tiger people from Detroit beat us by the score of 8 to 3. But in the second game -- ah, in the second game our manager came to the front with Lace in the pitching point, and it was quite different, for the Tiger people beat us only 11 to 4. 
--------
736-> WOULD COMMUTE ON AN AIRSHIP; Practicable Now to Come Into Town by Aeroplane, Says A.M. Herring. HARD TO ALIGHT IN TOWN But in Open Country, He Contends, It Will Soon Be Easy to Make Long Flights.
A.M. Herring and Capt. Thomas S. Baldwin, both of whom are building airships for the United States Government, the former an aeroplane and the latter a dirigible balloon, expressed keen interest yesterday in the recent remarkable flight of twelve hours over Switzerland by Count Zeppelin in his dirigible airship, carrying fourteen men.

--------
738-> TOPICS IN WALL STREET.; Checking the Advance.
No one appeared to be satisfied with the result of yesterday's trading, to judge by the expressions of opinion in brokers' offices after the close of the market. The enthusiastic bullish contingent chafed at the check to the upward movement, professing to believe that technical conditions and the fundamentals alike should have induced a continuance of the advance. 
--------
739-> YOUNG MR. WILLETS EXPLAINS; And the ex-Actress Stays at the Bevan -- Father Not Yet Told.
LARCHMONT, July 7. -- Samuel Willets, Master of the Meadow Brook Hounds, who, as told in yesterday's TIMES, denied that Amber Lawlor, the former actress, was his wife, although the young woman had registered at the Hotel Bevan here as Mrs. Samuel Willets, drove up to the hotel early this evening in his automobile.

740-> CRANDALL WEAKENS NEAR END; The Cincinnatis Forged Ahead and Win from New York.
CINCINNATI, July 7. -- After being almost hopelessly in the rear for two-thirds of to-day's game, the locals spurted in the seventh and eighth innings and defeated New York by the score of 4 to 3. Crandall pitched splendid ball for the visitors up to the time he weakened. 
--------
741-> ONLY ONE VICTIM.
Of the recent stern uprising in this city against Sunday entertainments there has only one victim, namely, the Children's Theatre of the Educational Alliance. On the lower east side, in a neighborhood largely populated by Jews, this commendable institution has given plays on Sunday, the only day these people, old and young, can spare for entertainment. 
--------
742-> ART AND THE CUSTOMS.
Of course, the general belief of intelligent persons throughout this country that the duty on works of art imported from foreign countries is inconsistent, admittedly useless as "protection" to American industries, and of small value as revenue, does not excuse the smuggling of such works while the law is in force. 
--------
743-> HUMAN CROSS-CURRENTS.
There is always coming and going on the ocean, but the connection with commerce was more clearly revealed last year than ever before. Naturally this is not looked for in the cabin movement so much as in the steerage, for the cabin movement, although stimulated by prosperity, is less affected by reactions. 
--------
744-> BOARD STANDS BY COAL SAVING PLAN; Oxalic Acid Solution Has Already Worked Wonders, a Committeeman Avers. 10 TO 70 PER CENT. SAVED Chairman Barrett Says No Request Has Been Made for More Money, Though More Coal Will Be Needed.
Although most other persons having a knowledge of chemistry laugh at the Board of Education's idea that it can save "thousands of dollars" by mixing oxalic acid and salt with the ashes in the schools and burning the mixture as a substitute for coal, the Board's Committee on Supplies is standing firmly by the ash-burning notion.

745-> Dartmouth Loses Hockey Match.; Columbia's Fencing Schedule.

The New York Clearing House at a special meeting of the association adopted yesterday an amendment to its constitution providing for the admission of trust companies to full membership in the association providing they maintain the same reserve as the banks, namely, 25 per cent. of their deposits in cash. 
--------
748-> OUR NATIONAL HIDDEN RESERVES.
The City Bank lends the weight of its monthly circular to the observation hitherto made by many that country banks hoarded an "undue" amount of cash during our recent crisis. According to the reports to the Controller, National banks located outside the reserve cities held $103,700,000 above their legal requirement, while the reserve city banks were $35,900,000 below their requirements, having weakened themselves to oversupply those who were in no need of assistance.

749-> HUDSPETH TO RUN BRYAN'S FIGHT HERE; National Chairman Mack Names Jersey Man for His Manager in the East. FULL LIST OF ASSISTANTS Former Gold Democrats on the Committee to Help the Democrats Here.
Judge Robert S. Hudspeth, who until yesterday was Chairman of the Democratic State Central Committee of New Jersey, will be the active manager of the Bryan campaign in the East. Norman E.

PORTLAND, Ore., Sept. 8. -- A package intrusted to the care of the Wells-Fargo Express Company at Salem, Ore., by J.R. Albert, President of the Capital National Bank of that city, and addressed to Joseph M. Meyers at the Portland Hotel in this city, containing notes and other valuable papers representing over $50,000, is strangely missing. 
--------
751-> WALL STREET PURGES ITSELF.
The punishment of the members of the Stock Exchange who falsified the public market for securities falls upon them within a month of their fault, and at the hands of their associates. Its swiftness and completeness leave nothing to be desired. They are condemned by a jury of their peers of offenses which easily might have escaped legal punishment. 
--------
752-> BLANCHE BATES'S NEW PLAY.; It's "The Fighting Hope," by William J. Hurlbut, a New Author.
The name of the new play in which Blanche Bates is to appear this season at the Stuyvesant Theatre, under the management of David Belasco, is "The Fighting Hope," and it is not by David Belasco. The author is William J. Hurlbut, an entirely new figure in the dramatic world.

753-> FRENCH PAYMENTS HELD UP.; Result of Forbidding Brazilian Charge to Look After French Interests.
CARACAS, Sept. 2. -- President Castro's refusal to permit the Brazilian Charge d'Affaires, Senor Lorena Perreira, to assume charge of French interests in Venezuela, added more fuel to the smoldering fire of Venezuela's international complications, and speculation is still rife in Caracas as to whether or not Brazil will look upon this action as an insult directed at her, and what France will do toward getting representation here for her interests after this rebuke. 
--------
754-> STILL FIGHT HUGHES DESPITE PRESIDENT; Woodruff Says Convention Alone Will Decide Who Shall Run for Governor. PARSONS MAY CONTROL New York County Delegation Likely to Hold Balance of Power at Saratoga -- May Go Uninstructed.
Despite the declaration of President Roosevelt, given to the public on Tuesday last by Silas McBee, editor of The Churchman, and confirmed yesterday by Republican National Committeeman William L. Ward, that the President regards the renomination of Gov. Hughes essential to Republican success at the polls, the leaders at Republican State headquarters are still endeavoring to encompass the Governor's defeat at Saratoga. 
--------
755-> PUBLIC UTILITIES AND STATUTE LAW; Statesmanlike Discussion of the Tendencies of Modern Legislation on an Important Subject.
THIS is one of those books in sheep whose covers give the non-legal reader a weariness akin to pain. The reason for mentioning this book here is that it is different, in a respect that will be stated after its value to the legal practitioner has been mentioned. 
--------
756-> SOCIAL MYSTERIES.
Complications similar to that which now involves the family of Senator ELKINS and the royal house of Italy have frequently occurred in society since man abandoned the good old practice of choosing a mate by knocking a neighbor's daughter on the head and bearing her off to his cave. 
--------
757-> TUBERCULOSIS EXHIBIT OPEN.; Private View Given and Public Will Be Admitted To-morrow.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 19. -- The unfinished exhibition of the International Congress on Tuberculosis was opened to a private view for a few hours this afternoon for the benefit of invited guests.

There is little chance that President Roosevelt will end his career in the jungle as the victim of a man-eating lion or a charging rhinoceros in the belief of his old friend John Burroughs, the poet and naturalist.

CHEF HIPPOLYTE BONNEFOUX of the Plaza has ideas of his own about carving the National bird. He may not have learned the knack in sunny France; he may even have received some tips from Steward Pike, but nevertheless he can slip a sharp knife between the complicated tendons or through knotty joints with an ease that would make the average paterfamilias green with jealously and drive to despair the inexperienced young husband.

ALBANY, March 18. -- Senator Saxe, when his attention was called to-night to the letter given out by Attorney General Jackson, said:

WASHINGTON, April 18. -- Disappointment black as Egyptian night rests over the Taft headquarters to-night. Frank H. Hitchcock, manager of the Secretary of War's boom, refuses to be comforted.

tory prohibition has been failure, contempt tory prohibition has been failure, contempt for law and the accentuation of other immoralities even more destructive in their effect upon society.

It acts as a constant menace to the saloon's license and is, in all respects, the best incentive to the enforcement of law ever found.

789-> TOPICS IN WALL STREET.
One of the most obvious characteristics of yesterday's market was the apathy of traders and the total lack of any disposition to do business on the past of the average customer in the average brokerage office. No very good reason could be assigned for this condition of affairs except possibly a growing distrust of the market, which will require one or two days of a good, strong upward movement to eradicate.

The labor question is so nearly alike everywhere that the interest of the Canadian strike is far from being confined to the Dominion.

It seems to me that the modern man demands a Griselda.
