169-> The Screen:Carnegie Cinema Has Trilogy by Capote
HAVING filmed three Truman Capote short stories for television, Frank and Eleanor Perry (of "David and Lisa" fame) have had the grit and gumption to package them, with minor trims, as a single episodic feature for movie houses. And the tonic effect of "Trilogy," which Allied Artists presented yesterday at the Carnegie Hall Cinema, is marvelous.Without a single hitch of transition, the television footage flows beautifully and vibrantly across the large screen, which deepens the theme of human loneliness linking the contrasting stories, as adapted by the author and Mrs. Perry. The very chronology of the tales adds bite and dimension to the canvas.As director-producer, Mr. Perry also has a flawless cast, down to the smallest bit player (including himself as a flower vender), headed by three first ladies of American drama—Geraldine Page, Maureen Stapleton, pairing with Martin Balsam, and Mildred Natwick."Miriam," the only section not yet televised, is a tour de force for Miss Natwick, as a gentle old soul prodded to the brink of madness by a monstrously baffling girl, neatly played by young Susan Dunfee, and the woman's own imagination. In contrast to the chilling brush strokes and grim denouement is "Among the Paths to Eden," a tender, wistful conversation piece with Miss Stapleton and Mr. Balsam as two strangers exchanging reminiscences and fragments of hopes and dreams. Both are splendid.But the closing sequence, Mr. Capote's autobiographical "A Christmas Memory." which mopped up with television awards, is simply wonderful, a warm, funny and lancingly poignant vignette of a child and a faded eccentric creating a private island of life and love in a small patch of Dixie some thirty years ago. Whether baking a cake, prattling like two wise children or raiding a pecan orchard, young Dennie Melvin and the remarkable Miss Page are unforgettable. The authentic Southern setting looks so real that it hurts, at least to one who raided a pecan orchard or two in his own time. The color photography of the entire picture is muted and excellent.The cold fact is that "Trilogy" is all talk and little action. But it quietly says and conveys more about the human heart and spirit than most of today's free-wheeling blastaways on the screen. Delicately, it towers. TRILOGY, three Truman Capote stories adapted by the author and Eleanor Perry; directed and produced by Frank Perry; presented by Allied Artists. At the Carnegie Hall Cinema, Seventh Avenue and 56th Street. Running time: 110 minutes. (The Motion Picture Association of America's Production Code and Rating Administration Classifies this flim: "G—suggested for general audiences.")MIRIAMThe Woman . . . . .

"Americans in Paris" is a cultural history of that familiar gallery of ambitious and talented American expatriates in Paris who did so much to plot our present esthetic glories and confusions.

744-> Eloquent 'Ma Nuit Chez Maud'
ERIC ROHMER'S "Ma Nuit Chez Maud" (literally, "My Night at Maud's") is so French and so Catholic—as well as so fine—that it should prove irresistible to certain Americans, especially to those of us who, having been raised in a puritan tradition, have always been a little in awe of the Roman Church's intellectual catholicism. The French film was shown last night at Alice Tully Hall and will be repeated there tomorrow evening at 6:30. To my way of thinking, it's the first new film to be seen at the current New York Film Festival that achieves with elegance and eloquence the goals it has set for itself.Elegance and eloquence may seem like strange words to use about a film that was photographed entirely in black and white in a French provincial city in the dreariness of winter (mostly in ordinary interior settings) and that concerns four seemingly commonplace people, none of whom renounces a throne or even possesses an inflammatory political pamphlea.I'd even go so far as to call "Ma Nuit Chez Maud" civilized, except for the fact that that adjective usually recalls some boring film adaptation of a Lillian Hellman play in which people talk canned wisdom as they move from fireplace to settee to French windows, all the while anticipating some melodramatic disaster."Ma Nuit Chez Maud" is the first Rohmer feature to be seen in this country. Rohmer, a 40-year-old Cahiers du Cinéma critic, directed one of the episodes in the omnibus feature "Six in Paris," which was shown at the 1965 New York Film Festival (and which frankly, I don't remember). This new film is described as the third feature in a projected cycle called "Six Moral Tales," of which four have now been completed. Each is a variation on a single situation: a man who is in love with one woman meets and spends some time with another woman, whom he finds supremely attractive, but with whom he does not consummate the affair.The hero of "Ma Nuit Chez Maud" is Jean-Louis (Jean-Louis Trintignant), an engineer in his early 30's, a solitary but not a lonely sort, a man who at first seems to be something of a prig. He isn't. He just values himself too much—in the best sense—to waste time on superficial sexual or social experiments. Within his abiding Roman Catholicism, he also believes that he will ultimately meet and marry the right girl, who will not only be Catholic but also blonde.By chance one night, he runs into an old friend, a philosophy professor and Marxist atheist, who introduces him to Maud (Françoise Fabian), a divorcee and skeptic (this is the sort of movie in which people's philosophical attitudes are made as immediately apparent as are the birthrights in Shakespeare's histories). Maud, beautiful, wise, tells him about her marriage, her dead lover, her husband's mistress (a lovely young Catholic girl) and tries unsuccessfully to seduce him. The very next day, Jean-Louis meets the girl for whom he has been looking—which is not quite the end of a tale that is as ironic as it is moral.Rohmer's achievement in "Ma Nuit Chez Maud" is that he has been able to make so much talk so unaffectedly cinematic. Although a quick dip into Pascal's "Pensées" would not hurt before seeing the film, there is so much wit-in-context that it is not absolutely necessary. Most refreshing is the sight and sound of four characters who are articulate, interested, informed, educated, amused, vulnerable, totally free of epigrams and aware of their identities. Their only concern is the manner in which they will realize those identities, and whether it will be by choice, predestination or simple luck.The film is beautifully played, that is, as written, which is almost as if it were music. The camera literally and figuratively never looks down or up at the characters. It faces them straight on, the better to catch some completely unexpected moments of intimacy and humor."Ma Nuit Chez Maud" is set in Clermont, a town of something over 100,000 citizens, southwest of Paris, where Pascal was born in 1623. For more data, you'll have to search your own "Pensées," and the film, both of which might be most agreeable. MA NUIT CHEZ MAUD, screenplay by Eric Rohmer, based on the third of his "Six Moral Tales"; directed by Mr. Rohmer; produced by Barbet Schroeder and Pierre Cottrell. At the New York Film Festival, Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center. Running time: 105 minutes.Jean-Louis . . . . . Jean-Louis TrintignantMaud . . . . . Francoise FabianFrancoise . . . . .

751-> ' The Adding Machine'
WITH newsreel footage of strikes, protest rallies, and breadlines, with shots of Clark Gable and Deanna Durbin, the movie begins by evoking the American urban 1930's insistently, ineptly and pointlessly, since Elmer Rice's play dates from 1923, and both the play and the adaptation mean to be for now and forever. Jerome Epstein's "The Adding Machine" opened yesterday at the Kips Bay Theater, and yesterday is pretty much where it belongs.I suppose that everyone who has been through a certain kind of modern drama survey course or an anthology remembers the story of Mr. and Mrs. Zero and their friends (the Twos, the Threes, the Fours, the Fives and the Sixes), and how Zero, a bookkeeper for 25 years, learns that he is to be replaced by an adding machine, kills his boss, is tried and executed. He goes to heaven — where the woman of his dreams and the freedom of the commune prove too much for him, so that he turns to bookkeeping in Hell while awaiting rebirth into another life of drudgery."The Adding Machine" turns out on rereading to be a somewhat livelier, more honorably ambitious play than I remember it. Zero himself, despite the dead-eared sociology of his name, is an individualized presence before his Creator puts him in his place. A movie version doesn't seem like such a bad idea. But virtually everything in this movie version is a bad idea poorly realized.Epstein's direction is straight pre-New Wave academic, with absolutely regular cross-cutting punctuated by occasional lyrical montage to indicate imagination. He has softened the play a bit, added a dumb discourse on violence, added a needless prison scene for Phyllis Diller, and moved the Elysian Fields to an amusement park. For frumpy Daisy Devore, Zero's long-lost office romance, he has miscast Billie Whitelaw, who would still look ravishing if she dressed in cast iron and took ugly pills for a year.Indeed, each member of the distinguished cast is in his own way unsuitable. Phyllis Diller from Ohio, Billie Whitelaw from England, and Milo O'Shea from Ireland, all try to sound as if they commuted on the Pelham Bay local, and none succeeds. You need only hear Billie Whitelaw attempt a line like "I never cared nothin' about nobody else" to appreciate the frustrations that must sometimes plague the best performers. Phyllis Diller and Milo O'Shea look right, and in provincial productions (different provincial productions) might have sounded right. In the present circumstances everybody wastes too much effort simply in finding a characterization.But there is a more serious problem common to the play and the movie. Where Elmer Rice meant to lament the common man's fate in the history of societies, he actually deplores a particular life style in American cities. The commanding vision Zero lacks could be easily supplied by a liberal arts education and a ticket out of the lower middle classes. And the playwright's vision seems to have been compounded from all the stock illusions shared by those who don't have to work at dull jobs from 9 to 5 about those who do. THE ADDING MACHINE, written by Jerome Epstein, based on the play "The Adding Machine" by Elmer Rice; produced and directed by Mr. Epstein; released by Regional Film Distributors, Inc. At the Kips Bay Theatre, Second Avenue and 31st Street. Running time: 100 minutes.

1250-> Daring Game'
THE name of the game in "Daring Game," which surfaced in varied colors yesterday at local houses, is: Don't let the story get in the way of the subsea scientific games. And, Ivan Tors, the producer, and the aquatic troupe headed by Lloyd Bridges, who, thanks to Mr. Tors's long-running "Sea Hunt" TV series, is as much at home in the deep as a mackerel, have made the submarine gimmicks and the hunt, if not the story, a mild diversion for movie and video adventurers.There is an obviously manufactured fiction about a noted political scientist and his daughter held captive by the dictator of a Caribbean island republic. But it does call for Mr. Bridges and his Survival Devices, Inc., who are a group of aviator-frogmen-karate experts in the business of alleviating this specialized kind of distress, to come to the aid of the beleaguered parties.Credit Mr. Tors and company with coming up with such devices as a two-man submarine, torpedo-like vehicles for propelling scuba divers and, best of all, Instant Underwater Habitat, or "Igloo," a contraption dropped from a plane and then inflated on the ocean floor to bungalow proportions, to thwart the villains. Naturally, Michael Ansara, as the glum dictator, a scuba man himself who will not heed the liberal advice of his former professor, the captive Shepperd Strudwick, and the island's military, are no match for "Igloo" and all that scuba gear.Although Lloyd Bridges, somewhat winded but still steely eyed; Joan Blackman, as the professor's daughter, and the other athletic types display no more emotion than is absolutely necessary, they are as active as Seals, even if "Igloo" is impossible to top. DARING GAME, screenplay by Andy White, based on a story by Art Arthur and Mr. White; directed by Lasio Benedek; produced by Gene Levitt with Ivan Tors as executive producer; presented by Paramount Pictures.

1282-> Screen: 'Monster Party':Local Theaters Show Animated Feature
MOST of the so-called kiddie movies unloaded on weekends at neighborhood theaters are absurdly awful. But "Mad Monster Party," which Avco Embassy is showing today and tomorrow, at matinees only, is another matter entirely.In this peppery and contagiously droll little color package, a collection of animated puppets scamper across some clever miniature sets, exchanging sass and barbs and occasionally warbling some sprightly tunes. The rubbery-faced puppets themselves are modeled after the best-known movie "monsters," including the Wolf Man, Dr. Jekyll, Quasimodo, Yetch (Peter Lorre), Dracula, and Frankenstein's Monster. What a party list for a weekend on a Caribbean isle, where Baron Frankenstein has summoned his old pals to name his successor. This is his nephew, an All-American boy who soon yearns for his uncle's secretary, a delectable doll of a redhead. The jealous monsters then cook up some intrigue.The picture clips along breezily in a flow of wise-cracks and slapstick. And the voices applied to the animated figures—Boris Karloff and Phyllis Diller are credited with their own—are a riot. So are a banquet scene and a kitchen tour when the chef (Mafia Machiavelli) ticks off the menu. Add a red-hot rock quartet of beatle-mop skeletons.King Kong drops by for the finale, a takeoff on that monster classic, complete with toy airplanes. But the two funniest party guests are Count Dracula ("Time for my coffin break") and Miss Diller) "Boy, do you need a manicure!" she tells the Wolf Man, after he kisses her hand)As directed by Jules Bass and produced by Arthur Rankin Jr. with some gifted technicians, this party should make everybody chuckle, the tots and their escorts, and even the monsters at heart. The ProgramMAD MONSTER PARTY, directed by Jules Bass; produced by Arthur Rankin Jr.; a Rankin-Bass Production, presented by Avco Embassy. At neighborhood theaters. Running time: 93 minutes.

1283-> Screen: 'The Fool Killer' Begins Run:Little Carnegie Shows a Tale of Murder
"THE FOOL KILLER" is describably bad — a poetic melodrama about a 12-year-old boy (Edward Albert) and his love for a kindly, philosophic ax murderer (Anthony Perkins) with whom, for a few weeks, he roams the pastoral post-Civil War South. It's the sort of movie in which Perkins, lying face down on the ground, announces he can feel the grass grow, in which the boy says of a beating by his stepfather: "It ain't the pain of it, or the hurt. It's the shame," and in which there is so much background music (folk and movie airs) that the music almost acts as a curtain to obscure the screen.The film, based on the Helen Eustis novel, was directed by Servando Gonzalez, the young Mexican director whose "Yanco" was seen here in 1964. In "The Fool Killer," he has anthologized almost five decades of cinematic clichés — obtrusive wipes, wobbly dissolves and bizarre camera angles that have no relation to the scene being performed. The picture is photographed in black-and-white with lots of filters that give cumulus clouds the look of great wads of cotton dipped in plaster of Paris.The performances by Perkins, Albert, Salome Jens and Henry Hull are all quite decent but, like the screenplay, full of unexplored innuendos. The movie, which was made in 1963, was withheld from release for six years and released now, I suspect, in a desperate effort to recoup the production cost. It opened at the Little Carnegie Theater, which, yesterday anyway, was air-conditioned to a point that almost induced hibernation. THE FOOL KILLER, screenplay by Morton Fine and David Friedkin, based on the novel by Helen Eustis; directed by Servando Gonzalez; produced by David Friedkin, with Worthington Miner as executive producer; presented by the Landau Company and Jack J. Dreyfus Jr.; distributed by the Landau Releasing Organization through Allied Artists. At the Little Carnegie Theater, 57th Street east of Seventh Avenue.

1315-> Festival Presents Bresson's 'Une Femme Douce'
"UNE FEMME DOUCE" is the ninth film of the 62-year-old French director Robert Bresson. Of the previous eight, the last three ("The Trial of Joan of Arc," 1962; "Au Hazard Balthazar," 1966; "Mouchette," 1967) have had their premieres in this country at the New York Film Festival. If the festival had no other justification, merely showing the works of Bresson, and of a few other great and not very popular directors, would be justification enough.Bresson's career has been extensively discussed in film journals and almost totally ignored everywhere else. His movies are austere, relatively static, acted frequently by amateurs whom the director has trained to suppress both facial and vocal expression, and concerned with man's inward life—which they take pains to keep inward. The privileged Bressonian moment is the crisis of the soul's salvation, often, but not always, figured in religious terms.The Film Festival advertisement asserts that "Une Femme Douce" offers us Bresson's first "real woman" in years—which is not true. The gentle woman of the title, played by Dominique Sanda (17 years old, a model and, like many of Bresson's leading ladies, beautiful) is neither more nor less real than her predecessors. She differs from most of them only in that she has no vocation for her life—except to leave it.In the best critical introduction to Bresson, "Spiritual Style in the Films of Robert Bresson" (1964; reprinted in "Against Interpretation"), Susan Sontag posits a theme common to all his films: "the meaning of confinement and liberty." For the films made since her essay, I should modify that theme to "the meaning of escape." In Bresson's recent movies, "liberty" has meant only the "escape" that is possible through death. The martyrdom of Joan, the dying of the donkey Balthazar, the suicide of the girl Mouchette—all bring to an end unredeemable life situations, and all provide ravishingly beautiful climaxes for their respective films.The young wife leaps to her death at the very beginning of "Une Femme Douce." The action is then mostly played out in flashbacks, the husband speaking to the maidservant while standing or kneeling over his wife's dead body.That body may produce mixed reactions. It is distressingly in evidence, and the cuts to it are sometimes shocking. Much of the past action takes place in and around the bed on which the corpse now lies and, because Bresson provides no bridges, you are never sure whether the film will cut to a living wife or a dead one. Nevertheless, the corpse is the residue of something that has escaped, and for that escape we must be glad. At the very end, the husband, a pawnbroker who has helped drive his wife to suicide, begs her to look at him once more. But in Bresson's world a direct look is always a speaking between souls, and this is precisely the sign that can no longer be given.Just before the young woman's death the audience is given some signs for itself, momentary scenes: the woman's smile in her mirror, her fierce and happy eyes at the door to her balcony, the balcony furniture toppling slowly over, her shawl floating to the ground. Anyone familiar with Bresson will recognize a continuity between these signs and the lovely intimations of grace in his earlier films. You must watch closely. That smile, the film's only smile, lasts a second or two; but in the cinema of Bresson, such seconds are what we go to the movies for."Une Femme Douce" is adapted from a Dostoevski novella. Bresson has kept the novella's basic situation and changed everything else. His gentle woman wants to escape not just her husband (as Dostoevski's does) but the very idea of marriage, the tedium of typical life patterns and even the historical continuity of biological forms—by which her bone structure partially reproduces the bone structure of animals long extinct and her nude body duplicates nude bodies throughout the history of painting.Bresson has placed his action in present-day Paris. And he brings in the "modern world"—by which I mean he arbitrarily shows cars, airplanes and race horses on a television screen and introduces the sound of traffic outside the couple's bedroom.But his world remains mysterious. The pawning of objects, and the paying of money for them, is presented as a secret joint admission of guilt. Empty stairways, doors, street corners repeatedly suggest the absence of the people who have just passed through them. And on her wedding night the new wife simply runs from closet to bath to bed—to indicate (without expression) what there is of pleasure and passion before that fateful smile.Of course there are lesser and greater Bresson films. I think "Une Femme Douce" belongs among the greater ones. The usual language of critical praise seems beside the point in discussing Bresson, but please understand that I mean this to be a rave review.The film will be shown again Saturday at 3:30 P.M. UNE FEMME DOUCE, screenplay by Robert Bresson from Dostoevski's "The Gentle Woman." Directed by Mr. Bresson; produced by Mag Bodard; released by Paramount Pictures Corporation. At the New York Film Festival, Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center. Running time: 87 minutes.She . . . . . Dominique SandaHe . . . . . Guy FranginAnna . . . . . Jane Lobre
