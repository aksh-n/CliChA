Desperate ills, it is said, call for desperate remedies. When it becomes indisputably manifest that the population of a country is steadily diminishing in number year by year, the dictates of patriotism and self-preservation naturally enough suggest to the rulers of that country the urgent necessity of taking effective measures, legislative or administrative, to check so alarming a tendency in the direction of national debilitation and decadence.

The first Chinaman yet arrested in the confines of Central Park, according to trustworthy accounts, felt the rigor of police authority yesterday as a result of resenting an affront which even the gentle spirit of a law-abiding Mongolian might not be expected to brook.

During the civil war and afterward I remember well a noted man about town -- a sort of counterpart of the well-known Dandy Marx of a former period -- whose name was George Hill, but who bore the nickname of "Cooley Keys," as the newspapers of the day spelled it.

The semi-official Berlin Post recently gave a direct rebuke to those Anglophobe sheets of Germany that have criticised the Colonial Office for coming to terms with England over Delagoa Bay. Up to 1896, the Post says, England's right to Delagoa Bay existed only on paper.

24-> THE REPUBLICAN ARRAIGNED.
The questions that called the National Democratic Party into being are, to say the least, now in abeyance. Those who, like the writer, have voted for that party's candidates in recent elections, now must make a momentous choice.

--------
25-> Bookbindings on Exhibition.
To those who have been deluded into thinking that the only mission of books in the world is that they might be read, the present recurrence of the annual Scribner exhibition of special and unique bindings will be in the nature of a revelation.

31-> Review 1 -- No Title
Pretty generally the inspired German newspapers are down on Dr. Busch's Bismarck diary. "Here is a man," they say, "who writes for money -- and the memory of Bismarck is besmirched on that account. A German is unfit to live who is mercenary," ,  Since it seems probable that no Bismarck memoirs are to be published, Dr. Busch's diary will have to suffice at least for the present.

63-> THE FRENCH PROGRAMME.
As had been anticipated, the Ministerial declaration made by Premier DUPUY before the French Chamber last Friday was one tending to restore confidence and to bring tranquillity to the disturbing factions of Deputies.

In general, the destruction of wealth is a social as well as an individual loss. The wealth that is used up in riotous living is diverted from better uses. Extravagance is not necessarily luxury.

Our Democratic friends who are afraid of National issues and insisting on State issues solely would do well to study the following from the Democratic NEW YORK TIMES: 
--------

PROVINCETOWN, Mass., Nov. 30. -- The exact number of persons who were carried away from Boston by the Portland will probably never be known, as no list of passengers was retained on shore when the vessel left last Saturday. Many estimates of the number on board have been made, but the estimates have seldom agreed. 
--------
241-> YALE ATHLETES CONFER.; Seeking a Remedy for the Conditions Which Worry Them.
NEW HAVEN, Dec. 11. -- A meeting, quite out of the ordinary at Yale, was held this evening to discuss the decadence in Yale athletics and to find a remedy. The meeting was held in secret, and few outside of those who were present had any inkling that any such conference was to be held. 
--------
242-> SALVATION ARMY FETE.; Novel Entertainment at Carnegie Hall to Start a "Red Crusade."
" One of the greatest battles in the history of Christendom" is announced by the Salvation Army to take place to-morrow evening at Carnegie Hall. The programme for the evening containe many striking features, and although it is termed a battle, it is really to be a sort of thanksgiving demonstration, besides inaugurating a "Red Crusade" campaign to cover all Greater New York in a mighty revival effort. 
--------
243-> BASEBALL ISSUES SETTLED.; The National Board of Arbitration of the League Passes on Old Disputes.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 22. -- The National Board of Arbitration of the Baseball League at a special meeting held in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York, took action on a number of matters of interest to followers of the National game.

--------
245-> QUESTION OF THE VOLUNTEERS.
Are you entirely right in the criticism you make regarding the attitude of the Democratic members of Congress toward the volunteers? It is history that war was declared against Spain to force her to relinquish sovereignty over Cuba -- that volunteers were enlisted for this purpose, and that purpose only, for a term of two years. 
--------
246-> NEW COUNTERFEIT $5 NOTE.; Notice of Its Issuance Given by the Government Authorities.

Capt. Eulate, late commander of the destroyed cruiser Vizcaya, who arrived in town Wednesday night, was down town yesterday endeavoring to make arrangements for the transportation to Spain of the Spanish prisoners from the fleet.

--------
248-> CARL SCHURZ ON ROOSEVELT.
Mr. CARL SCHURZ has made public a very candid statement of the reasons why he cannot vote for Mr. ROOSEVELT and why he feels it his duty to vote for Mr. THEODORE BACON, the independent candidate for Governor. 
--------
249-> ADVANCEMENT IN THE NAVY.
The navy system of rewarding officers by advancing them a few numbers is satisfactory to nobody. It is resented by the officers that are thus carried backward in the line of promotion, it is disliked by the men that are advanced and it is looked upon by civilians as a peanut sort of business at best. 
--------
250-> MURDERED BY ITALIANS.; Autopsy Proves Curtin's Statement as to His Fatal Injuries.
Just before his death at the Metropolitan Hospital on Blackwell's Island on Monday Cornelius Curtin, fifty years old, of 412 East One Hundred and Sixth Street, told the House Surgeon, H.O. Sommer, and his assistant, Daniel J. Baker, that his injuries were due to an assault upon him on Sept. 3 by a gang of Italians. 
--------

--------
252-> NICARAGUA CANAL TREATY; England Is Willing to Modify the Clayton-Bulwer Convention. MAY ASK FAVORS IN RETURN Possibility that the Negotiations Will Solve the Question of Reciprocity with Canada.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 23. -- It is accepted as little short of certain in the best informed official and diplomatic circles that negotiations will be opened at an early day toward modifying the Clayton-Bulwer treaty, so as to meet the conditions of the present day concerning American construction and control of the Nicaragua Canal. 
--------
253-> NEWS OF THE RAILROADS.; LAKE ERIE AND WESTERN. Plans for the Absorption of the Cincinnati Northern.
TOLEDO, Ohio, Sept. 12 -- Ex-Senator Brice and several other Lake Erie and Western stockholders favor the absorption of the Cincinnati Northern, and it comes on the best of authority that the consolidation will take place. There has been positive opposition to the consolidation. It was claimed that this opposition grew out of the fact that the old Mackinaw was never able to pay its interest, not to speak of dividends. 
--------
254-> OPERATIONS AT SANTIAGO.; Plans for Establishing a Civil Government -- Relief of Cubans -- Testimonial to Gen. Lawton.
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Oct. 10. -- Lieut. Col. Wiley, Lieutenant Governor of the Department of Santiago, accompanied by Gen. Castillo, the Cuban leader recently appointed to advise Gen.

--------
256-> WRANGLE OVER A DYING MAN.; Doctors and Hospital Authorities Argue While a Patient Sick with Pneumonia Grows Weaker.
George Brown, eighteen years old, of 216 East Thirty-seventh Street, is dying from pneumonia at the Bellevue Hospital, where he was admitted last night after what is alleged to be an entirely unnecessary wrangle of an hour or more, during which the condition of the sick man was each moment growing more serious. 
--------
257-> SIR KNIGHTS AT PITTSBURG.; A Parade of 25,000 Uniformed Men Witnessed by 1,000,000 Persons.
PITTSBURG, Oct. 11. -- The parade of Knights Templars in connection with the triennial convention now in session in this city took place this morning. It is estimated that the parade was made up of upward of 25,000 uniformed Knights, and there were at least a million spectators along the route of the parade, which was seven miles long. Gen. J.P.S. Gobin acted as Grand Marshal. 
--------
258-> ON THE BASEBALL FIELD.; New Yorks Win and Lose a Game in Baltimore -- Victory Due to Good Batting.
Gastons, one of the recent acquisitions to the Brooklyns' pitching department, had another trial yesterday, and if the easy manner in which he disposed of the Philadelphias at Washington Park is any criterion he will make a reputation in the major League. A three-bagger by Delehanty in the sixth inning was all that saved the visitors from being shut out. 
--------
259-> PEACE WORK IS DELAYED; Our Commissioners Hold Two Sessions to Formulate a Final Answer on the Cuban Debt. SPAIN WOULD REPUDIATE IT A Paris Paper Criticises the Method of Communicating in Writing Instead of Outspoken Debate in Their Sessions.
PARIS, Oct. 22. -- The United States Peace Commission held two sittings to-day to consider the voluminous communication presented yesterday by the Spanish Commissioners. This new proposition of the Spaniards looks to a compromise between the refusal of the Americans to assume any of the Cuban debt, the Spanish holding that the United States should assume it wholly. 
--------
260-> POLICY BEFORE THE BABY.; Colored Man Abandons a Child at a Fire to Find Insurance Papers.
As between a baby and a life insurance policy, in a fire which last night threatened the existence of both, H. Hilman, a colored man living on the third floor of the tenement at 233 West Sixty-first Street, chose the policy and left the baby to its fate. That fate would undoubtedly have been death had it not been for the fortunate arrival of neighbors. 
--------
261-> A FIERCE DOWN-TOWN FIRE; Many Firemen Are Overcome by Fumes of Burning Essential Oils in Beekman Street. FOUGHT THE FLAMES TWICE After Three Hours' Work the Firemen Leave the Building, Only to be Summoned Again -- Leerburger Bros. Sustain a Heavy Loss.
A stubborn fire in the subcellar of the five-story building at 54 Beekman Street last night destroyed a large stock of valuable oils belonging to Leerburger Brothers, dealers in essential oils, perfumes, and supplies. Shortly before 6 o'clock a fine line of smoke was noticed issuing through a trapdoor in front of the store. 
--------
262-> WEATHER WARNINGS.
Commendable promptitude and energy have evidently been displayed by the Weather Bureau officials to whom was recently intrusted the task of extending the service to the chain of islands connecting Florida with South America. In the regular summary of meteorological conditions sent out Saturday night and printed Sunday morning news was given of a severe storm developing in the Eastern Caribbean Sea, near Barbados. 
--------

LONDON, Aug. 6. -- The Madrid correspondent of The Daily Mail says: 
--------
264-> THE TAX ON RACE TRACKS.; Agricultural Societies Anxious About an Important Source of Revenue.
ALBANY, Sept. 1. -- J.H. Durkee, President of the Association of County Agricultural Societies, has finally, after failing to secure the Governor's co-operation in enforcing the racing track tax law, decided to prefer charges of neglect of duty against Hamilton Busbey, editor of The Turf, Field and Farm, as Supervisor of Accounts of Trotting Race Meetings. 
--------
265-> GOLFING OVER WET LINKS.; Twelve Professional Play for Money Prizes at Baltusrol.
Sixteen golfers, wet through to the skin, endeavored to get fun and exercise from the combined professional and amateur tournament played yesterday on the links of the Baltusrol Golf Club at Short Hills, N.J. It was one of the worst golfing days of the season, and that accounted for the small number of competitors, particularly of the amateurs, of whom there were only four. 
--------
266-> SMALLPOX IN THE STATE.; Board of Health Issues a Circular to Schools Looking to the Prevention of Its Spread.
ALBANY, N.Y., Nov. 10. -- The State Board of Health, in order to prevent a possible smallpox epidemic in this State, is taking every possible precaution and exercising every means in its power to accomplish that end. It to-day sent to the School Commissioners of the State for distribution among the school authorities the following circular: 
--------
267-> THE OLD GAME.
The Hon. WILLIAM E. CHANDLER visited his attic last week to inspect his ancient stock of bloody shirts, now stained by time as well as by Ethiopian gore. He laid out the garments one by one, examined the ensanguined arras, noted their faded and yellowing tone, and gently tested the strength of the material. 
--------
268-> SPAIN IN THE PHILIPPINES; The Ministerial Organs in Madrid Urge the Government Not to Surrender the Islands. REPORT OF GEN. AUGUSTIN Former Spanish Captain General at Manila Tells of His Defeat and Endeavors to Justify His Action in Leaving.

--------
269-> Canadian Pacific Rates.
CHICAGO, Sept. 12. -- A definite statement has been secured from the Canadian Pacific as to its intentions regarding the restoration of rates. It will use the basts in effect prior to last November, taking care to use the lowest rate in effect over any American line. This arrangement is satisfactory to all the American roads. 
--------
270-> Quarters for the Peace Conference.

Charles Burkawitz, thirty-five years old, one of New York's wealthiest and most influential beggars, was sent to the Island for three months yesterday by Magistrate Olmsted in the West Side Court. The charge against him was vagrancy, yet the misshapen and withered little man is said to be worth all the way from $14,000 to $20,000. 
--------
272-> THE THOUSAND ISLAND PARK.; St. Lawrence River Anglers' Association Thinks Lands Should Be Bought Before Aug. 1, 1899.
THOUSAND ISLANDS, Clayton, N.Y., Aug. 5. -- The annual meeting of the St. Lawrence River Anglers' Association was held this week at the Thousand Island House, Alexandria Bay. After a spirited discussion of the present status of the International Park at the Thousand Islands, the following resolutions were passed: 
--------
273-> THE FINANCIAL MARKETS
Judging by Wall Street's disposition last week, the course of the stock market during the coming few days, except where influenced by professional at manipulation, is likely to depend largely upon developments in the political situation at home and upon the progress of the quarrel between Great Britain and France over the Fashoda matter. 
--------
274-> ECHOES FROM THE LINKS.; Many Events for Men and Women Golfers to be Decided This Week -- College Games at Ardsley.
The present will be an active week on the golf links, and there will be plenty of interesting contests for both men and women. The college golfers will form one of the chief attractions in their four-day championship tournament at Ardsley, which begins Wednesday morning, and in which, as already announced, some of the leading golfers from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Columbia will participate. 
--------
275-> OBDAM HERE, FIRE IN HOLD; Three Hundred and Five Soldiers from Ponce on the Transport. MANY COMPLAINTS ARE MADE Col. Charles H. Gibson Says He Has a Sensational Report to Make to the President Regarding the Treatment of the Sick.
The United States transport Obdam, Capt.

--------
278-> MOORE JURY IS LOCKED UP; Recorder Waited for a Verdict Until 1:50 o'Clock This Morning. CAME IN FOR INSTRUCTIONS Wanted to Know If They Could Find Defendant Guilty of a Lesser Crime Than Charged.
The jury that is to decide the fate of Mrs. Fayne Strahan Moore had not returned a verdict at 1:30 o'clock this morning, and was locked up for the night. Recorder Goff waited for the jury to arrive at an agreement until that hour, and tired and weary after the long day's work, he decided to go home, telling the court officers that he would not return until 10 o'clock this morning. 
--------
279-> FOUND DEAD IN A CISTERN.; A Mystery of the Storm in a Snowbound Long Island Village.
PATCHOGUE, L.I., Dec. 1. -- James and Samuel Hope of Waverly reached Patchogue late this afternoon after a five-mile tramp over a road every foot of which they say had at least two feet of snow on it, and where occasionally they had difficulty in forcing their way through drifts. They are the first persons to get out of the village since Saturday. 
--------
280-> PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATIONS.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 12. -The President to-day sent these nominations to the Seate: 
--------
281-> SPAIN'S FINAL REQUESTS; Sues for Free Trade with the Islands She Has Released. FIVE YEARS THE TIME NAMED Such a Privilege, She Cites, Was Allowed When We Took Florida from Her in 1819.
PARIS, Dec. 1. -- Anxious as both are to conclude their work, the United States and Spanish Peace Commissions did not hold a joint session to-day. Their next meeting will be held at 2 o'clock to-morrow afternoon. 
--------

PORT TOWNSEND, Washington, Dec. 12. -- News is brought by the steamer Farrallon, which has arrived here from Skaguay, Alaska, that on Dec. 2 Charles Watson, John McGubbin and John Hapin lost their lives by the premature explosion of a blast. The men were working on the grade of the White Pass and Yukon Railway, between Camps Nos. 9 and 10. 
--------
283-> THE OPPOSITION TO CROCKER; Various Leaders Credited with Desire to Head Revolt. STORM BREWING IN BROOKLYN James Shevlin Looked To to Unhorse the Tammany Chief -- Croker to Take a Trip.
There is still much talk among Democrats about the growth of the opposition to Richard Croker within the organization both in this city and in the State. It was rumored yesterday that the nucleus of this opposition will be the Manhattan Club, which, as is well known, has not always been friendly to Mr. Croker, although it volunteered its service to the Democratic Campaign Committee in the recent political canvass. 
--------
284-> THE WAR INVESTIGATION; Signal Corps' Work Explained by Gen. Greely. WHY HIS MEN DID NOT DIE Sanitation and Discipline Their Safeguard -- No Change in the Tropic Ration Needed.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 12. -- Gen. A.W. Greely, Chief of the Signal Service, testified before the war investigating commission to-day that his plans had been laid well ahead, and that when appropriations became available there was no delay in launching the work. He knew what would be required and acted accordingly. 
--------
285-> II. Pindar Makes a Convert for "E.G."
I had my doubts as to the efficacy of "E.G.'s" recipe for writing sonnets, in THE TIMES'S SATURDAY REVIEW, but since I tried my hand on "Pindar's" test case this afternoon, I have become a convert. I inclose the results of my efforts. The sonnet, I may say, composed itself, as I had no idea what it would be about when I began. 
--------
286-> Architects of the Capitol.
Miss Repplier, in her delightful book on Philadelphia, speaks of the Franklin Institute, founded in 1824. One of the early students, so she says, was "Thomas Walter, a young bricklayer, who some years later designed Girard College and the Capitol at Washington." 
--------
287-> Sarcophagi of Sidon.
We are indebted to his Excellency Hamdy Bey, Director General of the Imperal Ottoman Museum at Constantinople, for the latest catalogue of the many rare and unique objects in his keeping. Together with the catalogue of the museum, another is added treating of early Turcoman coins. M. Andre Joubin has written an excellent preface to the catalogue, describing the sarcophagi of Sidon, and how they were discovered. 
--------
288-> OUR COMMISSIONERS IN CUBA.; May Stay at El Vedado -- Gen. Butler Takes Photographs of Public Buildings in Havana.
HAVANA, Sept. 12. -- The United States Cuban Evacuation Commissioners will not hold a meeting to-day. At 8 o'clock this morning Gen.

--------
289-> WEARY OF WEDDED LIFE.; Commodore William K. Mayo Seeking a Divorce from His Young Wife.
FARGO, N.D., Nov. 23. -- Commodore William K. Mayo, United States Navy, retired, has taken up his residence in Fargo, and has begun suit for divorce from his young wife to whom he was married in 1892. Commodore Mayo is a fine-appearing old gentleman, of about seventy, comes from one of the oldest families in Virginia, and is said to be a millionaire. 
--------
290-> DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S FUTURE.
The future of the Democratic Party in New York State seems to be at present a subject of much speculation. Many editorials in your paper and in other papers, as well as letters from your respective readers, suggest ways and means for the rehabilitation of a once powerful organization. 
--------
291-> Editorial Article 1 -- No Title
Gen. COPPINGER has been moved to inform Gen. STERNBERG that Camp Wheeler, near Huntsville, Ala., is well placed and well equipped, and that the soldiers there are getting well and happy. That is indeed good news, and it is easy to understand why information so unlike that which comes from the other camps should have been made public by the War Department. 
--------
292-> THE MILLS HOUSES.
In holding for trial a man charged with attempting to steal an umbrella at Mills House No. 1 Magistrate CORNELL is reported to have made the following observations: 
--------
293-> SENATOR VEST'S MISTAKE.
Senator VEST relies with too much confidence on Chief Justice TANEY'S opinion in the Dred Scott case. He introduced a resolution last week declaring that the Constitution confers no power on the Federal Government to acquire territory to be held and governed permanently as territories. In his argument yesterday in support of the resolution, which is in language almost identical with that of Chief Justice TANEY'S opinion, he said: 
--------
294-> DREYFUS REVISION AND WAR; High Officers Prefer the Worst to Having the French Army Remain Under a Cloud. ALL PARTIES WANT A RETRIAL Conferences Held to Convince M. Cavaignac, Minister of War, of the Need of Revision -- Faure Stays at Havre.
PARIS, Sept. 2 -- 11 P.M. -- The report, put in circulation by a news agency, that a revision of the Dreyfus case had been decided upon appears to be premature. 
--------
295-> The Gate City at Savannah.
SAVANNAH, Dec. 1. -- The Ocean Steamship Company's steamer Gate City, Capt. Googins, from Boston, passed in Tybee safely this morning. 
--------
296-> LIGHT, HEAT, AND POWER; The Object of the New Whitney Syndicate to Make Them Cheap. AN OFFICIAL STATEMENT MADE To Save Loss in Stoppage, Its Plant Will Be Run Continuously and the Surplus Electricity Sold.
Several members of the Whitney syndicate, officially known as the New York Gas and Electric Light, Heat, and Power Company, met in the cable building, at Broadway and Houston Street, yesterday, and discussed the plans of the new organization, which, within a comparatively short time, is to control the electric transportation and lighting business in Greater New York. 
--------
297-> RIOT OVER GARCIA'S DEATH; Effort to Honor His Memory in Havana Causes a Clash. THREE CUBANS SHOT TO DEATH The Trouble Quelled by Spanish Authorities and Stringent Measures Taken to Prevent Outbreaks.
HAVANA, Dec. 12. -- Three Cubans were killed and one Spanish officer and two Cubans were wounded last night in an affray between some Spanish officers off duty and a number of citizens and a party of Cubans who wished to close the Tacon Theatre on account of the death of Gen. Calixto Garcia at Washington. The Spanish troops on duty intervened and restored order. 
--------
298-> MR. ROOSEVELT'S RESIDENCE.
THE NEW YORK TIMES prides itself, and, I must say, justly, upon its independence; further, as I understand, especially in its editorial pages, upon the exactness of its statements and its unwillingness to draw false conclusions for the purpose of making a given point. 
--------
299-> THE NEGRO AS A SOLDIER.
In the war period, 1861-5, the negro population of the United States averaged about 4,000,000. That was approximately one negro in every eight of the total. This ratio has been well maintained to this time. In the last two years and four months of the civil war there were raised and mustered into the service of the United States negro regiments that aggregated 186,017 men. 
--------
300-> MORE SCOTTANA.; Sir Walter the Author of an Advertising Sheet.
Sir Walter Scott in 1817 Wrote "an advertising sheet," which was published by John Balantyne under the title of "The Sale Room." This clever sketch of Sir Walter's, Literature states, is quite unknown, and one of the exceedingly rare copies of this publication was quite recently purchased by the Edinburgh Public Library. 
--------
301-> GOLD BRICK GAME STOPPED; Two Rich Englishmen Were All Ready to Pay $10,000 for a Seventy-Pound Bar. A CHANCE WORD SAVED THEM The Transaction All Arranged When a Lawyer and Then the Detectives Heard of It and Arrested the Salesman.
J. Algernon Wood and Reginald Baiss, both of Belvidere, Kent, England, are two of the happiest young Englishmen now visiting this country, and their happiness is due to the work of Capt. McClusky of the Detective Bureau in saving for them $10,000, which they were on the point of turning over to a gold-brick salesman, who is now under lock and key at Police Headquarters. 
--------
302-> FOUR DAYS' REGISTRATION; Revised Tables Show a Total of 556,489 for the Entire City. 137,840 FOR THE FOURTH DAY The Increase Was Considerably Over That of the Fourth Day of 1897, and Was Unexpectedly Heavy.
Below are the revised and corrected tables of the four days' registration of the city's five boroughs. The total amounts to 556,489 against 564,900 for 1897. The fourth day's registration showed a general and somewhat unexpected increase in Manhattan and Brooklyn. The total for the boroughs is 137,840 compared to 108,631 last year. 
--------
303-> VIEWS ON REGISTRATION.; Opinions of Party Leaders as to the Significance of the Figures. REPUBLICANS SEE VICTORY The Democratic Managers Decline to Base Any Estimates Upon the Returns and Insist that They Are Meaningless.
The significance of the returns from the four days of registration which ended Saturday was the one thing talked about yesterday by the politicians of both parties. The Republican managers were quick to claim in the heavy registration up the State and the falling off in this city a portent of victory for their ticket in November. 
--------
304-> A BIG BANK AT BOSTON.; Believed that the Application to Organize a $3,000,000 Concern Means a Consolidation of Banks.
BOSTON, Oct. 23. -- The application of the following persons for authority to organize "the National Shawmut Bank of Boston, with a capital of $3,000,000," has been approved: James P. Stearns, 60 Congress Street, Boston, Mass.; Frank G. Webster, Henry L. Higginson, Fred S. Scherley, and Robert Winsor. 
--------
305-> A Deaf-Mute Missionary.
A very interesting gentleman, indeed, is the Rev. Austin W. Mann of Cleveland, Ohio, the famous deaf mute minister, who was seen last evening at the Arlington. Mission work has been the chief labor of his life, and his unselfish efforts in behalf of his unfortunate brothers entitle him to the highest praise. He is general missionary to deaf-mutes in the Middle Western dioceses. 
--------
306-> At Poughkeepsie.
POUGHKEEPSIE, Aug. 5. -- The meeting of the New York State Trotting Horse Breeders' Association closed to-day The 2:15 trot was unfinished and will be decided to-morrow morning. Summaries: 
--------
307-> ANGLO-SAXON DOMINION.; A Frenchman's Tribute to It as "a Preponderance Whose Progress no Human Force Can Now Stop."*
M. Demolins in this volume on a great theme applies in his arguments methods of analysis which he tells us have been devised by MM. le Play and de Tourville. The author aims to show what is Anglo-Saxon influence, and why certain phenomena "alone insure for England and the United States their social originality and superiority." Geographical conditions as important factors, M. Demolins, it seems to us, entirely ignores. 
--------
308-> THE GALLANT SIXTEENTH.
I see by to-day's Herald that the President has decided to send the troops at Huntsville, Ala., to Cuba, the middle of October. Can it be possible that they seriously think of sending these men back there to die of disease? Take for an example the Sixteenth Infantry -- a regiment which fought so magnificently at Santiago that foreign as well as American journals paid them the most glowing tributes of praise. 
--------
309-> Another List.
I am glad to send you the following list of books that, in my humble opinion, give the best ideas of early life in the New England Colonies 
--------
310-> THE MUSIC OF YESTERDAY.; " Pagliacci" and "Cavalleria Rusticana" by the Royal Italian Company.
Something might be done to popularize good opera with such material as there is in the Royal Italian Opera Company, now singing at the Casino, if there were more human intelligence among Italian singers. One wonders at the prodigal waste of vocal energy and the blazing outpour of tropical temperament unguided by any sound understanding of theatrical values. 
--------
311-> RELIEF WORK IN THE WAR; Report of the President of Auxiliary II. of the Red Cross. AIDING SOLDIERS' FAMILIES Instances of Mothers' and Children's Distress -- Employment Given to 139 Women for Five Months.
The amount of work done by the women of the country to aid the soldiers and their families this past Summer will never be fully known, but occasionally it is possible in following individual organizations to form some idea of its extent. 
--------
312-> GOV. BLACK'S TOUR ENDS; Returns to Washington After Visiting New York Troops in Their Camps. MANAGEMENT OF HOSPITALS Evil Effect of the Long Encampment at Chickamauga Park -- Food Found to be Good and Well Cooked.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 2. -- Gov. Frank S. Black and party of New York arrived in Washington late this afternoon from a trip, during which there were visited the mobilization camps at Chickamauga Park, Lexington, Ky., and Huntsville, Ala.

314-> OLD ENEMIES AND NEW FRIENDS.
A correspondent whose letter we published Thursday recalled the fact that England and the United States, now such enthusiastic friends, were saying, not many months ago, the harshest sort of things about each other, and seemed much more likely to add a new war to their record as neighbors than to forget those of the past.

Further consideration of the language problem which is raised by the acquisition of Puerto Rico by the United States emphasizes the opinion, expressed in this column, that vastly better results will come from the learning of English by the islanders than from making a knowledge of Spanish an essential qualification of American officials sent down there to administer civil and military functions.

360-> THE ROMAN CHURCH IN OUR NEW POSSESSIONS.
How is the Roman Catholic Church establishment to be supported in Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines while those island colonies are under our control and protection? Spain is a Catholic country.

--------
364-> "MORE TROUBLE WITH SPAIN"?
Gen. WHEELER'S opinion that we are going to have more trouble with Spain over the Philippines will not be shared by many of his countrymen.

365-> THE SICKNESS AT CAMP ALGER.; Surgeons Report the Typhoid Epidemic Well Under Control.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 6. -- The question of the removal of the First Division from Camp Alger depends upon the recommendation of Gen. Butler, who is inspecting the ground at Manassas.

In your SATURDAY REVIEW of Nov. 19 there is a letter taking to task one of your contributors, who wrote a review of a book on "The Magic of the Horseshoe," because he, in the course of his review, implied that the horseshoe and the cross of Christ were not in the same category of symbols, and declared that the horseshoe was "unworthy even to be named in connection with the Sacred Cross."

383-> Texts from Science.
A phenomenon of modern progress is the utilization of what are known as by-products -- things that one does not set out to save, but expects to throw away as the refuse from the things he is making.

M. Moissan, so well-known for his researches with the aid of the electric furnace, described recently before the French Academy of Sciences the preparation and properties of calcium nitride, a body which, could it only be produced at a reasonable rate, would once for all solve the question of the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen, and consequently also the direct production of ammonia from the air.

388-> JOINT TRAFFIC DECISION; Board of Managers Delays Action in the Matter. RAILROAD MEN NOT SURPRISED Two Presidents Say the Decision Will Not Be Demoralizing in Its Effect.
The Board of Managers of the Joint Traffic Association met as usual yesterday at 143 Liberty Street. At the instance of the Chairman, Horace J.

--------
390-> WASHINGTON IRVING'S MANNERS
It was an unwritten law in the environment amid which the present writer was reared that the best way to deal with a slight, a slur, or an adverse criticism upon one's self or one's friends was to let it die a natural death from neglect as quickly as possible, rather than to fan it into a longer life by spirited resentment, and thus give it over to general notice and discussion.

VIENNA, Sept. 3. -- If living exhibits were admitted to the Vienna Police Show at the Jubilee Exposition, then Julius Raidl, a young artisan, twenty-seven years old, would be its greatest ornament and attraction. He has secured for himself a name in criminal annals. He calls himself the King of the Burglars, and certainly there is nobody in the past or present that can beat his score. 
--------
392-> Editorial Article 2 -- No Title
Military experts have professed some dissatisfaction with our little war because it left many problems unsolved and developed no particularly new methods of destroying life and property. But though the experts complain, they have not failed to note the defensive value of barbed wire as used by the Spaniards. 
--------
393-> AMEND THE BALLOT LAW.
What better means of putting into practice Justice Van Wyck's declaration that municipal issues should govern in municipal contests, State issues in State elections, and, by deduction. National issues in National elections, than by an amendment to the ballot law which would bring home to the voter the three separate and distinct areas of government by placing in his hands a ballot for each branch? 
--------
394-> ODD CHARACTERS SEEN AT THE ASTOR LIBRARY.
A FEW years now and the Astor Library will be no more. Like many another famous building of New York, it will have vanished into a past that comes back only in kind memories. That in its stead another and far greater building will arise -- the Lenox, Tilden, and Astor foundations, the New York Public Library, as it is to be known -- does not alter the case.

Three of her boats were gone, ventilators were demolished, and temporary rails marked the breaches made by the seas. 
--------
399-> Wages and Elizabethan Legislation.
The attempts of Elizabethan legislation to fix wages by statute and to secure greater fixity of labor are well known, but perhaps few of us realize thelr extreme rigor. A servant, refusing to work for statute wages, or leaving his work wlthout "giving a quarter's warning, is naturally open to be brought before a Magistrate and "bound over to the Sessions." 
--------
400-> SOME CONSERVATIVE ADVICE.
The boom at New York still continues and the volume of trading and advance in prices during the week were record breakers. 
--------
401-> "STANDING BY" ALDRIDGE.
The purpose of "the organization" to "stand by" Mr. ALDRIDGE in his present trials, with the emphatic indorsement of him and Mr. ADAMS as "honest" and "conscientious" by Lieut. Gov. WOODRUFF, presents a curious phase of morality.

Police Commissioner Abell last night launched his boom for reappointment by a dinner given in his honor at the Clarendon Hotel, Brooklyn.

405-> THE CURRENCY AND AN EXTRA SESSION.

PLAINFIELD, N.J., Dec. 25. -- Through the generosity of Mayor Fisk there was no need of a single person's going without a Christmas dinner here to-day. Several days ago Mayor Fisk gave Mrs. W.A.

SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 14. -- When Walter Rosser, the Tennessee volunteer who is charged with the murder of Henry Hildebrand, a clerk in the Spreckels Market during a drunken spree, was booked at the City Prison, he began to recover from his intoxication.

Crawford of Dallas, Texas, who spoke in opposition to free silver coinage. Judge Crawford said that the adoption of the ratio of 16 to 1 would mean, not bimetallism, but silver monometallism, and that bimetallism could exist only on the statute books.

415-> BIG DEFICIT IN HOLYOKE.
SPRINGFIELD, Mass., Oct. 13. -- At a meeting of the Finance Committee of the Holyoke City Government this afternoon, Mr. Estes, the expert accountant employed to examine the books of ex-Tax Collector Keough, made a partial report, showing an apparent deficit of about $118,000.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 3. -- Despite the fact that to-day has been another record-breaker in the matter of heat, the politicians and contractors have contrived to make a rather busy time of it. Governors and political leaders have been besieging the Secretary of War's office to have volunteers discharged from service, so that they might return to their homes. 
--------
421-> GOSSIP OF THE HORSEMEN; Many Fine Horses Entered for the Meet on the Bennings Race Track. GOOD FORM IS LOOKED FOR Western Men Said to Have Formed a Syndicate to Bid on Star Pointer -- Nathan Straus's Crack Roadster.
There are enough horses stabled on and around the grounds of the Bennings race track to furnish large fields for the meeting, and only fair weather is needed to make the meeting a success. Every stall on the grounds has an occupant, and there is a demand for additional stable accommodation outside of the track. 
--------
422-> MAROON UPRISING IN JAMAICA.; It Is Denied by the Government that It Was Serious.
KINGSTON, Jamaica, Oct. 1. -- Official reports absolutely contradict the stories in circulation about Maroon outbreaks sent out from Port Antonio. The only foundation for the reports was that a small party of Maroons attempted to seize some disputed property, which necessitated the forcible ejection of the Maroons by the police. 
--------
423-> GIRL MURDERED BY A BOY; He Shot Her in a Fit of Jealousy, then Attempted His Own Life. HAD ASKED FOR FINAL MEETING Tragedy Occurred in the Hallway of the Victim's House -- His Wounds May Prove Fatal.

--------
424-> TRAGEDY OR COMEDY?
I KNEW George Arbuthnot pretty well for two years -- ever since he had been married, in fact -- and considered him a rising fellow in the literary world. He had not done anything very great, but his work was distinctly promising, and his name was gradually making itself known. 
--------
425-> THIS WONDERFUL YEAR.; Epitome of Events Which Have Crowded and Distinguished It.
Whoever concerns himself with history in the making takes all the world for his province, and seldom has there come a year more wonderful than this. It has seen every State in Europe, except peaceful Scandinavia and the Dutch communities, face to face with either war or internal dissolution -- some of them within measurable distance of both. 
--------
426-> THE BUTTERFLY BOOK.
BUTTERFLIES are far more easily collected and studied than birds; there are as many different species in America as there are of birds, and the colors of the butterflies are more variegated and beautiful. 
--------
427-> Editorial Article 3 -- No Title
The inter-imperial penny postage called by the London correspondent of THE NEW YORK TIMES a handsome Christmas gift that Britannia presents to her children might more fittingly be characterized as "a most self-sacrificing gift of the children to the mother country," more especially as some of the smaller children are likely to suffer acutely because of it. 
--------
428-> Capt. Capron's Gallant Feat.
Army officers and National Guardsmen have not forgotten a notable incident on the Presidio grounds in the early part of 1893, when the courage and superb horsemanship of Capron saved the lives of a woman and her two children. It was on a morning when the First Troop of California Cavalry, then under the command of Capt. Blumenberg, was at drill on the large parade ground. 
--------
429-> CAVE-IN ON THIRD AVENUE; Three Persons Carried Down with a Pile of Paving Stones. PANIC IN NEAR-BY TENEMENTS Wall Paper Cracked and Tenants, Fearing the Houses Would Collapse, Rushed to the Street.
There was excitement in the neighborhood of Ninety-eight Street and Third Avenue last night when a section of pavement fifteen feet square suddenly gave way, and two men and a woman who were walking over it dropped out of sight.

William Travers Gray, Charles H. Bean, Jacob Field, and James H. Parker were elected yesterday to membership in the New York Stock Exchange. Each paid about $25,000 for his seat, the highest price paid in five years, and more than $10,000 over the rate which prevailed in 1896. None of the new members will escape the initiatory hazing on "the Floor."

--------
434-> The Negro and English School Children.
The negro is not so well known as one might expect, considering that geography is widely and often excellently taught in our primary schools. The ideas most frequently expressed concerning him are that he is black and a foreigner.

435-> DEATH OF JOSEPH H. WALSH.; Albany Man Stricken While Bathing at Asbury Park.
ASBURY PARK, N.J., Aug. 6. -- Joseph H. Walsh of Albany dropped dead this afternoon at the Fourth Avenue bathing grounds. He was just entering the water when he fell. Medical aid was summoned and artificial respiration tried, but to no avail.

437-> AT MANHATTAN BEACH.
Besides the usual features of entertainment at Manhattan Beach, much interest has centred during the past week in the preparations for the water carnival, which occurs next Tuesday.

When the returns from the botanizing expedition the New York Botanical Garden is to send to Puerto Rico, under the patronage of the President of the garden, Cornelius Vanderbilt, are ready to be added to the already large museum collection, there will probably be a building ready to receive it. The garden has been developing rapidly in all lines this last Summer. 
--------
441-> ANARCHISM AND NATIONALITY.
It was almost inevitable that the brutal murder of the Austrian Empress by an Anarchist who happens to be an Italian should arouse demonstrations against Italians in Austria. That might not be the case if the relations between the countries were not already strained. As a matter of fact, they have been strained ever since the Austrians entered Italy. 
--------
442-> THE UTAH SENATORSHIP.; Mr. Cannon a Candidate for Re-election -- Rival with $50,000 a Day Income.
SALT LAKE CITY, Utah, Nov. 18. -- Although it is little more than a week since the result of the election giving the Democrats sweeping control of the Legislature of this State was announced, the Senatorial contest is now fairly under way, and promises to be decidedly interesting. On joint ballot the Democrats have 48 votes and the Republicans 15. 
--------
443-> THE PENALTY OF DEATH.
It is likely to be a difficult task to convince the people, or even the few who think and reason for the people, that criminology is a most useful science; and that the utility of the methods which have brought this science to its present state must be so impressed upon lawmakers and jurists as to produce radical changes in the existing systems of criminal jurisprudence. 
--------
444-> MANILA AND MONROE DOCTRINE; Aguinaldo, the Insurgent Chief, Says American Have Freed the Rebels and Should Now Withdraw.

--------
447-> MERIVALE.; An Autobiography Showing Him to Have Been Less of a Churchman than of a Scholar.
Dr. Charles Merivale, sometime Dean of Ely, or better known as the writer of that incomparable history, the "Romans Under the Empire," recorded the reminiscences of his early life in an autobiographical form. This he dedicated to his own family, and now after the Dean's death the autobiography has been printed for private circulation. 
--------
448-> NEW YORK STREET SCENES.
A FEW hours spent in walking about the streets of New York will disclose to an observing person more novel sights and a larger variety of entertainment than can be found in any museum or theatre. The ever-changing street scenes afford a "continuous performance" of the deepest human interest by the most realistic of actors. 
--------
449-> MAJOR MARCHAND.
One of the painful things about the French pretension that Major MARCHAND is in occupation of Fashoda by right of conquest is the falseness of the position in which that pretension puts a gallant and much-enduring man. He is really entitled to be regarded as one of the glories of France. 
--------
450-> CAPT. CHANLER'S CAMPAIGN; Congressman Quigg's Opponent Addresses Several Large Meetings. HIS SPEECH AT LION PARK He Criticises Col. Roosevelt's Political Tactics and Denounces Algerism -- His Talk to Colored Voters.

452-> PRINCETON'S FOOTBALL TEAM.; It Is Rapidly Getting Into Condition -- Some of the Men Who Are Likely to Get on the Team.
PRINCETON, N.J., Oct. 1. -- This week has been productive of great results in the football circles of Princeton University. Within six days the coaches have gotten together a team that bids fair to do honor to the orange and black before the end of the season. That such rapid strides in the formation of the team should be made would have been believed impossible in past years. 
--------
453-> SPAIN TO REJECT OUR TERMS?; Reported in Paris that She Will Not Give Up the Philippines Without Compensation.
PARIS, Nov. 1. -- The French papers derive their news of the work of the Peace Commisssions from Spanish sources, and therefore the morning papers here to-day are interesting as indicating the atmosphere in Spanish quarters and the trend of French views and tendencies. 
--------
454-> THE PHILIPPINES.
Our demand upon Spain, made yesterday, for all the Philippines, is made when it has just been almost authoritatively given out that Spain will retire from the negotiations if that claim is pressed without an offer of compensation. Our demand does not seem to exclude the notion of compensation, and of course the compensation would be pecuniary.

455-> MICHIGAN BANKER FAILS.; D.F. Parsons of Burr Oak Makes an Assignment.
STURGIS, Mich., Sept. 14. -- The bank of D.F. Parsons, at Burr Oak, six miles east of Sturgis, failed to open its doors this morning, an assignment having been made the night before. A.C. Hilbaugh of Burr Oak is assignee. Mr. Parsons has been engaged in the banking business in Burr Oak for thirty-five years. 
--------
456-> Verse from the Muse of Medford.
We have Milton's authority for speaking of a muse as masculine. (Lycidas, l., 21,) therefore it is allowable to say that the muse of Medford, inspired by the legends of Maine, has given to the world the legend of Moosehead. The short, irregular lines, beginning each with a capital and occasionally rhyming, show that this legend is poetry; most of it, at least, for there are some prose passages. 
--------
457-> Do Fishes Sleep?
" Do fishes sleep -- and how?" This Question was addressed to Eugene G. Blackford, formerly Fish Commissioner of New York State. His acquaintance with fish began when he was very young, and at the present time he is a recognized authority all over the world.

458-> AN EXCITING NIGHT IN CAMP.; Ex-Rough Riders Dance Around a Big Bon Fire in Disregard of Taps.
MONTAUK, L.I., Sept. 14. -- With the exception of Col. Roosevelt and a few of the officers, the Rough Riders are out of the Government service.

--------
461-> ASSAULT ON SNOW TO-DAY; Mr. McCartney Plans a Campaign of Extermination. HE MAKES A LIST OF STREETS They Will Be Cleaned This Time, Not Piled, He Says -- His Inspection Tour.
Commissioner McCartney is out with a list of streets that are to be cleaned today. This time, he says, cleaned means cleaned, not piled. He made this distinction when it was pointed out to him that a number of the streets in the list have been included in the lists given out before. One case in point is in the matter of Thirty-fourth Street, from Sixth Avenue to the North River. 
--------
462-> GRAIN PILING UP A BUFFALO.; 16,000,000 Bushels Afloat and in Store -- The Blockade Unprecedented.
BUFFALO, Dec. 15. -- The grain blockade at this port is unprecedented. At noon to-day fully eighty large steamers were in the river waiting to be unloaded or frozen in. They carry about 9,000,000 bushels of grain, while the elevators contain 7,000,000 bushels. Such vast accumulations have never before existed here, and ice is forming so rapidly that the vessels will be forced to winter in this port.

CINCINNATI, Oct 1. -- Hawley kept the St. Louis' hits scattered in the first game and won. Coleman, once a St. Louis pitcher, but now a member of the Sixth Regiment, pitched the second game for the Cincinnatis, and was hit hard in the last three innings. Scores:

In your article on "The Two Parties in New York," replying to the inquiry "Why you are now not the supporters of the present Republican nominee for Governor, Theodore Roosevelt," you say, "For our part we do not think the danger of a silver triumph is so great as to constrain us to listen to the Republican appeals to make National issues paramount."

466-> BATTLED OVER FAMILY TROCHA.; Pierce Struggle Between Seller of Meat and Vendor of Fruit.
NEWARK, N.J., Oct. 26. -- As a result of the crossing of an imaginary trocha, drawn down the middle of a store at 182 Broome street, there was a family quarrel yesterday afternoon, and Mrs. Rosa Amada stands accused of atrocious assault upon Jacob Hochberg.

PARIS, Oct. 26. -- Although there is evidence of suppressed excitement on all sides here, there has been no disturbance of public order up to the prsent to-day. The police and Municipal Guards are out in strong force, and they will not permit the crowds to assume dangerous strength. But the situation was eagerly discussed by exicited groups in the main streets. 
--------
469-> THE GERMANS IN CHICAGO; Death Casts Gloom and Sorrow Over the Opening of Their Social Season. NEGLECT OF TROOPS RESENTED Efforts to Atone for the Government's Faults -- Pacific Garden Mission -- Frequent Crimes Against School Children.
CHICAGO, Sept. 24. -- In this cosmopolitan town there are so many social cliques, divided more or less by the accident of nationality, that what affects one is a matter of indifference to the other. Yet, while it is the doings of the smart Americans that occupy the society columns, there are many other social sets in which intellectuality is prized, and where elegance and luxury are displayed. 
--------
470-> How Longfellow Wrote Some of His Poems.
In my correspondence from England a few weeks ago a paper was inclosed cut from the pages of a periodical not read on this side of the Atlantic. Therefore, it is safe to assume that the following condensation of how Longfellow wrote his best-known poems will be new to the readers of THE TIMES'S SATURDAY REVIEW, and will be read with interest by them. 
--------
471-> THE REPUBLICAN PARTY ON TRIAL.
' A political party which can not or will not purge it.e'f of Its corrupt and corrupting leaders and officials, regardless of consequences to the party, is unworthy of the confidence of an honest, free, and intelligent electorate. 
--------
472-> SOME NEW GLOVES.
OMEN will see something worth looking at this Fall when they go to choose their gloves. That delightful feminine pastime will offer a field large enough to satisfy the most fastidious. Not that there will be an abundance of novelties; there never is in gloves. 
--------
473-> THE DEPARTURE FROM ATLANTA.; Mr. McKinley to Visit Other Southern Cities During His Trip.
ATLANTA, Ga., Dec. 15. -- The Presidential party will leave Atlanta at 1 o'clock tonight for Tuskegee, Ala. The trip will be made over the Atlanta and West Point Railroad to Chehaw, Ala.

--------
474-> The Devil Fish.
When a youngster I was homeward bound from Sant' Ana with a cargo of mahogany, and when off Cape Campeche was one calm afternoon leaning over the taffrail, looking down into the blue profound, on the watch for fsh. A gloomy shade came over the bright water, and up rose a fearsome monster some eighteen feet across, and in general outline more like a skate or ray than anything else, all except the head. 
--------
475-> THE BUDGET FOR NEXT YEAR.; Provision Made for the Payment of Interest on Bonds for Many Public Works.
That the city administration contemplates making many public improvements during 1899 was evidenced by a report published in The City Record yesterday in which the details of the budget for next year were set forth. Provision is made for the payment of interest on bonds for many public works which have been hung up on account of the debt limit. 
--------
476-> FAILED FOR A MILLION.; Recently Enriched Kansas Cattle Dealer's Prosperity Suddenly Brought to a Finish.
ABILENE, Kan., Nov. 25. -- A failure involving cattle interests throughout the Southwest was precipitated here to-day when an attachment suit for $40,000 was filed against Grant C. Gillett of Woodbine by the Gillespie Commission Company of Kansas City. Gillett controls thousands of cattle on the Southwestern ranges, and his liabilities are believed to be over a million dollars. 
--------
477-> OUTRAGES BY AN ARBITRARY POLICE.
I never saw Mr. William J. Logan, nor had I heard of him until his summary arrest and holding to bail in the night as the builder of a gasholder that had unaccountably burst moved me anew to indignation and alarm at the fantastic tricks of officious blockheads intoxicated with power which they have no sense to use. 
--------
478-> SPAIN IS STILL WRIGGLING; Affects to Doubt that Our Offer for the Philippines Is Final. COUNTER-PROPOSALS GALORE For Nominal Sovereignty in the Islands Would Give Up Other Colonies -- President McKinley Says No.
PARIS, Nov. 25. -- It is now known that Spain will exhaust her time limit, which expires on Monday, before replying to the American offer regarding the Philippine Islands. In the meanwhile the Spaniards are canvassing the entire field and exhausting every source to postpone the inevitable.

In the study of living forms, from the protozoa to the mammals, and from the protophytes to the seed plants, we find certain changes and conditions characteristic of old age. In the human subject the principal changes which we note are atrophic and degenerative in their nature. 
--------
481-> UNIVERSITY CHESS CONTEST; Columbia, Harvard, Yale, and Princeton Represented. E.E. SOUTHARD'S CLEVER PLAY Wins a Good Game from Bell, Who Resigns After the Twenty-seventh Move.

--------
482-> STRIKING LADIES' TAILORS.; A Prospect that a Co-operative Shop May Be Established for Them.
There is a prospect that the striking ladies' tailors will be put to work in a co-operative shop to be started by the wealthy residents of this city. Measures were taken last night at a meeting of the Social Reform Club that may lead to such a state of affairs. For several months these tailors have been on strike through some differences with the employers. 
--------
483-> THE NICARAGUA CANAL.; Visit of the President of Costa Rica at This Time Considered Opportune.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 25. -- President Iglesias of Costa Rica, accompanied by members of his staff and Col.

--------
484-> CLOSE OF THE WILBOUR SALE.; Chicago Man Paid the Sum of $2,000 for John Randolph's Table.

Mr. JOHN G. CARLISLE, as a distinguished representative of the Democratic Party, has joined Mr. EDMUNDS, an equally honored member of the Republican Party, and Mr. SCHURZ, the recognized leader of the Independents, in protest against "a career of conquest and annexation," and a plea for "the peaceful continental policy which has heretofore characterized our National course." 
--------
487-> Austin Corbin Estate Wins a Suit.
BOSTON, Oct. 26. -- Judge Lathrop of the Supreme Court to-day rendered a decision in the case of the New England Mortgage Security Company vs. J.F.F. Brewster and others, holding that the "Austin Corbin party," so called, is entitled to have counted its votes which were cast at the annual meeting of the corporation, held some time ago, and that William G. Bosworth of New York and Austin Corbin, Jr., are, respectively, President and Treasurer. 
--------
488-> Sir Herbert Kitchener.
Gens. Hunter and Rundle had already distinguished themselves in the Khedival service before Kitchener became their chief; Macdonald also, Lewis, Maxwell, and others had joined the Egyptian Army under another Sirdar, but a crowd of good men owed their appointment to Kitchener. He has ever tried to get the best assistance possible; he is a judge of character, and he has been very fair and public-spirited in the use of his patronage. 
--------
489-> "ALL THAT IS POSSIBLE."
When President McKINLEY met the Commissioners whom he has finally persuaded to "investigate" the conduct of the War Department, in compliance with a request from the Secretary of War, he made a statement to them of his views and wishes. This is an unusual and somewhat theatrical way of going about a serious piece of public business. 
--------
490-> A SHARP REMINDER.
The President's investigating committee is a thing of shreds and patches. The men of real competence for the work, the men whose grading would have had weight with the country, have declined to serve. They would not be sent on such a fool's errand. The President deceived himself if he supposed that LAMONT, LINCOLN, or ENDICOTT would accept places on a commission having no standing in law and no power to get at the facts. 
--------
491-> ALGER AT JACKSONVILLE; He Tells of the Great Task of Organizing and Supplying an Army in War. HIS JESTS WITH GENERAL LEE Declares that the War Department Has Been Unjustly Criticised -- Finds Good Conditions at Camp Cuba Libre.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Sept. 25. -- Secretary Alger, and party, consisting of Gen. Sternberg, Surgeon General; Gen. Ludington, Quartermasters, and others, spent the day in Jacksonville visiting the camp of the Seventh Corps. The party was met at the station by Gen. Lee and a committee of citizens.

The officials of the City Government were jubilant yesterday over the decision of the Court of Appeals in the case of the People against Keller, affecting the civil service rules, which were handed down on Tuesday. The question which has been under dispute since last Spring was recognized as a vital one by the Municipal Administration, affecting nearly every appointment made by the Mayor since the formation of the greater city. 
--------
493-> On Heroes' Rights.
In the interesting paper, written by Mr. Bangs, on "Heroes' Rights," in THE TIMES'S last SATURDAY REVIEW, the obligations of creators to their creations is most ably discussed. It is a subject I have long thought of, and never, to my knowledge, seen or heard brought forward as an argument. 
--------
494-> THE AMERICAN SHIPBUILDERS.
Nobody now can entertain any doubt that the order restricting to American bottoms both the trade between Puerto Rico and the United States and the coastwise trade of the island itself was a great blunder. Even if, upon mature consideration, Congress might decide to keep in force the obsolete navigation laws of the seventeenth century, there was no reason why the President should anticipate its decision. 
--------
495-> THE CART-TAIL CAMPAIGN.; Odd Things Heard at Political Meetings on the Extreme East and West Sides.
The cart-tail campaign all over town, particularly on the extreme east and west sides of town, goes merrily on, and at last accounts honors seemed to be about even between the Republican and Democratic orators, both being equally lusty as to lung and argument. The cart-tail orator, there can be no doubt, takes himself seriously, and goes on amusing his fellow-citizens by the vigor with which he seeks to impress his arguments upon them. 
--------
496-> FLOUR MILL TRUST IS DEAD.; Minneapolis Men Decline to Accept the McIntyre Proposition.
MINNEAPOLIS, Minn., Dec. 15. -- Thomas McIntyre's scheme for a flour mill trust is dead. The Minneapolis millers settled its fate yesterday afternoon at a meeting held in the offices of the Pillsbury-Washburn Company. 
--------
497-> SOME CHARACTERISTICS OF A COOPER UNION AUDIENCE.
At a meeting of the People's Institute, held at Cooper Union last Friday evening, some interesting problems were suggested by the discussion which took place concerning our policy in regard to the Philippines, but quite as much food for thought was to be found in the attitude of the audience as in the remarks of the speakers. 
--------
498-> ONE MAN SHOOTS ELEVEN; A Wisconsin Workman's Revenge Upon Practical Jokers. BROUGHT DOWN BY A BULLET He Yields Only When Wounded by an Expert Marksman Under the City Marshal's Direction.
BEAVER DAM, Wis., Nov. 1. -- Adam Hammer, an employe of the J.S. Rowell Manufacturing Company, went gunning today for human game, and as a result eleven men bear wounds from his aim, and he is in jail with a bullet in his shoulder. 
--------
499-> COMAL TO LAND HER CARGO.; Spanish Authorities Agree that No Duty Shall Be Exacted on the Supplies She Carries.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 25. -- A statement was issued by the War Department tonight that the Cuban Commission had effected an arrangement with the Spanish authorities whereby the steamer Comal, carrying a cargo of supplies for the suffering people of Cuba, would be permitted to land her cargo at Matanzas free of duty. This is the text of the War Department's statement: 
--------
500-> CURRENT NOTES.
California's State University is faring particularly well at the hands of the women of the State. The rebuilding of the university quadrangle on a plan that is very imposing will cost Mrs. Phoebe Hearst something like $1,000,000, and now Miss Jennie Flood has given it the Flood country seat at Menlo Park, estimated to be worth $2,500,000.

--------
504-> MILITARY PLOT IN PARIS; Alleged Conspiracy Discovered to Overthrow the Republic and Revive the Monarchy. LEADING GENERALS INVOLVED Rumors Connect Prince Louis Bonaparte, the New Leader of the Imperialist Party, with the Affair -- Officials Reticent.
PARIS, Oct. 14. -- It was announced here this morning that a military plot against the Government had been discovered. The Rappel, Aurore, and Petite Republique Francaise published almost identical stories on the subject, to the effect that the plot was discovered by a General holding an important position.

--------
508-> THE BOSTON ORCHESTRA.; Second Evening Concert of the Thirteenth Season at Carnegie Hall.
The fourth concert of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the second in its series of evening performances took place last night at Carnegie Hall. The audience was much larger than that which attended the afternoon concert of the previous day, and, as is to be expected of an evening assembly, was much more courageous in the award of commendation. 
--------
509-> DEATH'S DEADLIEST WEAPON.; Theory of Malaria, Now Ravaging Our Volunteers' Ranks.
Malaria claims more victims than any other disease. The annual aggregate runs into several millions. A scientific commission has been appointed to investigate the mode of dissemination of malarial poison. 
--------
510-> NORTHERN PACIFIC LAND GRANT; Washington Legislative Committee Thinks that the Present Company's Holding Is Unlawful.
TACOMA, Washington, Dec. 26. -- The Fusion Government of this State will probably endeavor to have the Northern Pacific land grant in this State set aside by the Federal court. The grant consists of nearly nine million acres, valued at several million dollars. The last Legislature appointed a committee to investigate the legal status of the company's land grant. 
--------
511-> THE ADJUTANT GENERAL.
Adjt. Gen. CORBIN, who is commonly regarded in the United States Army, and we believe with substantial justice, as its worst enemy, has been giving some skillful and interesting testimony before the House Committee on Military Affairs. When we say that the army regards the Adjutant General as its worst enemy, we do not at all lose sight of the Secretary of War. 
--------
512-> Malaria -- Its Transmission.
The Madagascar campaign affords a striking lesson as regards the importance of aerial transmission. To facilitate the transportation of baggage into the interior of the island the French Government had supplied its troops with metallic wagonettes, so constructed that they could be floated across streams. For one cause or another it was soon found that they could not be used, and the construction of a cross-country road was determined upon. 
--------
513-> LEAVING PUERTO RICO.; Admiral Schley Thinks the Evacuation of the Island Will Be Completed by the 6th Inst.
SAN JUAN DE PUERTO RICO, Oct. 1. -- The Spanish transport Isla de Panay arrived here this morning, and a second transport is expected to-morrow or Monday. These, with a hospital ship which will come from Havana to remove a number of sick troops, will carry away about 3,500 Spanish soldiers.

GREAT NECK, L.I., Sept. 2. -- Ground was broken in this village to-day for the erection of a memorial parish house, to be connected with the All Saints' Episcopal Church. When completed it will have cost $16,000. The plans for the building were drawn by Hein  La Farge, architects of the new Cathedral of St. John's, which is being erected in Manhattan. 
--------
515-> PROBING THE SUGAR TRUST.; Stockholder Van Benthuysen Cites Some Law to Counsel John E. Parsons.
Watson Van Benthuysen of New Orleans, the stockholder of the American Sugar Refining Company whose efforts to obtain certain specific information regarding the affairs of that company were described in this newspaper on the morning of Nov. 10, was requested by John E. Parsons, counsel for the corporation, to cite to him any law that entitled a stockholder of a corporation to know the holdings of other stockholders. 
--------
516-> PROMOTION FROM THE RANKS.
One notable fact about the plans for the enlargement of the army, involving its reorganization, must have struck plain people with wonder. We have referred to it before, but we make no apology for referring to it again, for in our judgment the question which it raises is the most important and far-reaching now before the American people. 
--------
517-> Harold Frederic and the Prussian Lieutenant.
Harold Frederic's self-confidence and power of dominating strangers stood him in good stead in one of his first visits -- if not his very first visit -- to Berlin. The incident as he related it seemed natural enough to an American not brought up in awe of a military caste, but to those who knew Germany it was almost surprising that he came through it with his life. 
--------
518-> MADE A LONG TRIP TO VOTE.; Journey of 8,000 Miles to Cast a Ballot in Iowa.
CHICAGO, Oct. 26. -- Thomas C. Dawson, First Secretary of the United States Legation at Rio Janeiro, has made a journey of nearly eight thousand miles to vote. His home is in Council Bluffs, Iowa, to which place he went to-night from the Lexington Hotel.

PRINCETON, N.J., Oct. 26. -- Pennsylvania State College held the Princeton players down to 5 points in a game this afternoon that exceeded in fierceness any struggle the Tigers have been through this season.

--------

Capt. David Roach has the name of having an eye single to business, and it was a matter of come astonishment to his crew when, shortly after sunrise yesterday morning, his tug, the Edward M. Timmins, making down the bay looking for a tow, was swung suddenly from her course toward the Brooklyn shore and toward a small boat in which sat a man bolt upright and motionless. 
--------
523-> PERSECUTION OF PICQUART; New Attempt to Suppress the Dreyfus Witness Stirs Paris. APPEAL TO THE GOVERNMENT Protest Against the Court-Martial Ordered by the Military Governor Being Signed by Public Men.
PARIS, Nov. 25. -- The Picquart case seems in the way of raising even a greater storm than the Dreyfus affair. The papers favorable to the General Staff are dumb in the face of the barefaced decision of the Military Governor of Paris, Gen. Zurlinden, to try Col. Picquart by court-martial, while those favoring revision are furious at this new attempt to defeat justice, and protest against the court-martial being ordered. 
--------
524-> KILLED BY STOLEN GAS.; Attempt of Jersey City Man to Cheat Gas Company Ends in His Death and Narrow Escape of Another.
John Lyon a saloon keeper at Henderson Street and Railroad Avenue, Jersey City, lost his life yesterday as the result of an attempt to cheat the gas company. Thomas Murphy of 168 Bay Street, Jersey City, had a narrow escape from being a second victim. 
--------
525-> Thackeray Unjustly Assailed.
I shall probably argue myself singularly benighted when I ask, Who is Prof. Sedgwick? quoted in last Saturday's issue of THE TIMES'S SATURDAY REVIEW so much to his discredit? I feel that every true lover of Thackeray owes you a vote of thanks for your answer to Prof. Sedgwick. Much more might have been justly said in refutation of such unjust criticism, but it scarcely deserves more serious consideration than you have given it. 
--------
526-> GRIP DRIVES GIRL TO SUICIDE.; Jane L. Ackerman, a Convalescent, Leaps from Fifth-Story Window.
Jane L. Ackerman, nineteen years old, ended her life yesterday because of an attack of the grip which had developed into pneumonia.

--------
527-> Editorial Article 1 -- No Title
It will be interesting to see how the two men arrested on Sunday as "habitual criminals" will fare to-day when they are brought up for examination. The officer who arrested them claimed before Magistrate MOTT that the entrance of two men known to be of this class into a public conveyance together was sufficient evidence of their criminal intent to warrant their arrest, and in this he was sustained by the District Attorney's office. 
--------
528-> HOTEL MAN SHOT AND ROBBED.; Ex-Postmaster of Duryea, Penn., Murdered by Burglars, His Servant Gagged and Bound.
SCRANTON, Penn., Dec. 3. -- Michael F. Corcoran, proprietor of the Anthracite Hotel at Duryea, was murdered in the most cold-blooded manner by burglars early today.

--------
529-> MEN IN LOCAL HOSPITALS; Major Daniel M. Appel Prepares a List of Sick Soldiers Under Treatment Hereabout. REVISED FROM DAY TO DAY Hundreds of Disabled Men Now in Institutions in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and the Forts of the Harbor.

--------
531-> "LEGAL TENDER" AND LEGAL TENDER.
We may observe a due respect to the Supreme Court, and conform to its decisions in act, and still maintain the respect we deem due to our own mind. We are thankful that we know both the limits of freedom and freedom itself. The former are in the human relations, the latter is in the free mind. With this "mystic utterance" and confession of faith, let us proceed. 
--------
532-> THE PANAMA CANAL.
Last Sunday week I read with much interest the lucid and businesslike extract you published of Gen. Abbot's remarkable paper in The Forum concerning the Panama Canal. A friend of mine called my attention this morning to a disparaging article published in last Sunday's Sun about the canal, which it calls "de Lesseps's big ditch." 
--------

Mr. Cox, who was recently assaulted near Peking, has had many similar experiences during the dozen years he has been railroad building in the Chihli Province, and has only extricated himself by dint of tact, pluck, and good humor. He has practically for years carried his life in his hand. 
--------
536-> TIPS AND FOGS OF LONDON; Odd Things Seen by a Stranger in the British Metropolis. AN EXPERIENCE IN THE FOG Confusing Irregularities of London's Streets -- American Girl's Tribute to General Gordon.
They told me to wait until I saw "London Town." The big steamship was gliding between the white cliffs of Lisbon Bay, and the next place was "London Town." We plowed our way through the waters of the Bay of Biscay and the River Thames, and for breakfast, luncheon, afternoon tea, dinner, and dreams I heard of nothing else but the glories, the wonders, and the people of "London Town." 
--------
537-> Pekin.
Pekin struck me as extraordinarily backward after the evidences of progress I had seen and heard of in other parts of China, even in such places as Chang-sha, the capital of Hunan, where no European resides. In the latter town electric light has been installed by the Chinese themselves in several dwelling houses. 
--------
538-> ART TOPICS OF THE WEEK.
The week which closes to-day has brought almost too much of art incident for the average art student or lover. The short days of the waning year have been all too brief for the proper study or enjoyment of the several club and public displays, and particularly of the exhibition of loaned portraits at the Academy of Design. 
--------
539-> CHEMICAL BANK'S NEW OFFICIAL; William H. Porter of the Chase National to be Its Vice President.
William H. Porter, Vice President of the Chase National Bank, will Dec. 31 vacate this position to become Vice President of the Chemical National Bank. Mr. Porter will remain a Director of the Chase. His successor there has not been named. He is thirty-eight years old and a native of Vermont.

652-> Russia and "Pax Vobiscum."

776-> LETTER FROM ADMIRAL DEWEY.; American Seamen's Friend Society Elects Him Vice President.

777-> COAL MINERS TERRORIZED.; Secret Society with Highbinder Methods in the Anthracite Regions in Pennsylvania.
READING, Penn., Dec. 30. -- The arrest of John Casputis, Anthony Casputis, John Okavage, and Joseph Sucklosky of New Philadelphia, Schuylkill County, Penn., on the charge of unlawful assemblage disclosed the existence of an organization similar to that of the Chinese highbinders. The organization, it is said, has attained to large proportions in the anthracite coal regions of Pennsylvania, although its membership is not confined to residents of that district.

778-> WHAT IS DOING IN SOCIETY.
The cards of invitation to the wedding ceremony and following reception of Mr. Harold Baring and Miss Marie Churchill have been issued and read as follows: "Mr. and Mrs. John Augustus Churchill request the honour of your presence at the marriage of their daughter Marie Heyl and Mr. Harold Herman John Baring on Monday afternoon, October the 24th, at half after four o'clock, at St. Thomas's Church."

An important amendment has been made to Rule 1 of the Harlem River Speedway regulations. The amendment reads as follows: 
--------
781-> Editorial Article 2 -- No Title
It has generally been supposed that only in this country and in England were people much concerned about the relation between art and morality, and it is distinctly surprising to learn that even in France there are folks who cannot separate the artist from his or her respect for the proprieties. Such is the fact, however. 
--------
782-> RUSSIA'S CLAIM ON CHINA; Great Britain Is Giving the Matter Close Attention, and May Demand a Change. NEW-CHWANG RAILROAD ISSUE The Question Brought Up in the House of Commons -- British Military Squadron at Gibraltar Receives Orders.
LONDON, Aug. 11. -- In the House of Commons to-day Mr. A.J. Balfour, the First Lord of the Treasury and Government leader, admitted that the facts set forth in the Pekin dispatch to The London Times to-day were substantially correct.

783-> ROCKEFELLER TAXES CUT; Justice Barnard Confirms, the Referee's Report Reducing the Assessment. FROM $2,500,000 TO $343,745 " Evidence Clearly Establishes the Fact that the Assessor Was Influenced by Malice," Says the Court.

--------
784-> EX-SENATOR HILL'S VICTORY.; Tammany Hall Forced to Make the Syracuse Ticket and Platform Satisfactory to Him.
SYRACUSE, Sept. 29. -- David B. Hill, whom Tammany Hall had expected it would practically ignore in the making of its programme for the convention, proved himself to-day as great a power in the party organization of the State as he has ever been. It was Mr. Hill who forced Richard Croker to compromise with Kings County and agree to the nomination of Justice Van Wyck. 
--------
785-> THE CONTAGIOUSNESS OF THE "GRIP."
The announcement of the Board of Health that what is very absurdly called "the grip" is at present epidemic is accompanied by the decision that it is contagious. This decision will surprise most laymen. We believe that it will surprise some physicians. Everybody who has a bad cold nowadays is in the habit of saying, with a certain air of superiority, that he has the grip. 
--------
786-> "A LESSON FOR MR. ALGER."
May I add a few words to your article of last Monday under the above title? The principle and the effort of the Sanitary Commission were to make itself solely auxiliary; to do for the Government what, in the early stages of the war, with limited resources, it was unable to do itself; but not to relieve it of its duty; on the contrary, to bring it to see and do that duty properly. 
--------
787-> PUERTO RICO.
If a man were to publicly announce that from unselfish sympathy he would institute proceedings to restore to a defenceless neighbor property wrongfully withheld by a stronger hand, and the proceedings resulted in giving him the power not only to do this, but also to restore property to another defenseless neighbor, what would you think of him if instead of so restoring the second property he kept it for his own use? 
--------
788-> IN THE WORLD OF MUSIC.; What the Composers, Singers, Players, and Managers Are Doing and Saying.
The failure of Carl Lowenstein, who undertook the management of the New York Orchestra, upset the calendar of concerts for the current season and spread consternation through the halls of the Aschenbrodel Verein. Mr. Lowenstein went into musical management a year ago with a little money and less experience. He went out of it with a little experience and less money. 
--------
789-> DR. STEPHEN H. TYNG DEAD.; He Was Once a Celebrated Divine, and Afterward Achieved Success as a Business Man.
PARIS, Nov. 17. -- Dr. Stephen H. Tyng, President of the American chamber of Commerce, is dead. 
--------
790-> SUNDAY SCHOOL LESSON.; Notes on the International Series Selection for Jan. 8.
There is a tremendous distance -- both in time and condition -- covered by this first chapter of St. John's Gospel. It begins with the affairs of heaven. It ends with the affairs of earth. It opens with the declaration that "The Word" is "God." It closes with the declaration that "The Word" is "The Son of Man." 
--------
791-> AMATEUR BILLIARD MATCH.; Alexander Taylor Defeats Dr. Miller by a Score of 300 to 198 -- Hendrick Loses to Stark.
Alexander Taylor, the young Chicago expert, won his second game last night in the National amateur billiard tournament, at the 14-inch balk-line game, in progress at the Knickerbocker Athletic Club, defeating Dr. A.B. Miller of this city by a score of 300 to 198. Taylor did not warm up to his work until after the twenty-seventh inning, when he played consistently. 
--------
792-> FROUDE'S CARLYLE.; David Wilson's Effective Arraignment of the Famous Biography.*
A great many people still base their opinion of Carlyle, particularly in his domestic relations, upon Froude's account. Undoubtedly the pose in Carlyle's magnificent rhetoric and his egoistic concern with his own physical comfort or discomfort, in part account for the readiness of the public to accept Froude's view of his private character; but it is late in the day to be surprised by any new proof of that historian's inaccuracy. 
--------
793-> WOMEN HERE AND THERE
This is the season of wood fires, and the fortunate individual who has an open fireplace with a place for andirons and the andirons for the place is to be congratulated. There is nothing more delightful than the warmth and odor of a wood fire through a house on a crisp Fall day. 
--------
794-> VICE AND THE RAINES LAW.
Your journal is not much read by advocates of the Raines law, therefore it is of little use for me to reply even in few words to Willoughby, who makes a most pertinent inquiry concerning the Society for the Promotion of Social Purity. The society has been as persistent in its efforts since the Raines Liquor bill became the law of the State as before. 
--------
795-> HANNA'S REVISED OPINION.; Says the Dingley Bill Is the Most Scientific and Best Adjusted Law Ever Enacted.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Nov. 17. -- Senator Hanna, referring to the recent interview which had been given to the public as coming from him, said to-day:... 
--------
796-> CHEER FOR ROOSEVELT; Republicans Have an Enthusiastic Ratification Meeting. A FASHIONABLE ASSEMBLAGE Men and Women Applaud the Candidate in Carnegie Hall. Col. Roosevelt, Gen. Woodford, Seth Low, Joseph H. Choate, and Lieut. Gov. Woodruff Speak.
As many people as could get into Carnegie Hall, and a great many more, met last night to ratify the nomination of Col. Theodore Roosevelt for Governor of New York. Incidentally they ratified the nomination of the other men on the Republican State ticket; but the Colonel of the Rough Riders was the centre of attraction and the subject of all the speaking. 
--------
797-> REGULARS FOR CUBA.; Regiments Not Yet Selected -- Departure from Montauk Not Probable.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 7. -- It is said at the War Department that the troops which will be used to garrison Cuba pending the establishment of some permanent form of Government there will be principally regulars. The regiments, however, have not yet been selected, and the fact that certain of these regular regiments have been left for the time at Montauk has no significance as indicating a purpose to send to Cuba. 
--------
798-> TWO NIGHTS IN JUNE.
THE words echoed idly in Brunton's mind, as, escaping by favor of a French casement from the crowded reception room, he found himself in the pleasance. Softly the thrill of the distant music rose and fell upon the still air. Less tunefully sounded the nearer hum of conversation and laughter. 
--------
799-> THE WAY TO TURN THE BASCALS OUT.
It would be a good thing for Col. ROOSEVELT if he would interrupt his stamping tour for one day in order to read the report of the canal investigating commission presented to Gov. BLACK on Aug. 4. We cannot believe that he has read it or knows very much about it. His talk at Kingston, from which we quote, shows him to be ignorant of its contents: 
--------
800-> THE NAVAL ACADEMY.; Alternates Ready to Take the Places of Failing Candidates.
ANNAPOLIS, Sept. 17. -- This has been "alternate" week at the Naval Academy. The alternate is a result of a combination of circumstances, favorable to himself and exceedingly unfortunate to another. He is the youth who steps into the shoes of the candidate who holds the appointment from his Congressional district to the Naval Academy when the latter fails of admission. 
--------
801-> CUBANS EAGER FOR OFFICE; Clamoring for Patronage at Manzanillo, They Greatly Worry Gen. Wood. HIS WORK IN THE PROVINCE The Mayoralty and Municipal Government of the Towns Eagerly Sought by Rival Factions Among the Insurgents.
MANZANILLO, Oct. 30. -- The visit of Gen. Leonard Wood, Governor of the Military Department of Santiago, has been instrumental in bringing all the elements among the Cubans to the front. No fewer than 2,000 insurgents, of whom 500 are officers, want offices, and their clamor almost amounts to a demand. 
--------
802-> ORMESBY'S QUICK LOADING; Captain Learns He Must Ship Grain in Twenty-four Hours. 3,600 TONS TO GO ABOARD Had Just Arrived from England -- Chartering Time Worth $7 a Minute.
The British steamship Ormesby arrived here yesterday in ballast, after the slow voyage of twenty-three days from Shields. Her master, Capt. Robinson, was greatly astonished on swinging to at 'anchor off Liberty Island at being hailed by two tugs. The tug Captains announced that they had instructions to dock the steamer at once at Beard's Stores, Erie Basin, and that she was to get on a big cargo before midnight to-night. 
--------
803-> MAN'S BODY IN THE WATER.; A Tugboat Crew Picks It Up in Buttermilk Channel.

Coroner Burger was notified, and he gave permission for the removal of the body to the Morgue. The body was that of a man about 5 feet 8 inches in height and weighing about 160 pounds. 
--------
804-> Editorial Article 1 -- No Title
There must be something about the air of Puerto Rico that makes the island really and hopefully our own. As Spanish as Cuba, in one sense, in another Puerto Rico is not Spanish at all. The inhabitants, native and alien alike, look ahead instead of backward, and they demonstrate a most commendable inclination to recognize accomplished facts.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 7. -- Four bids were submitted to the Post Office Department for supplying stamped envelopes and newspaper wrappers to the department for the ensuing four years.

It is about $48,000 per annum lower than the lowest bid submitted last March, which was then $250,000 lower than the previous contract. 
--------
810-> "THIS GOVERNMENT" AND POLITICS.
One of our contemporaries reports a characteristic and mirth-provoking remark of the Secretary of War. The Secretary had been asked, by the Washington correspondent of our contemporary, whether and when he was going to give out for publication Col. ROOSEVELT'S report of the Santiago campaign. 
--------
811-> THE PATHFINDER LAUNCHED; Finely Equipped Steamer for Coast and Geodetic Survey. BUILT AT NIXON'S SHIPYARDS Distinguished Guests Witness the Vessel's Plunge -- Designed Especially for Work Off Alaska.
The new Coast and Geodetic Survey steamer Pathfinder, by far the largest of her kind ever constructed for the United States Government, was launched yesterday afternoon at the Crescent Shipyard of Lewis Nixon, at Elizabethport, N.J. There was present at the launching an unusually large gathering of distinguished Federal and State officials and others, headed by Secretary of the Treasury Gage. 
--------
812-> MUSIC "BY REQUEST."; Some of the Queer Encore Demands That Sousa Has Received in the West.
Whatever relation it may have to the artiste development of the country need not be considered, but it is a tangible fact, nevertheless, that a large portion of Sousa's audiences attend his concerts solely to hear his encores. At every performance of Sousa and his band the requests that reach the conductor for encore numbers, if complied with, would treble the length of the programme. 
--------
813-> THE NEWS IN WASHINGTON.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 5. -- Official dispatches received here to-night brought to the authorities the sudden realization of an Indian uprising of more than ordinary dimensions. The dispatches began coming about 6 P.M., two of them coming to Secretary Bliss, who, as the head of the Interior Department, has charge of Indian affairs, and a third to Attorney General Griggs from one of the United States Marshals at the seat of the uprising.

--------
815-> A POST-MORTEM STORY.
The Great Roosevelt and Depew Railroad Circus and Special Political Menagerie which is now rushing through the State must leave a weird impression with the people who listen to the "words, words, words" of oratorical stars. The late world-renowned manager of the sawdust ring would have wished for no better programme of humbug, for Mr. Barnum believed that humbug paid. 
--------

--------
819-> West Virginia Game Protectors.
When we shall come to build monuments to those who have been instrumental in preserving the game resources in this country, let us not forget the moonshiner of the West Virginia mountains and contiguous regions roundabout, who because of a well-known proclivity to bush unsuspecting invaders of his wilderness realm, has exerted a decidedly deterrent influence on hunting excursions.

--------
837-> DR. GILMAN'S GOOD ADVICE.
Dr. Gilman, like a true American and a man of courage, reads history with comfort and encouragement on this point.

He very properly turns to England and finds there a success which has blessed the world.

846-> A NEW ERA IN CUBA.
The deep interest and importance of the order creating the Military Department of Santiago under the command of Major Gen. HENRY W. LAWTON is perhaps not generally appreciated. This order marks a stage in the history of our war with Spain. First in order is the command to invade and conquer.

Although the French Cabinet has decided to appoint a special commission to examine the Dreyfus "dossier," and two Cabinet Ministers have resigned because of this decision, it does not follow that the verdict of the commission will be in favor of a reversal of judgment.

The rapid growth of the Roosevelt boom has alarmed the Democratic leaders, some of whom have no hesitation in admitting that if the Colonel of the Rough Riders is nominated they will be at a loss to find a candidate to put up against him. In case of such an event they would need, they say, a war candidate whom they could set before the people as a hero. 
--------
866-> THE SECRETARY OF STATE.
How long must the country put up with the humiliation, forced upon it and persisted in even in the face of the risk of a serious misunderstanding at some inconvenient moment, of the maintenance at Washington of the pretension that we have a Secretary of State? 
--------
867-> THE PRESIDENT'S POLICY; He May Demand Indemnity for the Maine and Ask Spain to End the War at Once. HIS INTENTIONS NOT KNOWN Senators Close to the Administration Predict that It Will Settle the Whole Cuban Question at One Stroke.
WASHINGTON, March 9. -- Just when the President will take a new step in the direction of peace for the Cubans, and what that step will be, possibly no one besides himself and Assistant Secretary of State Day knows.

869-> ILLITERACY STATISTICS.
In the recent article of Mrs. Houghton, which has caused so much indignation in the South, she speaks of the work of Mormon preachers among the illiterate classes. It appears to be a general impression that among these Latter-Day Saints, as they call themselves, a condition of ignorance exceptionally low prevails. To those who have no investigated the matter, a comparative study of available statistics will be somewhat surprising. 
--------
870-> Railroad Directors Re-elected.
PITTSBURG, Penn., May 19. -- At the annual meeting of the Pittsburg, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railroad, the three Directors whose terms expired, Messrs. Levi Z. Leiter of Chicago, John N.

WASHINGTON, March 10. -- President McKinley and Ambassador Pauncefote are equally uncommunicative about the reported message of the Queen and the British Ministry to this Government. Sir Julian Pauncefote stops all attempts to draw denials or explanations from him with the assertion that the stories published are "largely conjecture," but the very language of his avoidance is interpreted here as in a measure corroborating the reports that were believed yesterday to be wild imaginings. 
--------
874-> VOTED FOR A GOLD BILL.; Significant Midnight Episode at the Lincoln Dinner of the Republican Club.
Several sound-money men of this city who attended the banquet of the Republican Club last Saturday night are disposed to attach some importance to an episode which occurred just prior to the breaking up of the enthusiastic company at that banquet.

It would be difficult to tell from the appearance of a certain pleasant little parlor uptown exactly the character of the woman to whom it belongs. 
--------
879-> MR. DEPEW IN EUROPE.
We hope Mr. DEPEW will make use of the opportunity of his trip across the water to open the minds and the hearts of the people of Europe. They are in sore need of light. It is his nature to be effulgent. Misinformation and prejudice stalk at noonday through the streets of their capitals. 
--------
880-> Valencia and Cordova.
One realizes all one's fantastic ideas of tropical fertility in passing over the huerta, or prairie, which environs the Southern Spanish city of Valencia. It is intersected with canals and waterways called variously sangrias, acequias, requerias, with norias or water wheels for distributing that liquid gold which water is to a thirsty, sun-burned red earth. The careful agriculturists manure this ground with guano, and it gratefully gives them back five crops a year. 
--------
881-> MR. SHERMAN SHOULD RETIRE.
President McKINLEY is not an emotional man, fortunately, but he must have been deeply touched by the confidence in his wisdom and judgment which Congress and the country have so conspicuously exhibited during the past three weeks. The peace-loving people of the United States trust him because he is one of themselves, a man reared in simple surroundings to the plain life of a hard-working American citizen. 
--------

The library of the Law Association of Philadelphia, which consists of 35,000 volumes, has found new and spacious quarters at the City Hall.

--------
884-> THE MAINE AND THE FREAK PRESS.
Our esteemed freak contemporaries occasionally betray irritation because the community does not take them seriously enough. It seems that they have not sufficiently reflected upon the frightful consequences that would ensue if they were taken more seriously. A lamentable disaster happens to an American man-of-war in a port under control of a power with which our relations are in a state of extreme tension.

SOMALILAND is the horn that Africa sticks up toward Arabia, with Cape Guardaful for a tip. The Gulf of Aden is its northern boundary and the Indian Ocean is its eastern shore.

It is said that Mr. Roosevelt surveys with pride the diversity of the personnel of his regiment of rough riders, ranging as it does through the list from cowboys and miners, old soldiers, firemen, policemen, university men, club men, and millionaires, but, so far as noted, no scion of royalty has yet appeared among the enlisted.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 11. -- Navy Department officers generally assume that the promotions recommended by Secretary Long, and announced as having received the approval of the President, will stand not only the examination of the public, but the criticisms of the Senate, to which all must go before they become effective. 
--------
895-> MARQUETTE'S CLAIM TO GLORY.; Why the Post Office Department Honored the Jesuit Explorer.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 11 -- The question as to the right of Father Marquette to figure as a leading actor in the history of this country has arisen again, in connection with the fact that a picture of Marquette sailing down the Mississippi is borne on the one-cent Omaha Exposition stamps.

WASHINGTON, April 20. -- Although no proposed legislation directly relating to the Cuban queston was before the Senate to-day, most of the discussion bore on that question.

--------
898-> DIED IN CENTRAL PARK; Sheppard Homans, Stricken in a Street Car, Expired Near His Home. HIS FAMILY WAS AT DINNER They Thought He Was Kept at His Office -- His Body Was Taken to the Morgue Before It Was Identified.

WASHINGTON, March 10. -- The United States Government has not yet acquired a single additional ship for the navy. This is true, not because of a lack of offers of warships from abroad, but simply for the reason that the Navy Department is proceeding with all of the circumspection consistent with the needs of the case in looking after the qualities and prices of the craft.

--------
903-> AMERICAN AND ENGLISH WARS.
The Anglo-American organ of this city gives us daily homilies upon the general wickedness and inhumanity of war, and is worrying itself because of the lack of civilization shown by us in our determination to put a stop to the atrocities in Cuba. This is all very well, but the source whence it comes makes it a trifle ludicrous.

904-> Grant Duff's Diary; Disraeli, Brougham, Browning, and Victor Hugo. SECOND ARTICLE.
In a former issue of THE TIMES'S SATURDAY REVIEW extracts from Sir Montstuart E. Grant Duff's diary were presented.

--------
916-> IT CAN WAIT.
The old Hawaiian gang, re-enforced by certain sincere patriots who are equally unselfish and unsuspicious, are pressing the annexation job forward in the guise of a war measure. We must have Hawaii, they say, as a half-way station between San Francisco and our new possessions, the Philippines. Manila is 5,000 miles from our coast.

924-> TIRED OF THEOLOGICAL DEBATE.
The joy with which I hail the statement in this day's TIMES, that the anti-vivisectionists, with their harrowing details of midnight prowlings, with grim visage and tallow dip, in search of trembling little dogs to anti-vivisect, have betaken themselves to Baltimore and secured quarters there for the Winter, is not quite without alloy, for -- there are others.

The writer of the letter "A Hundred Daughters of an Earl" did me the honor to refer to my novel, "A Pedigree in Pawn." He sadly declared I am no Aristophanes and he sighed for "the polished satire" of that great Greek dramatist. Indeed, Mr. Editor, I never professed to be an Aristophanes.

The Ministry of Education and the Fine Arts has no fewer than 119,709 paid officials. As to the Ministry of War, it is difficult to determine the exact number of civilian employes connected with it.

1040-> Broad Scotch and Slang.
Language has never been stationary -- least of all the English. It has been improved, and it has been corrupted; and it may be improved, or it may be corrupted again.

--------
1048-> AT LAST.
The action of Mayor VAN WYCK yesterday puts Tammany where it was bound to be so soon as it dared use the power stupidly given to it by the voters at the last election. That is, it puts Tammany "on top" in the Police Department, with unchecked control of the sources of income and of political strength supplied by the vicious and criminal classes.

--------
1056-> ENGLISH FROM YALE.
Although the Nation is at war, scholarship and education are still vital interests. These are continuing forces. War, costly, exciting, potential, as it may be, is an incident, and, like a fever, it soon runs its course. The present circumstances do not deter President Dwight from issuing a confident appeal for generous contributions to promote the grandeur and usefulness of Yale University.

WASHINGTON, July 1. -- The Government is highly gratified at an offer received from the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad Company, tendering the War Department the fleet of line freight steamers owned by that company, plying between Newport News and Europe, at the actual cost of the vessels, with provision for restoring them to the company when the department has no longer need of them, at a figure that would be eminently reasonable.

1242-> Article 2 -- No Title
ST. LOUIS, Mo., May 22. -- Fully 10,000 persons witnessed to-day's game. It was the first time that the New York team has ever played a Sunday's championship game. Daniels gave the Giants a lead in the first inning. Taylor succeeded him, and in the fifth Gilpatrick was given a chance. Score: 
--------
1243-> Books and Authors.; Notes of Forthcoming and Recent Publications.
New York publishers are generally complaining of the bad effect that the preparation for the imminent conflict with Spain has upon the book trade. It will be recalled that it was noted in these columns in the recent Zola-Dreyfus excitement in Paris that Parisian publishers made a similar complaint.

WASHINGTON, April 1. -- The sub-committee of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations appointed to draft a report and prepare a form of resolution outlining a course of action which this Government shall pursue toward Spain with reference to Cuba so far completed its work to-day that it will be able to report to the full committee at its meeting to-morrow.

1245-> THE REVENUE MUDDLE.
When the Senate reconvenes to-day it will have the War Revenue bill before it, very little altered after the week of discussion to which it has already been submitted. The minor changes that have been proposed and some of them adopted will have been studied by the committee, and such modification as is necessary in the bill will doubtless be reported. 
--------
1246-> QUIET DAY AT CHICKAMAUGA.
CHICKAMAUGA NATIONAL PARK, May 22. -- This has been a quiet day at Camp Thomas. The Second Nebraska Regiment, which reached Chattanooga yesterday afternoon, arrived this morning, and was assigned to the camp ground selected for the first division of the Third Corps, and the men have been busy getting into their tents during the day.

After four weeks of postponements, the new Summer extravaganza, "Yankee Doodle Dandy," will be produced at the Casino to-morrow night. The words were written by "Hugh Morton," and Gustave Kerker composed and arranged the music. The story is as preposterous as need be, and the action passes in New York and Washington in the present hour.

CHICAGO, Aug. 14. -- C.T. Yerkes returned from New York to-day, and speaking of Roosevelt, he said: 
--------
1249-> SAYS SEAL LAW IS ABSURD.
Your dispatch from Niagara Falls of this morning places the seal question in the glaring light of ridicule so justly due to it. It has nothing to recommend it to the attention bestowed upon it but sentiment, and when it is duly considered even this emotion should vanish into thin air.

1250-> NEW JERSEY LEGISLATURE; Admonished to Investigate the Charges of Corruption in Hudson County. MESSAGE FROM GOV. GRIGGS Comments on the Alleged Protection of Criminals by Public Officials -- The House Appoints an Investigating Committee.

PHILADELPHIA, March 2. -- A.J.

--------
1253-> THE BOARD OF CUSTOMS.; Importers Protest Against an Assessed Duty of 60 Per Cent.
Tariff protests docketed under the head of "Laces, lace articles, nettings, veilings, " had a public hearing before ex-Judge Henderson Somerville, Charles H. Ham, and George C.

--------
1256-> "POSTAL INTELLIGENCE."; Adventures of a Man Who Inquired Concerning Brooklyn Deliveries at the New York Office.
The New York General Post Office is in itself a busy village, but it seems to lack a directory. A man went there recently to post a letter, and at the Bureau of Information on the Park Row side inquired what time a special delivery letter mailed at that time, 3:40 P.M., would be delivered in Brooklyn. 
--------
1257-> AN ADMINISTRATION POLICY.
As events are at present shaping themselves it would not only be unnecessary but unwise for the President to appoint a Democrat to the Peace Commission. Certainly any Democrat who accepts such an appointment will find himself under serious embarrassment. Considerations of this nature may have prompted Mr. OLNEY to decline to serve.

1258-> PIRACY NEAR PYRAMID HARBOR.; Bark Canada's Captain Takes Her from the Tug Coleman, Which Claimed Her as a Derelict.

--------
1261-> AMERICAN LOCOMOTIVES.
n a recent comparison between American and English railroads, a writer in The London Times concedes, as the result of personal investigation, that the quality of the fastest American trains is such that the British cannot pretend to equal. He also practically admits the superiority of the American locomotives of the best type. 
--------
1262-> POSTAL SAVINGS BANKS.
Mr. JOHN P. TOWNSEND, President of the Bowery Savings Bank, marshals a telling array of arguments against postal savings banks in an article of less than four pages in the February number of Gunton's Magazine.

--------
1266-> "THAT REMAINS TO BE FIXED."
That part of the President's message which relates to the destruction of the Maine has the same merit which pertained to the message with which he accompanied the report of the court of inquiry. It is a powerful piece of understatement.

PARIS, Feb. 8. -- We are now in the thick of the Zola trial; and though this letter will probably not have reached you before the result is known I may be permitted to express the belief, based on my two days' hearing of the case in court, that Zola will be acquitted.

--------
1274-> Eusebius.
The history of Eusebius I have not read, but I have perused Mr. S.W. Green's article thereon in THE TIMES'S SATURDAY REVIEW. Eusebius, I take it for granted, was a writer of sacred history; Mr. Green, it is evident, has not written, nor will he ever write, sacred history.

1275-> VENEZUELA'S BOUNDARY CASE.; The Tribunal to Settle the Pending Issues with Great Britain Will Assemble in Paris.
WASHINGTON, May 22. -- The tribunal which is to adjust the dispute between Venezuela and Great Britain as to the boundary between the former country and British Guiana will assemble in Paris next February.

--------
1276-> Brunetiere's Ugly Expression.
M. Brunetiere's recent utterance, "at the bottom of every form of art there is a latent germ of immorality, and all it asks is further growth," is enigmatical. Perhaps it is just as well that there was a warning in M. Brunetiere's words, for he was then addressing a strictly French audience. Talented and refined as may be M. Brunetiere, this phrase is meaningless and impossible of application to great art.

1277-> WOOLEN MEN ORGANIZE.; It Is Proposed to Stop Alleged Abuses in the Trade by Wholesale Clothiers.
A meeting of leading local commission agents and of representatives of the trade known "men's woolen goods" was held at the Wool Exchange yesterday afternoon.

1286-> ACTIVITY IN DEPARTMENTS.; The New York "Mosquito Fleet" Ordered to Key West -- Its Duty Still a Mystery.
WASHINGTON, April 1. -- The Navy and War Departments are growing more and more martial in aspect every day. Aides and secretaries rush with important looks and mysterious looking documents in hand from office to office, as if the departments were military headquarters. Orders for absolute secrecy have been issued everywhere, and all that is wanting to carry out the analogy with a headquarters is a censorship of the press.

--------
1288-> The Klipspringer.
The klipspringer, or klipbok, as it is often called by the Colonists, seems, like the chamois of Europe, to be created for no other purpose than to complete and adorn a mountain landscape. Although smaller than its distant cousin of the snowy Alps, the klipspringer yields neither to it nor to any other mountain dweller in the world in the ease with which it can get about the most difficult and dangerous rocks and precipices.

COLUMBUS, Ohio, Jan. 1. -- The caucuses for nomination of officers of the Legislature, which convenes next Monday, were held tonight. Usually these caucuses are of State interest only.

1290-> WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
American and English swells have long vied with each other as to the variety and number of their suits of clothes. We have never heard that Parisian swells entered into the competition.

The rector of Beaconsfield, who has appealed in our columns for American subscriptions to a monument to EDMUND BURKE, will doubtless remark with some astonishment the denunciation of that project by "Historicus" in our columns on Sunday. Most of the American readers of that letter will share his astonishment.

Patrolman Hefferman of the Morrisania Police Station and Louis Webber of 639 Bergen Avenue made a daring rescue yesterday of an aged woman, who stood at a window on the top floor of a burning house, at 783 Elton Avenue.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla., April 11. -- The Cuban Junta here received a very important letter from Gen. Gomez yesterday, via Key West.

Usually it comes in April.

Friends of George Fruh, a Brooklyn contractor, are wondering where he is. Mr. Fruh, who took Cody Brothers' contract for the new Shore Road Drive, has not been at his office, at 44 Court Street, for a week, and no one seems to know his whereabouts.

1299-> SUNDAY SCHOOL LESSON.; Notes on the International Series Selection for July 10.
Between the time when Rehoboam became King of Judah, and Jeroboam King of Israel, as we saw last week, and the incident now brought before us, there is an interval of more than sixty years.

1308-> BIENNIAL TOWN ELECTIONS.; Violent Opposition Manifested to the Administration Measure.
ALBANY, Feb. 7. -- It is within the possibilities that at least one feature of the Administration programme for this session of the Legislature may have to be abandoned on account of opposition inside the Republican ranks. The feature in question is the bill providing for the election of town officers biennially, at the same time as State officers are chosen. 
--------
1309-> THE POINTS OF INTEREST.
No war of this century, no war in the world's history except the wars of Great Britain and Spain in the seventeenth century, has been characterized by so remarkable a dispersion of its points of interest and activity through both hemispheres as this war of ours with Spain. The war is but two days old, yet it has already developed half a dozen distinct and notable centres of interest.

1310-> THREE BOATS IN COLLISION.; Bow of a Freightboat Damaged by the Ferryboat Somerset, and a Canalboat Sunk.

1311-> CABLE-CUTTING IN WAR TIME.
Unquestionably people's minds are directed very much just now to the question of the ability of this country to maintain telegraphic communication with the outer world, more particularly, of course, with her colonies, in times of war. Of course such speculations owe their origin to the war which, up to the moment, is being waged between America and Spain.

1316-> PURCHASING FOREIGN SHIPS.; A Small Harbor Torpedo Boat Bought by the Government.
WASHINGTON, March 22. -- The negotiations for the purchase of ships abroad are going forward steadily, but there was a regrettable disappointment in this connection to-day. The authorities had been exceedingly anxious to get the big torpedo cruiser Tupy, built for Brazil.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 18. -- A man who has been in the clutches of the Judge Advocate General of the navy, and has been acquitted or convicted, is not always sure that the Department of Justice of the navy is done with him, even if he never commits an offense that will fairly entitle him to be subjected once more to the power of that bureau.

1318-> A WIDOW'S SAD DEATH.; She Had a Letter from Her Son, Who Is Studying Theology, Declining to Aid Her.

Hart of Chicago Secretary, and Levi L. Barbour of Detroit, Mich., Treasurer. 
--------
1326-> Questioning Is Not Conversation.
The man who imagines that the art of conversation consists in asking questions spoils conversation as much as the man who never asks any. People of this description will interrupt a speaker as frequently as they do in the French Chamber, and run anxiously from subject to subject with their interrogatories, like a cackling hen that is going to lay an egg. 
--------
1327-> Article 13 -- No Title
NEWARK, N.J., Feb. 8. -- Mrs. Place lived here fourteen years ago. She was then Mrs. Savcole. A year or so after taking up her residence in this city a son was born.

1328-> THE WEEK IN NEWPORT.; Arrival of Two Prominent New York Families -- The War Scare and Society -- Local Improvements.
NEWPORT, April 23. -- Mr. and Mrs. Prescott Lawrence and Mr. and Mrs. L.L. Lorillard have started the movement of Summer residents from New York to here, showing that they consider Newport as safe a place as any to live in in case that the Spanish fleets are to take a few short rounds out of seacoast towns. Both families are happily installed here, and at a date of arrival much earlier than usual. 
--------
1329-> MORE MINES AND COAST GUNS.
WASHINGTON, April 23. -- Orders were issued to-day from the Engineer Bureau for the placing of submarine mines in a number of the harbors of the United States. Naturally the department declined to make public the specific points at which the mines are to be located, but they will be so placed and guarded that vessels of friendly nations will not suffer from their presence.

CHICAGO, Aug. 15. -- Within a few days the details of the consolidation of the three street car systems of Chicago, already arranged in New York by C.T.

After declining steadily for two and a half months it would seem thee the volume of realty dealings has reached about the lowest point to which it can possibly go, unless the business is to come to a literal standstill. Practically it has reached this stage now, and there is perhaps encouragement to be found in the fact that things cannot be any worse.

There is reason to believe that a year hence cycle racing will be an altogether changed sport from that which America, England, and the Continent have followed with interest hitherto. Middle distance events are promised as the pieces de resistance of every race meet worth attending, and the short distance contests must sink to the level of introductory features, or fillers between the longer races. 
--------
1339-> RAN A RACE WITH DEATH.; Italian Drank Ammonia for Whisky -Officer Moore Carried Him Twelve Blocks to a Drug Store.
The few residents of the half-built section of East New York, near Norwood Avenue, who braved the snow and sleet and ventured out last night were startled at the sight of a young policeman running at the top of his speed through the deserted streets with his head down to avoid the storm, and with a ragged, lifeless body on his shoulders. 
--------

NEWPORT, R. I., April 30. -- Whether the war lasts a month or the whole of this Summer, Newport will not be greatly affected as a Summer resort so far as its regular cottagers are concerned, as they will come here just the same, and this year much earlier than usual. A number of cottages have been prepared for early occupancy and a number of families are already here. 
--------
1341-> THE MONUMENTS OF PISA; The Many Wonders of the Famous Old Leaning Tower. THE NOTED LAMP OF GALILEO Custodians Who Chant the Praises of Rival Attractions and Increase Their Earnings by Enlarging Their Stock of Vile English.
PISA, May 7. -- It is a relief to see flat land again after a surfeit of hills. For months along the Mediterranean we have had nothing but hills and mountains. Whether in Marseilles, in Nice, Monaco, Vintimille, or Genoa, you are no sooner down one hill than you begin to climb the next; and the outlying mountains are not beautifully green like ours, but bare, cream-colored rock. 
--------
1342-> CORNELL'S BUSY OARSMEN.; Five Men Who Are Certainly Selected for the University Crew.
ITHACA, N.Y., April 30. -- Every afternoon at about 5 o'clock five crews made up of students from Cornell University leave the boathouse on the Inlet and for a half hour or so row up and down over the mile of winding water closely watched by Charles Courtney, the professional coach.

--------
1344-> CHASE AFTER A POLICEMAN.; Four Men and Three Women Pursue Him in Cabs, While He Flees in Another -- Held for Assault.
The Tenderloin enjoyed yesterday morning a thing it very rarely knows -- an entirely new sensation.

--------
1345-> JOSIAH J. WHITE ARRESTED.; Disregarded a Court Order in the Settlement of His Wife's Estate.
Josiah J. White of 186 Columbia Heights was arrested Friday night by an officer attached to the Surrogate's Court and locked up for the night in Raymond Street Jail. The arrest was under an attachment issued by Surrogate Abbott, requiring White to appear on Monday. The arrest grows out of litigation over the estate of Eliza T. White, his wife. 
--------
1346-> THE POPE'S HEALTH.; The Prisoner of the Vatican Is Debarred from the Remedy He Needs.
It was a wag who said the denial of a report proved its truth. It will be denied, but, it is true, that the health of Leo XIII, is far from satisfactory, and causes much anxiety to those about him. Three weeks ago his Holiness was slightly indisposed. With the warm weather his malady has increased; his weakness has become more pronounced. 
--------
1347-> CROKER AND M'LAUGHLIN; The Brooklyn Leader's Friends Say that He Still Stands Firmly for His Rights. NO YIELDING TO TAMMANY
Democrats were reticent yesterday about the outcome of Richard Croker's visit to Hugh McLaughlin on Friday. This much, however, is known: Mr. Croker did not succeed in getting the Brooklyn leader to recede from the position that he has taken with regard to the distribution of municipal patronage.

CHICAGO, June 11. -- The week has been a singularly uneventful one. The halcyon days of graduating exercises are at hand, and the persons of most importance are those who are "standing upon the threshold of the future." Out at the Northwestern University a divertissement has been furnished by an impulsive and patriotic professor, who held the Chair of German there, and who at the breaking out of the war endeavored to raise a regiment. 
--------
1355-> COMMODORE JOHN C. WATSON.

WASHINGTON, June 24. -- Up to 12:30 this morning neither the War nor the Navy Department had received any news from either the troops or the fleet in the vicinity of Santiago.

--------
1362-> WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH THE PHILIPPINES?
One of the most famous of the many pregnant phrases with which Mr. CLEVELAND enriched our discussion of public affairs was this from his great tariff message of 1887: "It is a condition that confronts us -- not a theory." The fault we have to find with Mr. CLEVELAND'S Lawrenceville school address is common to all the arguments against the retention of the Philippines which have come under our notice 
--------
1363-> MUSTER OF VOLUNTEERS.; Some States Have Completed the Work and Others Made Progress.
WASHINGTON, May 11. -- Reports received at the War Department show a continuation of the rapid progress being made in the mustering in of the volunteers. Among the advices received under yesterday's date are the following:

The Spanish armored cruiser Vizcaya, after riding at anchor off Sandy Hook since early Friday evening, waiting in vain for the weather to clear, got under way yesterday afternoon and steamed up to the man-of-war anchorage off Tompkinsville.

--------
1366-> HOFFMAN ALLOWED TO GO.; New Brunswick Police Fail to Connect Him with Opetz's Death.
NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., July 14. -- The police of this city to-day made an attempt to connect the death of Vincent Opetz, who was found dead beside the Pennsylvania Railroad tracks at Iselin, with that of Jared Matthews, whose body was found in a car at Wilmington, Del.

1374-> ARMY REORGANIZATION BILL.; Adopted by the Committee and Reported to the House -- The President's Powers Modified.
WASHINGTON, March 23. -- The Army Reorganization bill was adopted unanimously to-day by the House Committee on Military Affairs and it was subsequently reported to the House.

--------
1375-> The Greatest Cycling Road in the World.
The road I have in my mind is in India, and stretches twelve hundred miles from Lahore to Calcutta. It is the famous Grand Trunk Road. Let me explain its nature, though one cannot do so by comparison, for there is no road of five miles in England that is anything like it. It is level; indeed, there is not above a mile the whole distance where even a lady need dismount to walk. 
--------
1376-> COLORED DEMOCRATS SCARCE.; " Grand Reception and Ball" in Honor of Leaders on Staten Island a Failure.
The Colored Democracy of Richmond Borough announced a demonstration for last night, but distinctly failed to demonstrate.

Dudley, Chairman of the Committee of Arrangements. 
--------
1377-> TOPICS OF THE TIMES.
-- We are fast losing confidence in The Boston Transcript. Its former gravity of expression and soundness of thought have departed, and now, instead of representing the respectability and common sense of New England, it vehemently supports the newest delusions of the period, and does not hesitate at making rash generalizations from what once it would have lamented as exceptional cases or ignored as unworthy of attention.

Arolas used the regular troops to restore order and to compel the dispersal of the crowd, which kept up a continuous shouting on the streets near Central Park. 
--------
1381-> DAMAGE FROM PRIVATEERS; Much Less Injury Could Be Inflicted Upon This Country Than the Spaniards Think. COASTING TRADE UNASSAILABLE It Constitutes the Bulk of Trade Carried in American Bottoms -- Small Percentage of Our Commerce Vessels Under the American Flag.
From recent utterances in at least a portion of the Spanish press, it may be inferred that the Spaniards look to privateering as the means of injuring America and securing revenge for whatever reverses may befall their fleets or soldiers. No official notice has, however, been given by the Spanish Government that it intends to issue letters of marque, although the statement has been made that it has received many applications for such letters.

1390-> STOCK MARKET ERRATIC; Weakness, Strength, Advances, and Declines Exhibited at Different Times. EFFECTS OF WAR REPORTS Amount of Dealings Comparatively Small -- Strong Support Supposed to Have Been Given by a Half Dozen Large Operators.
Stock Exchange dealings were erratic yesterday. "The pulse of the country" beat unsteadily. It was weak, rallied, became excited and feverish, almost stopped and throbbed again, all in rhythm to the news of the international situation, which, through public and private channels, found its way to the brokers and their customers. 
--------
1391-> CUBAN ARMY TO BE DISBANDED?; Reported Decision by American Officers and Cuban Leaders. GEN. GARCIA WAS PRESENT Men to be Paid Off by This Country, It Is Said. Will Involve an Expenditure of $15,000,000, but Is Essential to the Island's Prosperity.

--------
1393-> AGES OF GRADUATES.
How has it come about that the average graduate of an American college is about twenty-three years old when he should be about twenty? In this morning's paper you comment upon an address by Prof. Remsen of Baltimore, in which, as it appears, the responsibility for this condition of affairs is traced back to the German universities. 
--------
1394-> FOR JEWS IN JERUSALEM; A New Organization Formed to Collect and Distribute Money to Aid Them. THE OLD COMMITTEE OPPOSED It Is Charged by the President of the New Association that Funds Collected in America Have Not Been Properly Spent.
A movement has been started against the old Jewish organization which has for its object the support of indigent Jews in Jerusalem, and the charge has been made that a large part of the money contributed by the Jews of New York has been misspent, and that bad management exists among the officers and the agents of the old organization.

--------
1398-> NO FEAR OF THE VIZCAYA.; New York Harbor Defenses Relied Upon in Washington to Keep Her from Doing Damage.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 21. -- Some concern was expressed at the War Department to-day by inquiring visitors about the danger that would confront New York in case hostilities between Spain and the United States should break out while the Vizcaya is in the harbor. From an artillery officer it was learned that there is slight occasion for alarm about that vessel. 
--------
1399-> COMPLAINTS AT SEA GIRT.; Wholesale Rejection of Recruits by the Army Surgeons Causes Gov. Voorhees to Protest.
SEA GIRT, June 23. -- The wholesale rejection of recruits sent to Camp Voorhees to fill the quota of the three New Jersey regiments now in service is causing Gov. Voorhees and Adjt. Gen. Stryker, the post commandant, considerable uneasiness, and the Board of Examiners, consisting of Drs. Keefe and Schlichter of the Third Regiment, have been semi-officially requested to be less exacting in their medical examinations. 
--------
1400-> INTERVENTION.
The pacification of Cuba is now the leading object of the policy of the United States. Peaceably if we can, but at any rate effectively, we must re-establish orderly government in that island, primarily in our own interest and for our own peace and security, and for a second reason to put an end to a savage and useless war. 
--------
1401-> A SOUTHERN INCIDENT.
Our readers who took note of the account we published yesterday of an extensive new steel plant to be established near Birmingham, Ala., must have been struck with the significance of such an announcement at the present time. 
--------
1402-> Naval Militia Officers Rejected.
GLOUCESTER, Mass., May 24. -- Three officers on board the Catskill were rejected to-day by the United States surgeons, and will immediately return to the Minnesota. They were Lieut. Sears, for color blindness; Lieut. Pearce, for weakness of the heart, and Chief Engineer Hall, for defective eyes. 
--------
1403-> FLORIDA'S POCAHONTAS.; The Romantic Story of the Daughter of an Indian Chief Told by Gov. Bloxham.

--------
1405-> THE WEATHER AND THE TROOPS.; Intense Heat at Washington Alarms the War Department.
WASHINGTON, July 2. -- Not since 1873 has Washington experienced during any of the first ten days of July so hot a day as this has been. At the Weather Bureau a maximum temperature reaching 101 was recorded. During the past twenty-five years few higher readings of temperature than that have been recorded. 
--------
1406-> DE LOME'S FORECAST.
It is universally conceded that the letter which caused the downfall of the now almost forgotten DE LOME was a sincere expression of his views. The sentiments were too indiscreet to have been manufactured, and the absence of possible motive for such an invention shuts us up to the conclusion that they were uttered for no other reason than that they were honestly entertained. 
--------
1407-> Gladstone Memorial Ideas.
Proposals for Gladstone memorials, in addition to the public monument in the Abbey, are now becoming numerous. Putting aside small and purely local suggestions, there have now been proposed: 
--------
1408-> BRUTAL SPORT IN THE RING.; Gorman Knocked Out by Williams in a "Glove" Contest at Coney Island -- Monroe Badly Battered.
Paddy Gorman of New York was practically knocked out in his fight with Tom Williams of Australia at the Greater New York Athletic Club, Coney Island, last night. The fight was brutal from the start, and it was easy to see that Gorman was no match for Williams. 
--------
1409-> Lee Feels Like Turning Back.
EMPORIA, Va., April 12. -- Gen. Lee arose at 8 o'clock, in time to catch the first glimpse of Virginia soil. He rested well during the night, and when he came out of his room, said: 
--------
1410-> RECEIVER LEVIES $500,000.; Policy Holders in the Star Accident Company Assessed.
CHICAGO, June 11. -- Holders of policies the Star Accident Company since Oct. 14, 1897, in the hands of a receiver, are taking steps to solve what they consider to be a mystery. The receiver has recently begun to send out assessment notices, which if paid, according to the statements of a number of the members of the company, will result in the accumulation of nearly $500,000. 
--------
1411-> PRAIRIE ASHORE AND FLOATED.; The Auxiliary Cruiser, Carrying Troops to Montauk, Grounded Near Amagansett in a Night Fog.
AMAGANSETT, L.I., Aug. 26. -- The auxiliary cruiser Prairie, which was pressed into service at Santiago to carry soldiers to Montauk Point, and which grounded on a sand bar at Napeague Beach, half a mile from the mainland and two miles east of this village, at 10 o'clock last night, was pulled out of the sand by two tugs shortly before 2 o'clock this afternoon, and proceeded to Montauk Point. 
--------
1412-> CRITICISM FROM ABROAD; Singular Unanimity of the German Press in Condemning the United States. FOR STRICTEST NEUTRALITY Semi-Official Journals Cautious -- America's Course Regarded as Undignified -- Commercial Men Believe the War to be Favorable to Germany.
BERLIN, April 23. -- With singular unanimity, the German press of every class is condemning the United States for the course taken toward Spain. All the German newspapers impute to the United States selfish and base motives, and praise the attitude of Spain, in contrast with "the undignified course which the United States is pursuing." 
--------
1413-> CORNELL'S ATHLETES BUSY.; Changes Recently Made in the First University Crew -- Strengthening Baseball and Track Teams.
ITHACA, N.Y., April 23. -- Every afternoon, rain or shine, the oarsmen are out rowing on the inlet under the critical eye of Charles Courtney, the coach of the crews. The Satisfied smile the "Old Man" wears all the time would seem to indicate that he is well satisfied with the outlook. A few days ago some changes were made in the make-up of Capt. Colson's first eight. 
--------
1414-> CHOICE OF SMALL ARMS.; Ordnance Bureau Investigating Mauser and Krag-Jorgensen Rifles.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 15. -- The cessation of hostilities will not make any difference with the engineer and ordnance bureaus of the War Department in the matter of pursuing work on the fortifications. The Engineers will be as active as ever, and the ordnance office will continue its work in manufacturing and mounting the big guns on the fortifications. 
--------
1415-> RAPID TRANSIT QUESTION; Bill to Abolish the Present Commission Favorably Reported to Senate, but Not Accepted. A POINT OF ORDER RAISED Senator Brush's Contention that a Majority Did Not Vote for It Sustained -- New York Delegation's Objections to the Bill
ALBANY, March 23. -- But for a point of order raised against it by Senator Brush, the Platt-Croker Rapid Transit bill would have been reported favorably to the Senate his afternoon. Three Republican and three Democratic members of the Cities Committee voted to so report the bill. Five members, all of them Republicans, voted against it. One member, a Republican, asked to be excused from voting. 
--------
1416-> VIEWS OF THE BERLIN PRESS.

--------
1417-> ASPHYXIATED IN A WELL.; Buhrer Lay Dead and Firemen and Others Nearly Lost Their Lives While After the Body.
Charles Buhrer, a bricklayer, was asphyxiated yesterday morning at the bottom of a fifty-foot well in East New York. Three men who attempted to rescue him came near meeting the same fate, and one after another were drawn from the well just in time to save their lives. The body was finally recovered by policemen. 
--------
1418-> Editorial Article 1 -- No Title
Much and bitter complaint is made in the English press that the expedition in Egypt, which won so brilliant a victory over the Soudanese at Atbara, was not supplied with Rontgen apparatus for discovering the situation of bullets in the bodies of the wounded. The surgeons were therefore obliged to resort to the old-fashioned process of probing, which is at once barbarous and full of danger. 
--------
1419-> THE FINANCIAL MARKETS
Following are bits of gossip regarding stocks in which Wall Street is actively interested -- talk picked up here and there about the Street: 
--------
1420-> Article 7 -- No Title

BERLIN, Feb.8. -- Herr Richter, The Radical leader, referring to the Chinese question, said he regarded the acquisition of Kiao-Chau as much more useful than hoisting flags in Africa. Germany ought to preach none but a free-trade gospel in China, thus forming a natural community of interests with Great Britain. 
--------
1424-> PRIVATE BILLS IN THE HOUSE.; Contest Upon a War Claim for $15,000 Made by Newberry College, South Carolina.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 21. -- This was private bill day in the House. Little was accomplished owing to the fact that most of the time was consumed in the passage of private pension bills coming over from the Friday night session three weeks ago. 
--------
1425-> THIS WEEK IN CONGRES; Holiday Recess Will Close To-morrow, and Both Houses Will Be in Session Wednesday. SENATE MAY LACK A QUORUM House to Have a Debate on Civil Service, Which Probably Will Last into Next Week -- Questions Soon to be Considered.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 2. -- Congress will be in session again Wednesday, but it is not expected that any business of importance will be transacted in either house before next week. 
--------
1426-> IN THE REAL ESTATE FIELD; A Day of Small Transactions at Private Contract -- Results of Salesroom Offerings.
Voorhees  Floyd, in conjunction with J.J. Phillips  Co., have sold for Gustave H. Gossler the four-and-a-half-story brick and limestone front dwelling 7 West Sixty- ninth Street, 20 by 60 by 100. 
--------
1427-> Editorial Article 1 -- No Title
Attorney General HANCOCK'S opinion regarding the effect of the civil service law of 1898 is what we had expected he would give so soon as occasion required. It is, in substance, that this law restores, as to cities, the law of 1893, and rescinds the socalled Black law of 1897, which, inferentially, the Attorney General decides to be contrary to the Constitution. 
--------
1428-> THE SECRETARY OF STATE.; His Sole Performance.
So far as drawing the salary and performing the social functions of the position, John Sherman is Secretary of State, but no further. 
--------
1429-> UTILIZING WASTE THINGS; Sawdust and Shavings, Once Thrown Away, Now Very Useful Materials. USESTO WHICH THEY ARE PUT Packers, Ice Dealers, Sugarmakers, Gasmakers, and Builders Find Sawdust Very Useful, and Shavings Make Fine Bedding and Economical Fuel.
Not very many years ago both sawdust and shavings were esteemed a disagreeable waste, and were shunted as quickly as possible into some handy river or stream, or burned in heaps on waste ground. Nowadays these bye-products of sawing and planing mills have become a considerable source of revenue to the latter. 
--------
1430-> CROKER'S CLUB MAY NOT MOVE.; A Tempting Offer Has Been Received for Its Recently Purchased Home.
The Democratic Club has had various pieces of good fortune befall it since the November election, but, to judge from what happened last night at the meeting of the Board of Governors, the end of its run of good luck is not yet near. 
--------
1431-> AMONG THE HARLEM OARSMEN.; Pleasant Weather Will Witness Increased Activity Among the Clubs -- Training for the Regattas.
The past week has been a disappointing one to Harlem River oarsmen, and especially those who have already started training, as the rain and disagreeable weather have prevented them from taking their practice spins. The season has not yet fully opened, but all that is needed to make things very lively in the water is another spell of pleasant weather such as was experienced about the middle of last month. 
--------
1432-> "BIG BILL" MASON IN COURT.; He and His Friends Suspected of a Recent Robbery in Newark -- Requisition for Him Granted.
Nitrate of silver stains on the hands of "Big Bill" Mason, "Red" Spencer, and Thomas Reilly have, Capt. McClusky claims, connected the men with the burglary of an assay office in Newark, N.J., which occurred last Thursday night. Mason, Spencer, Reilly, and James Coffey were arrested after a desperate struggle last Monday night. 
--------
1433-> RACING AT HURST PARK, ENG.; Lorillard-Beresford Stable's Doric II. Wins an Event.
LONDON, July 2. -- This was the first day's racing of the Hurst Park Club Summer meeting. Mr. Fairle's four-year-old bay colt Eager won the Duchess of York Stakes. Eight horses ran over the course, distance one mile. Lord Zetland's three-year-old bay colt Pinfold was second, and the Lorillard-Beresford stable's four-year-old brown gelding Sandia third. 
--------
1434-> Article 8 -- No Title
THE arrival of Mr. Ffrangcon-Davies with his "cantillation" gives the music lover something to talk about. He may not know what cantillation is, and that fact at least serves to allow him to wonder what the word means and what manner of art it is that the admirable baritone has brought with him from London. 
--------
1435-> REILLY'S NEW YEAR SPREE.; Discovered Himself in Essex Market the Prisoner of No Policeman.
James Reilly, twenty-three years old, a driver in the employ of the Adams Express Company, residing at 1,985 Park Avenue, made a number of New Year's calls and ended by getting drunk. He found himself behind the railing at the Essex Market Court, but how he got there he does not know. 
--------
1436-> Pacer Coleridge Brings $8,000.
FLORA, Ind., May 11. -- Coleridge, one of the fast pacers of the country, which has a record of 2:04 1/4, was sold to-day to a Syracuse, N.Y., syndicate. It is said the price was $8,000. Coleridge was owned by Capt. Hardy of Logansport. 
--------
1437-> PEACEFUL INTERVENTION.
" Peaceably if we can, forcibly if we must." By one of these paths we shall come to the pacification of Cuba, and one or the other we shall surely take. All doubt about that disappeared with the publication of Senator PROCTOR'S recital of the horrors that now possess that island. 
--------
1438-> FOR DEMOCRATIC HARMONY.; Representatives of All the Boroughs Will Confer with Croker at Lakewood.
A special gathering of the Democratic leaders of the city is to be held at Lakewood, N.J., to-morrow and Sunday. The Tammany delegation, which will include Mr. Croker, John F. Carroll, Commissioner Murphy, and Daniel F. McMahon, a host of lesser lights, and perhaps Mayor Van Wyck, will leave the city at 3:40 o'clock this afternoon. 
--------
1439-> A GRAND ARMY CORPS.; Order for Its Formation Issued by the War Department -- Gen. Brooke in Command.
WASHINGTON, April 23. -- The formation of a grand army corps in the Department of the South, with headquarters at three Gulf ports, is an evidence that the Government is to move upon Cuba at once with the troops of the regular army, leaving the volunteers just called for to be disciplined and worked into shape for future use in the campaign. 
--------
1440-> IN THE REAL ESTATE FIELD; Buildings on Pearl and Pine Streets Sold -- Hamilton Properties the Feature in the Salesroom.
Richard M. Montgomery  Co. have sold for Richard J. Chard to G.H. Gossler, for about $30,000, the five-story brick store and loft building 98 Pine Street, extending through to 34 Depeyster Street, 25 by 52, Mr. Gossler already owned two adjoining buildings on Pine Street. 
--------
1441-> The Keokuk and Western Railway.
DES MOINES, Iowa, June 11. -- A mortgage securing bonds of $2,500,000, issued to the Metropolitan Trust and Loan Company by the Keokuk and Western Railway, was placed on record this afternoon. The money will be used to extend the road from Cainesville to Pattonsburg, Mo. 
--------
1442-> PRINCETON 'VARSITY GAMES.; Fetterman of Pennsylvania Breaks the Intercollegiate Record in the Mile Walk.
PRINCETON, N.J., April 23. -- The Princeton 'Varsity Track Association held its annual open handicap games this afternoon. Pennsylvania was represented by her best athletes and made the best showing. Fetterman, her mile walker, broke the intercollegiate record. The summary:

WILMINGTON, Del., July 25. -- After having been locked up since last Friday at 12:45 o'clock, the jury in the case of United States Senator Richard R. Kenney, who is charged with aiding and abetting in the looting of the First National Bank of Dover, to-night was still unable to agree upon a verdict, and was discharged by Judge Bradford from further consideration of the case. 
--------
1444-> THE DAMANOVITZ-MAYER CASE.; Governor Voorhees of New Jersey Refuses to Grant the Warrant of Extradition Asked For.
Gov. Voorhees of New Jersey heard the Damanovitz-Mayer case at Jersey City yesterday, and refused to grant the warrant of extradition asked for by Gov. Hastings of Pennsylvania. John Damanovitz eloped a year ago with Clara Mayer, a daughter of Jacob Mayer of Phoenixville, Penn., and they were married in New York. 
--------
1445-> THE PRINCE AND HIS BICYCLE.; He Learns in Twelve Lessons Without One Fall.
The Prince of Wales's holiday, the larger part of which has been spent in Cannes with frequent trips to Nice and Monte Carlo, has been a most enjoyable one, and the sunshine which has prevailed nearly all the time of the Prince's stay has given him quite a bronzed appearance. 
--------
1446-> THE FIGHT AGAINST HAWAII; Anti-Annexationists Continue Their Attack Upon the Newlands Resolution. PETTIGREW AND McENERY TALK Neither of the Speeches Completed -- Friends of the Resolution Take No Part in the Discussion.
WASHINGTON, June 23. -- When the Hawaiian annexation resolutions were laid before the Senate at 1 o'clock to-day, Mr. PETTIGREW (Sil. Rep., S.D.) was recognized to continue his speech begun yesterday. He yielded the floor to Mr. RAWLINS, (D., Utah,) who antagonized the provision embodied by the conferrees in the Indian Appropriation Bill enabling the Indians to lease the mineral lands of their reservations under certain conditions. 
--------
1447-> BISHOP SATTERLEE'S ADDRESS.; Prayer to be Used at This Time in the Protestant Episcopal Diocese of Washington.
WASHINGTON, April 13. -- Bishop Setterlee of the Episcopal Church has issued the following address to the members of his diocese: 
--------
1448-> PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATIONS.; Secretary of the Embassy at Rome and Consul at Bombay.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 13. -- The President to-day sent these nominations to the Senate: 
--------
1449-> TROOPS READY TO MOVE.; To be Mobilized at Chickamauga -- How Volunteers Will Be Called Out -- Gen. Miles's Plan.
WASHINGTON, April 13. -- Everything is in readiness for a prompt movement of troops toward some central point, particularly of the forces east of the Rocky Mountains, but Gen. Miles says that nothing is likely to be done in the way of moving any large body of troops southeastward until there is evidence that their services will be needed, which will be determined by the action Congress takes. 
--------
1450-> COACHES AND CAPTAIN TALK.; Harry Payne Whitney Sheds Tears Over the Defeat of the Yale Crew.
NEW LONDON, Conn., June 23. -- Coach Courtney, after the 'Varsity race, said: "I believed and still believe that there is not a crew in the country which could beat to-day's crew. Regarding the crew's chances at Saratoga, I cannot say. I have another crew which can do just as well as to-day's. It may be this other crew next time. 
--------
1451-> MAINE SURVIVORS VINDICTIVE.; Men in the Hospital at Key West Burning to Fight Spain.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Feb. 21. -- A special to The Times - Union and Citizen from Key West says: 
--------
1452-> A HUGUENOT ANNIVERSARY.; Celebration in Memory of the Signing of the Edict of Nantes by Henry IV. of France.
The three hundredth anniversary of the signing by King Henry IV. of the Edict of Nantes was celebrated yesterday by the American Society of Huguenots at the French Church du Saint Esprit. A short service, during which several of the old Huguenot psalms and chants were sung, preceded the session, which was entirely devoted to the reading of papers bearing upon the subject of the edict. 
--------
1453-> "A NORMANDY WEDDING."; A New Comic Opera Produced at the Herald Square Theatre.
A large audience of friendly disposition assembled last night at the Herald Square Theatre, where a new comic operetta, entitled "A Normandy Wedding," was produced. The audience applauded everything which gave the slightest excuse for applause and laughed at everything which might have evoked a passing smile from the proverbial Cheshire cat. 
--------
1454-> THIRD DAY OF RAIN.; Houses Damaged, Cellars Flooded, and Trees Uprooted in the Annexed District -- Schooner in Distress.
The third day of rain brought the amount of waterfall up to 3.36 inches. Its continuance sorely tried the tempers of men, and it is a question, indeed, if it did not do much to dampen the war excitement. Even the newsboys seemed to feel that they had surfeited the wet atmosphere with their shoutings of "Extra!" 
--------
1455-> ANDREE'S BALLOON IN CANADA.; Prof. Nordenskjold Calls for Further Investigation of the Report.
STOCKHOLM, Jan. 13. -- Prof. Nordenskjold, the arctic explorer, has informed the Swedish Academy of Science that the Foreign Office has received intelligence that several persons worthy of credence saw Prof. Andree's balloon early in August in British Columbia, seven miles north of Quesnelle Lake, in the District of Cariboo. 
--------

DUBLIN, Aug. 15. -- The whole city is en fete to-day in connection with the laying of the foundation stone of the monument in memory of Wolfe Tone. The municipal offices and many business houses are closed. Scores of thousands of excursionists are here, and delegates are in attendance from the United States, Australia, South Africa, France, and Italy. 
--------
1457-> Editorial Article 3 -- No Title
" You're another" is about the only argument the Democrats in the Legislature can find to use in the debate on Senator MURPHY'S silver vote. It is worthless in his defense. But it is a pity that the Republicans cannot see that it nevertheless puts them in a bad "hole." It is perfectly true. 
--------
1458-> PASTOR REJECTED AT FISHKILL.; The Rev. Thomas Lamont Not Received by the Methodist Church.
FISHKILL LANDING, N.Y., April 13. -- There is a big dissension in the Methodist Episcopal Church. The last session of the Conference sent as pastor the Rev. Thomas Lamont, said to be a near relative of ex-Secretary of War Daniel S. Lamont. This was done against the wishes of the members of the church. 
--------
1459-> New Postal Sub-Station.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 24. -- A new sub-station of the New York Post Office has been ordered by Postmaster General Gary, to be established Feb. 1 at St. John's Avenue and Dawson Street, to be known as Sub-Station No. 101. It will have facilities for the transaction of money order and registry business and the sale of postage supplies. 
--------
1460-> THE THIRTEENTH REGIMENT.
As an old admirer of THE NEW YORK TIMES, one who for many years has appreciated its justice and dignity, permit me to write a few words. In your editorial yesterday you wisely say that "if the disaffection of certain regiments is due to the action of some of their officers, those officers should be removed from the sphere of their pernicious activity." 
--------
1461-> THE DRAGON FLY.
No one could fail to be struck with the singularly perfect adaptation of the insect's structure to a life of aerial piracy. The four wings are large, and, in proportion to their weight, enormously strong. Each is supported by a wonderfully arranged network of slender ribs, which give the necessary rigidity to the thin, transparent membrane forming its basis. 
--------
1462-> NEW PLAYS IN LONDON.
The London Times praises highly the performance by Forbes P. Robertson and Mrs. Patrick Campbell of Maeterlinck's "Pelleas et Melisande," done into English by J.W. Mackail. This is a strange, naive marionette symbolistic treatment of the elemental situation in "Francesca da Rimini," "Lancelot and Guinevere," "Tristan and Isolde." 
--------
1463-> DR. BEAN ASKED TO RESIGN; The Request Made to the Superintendent of the Aquarium Without Charges or Explanation. MAY BE SAFE AS A VETERAN President Clausen Says the Demand Is in Pursuance of a Plan of Reorganization on Which He Has Determined.
Dr. Tarleton H. Bean, Superintendent of the aquarium, yesterday said the report in THE NEW YORK TIMES that his resignation had been asked for was true. He received yesterday morning from George C. Clausen, President of the Park Board, a letter telling him that his resignation was wanted. It contained no charges and no explanation of the reasons for the action. 
--------
1464-> RED CROSS RELIEF WORK; A Letter from C.H.H. Cottrell Telling of What Has Been Done at the Front MANY REFORMS EFFECTED The Society Now in Full Accord with the Army Surgeons -- Supplies for the Rough RidersShipped Yesterday.
Stephen E. Barton has received a long letter from C.H.H. Cottrell, who is with Miss Clara Barton at Santiago. He reports the departure of the Red Cross supply ship State of Texas from Key West on June 20. The ship was unable to make more than 8 miles an hour as a heavy marine growth had accumulated on the hull, owing to the long delay in tropical waters. 
--------
1465-> MR. DEPEW ON THE WAR.
The interview with Mr. DEPEW which was cabled from London is as interesting as his remarks are apt to be. His report of French feeling about the war is without doubt accurate, as well as his account, in general, of how this feeling has been worked up. It is probable, however, that sentiment counts for less, and Spanish bonds for more than he represents. 
--------
1466-> TUMULT AT ZOLA'S TRIAL; The Judge Refuses to Put Any Important Questions to the Witnesses for the Defense. NOVELIST SAVED FROM A MOB M. Casimir-Perier Says It Is His Duty Not to Tell the Truth -- Mme. Dreyfus on the Stand, but Cannot Testify.
PARIS, Feb. 8. -- When the trial of M. Emile Zola and Mr. Perreux, manager of the Aurore, growing out of the former's denouncement of the Esterhazy court-martial in a letter to the newspaper mentioned, was resumed in the Assizes Court of the Seine to-day, there was a terrific struggle to enter, people fighting their way with blows and kicks toward the courtroom. 
--------
1467-> LONDON'S NEWEST RAILWAY.
The opening of the Waterloo and City Railway by the Duke of Cambridge was not only an interesting event in itself, as inaugurating a new electric line, but also important in its bearing on the general question of metropolitan locomotion. Perhaps it goes even further and shadows forth the time when the electrical system of propulsion will be extended from the subterranean lines to those which traverse the upper surface. 
--------

1473-> THE AFFAIR AT CARDENAS.
It was quite evident, even from the first accounts of the fighting at Cardenas, that the attack of our vessels on the Spanish gunboat was by no means an attack upon the Spanish fortifications, though it was announced to be so. There would be no point in such an attack in the present condition of affairs.

Nelson's intrigue with Lady Hamilton is the blot on his life and happiness. But he stood to her as Caesar, not as Antony, to Cleopatra. She was a part of his politics.
