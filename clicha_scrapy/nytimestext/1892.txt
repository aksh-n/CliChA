PICKWICK. -- The coining out of the numbers was a recurrent fact to which families looked hourly forward. Judges read them whiles juries were deliberating, and doctors between their visits to patients. And Carlyle told Forster of a clergyman who, as he left the room of a sick person to whom he had been ministering, heard him say: "Well, thank God, 'Pickwick' will be out in ten days, anyway !"

2-> GRATIFYING INDICATIONS.; REPUBLICANS IN THE WEST PRACTICALLY ADMIT THEIR DEFEAT.
The following sanguine and roseate view of Democratic prospects in Illinois and the Northwest is in many respects corroborated by other information received by the Democratic Na- tional Committee: 
--------
3-> THEY CANNOT WIN BY BRIBERY.
It is now generally admitted, even by candid Republicans, that there is no chance of the election of Mr. HARRISON by honorable means. There is absolutely no evidence of any reaction from the vote of 1890 and 1891 in this State, and without this State Mr. HARRISON canaot hope to win. 
--------
4-> TWO KINDS OF CAMPAIGNS; CONTRAST BETWEEN DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN METHODS. PETTY DEVICES OF MR. HARRISON'S MANAGERS AND THE OPEN CANVASS OF MR. CLEVELAND'S SUPPORTERS -- SOME SAMPLES OF REPUBLICAN "PEANUT POLITICS."
With absolute confidence that the Democratic issues and the Democratic candidates will win a magnificent victory the Democratic national managers will submit their cause to the people on Tuesday. With nervous reliance on the power or money to corrupt voters and to debauch franchises the Republican managers will send their cause to the people.

7-> WESTERN RACING SCHEME; TO GET EASTERN OWNERS TO RACE IN CALIFORNIA. A JOCKEY CLUB WITH GROUNDS LIKE THOSE AT MORRIS PARK TO BE ORGANIZED IN SAN FRANCISCO FOR HIGH-CLASS RACING IN THE EARLY WINTER MONTHS.
SAN FRANCISCO, Cal., Dec. 15 -- Up to the present year Californians have contented themselves with breeding race horses for the rest of the world to buy. The race meetings that have been hold here have been nothing in the way of a credit to the State, but have been quite the contrary as a rule, with all sorts of rascality rampant. But all this has changed this year. 
--------
8-> AT THE KEYSTONE TARGETS.; WOLSTENCRAFT DEFEATS POST IN A LONG AND CLOSE CONTEST.
NEW-LONDON, Sept. 1 -- The third day's shoot at the keystone target tournament was a model one so far as the weather went, but the wind made the shooting rather difficult at times.

The result of today's shooting was as follows:

ST. PAUL, Minn., Nov. 5. -- There is a new drift of traffic at the head of the great lakes. Duluth, Minneapolis, and St. Paul are sensible of it and its cause -- the movement of wheat through new channels. It is a gravitation to the shortest rail and longest water hauls.

11-> THE STEAMER BROKE IN TWO; LOSS IN LAKE SUPERIOR OF THE WESTERN RESERVE. ONLY ONE SURVIVOR OF THE TWENTY-SEVEN PERSONS ON BOARD -- THE OWNER AND HIS FAMILY AMONG THE DROWNED -- HARRY STEWART'S STORY OF THE DISASTER.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Sept., 1 -- The terrific northwester which swept down the chain of great lakes on Tuesday afternoon claimed for its prey one of the finest steel steamers that ply these inland seas, and the broken shell of the splendid Western Reserve is now at the bottom of Lake Superior.

12-> PLAYED-OUT TEMESCAL MINES.; HOW THE SCHEME 18 WORKED TO MAKE A SHOWING.
BAN FRANCISCO, Cal., Sept, 2. -- John Dilke, a mining expert, arrived this afternoon from the much-hoasted Temescal tin mines.

--------
14-> GEN. SCHOFIELD'S REPORT.; NATIONAL GUARD IN TIME OF NEED -- GARRISONS ALONG THE COAST.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 19. -- The annual report of Major Gen. Schofield, submitted to the War Department to-day, shows the discipline and state of military instruction throughout the service to be in a highly-satisfactory condition. The drill regulations have proved satisfactory and justify the belief that, with corrections in minor details, they will fully meet the necessities of modern drill regulations. 
--------
15-> PRINCETON UNIVERSITY.
PRINCETON, N.J., Nov. 5. -- More interest has been manifested by the undergraduate students of the university this year in the political campaign than in any previous Presidential election.

--------
17-> DEPEW STANDS BY HARRISON.; BLAINE'S LETTER OF DECLINATION RE- LEASED HIS FORMER FOLLOWERS.
MINNEAPOLIS, June 4 -- No doubt was left in the minds of the New-York delegation that today's developments meant a life and death struggle between the President and his Secretary of State. Chauncey M. Depow described Blaine's resignation as the most dramatic episode in the history of the Republican Party. When THE TIMES'S correspondent found Dr. Depew half an hour after the news was received neither surprise, disappointment, nor perturbation was visible in his features. 
--------
18-> BUSY "DAVE" MARTIN.; THE REPEATER AND HIS AGENTS WATCHING THE REGISTRATION.
"Dave" Martin, who has charge of the colonization of voters for the Republican National Committee, was one of the men most deeply concerned about the registration yesterday of any in the city.

--------
19-> BOSTON TOPICS.; SUBJECTS OF INTEREST TO THE PEOPLE OF THE HUB.
BOSTON, June 4 -- The opening of the promenade concerts in Music Hall has rejoiced a large element of music-loving Boston. This is Boston's only approach to decorous Bohemianism, but it has secured a stronghold on the public in the last six seasons. Under the skillful baton of T. Adamowski the most classical music is performed by an irreproachable orchestra, while subdued sociability and good cheer prevail at the tables.

WILMINGTON, Del., Nov. 6. -- All indications now point to the complete success of the Dem- ocratic Party at the election in this State on Tuesday. The Democratic situation has been steadily improving for the past month, and now the promise is that that party will win one of its old-time victories. 
--------
22-> LAST NIGHT'S MUSIC.; THE PHILHARMONIC CONCERT.
There has been a notable stirring of the waters on which the Philharmonic Society baa floated serenely for some seasons past. No other cause being discernible, we must attribute the readiness to introduce novelties in the programmes of the organization to Mr. Seidl's assumption of the conductorship. It is, perhaps, not necessary at this time to discuss the question whether the mission of the Philharmonic Is to produce novelties for their own sake. 
--------
23-> EXECUTION BY ELECTRICITY.
To say that the execution at Sing Sing yesterday was the first execution by electricity of the success of which the people have had an opportunity to judge from reports made by eye witnesses is to comment sufficiently upon the monstrous folly of that provision of the law which was repealed last week, and which prohibited any report of an execution by electricity beyond a mere mention of the fact that the execution had occurred. 
--------
24-> MORE CASES OF TYPHUS.; ONE DEATH FROM THE DISEASE ON NORTH BROTHER ISLAND.
Two new cases of typhus were discovered yesterday and in addition one person was taken in charge as a suspect.

ALBANY, N.Y., Jan. 1 -- When the worthy citizens of this town rubbed their eyes into wakefulness this morning and became sufficiently themselves to realize that another year had begun they experienced an unusual sense of relief, which even the burden of all the good resolutions to be made and kept could not obliterate. 
--------
30-> A CASE FOR GOING "SLOW."
English writers seem to be unable to find any explanation of the somewhat blustering tone of our State Department in dealing with the question of the Bering Sea modus vivendi except in the assumption that the Administration at Washington is seeking to make political capital out of the controversy for use in the coming Presidential canvass. 
--------
31-> NYACK.

33-> THE WEEK IN CONGRESS.; TARIFF DISCUSSION THE MAIN FEATURE -- BILLS IN THE SENATE.
WASHINGTON, March 13. -- At least one branch of Congress is now fairly embarked on the long-expected discussion of revenue measures, and the reflex movement is felt in the Senate, where, it may be expected, in view of the proceedings of the last few days, that speeches on the same subject will from time to time be injected into the routine.

ST. LOUIS, Feb. 22 -- For brilliant uncertainty no political gathering probably ever surpassed the extraordinary conglomeration, representing nearly a dozen national organizations -- farmers, laborers, prohibitionists, and what not -- which began its conference in the great Music Hall to-day. To-day's talk all whirled around the burning question whether a third nominee should be put up to run this Fall against the candidates of the old parties.

A few chapters from this diary, which was written at two European Courts, were recently made public in the pages of a popular magazine, but the more than 400 pages which comprise it in the present form contain much more that readers will be glad to see.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 1 -- In entire disregard of the feelings of the editor of the Evening Post, the President is understood to be preparing the special Chilean message to Congress promised in his annual message, and is moved to pursue that course in consequence of the insolent tone in which the correspondence, already transmitted has been couched by the Chileans.

BOSTON, April 23. -- Jerome K. Jerome's new comedy, "The Councilor's Wife," which had its first production on any stage at the Boston Museum last Monday night, was generally highly praised by the critics and is drawing large audiences.

It is not likely that President Beers or the Now-York Life Insurance Company will Issue any more blue and red circulars.

NEW-HAVEN, Feb. 7 -- The early call of the New-York State Democratic Convention to choose delegates to the National Convention is in a measure having the effect it was intended to have in Connecticut.

--------
48-> METHODISTS ASK TO DANCE; A MEMORIAL PRESENTED TO THE OMAHA CONFERENCE. IT COMES FROM THE TROY BODY AND IS FAVORED BY BISHOP FOSTER OF BOSTON -- WOMEN WANT A SAY IN THE MISSION WORK.

ROME, Ga., Jan. 15 -- The flood here has reached its highest point and is considerably worse than was at first expected.

55-> THE REVOLT AGAINST HILL.
Senator HILL is probably persuaded by this time that he made a mistake in calling a midwinter State Convention, to choose delegates to a midsummer National Convention.

Ellery Anderson, President of the club, and Mr. Walter S. Logan introduced the members to Mr. Mills. 
--------
57-> ENFORCING THE LAWS.
The special report of Superintendent BYRNES to the Police Commission is an interesting and suggestive paper. It shows, what every fair-minded New-Yorker will tie ready to admit, that there has been a considerable improvement in the enforcement of the laws since Mr. BYRNKS took command of the police, and that his improvement is due to the efforts of Mr. BYRNES himself.

--------
264-> THE BALTIMORE POST OFFICE.

--------
272-> THE HOUSE NAVAL BILL.
The provision made by Mr. HERBERT'S committee for the increase of the navy probably falls short of public expectations as well as of the country's needs.

BALTIMORE, May 5. -- Thirteen lively heats were trotted at the Gentlemen's Driving Park tills afternoon, and two of the three events were decided.

--------

CHICAGO, Feb. 3. -- The Directors of the Whisky Trust adjourned to-night after one of the most momentous meetings in its history. Almost all the forenoon was devoted to the matter of leases.

--------
289-> LIQUOR AND THE LAW.
Not long ago THE TIMES expressed a doubt whether no excise law at all would not be better than the excise law we have, as it is at present administered and as it is likely to be administered for an indefinite period to come. That doubt is strengthened by a consideration of the new excise law now pending in the Legislature. 
--------

"IMAGINATION," BY MR. ROSENFELD. "Imagination," a farce in three acts by the author of "A Possible Case," has all the peculiarities of Mr. Sydney Rosenfeld's genius, or perhaps it would be better to say his Muse, and thus avoid using a dangerous word.

--------
378-> IBSEN AGAIN.
The first appearance or HenriK Ibsen's drama, "Der Volksfeind," is an occasion worthy of a larger audience than was gathered to bear it last night at the Amberg Theatre. It is true that the play is more fitted for reading than for acting, but that is only the truth concerning many plays in German which are received by crowds with extravagant delight. 
--------
379-> RUSHING FOR THE NEW LANDS.; BUT THE RESERVATION WILL NOT BE OPEN UNTIL APRIL 19.

--------
382-> JUDGE MAYNARD AND THE BAR.
In naming the committee to investigate the charges against Judge MAYNARD, Mr. PECKHAM has given a perfect guarantee of the thoroughness and the impartiality with which the investigation will be accomplished. The committee is chosen about equally, we believe, from the two political parties, though it contains no names of mere politicians. 
--------
383-> CLARKSON HARD AT WORK; HE ARRIVES IN WASHINGTON AFTER BLAINE LEAVES THERE. HE WANTS A WHIFF OF ADMINISTRA- TION AIR -- THE ANTI-HARRISON TALK OF THE HOTEL LOBBIES -- AN OFFICE HOLDER'S VIEWS.

To the Editor of the New-York Times: In the President's latest attempt to secure the largest possible share of the Irish-American vote in the pivotal State of New-York he has, by a singular chance, given a foreign mission to a young man who was from boyhood in some degree the protege of the Republican politician whose defeat as a candidate for Mayor of Buffalo started Grover Cleveland on the road to the White House.

--------
393-> ARMISTEAD'S DOUBLE PAY.; LEAVE FOR PRIVATE EMPLOYMENT FOR A NAVAL CONSTRUCTOR.
WASHINGTON, May 7 -- The system or granting leaves to naval officers, for no other purpose than to allow them to engage in private enterprises, has been a source of inconvenience to the service, but no Secretary has yet found himself in a position to ignore the influential backing that always accompanies requests for leaves of this character.

--------
399-> Editorial Article 1 -- No Title
Ex-Senator BLAIR is not a very important or imposing figure before the public at present, but he is entitled to justice and fair play. It does not appear from the correspondence that has been published with reference to his appointment as Minister to China that the objections made to him by the Chinese Government had any real force or validity. 
--------
400-> NEW-JERSEY'S LEGISLATURE.; NEWARK AND JERSEY CITY FIGHTING ON THE WATER QUESTION.
TRENTON, Jan. 27 -- The water question bids fair to be a bone of angry contention between Jersey City and Newark as long as the session, lasts. A bill, mainly drawn on the lines suggested in Gov. Abbett's message, is pending in both houses. In the Senate it is in the bands of a committee, of which Senator Barrett of Newark is Chairman. 
--------
401-> THE "HAMILTON" TREES.
This is hard. For many days all old New-Yorkers, all persons hereabout who have a reverence for landmarks and historic relics, and all tne newspapers have declared and asserted with frequent iteration that the Hamilton trees ought to be spared. These trees are a precious adornment of the Grange on Washington Heights, a little to the north of West One Hundred and Forty-second Street, between Convent Avenue and Amsterdam Avenue. 
--------
402-> NEW BASEBALL RECORDS; PHILADELPHIA'S CLUB WON FOURTEEN STRAIGHT GAMES. WRIGHT'S BOYS DEFEATED THE NEW-YORKS AFTER A LIVELY CONTEST -- THE NEW MEN OF THE LOCAL CLUB ARE PLAYING A GOOD GAME.
If Manager Powers is only fortunate enough to secure a few more players of the calibre of young Lyons and Doyle, the probabilities are that we will have a club in this city capable of properly representing the metropolis on the baseball field. Both these men played yesterday, and their work was of a very brilliant character, surpassing by long odds that of any of the old members of the team. 
--------
403-> ELEVATED ROAD SUITS.; THE COURT OF APPEALS AFFIRMS THE STORCK AND BECKER JUDGMENTS.
ALBANY, March 22 -- The Court of Appeals affirmed two judgments against the New-York elevated railroads to-day. In the action brought by Frederick R. Storck against the Metropolitan, Judge Gray writes the opinion, in which he says: 
--------
404-> 'ENGLISH" USED FOR "BRITISH."; THE SCOTCH CLAIM EQUAL SHARE IN GREAT BRITAIN'S GLORY.
From Circular of Scottish Home-Rule Union. "Too great a tendency to self-esteem, too little disposition to regard the feelings, the habits, and the ideas of others" is essentially an English characteristic; an absolute disregard of the national sentiment of smaller nationalities is part of their nature; and conciliation is not one of the arts for which Englishmen are famed. 
--------
405-> GREAT SHOW FOR WOMEN.; NOVELTIES IN COSTUMES, DRESS GOODS, MILLINERY, AND PARASOLS.
If beauty of color, novelty of design, and richness of fabric still have their almost proverbial attractions for the ladies, the store of Stern Brothers, 32 to 36 West Twenty-third Street, will draw them like a magnet. Everything the feminine heart could long for in the way of dry goods of all kinds is to be found there in the latest styles and shades. 
--------
406-> AMENDMENT OF THE BALLOT LAW.
The fact that a Tammany member of the Assembly has introduced a bill patching up the present ballot law of this State in some minor particulars is likely to be taken as an indication that Tammany is not yet prepared to give its support to the more radical amendments of the Saxton bill, which were reported "for consideration" in the Senate yesterday. 
--------
407-> THE STUDY OF MANKIND.
Considering the attention paid by the chroniclers of the Spanish conquest of America to the red race and the interest taken in them much later by explorers and visitors of North America, such as CHAMPLAIN and PETER KALM, HUMBOLDT and CATLIN, very little has been done in a systematic way by our institutions of learning toward the study of this most interesting race of mankind or any other. 
--------
408-> OBITUARY.; WILLIAM H. FOLK.

The police were notified of the trouble, and men were sent to escort the engine men to their homes. 
--------
410-> BLAINE VS. HARRISON.
The Administration appears to be divided against itself in the contest for delegates to the Republican National Convention. Nominally at present the issue is BLAINE against HARRISON, and in a sense it is so in fact. We do not believe it is within the bounds of probability that Mr. BLAINE will consent, or that his family and personal advisers who understand his physical condition will consent, to having him pat in nomination for the Presidency. 
--------
411-> IT NEEDS MENDING BADLY; EFFORTS TO CORRECT OUR FAULTY PATENT-LAW SYSTEM. MONOPOLIES ARE FOSTERED WHILE THE INVENTOR LOOKS VAINLY FOR JUSTICE -- CONGRESS WAKING UP AT LAST ON THE SUBJECT.
The Committee on Patents of the House of Representatives is holding two meetings a week to consider the bills before the House affecting patents and trade marks. This unusual activity of the committee when compared with that of the committees of previous Congresses is caused by the great interest now taken by the American Association of Inventors and Manufacturers and other bodies in patent legislation. 
--------
412-> THE SENATE UNDER RULES.
The Legislature assembled and organized on Tuesday, Jan. 5. Yesterday, the twenty-third day of the session, the Senate adopted a body of rules for its government in the conduct of business, having been without such rules, in violation of all precedent, during this long period. Thus the constitutional provision is tardily obeyed.

Jay Gould sat on a sofa in the lobby of the Windsor Hotel yesterday afternoon and sulked. The Western Traffic Association had refused to do just as he wanted it to, and he was unhappy. His friends Russell Saga and Sidney Dillon sat down beside him and tried to cheer him up by telling him funny stories, but never a smile did they bring to his countenance. 
--------
417-> FAMILY LIFE IN AMERICAN CITIES.
The Census Office has issued a bulletin (No. 19) stating the number of persons to a family and the number of families to a dwelling for various cities of the United States. These figures alone are a little dry perhaps; but, being collated with other facts regarding death, disease, and crime, acquire new meaning. 
--------
418-> Editorial Article 1 -- No Title
The controversy between ex-Mayor HEWITT and Mayor GRANT concerning their respective responsibility for the "dives" with which, the city has lately been infested is enlightening, Ex-Mayor HEWITT says he by peremptory orders to the Police Commissioners, given early in his term closed up all the "dives" then doing business, and that when he went out of office there were none. 
--------
419-> LENOX.
LENOX, Mass., Feb. 6 -- There are now about eight inches of snow in Lenox and the sleighing is good. This is about the first time there has been any sleighing here of any consequence, and many cottagers are coming up from New-York next wools; to enjoy it.

SYRACUSE, N.Y., Feb. 20 -- The suspicion that Miss Fannie Voshall had committeed suicide at midnight on Thursday was confirmed to-night, by the report of Chemists Manlius Smith and Francis Englehards, who, after the post-mortem examination by the Coroner's physicians had failed to discover any traces of poison, analyzed the stomach of the dead girl and found abundant traces of hydrocyanic acid, the active principle of the deadly potassium cyanide. 
--------
424-> O'FERRALL STANDS FAST.; HILL'S DESPERATE ATTEMPTS TO CHANGE THE ROCKWELL VERDICT.
WASHINGTON, March 22 -- It is not to be supposed, because David B. Hill is not making a noise about the refusal of Representative O'Ferrall (Dem., Va.,) to compel the Elections Committee to keep Hill's man Rockwell in his seat, that Hill has abandoned his purpose of overturning the verdict of the Elections Committee. 
--------
425-> Editorial Article 6 -- No Title
Mr. JOHN BIGELOW has -- we may not say he enjoys -- the reputation of combining vapid theorizing and impracticable precepts in political affairs in a degree hardly ever excelled by an American barring Eli Perkins. Judging by his latest deliverances his peculiar talent is not changed by age. Take this for a sample dictum: "I have never supposed that Mr. CLEVELAND, since his defeat by Mr. HARRISON, would be renominated. 
--------
426-> WAS THE BOND ISSUE VALID; ARGUMENT ON THE STATUTE GOV- ERNING KINGS COUNTY. MR. DE WITT, WHO FRAMED THE LAW, SAYS THE EAST RIVER SAVINGS INSTITUTION'S PURCHASE DID NOT EXCEED THE LIMIT.

--------
427-> MR. HARRISON IN KINGS COUNTY.
The primaries of the Republican Party in Kings County on Thursday are generally conceded to have given a fair majority to Naval Officer WILLIS, which that energetic gentleman claims is a triumph for the Administration. If the issue in the primaries were really what the most emphatic friends of Mr. HARRISON insist that it was, the result was not so flattering as the President might well wish. 
--------
428-> ISLE OF WIGHT EVOLUTIONS.; BAD BEHAVIOR OF BRENNAN TORPEDOES -- AN EXPENSIVE TOY.
The most interesting phase of these operations -- and certainly the most important from a scientific as from the taxpayers' point of view, remarks the London Daily News -- was reached to-day, when a fleet was supposed to be making its way into the Solent under concentrated fire from the Western Forts, and with the certainty of a real Brennan torpedo being launched at it. 
--------
429-> GOOD METHODS IN NAVY YARDS.; A SYSTEM OF PAYMENTS THAT WILL SAVE TIME AND MONEY.
WASHINGTON, April 22. -- The Secretary of the Navy has rearranged the regulations pertaining to the civil force at navy yards so as to save the Government time and money. It is estimated that $30,000 will be saved to the New-York Navy Yard alone, and it is all due to the exercise of business common sense. 
--------
430-> A CRUEL DECEPTION.
"The whole contest over this issue," said Mr. BLAND on Tuesday, "is between the capitalists who demand interest and the people who demand money instead of interest." We suppose that this really represents very fairly the view taken by the sincere supporters of silver coinage. They see a considerable numbeer of persons in the country. 
--------
431-> CHAIRMAN FINLEY YIELDS A POINT.
CHICAGO, April 9. -- The indicatiors are that a complete victory will be gained by the Chicago, St. Paul and Kansas City Railway in its controversy with Chairman Finley regarding the right of the Western roads to use the reduced fares between Chicago and Ohio River points as basing rates from Western and Northwestern points to Cincinnati, Louisville, and Indianapolis via Chicago. 
--------
432-> SPRING SALES STARTING WELL; LAST WEEK'S TEST OF THE REAL ESTATE MARKET A SUCCESS.
If prospects for the Spring sesson in real estate are to be judged by last week's sales, there ought no longer to be any possible doubt that the market will be more active than it has been for years.

434-> A FIGHT AGAINST THE PRISON RING.
The Prison Association of this State, with the support of the Civil Service Reform Association, has determined to make a fight against the political ring which has demoralized the public service in the State prisons.

LOUISVILLE, Ky., May 25 -- The first battle in the Kentucky Democratic Convention, which met at 2 o'clock this afternoon, was a decisive victory for the anti-instruction element.

--------
439-> LONDON SOCIETY.
In the current number of the North American Review Mr. W.H. MALLOCK considers the article by Lady JEUNE on "London Society," which had appeared in a previous number of that periodical.

The agents of the Wilson Steamship Line and those of the Ocean Steamship Company of Savannah are considerably exercised over a matter of cotton and sulphur matches.

Although most earnestly opposed to the Paddock bill, which has passed the United States Senate and which associates drugs with food in its restrictive provisions, the manufacturers of proprietary medicines, against whom the bill is aimed, are not losing sleep over the prospects of its passage.

WASHINGTON, March 2 -- Those Democrats in Washington who have been loosing upon Hill as the invincible proprietor of the Democrats of New-York, and who have relied upon him to follow up his midwinter convention by showing that he controlled the voters who go to the polls as well as the comparatively few who go to the primaries, were amazed to-day at the news from all over New-York State.

--------
695-> A NEW CLIPPER SHIP.; HER SPEED COMPARED WITH THAT OF A STEAM VESSEL.
If the performances of two ships which were concluded yesterday when they reached this port are laid side by side, whoever campares them is likely to go over his own reckoning a second time for fear that he may have made some error in chronology. Between the two ships there is no point of resemblance. One represents a new era in marine construction; the other is a type that is fast being supplanted by steam. 
--------

--------
700-> SUNDAY AND THE WORLD'S FAIR.
It is not likely that the Directors of the World's Fair have yet taken into very serious consideration the question of opening the fair on Sunday, or rather of not opening it on Sunday.

LOUISVILLE, Ky., March 30. -- The Republican State Convention, held in this City to-day, was larger and more enthusiastic than is generally the case.

--------
708-> TALKS ABOUT WHIST.
VI. The Philistine of whom I wrote some weeks ago has picked up the gauntlet then thrown down and raised with it the question, What is the advantage of adopting the "American lead," giving information as to length of suit?

--------

COLUMBUS, Ohio, Jan. 5, -- The "shouters" have been taking to the woods during the day, and to-night there are comparatively few of the rank and file of the contingent within the city limits.

--------
713-> A SAMPLE HILL DEMOCRAT.
ALFRED H. COLQUITT, United States Senator from Georgia, has declared for HILL. COLQUITT is a man who is under all sorts of honorable obligation to GROVER CLEVELAND, whose confidence he had in large measure while CLEVELAND was President, presumably upon professions of agreement and sympathy regarding political principles and policy. 
--------
714-> SOCIETY TOPICS OF THE WEEK.
The uncertain weather of the last week was the chief cause of making almost a failure, financially speaking, of what it was hoped would be a triumphant success -- namely, the Open Air Horse Snow. Not alone was the rain of Thursday a decided deterrent, but the continued east winds made it imprudent for people to sit out on the benches in the evening.

--------
716-> A SETTLEMENT WITH ITALY.
The removal of all legitimate cause of ill feeling between the United States and Italy and the resumption of full and regular diplomatic relations seem now to have been arranged, and in a manner highly creditable to both Governments. The two countries have so much in common, and have so little on either side that should give rise to differences that any interruption of perfect good feeling was particularly to be regretted. 
--------
717-> MR. BRANDT'S SILVER MINE.
Conscientious newspapers in this town print a tale of wonder telegraphed from a place in Colorado which bears the apposite name of Creed.

--------
718-> WANAMAKER'S POSTAL CARDS.; THE OLD DEVICE VERY MUCH BETTER THAN ITS SUCCESSOR.
WASHINGTON, May 30 -- When the Postmaster General made a change in the styles and sizes of the postage stamps, persons who had an inveterate and incurable dislike of the green postage stamp were delighted because the green was transferred from the two-cent stamp to one of another denomination.

The Milholland Bliss row in the Eleventh Assembly District is going to disturb the officials in Washington again, and there is a good chance that it will give Civil Service Commissioner Theodore Roosevelt an opportunity to make one of his thorough investigations to see it there has been a violation of the spirit and letter of the civil service law in the Eleventh District.

--------
722-> Editorial Article 6 -- No Title
The New-Haven Palladium is a nice sort of paper for an organ of opinion in a respectable college town.

--------
723-> BROWN UNIVERSITY.
PROVIDENCE, R.I., April 30 -- Twenty years ago the Twenty-fourth Kappa Chapter of the Chi Phi Fraternity was established at Brown University, and the anniversary was celebrated at the Trocadero, Providence, by an elaborate spread and its convivial concomitants.

--------
733-> MR. CLEVELAND IN HIS OWN STATE.
Within the borders of the State of New-York there is no longer any occasion to argue that Mr. CLEVELAND, if nominated for the Presidency, will carry the State by a very large majority and receive its thirty-six Electoral votes.

--------
734-> PHILADELPHIA WON BY A RUN.

Cotton is essentially a sun plant.

Emmons, a gunsmith in the national armory and a monomaniac on religion, broke into Olivet Congregational Church last night, provisioned the pulpit for a week, and, armed with a revolver and fantastically draped and veiled in black, held the whole congregation at bay from 9 A.M. until 2 P.M. 
--------
1117-> MR. BLAINE ON THE ISSUES; HSI CONTRIBUTION TO THE RE- PUBLICAN CAMPAIGN. HE WILL NOT STUMP FOR HARRISON, BUT HE WRITES A LETTER IN SUP- PORT OF THE PARTY PLATFORM -- ALMOST AN ECHO OF THE PRESI- DENT'S LETTER.
AUGUSTA, Me., Sept. 6. -- The following letter from the Hon. James G. Blaine to Chairman Manley of the Republican State Committee was made public to-night: 
--------

WASHINGTON, Dec. 20 -- Some very valuable information relative to the laboring classes of Europe was submitted to the joint Committee on Immigration, which met this morning to confer about the bill introduced by Mr. Chandler in the Senate to suspend immigration for one year. 
--------
1119-> THE VOTE OF PENNSYLVANIA.
The vote of the State of Pennsylvania at the recent election presents an interesting subject of study. The official returns are not fully made up, but the reports generally agree that there was a falling off in the total vote from that of four years ago, whereas it would have been natural to expect an increase of from 80,000 to 100,000. 
--------
1120-> APPLE PIES AND THE TARIFF.
One great American industry has unquestionably been benefited by the muchabused bill of MCKINLEY, and that is the apple-pie industry. Statistics show that the cost of production of apple pie has fallen off largely, that the consumption has increased, and that the ruling market rate of 10 cents for a two-and-a-half-cent wedge of this delightful edible has remained unchanged. 
--------
1121-> JAPANESE CONVERTED TO CHRISTIANITY.; MISSIONARY WORK OF THE REV. DR. HARRIS ON THE PACIFIC COAST.

The Dry Goods Economist, one of the organs of the dry goods trade, has recently interviewed a number of business men upon the question, whehter Mr. Cleveland should call an extraordinary session of Congress immediately upon his inauguration for the special purpose of taking up tariff revision. It has published the result of its inquiries, extending not only to New-York, but to many distant and important trade centres. 
--------
1123-> SIDEWALK PEDDLERS.; STOREKEEPERS EXACT RENT FROM THOSE WHO SELL FROM STANDS.
The peddlers who have erected stands on the sidewalks, and who yell in the cars of the crowds who are passing by from early morning until late at night, have to pattribute to the storekeepers in front of whoso business places they stand. 
--------
1124-> A WASTE OF TIME.
Mr. CLEVELAND spoke out clearly and with emphasis for a sound currency in his letter of acceptance. No man can misunderstand the meaning of his words: 
--------
1125-> IN HARRISON'S OWN STATE; DEMOCRATS BELIEVE THEY WILL CAPTURE INDIANA. THE MANUFACTURED REPUBLICAN RN- THUSIASM OF FOUR YEARS AGO UT- TERLY MISSING THIS FALL -- BROKEN PROMISES OF THE PRESIDENT HAVE LOST HIM HIS WORKERS.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Oct. 11. -- Four years ago at this time of the year Indiana was in a whirl of political excitement. Never before, even in the most hotly-contested elections, had this Commonwealth been so rocked by dissension and so illuminated by red fire as it had then been, excited by the arguments and the demonstrations for Harrison and Cleveland. 
--------
1126-> FOUR YEARS AGO AND NOW.; OPINIONS OF A MANUFACTURER ON THE TARIFF QUESTION IN 1888.
NEW-HAVEN, Oct. 11. -- A recently-published interview with Max Adler of this city, a member of a coraet-making firm, in which he declined to say how he should vote at the approaching election, but in which he expressed the opinion that "the McKinley bill has benefited my business," recalls an interview published four years ago with the head of his firm. 
--------
1127-> BROOKLYN'S MEMORIAL ARCH; TO BE UNVEILED ON OCT. 21 -- A COMMITTEE OF ONE HUNDRED.
When the Columbus celebration in Brooklyn takes place, on Oct. 21, the local authorities will unveil the new Soldiers and Sailors' Memorial Arch, erected on the plaza near Prospect Park. 
--------
1128-> SENATOR SHEEMAN'S TALK; ADDRESS TO A SMALL AUDIENCE IN COOPER UNION. PROTECTION UPHELD AND THE M'KINLEY ACT PRAISED -- THE SILVER QUESTION, TOO -- THE STATE BANK TAX REPEAL PROPOSITION AS THE SENATOR SEES IT.
Senator John Sherman at Ohio last evening had a humiliating experience, such as he had no reason to expect in this city. Asked to come here and talk on the issues of the campaign, in Cooper Union, he had to speak to an audience that did not more than half fill the hall. For this Mr. Sherman can thank the Republican Club, under whose auspices he came here. 
--------
1129-> COL. HAIN TO BE MANAGER.; PHILADELPHIA WILL NOW TRY THE ELEVATED RAILROADS.
PHILADELPHIA, Penn., Aug. 21. -- The question of rapid transit in this city, which has so long been agitated by the press and public-spirited citizens, may now be regarded as settled, and an enormous amount of capital will be expended by a syndicate of Philadelphians and New-Yorkers to construct an elevated road such as is called for by the charters of the North Eastern and Quaker City Companies. 
--------
1130-> TO ENGLISH EYES.
All the cable dispatches yesterday morning were filled with references to public opinion -- or newspaper opinion -- in England regarding the recent troubles in this country. Much, of the newspaper comment, as we have already pointed out, is merely the fruit of a highly-developed kind of narrow partisanship. 
--------
1131-> MRS. BAYLIES'S BAY WINDOW.; HEARING RELATIVE TO IT BEFORE THE PARK BOARD.
The Park Board gave a special hearing yesterday in relation to the bay window which Mrs. N.A. Baylies wants to construct on the avenue front of her new house at Fifth Avenue and Seventy-first Street, which was objected to by Mrs. Thomas E. Satterthwaite, an abutting property owner. 
--------
1132-> FACTS FOR COAL BURNERS; NEW-YORK CITY "SQUEEZED" BY THE READING COMBINE. PRICES GETTING HIGHER NOTCH BY NOTCH -- TESTIMONY BEFORE THE SPECIAL SENATE COMMITTEE -- STATE- MENT BY EDITOR SAWARD.
A great deal of valuable information for coal consumers was elicited yesterday at the Murray Hill Hotel before the special Senate committee appointed to investigate the Reading Railroad combination. It was the first meeting of the committee hold since the adjournment of the Legislature. In the course of the last session of the Senate the committee made a special report of the work it had accomplished during its previous meetings. 
--------
1133-> TRIALS OF WYOMING PASSENGERS; A STATEMENT OF FACTS AND AN APPEAL IN THEIR BEHALF.
To the Editor of the New-York Times: Knowing the keen interest always manifested by THE NEW-YORK TIMES in the condition of American citizens, however and wherever situated, I feel assured that you will, by means of your valuable journal, extend to us -- the passengers imprisoned for no just cause on board the steamship Wyoming at lower Quarantine -- all the aid and succor in your power. 
--------
1134-> THEY STILL HOLD THE MINT.
We did expect that the President, enlightened by the notable decision of Judge HEBBARD in the suit of M.W. Fox against the Nevada Mill and Mining Company and the Directors of the Hale and Norcross Silver Mining Company, would appoint in the place of the late Superintendent of the Carson Mint a trustworthy man not connected with the abuses revealed by the trial of that suit. 
--------

HARRISBURG, Penn., Sept. 21. -- The Baker ballot law, which was enacted by the last Legislature, will be voted under for the first time in November. The one thing the voter knows is that he must mark his ballot. It is not expected that more than 75 per cent. of the entire vote will be polled. 
--------
1137-> THE RAILWAY WRECKS.
The accident on the Port Wayne Road yesterday morning seems to have been due to a piece of criminal negligence on the part of somebody. "Accidents" are much rarer on American railroads than they used to be, and are becoming more and more strictly limited to accidents, properly so called, and not to accidents that are properly called crimes. 
--------
1138-> The August "Harper."
Harper for August is an admirable number. Nothing in current periodical literature better deserves to become a vacation companion. Miss Woolson's paper on Corfu and the Ionian Sea is charming, written as it is with the familiar pertness of this writer, and beautifully illustrated. Mr. Millet's Danubian pilgrimage draws to a close, and the reader makes acquaintance with life in the remote delta of the great stream. 
--------
1139-> Editorial Article 1 -- No Title
The disappearance of the time-honored "Bureau of Provisions and Clothing," or, rather, its rechristening as the Bureau of Supplies and Accounts, as effected by this year's Naval Appropriation bill, while strictly only a nominal change, yet typifies a great practical improvement. When Secretary WHITNEY came into office one of his first efforts was directed to reorganizing the somewhat clashing and overlapping bureaus of the Navy Department on a more businesslike basis. 
--------
1140-> A NEW INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL.; FORMALLY OPENED AND DEDICATED BY THE CHILDREN'S AID SOCIETY.
The new building at 219 Sullivan Street, erected for the Industrial School of the Children's Aid Society in that section of the city, was formally opened and dedicated yesterday with appropriate exercises.

--------
1142-> THE SHORT DAY SESSION.; DELEGATES KEPT WAITING FOR THE CREDENTIAL COMMITTEE'S REPORT.
MINNEAPOLIS, June 9. -- The sun beat down morrily this morning through the ventilating shafts of Convention Hall.

--------
1143-> PETITIONS TO SENATOR HILL.; NEW-YORKERS REQUEST HIM TO OPPOSE THE ANTI-OPTION BILL.

The clubs playing were Milwaukee against University, Hamilton against Amrita, and Capital against St. Paul. 
--------
1145-> BIG "COMBINE" PROJECTED; LEADING SILVERSMITHS OF THE COUNTRY TO FORM A COMPANY. NO INTENTION TO START A TRUST OR TO ADVANCE PRICES -- THE SCHEME IS TO ESTABLISH A THING LIKE THE LONDON GUILDHALL -- A MEASURE TO PROTECT BUYERS.

Shiebler Manufacturing Company, and Dominick  Haff of this city, and the Towle Manufacturing Company of North Adams, Mass. 
--------
1146-> THE GERMAN ARMY BILL.; THE TAX ON GERMANY WHICH ITS PASSAGE WOULD MEAN.
FRANKFORT, Nov. 10. -- Finance is gradually getting the better of politics, and a decision between tlio two must be coming on apace. With a debt of 4,000,000,000 rubles, an unredeemed note issue of about an equal amount, and a several years' deficit of something like 500,000,000 rubles, also uncovered, the Bussions nave failed again to raise the contemplated loan in France. 
--------
1147-> FINE ARTS AT THE FAIR.; H.C. IVES, CHIEF OF THE DEPARTMENT, TELLS NEW-YORKERS ABOUT IT.

Tuthill, Secretary of the Advisory Committee for New-York of the Fine Arts Department of the World's Fair at Chicago, a meeting of painters, sculptors, architects, designers, engravers, etchers, and other artists of the city and vicinity was held last night at the National Academy of Design, corner of Twenty-third Street and Fourth Avenue.

--------
1151-> MR. MELAMET'S CANTATA.

The concert was given by a temporary union of the German singing societies under the title of Columbus Freier Sangerbund. 
--------
1152-> DIVIDING WHAT IS LEFT; THE FEW STATES NOW SURE FOR HARRISON AND WEAVER. JUST HOW THEY WILL BE SHARED IS STILL A MATTER OP DOUBT -- OHIO VERY CLOSE AND CLAIMED BY BOTH PARTIES -- DISPUTED RESULTS IN NEBRASKA AND THE DAKOTAS -- MR. CLEVELAND'S SPLENDID PLURALITY IN ILLINOIS.
The latest reports from Tuesday's election make no marked change in the tremendous majority for Cleveland and Stevenson. It is probable that the Republicans have won nine instead of eight Electors in Michigan, which would make Mr. Cleveland's majority 131. On the other hand, Montana's slight plurality for Harrison Electors may be wiped out, not counting the votes of Ohio, which State is in doubt. 
--------
1153-> QUICK TIME TO WASHINGTON.; RIVALRY BETWEEN THE PENNSYLVANIA AND BALTIMORE AND OHIO.

The note has caused a great sensation in Turkish official circles. 
--------
1157-> MR. DALY'S "LEADING MAN."; H.B. CONWAY IS NOT TO TAKE THE PLACE OF JOHN DREW.
Augustin Daly has at last taken the trouble to deny the report that has been printed and reprinted in almost every New-York paper except THE TIMES that he had engaged for His "leading man," to replace John Drew, H.B. Conway of London. In an interview published in the San Francisco Post, Mr. Daly says, in answer to a direct question as to the truth of this statement:

--------
1160-> LIBERAL GAINS CONTINUE; TWELVE NEW SEATS SECURED IN THE METROPOLIS. A DAY OF GLOOM THAT ENDED IN JOT FOR THE GLADSTONIANS -- THIRTEEN MORE GAINS WILL WIPE OUT THE TORY MAJORITY -- THE PARNELLITES CUTTING NO FIGURE IN THE FIGHT -- FINE PROSPECTS FOR THE LIBERALS TO SECURE A GOOD WORKING MAJORITY.
LONDON, July 7. -- The experience of 1885 is being curiously repeated in the vagaries of the election returns. At the end of the third day then the Standard said, "the Liberal defeat has been turned into a rout." Within ten days thereafter "it was apparent that the Liberals had the biggest majority any party had enjoyed in years." 
--------
1161-> CANADA MAY RETALIATE; SURPRISED AT PRESIDENT HARRISON'S PROCLAMATION. NOT WILLING TO AID THE REPUBLICAN CAMPAIGN BY RETREATING FROM HER POSITION -- REPRISALS ON THE WELLAND CANAL URGED -- TRAFFIC CAN BE BADLY HANDICAPPED.
OTTAWA, Ontario, Aug. 21. -- The issue of President Harrison's proclamation against Canada is the sole topic of conversation here. The move was entirely unexpected and will likely necessitate an early meeting of the Cabinet. 
--------

Six races were run at the Brighton Beach track yesterday, and the Favorites were beaten in all but the first one, so that the backers of the first choices had about as hard a time of it as they did on Friday last or on Saturday at Monmouth.

--------
1163-> CHICAGO PRODUCE MARKETS.
CHICAGO, Dec. 22.-- Hog product was lower in sympathy with the decline in hogs, and the improve- ment it grain reflected little strength into this mar- ket. There was a good deal of selling of long stuff bought the day before on the theory that the com- bine was to put the price up, and these offerings added to the feeling of depression. Receipts of products were large and shipments free. 
--------
1164-> STILL TERROR - STRICKEN; SOME WHO FLED FROM OIL CITY REFUSE TO RETURN. BODIES FOUND AT KENNERDELL BURIED -- WHAT A VISITOR SAW IN THE STRICKEN CITY -- RELIEF AND SANITARY WORK IN PROGRESS.

BERLIN, July 22 -- The communications recently published in the Svoboda, the organ of the Bulgarian Government, from the Russian Legation at Bucharest to the Russian Foreign Office, showing that every movement undertaken against Prince Ferdinand of Bulgaria was directed, paid for, and instigated by Russia, has caused a sensation in this city.

--------
1171-> MME. LINEFF'S RUSSIAN CHOIR.
The two concerts given at Music Hall by Mme. Lineff and her Russian choir -- one last Saturday night and another last night -- were by all means the most remarkable, interesting, and instructive musical entertainments given in this city this season, and they will remain among the choicest memories of those to whom music is something higher than a mere concourse of sweet sounds. 
--------
1172-> THE EPIDEMIC'S MARCH.; INCREASING IN SEVERITY AT SARATOFF -- GUARDS ON THE GERMAN BORDER.
ST. PETERSBURG, July 22 -- Cholera has appeared at Koslov and Tambov, having been introduced by travelers. 
--------
1173-> NEW-YORKS WON EASILY; THEY PLAYED A STRONG GAME AND WHIPPED ST. LOUIS 9 TO 1. BOTH SIDES BATTED WELL, BUT THE NEW-YORKS PLAYED A WONDERFULLY GOOD GAME IN THE FIELD -- IN BROOKLYN WARD'S MEN WON A GAME FROM THE CINCINNATI CLUB.
Both, the New-York and Brooklyn Clubs won their games yesterday, and to-day four of the twelve League clubs are on even terms for first honors. The others are well bunched, and the chances are that the struggle for first honors in the second halt of the championship struggle will be hotly contested. The Bostons, who lost yesterday, are rapidly going to the rear, and unless they brace up they will be soon distanced. 
--------
1174-> PUGILIST MITCHELL IN PRISON.; THE COSTS OF HIS APPEAL ADDED TO HIS ORIGINAL SENTENCE.
LONDON, Dec. 6. -- This was the day fixed for the hearing of the case of Charlie Mitchell, the pugilist, by Judge Sir Peter Edlin, in the Clerkenwell Sessions.

--------
1175-> MARYLAND FARMERS ANGRY.; THEY MAKE MATTERS VERY UHPLEASANT FOR GOV. BROWN.
BALTIMORE, Dec. 21 -- The farmers made it decidedly lively for Gov. Brown last week. Their association was in session here, and the veto of the Reassessment bill was the burden of the speeches and resolutions. 
--------
1176-> PLAYS AND PLAYERS IN BOSTON.
BOSTON, July 23. -- Another theatre closed this week -- the Palace -- but it will reopen on Aug. 1 with attractions yet to be announced. 
--------
1177-> FIGHTING FOR THE SENATE; SHE REPUBLICANS WILL HOLD IT BY FRAUD IF POSSIBLE. MEETING OF THE "STEERING" COMMITTEE AND ITS BOLD DECLARATION -- SENATOR CHANDLER'S LITTLE GAME OF BLUFF OPENED -- A STRONG FIGHT AHEAD FOR CONTROL.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 21 -- Those who were disposed to accept as truthful the statements of Republicans at the beginning of this session of Congress, that no attempt would be made by the Republican Senators to prevent the Democrats organizing the next Senate, are beginning to see how wide of the truth such statements were. 
--------
1178-> A STUBBORN FIRE.; A FOURTH ALARM SOUNDED, BUT NO HEAVY LOSSES.
A fire that was hard to fight occurred yesterday in the five-story brick building 11 and 13 East Fourth Street, just near the corner of Lafayette Place. 
--------
1179-> A REAR-END COLLISION; FIFTEEN PERSONS HURT ON THE ELEVATED RAILROAD. GREAT CRASH NEAR WEST ONE HUN- DRED AND TWENTY-FIFTH STREET STATION -- A BLOCKED TRAIN RUN INTO BY ANOTHER TRAIN -- ONE OF THE INJURED MAY DIE.
There was a collision at 7:20 o'clock last night between two trains on the elevated railroad near the One Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street and Eighth Avenue station. Fifteen persons were injured, two of them seriously, and the rear of one passenger coach was badly crushed. 
--------
1180-> SHEATHING FOR OUR CRUISERS.
The most interesting feature in the new group of small unarmored vessels which the designers of the Navy Department have under consideration is the sheathing with which it is proposed to furnish them. It will be recalled that Secretary TRACY, in his last report, asked for four lightdraught cruisers of about 1,200 tons displacement, for river service on the Asiatic and South Atlantic stations, where vessels of heavy draught cannot go. 
--------
1181-> THE LIBERAL STRUGGLE

--------
1182-> CONNECTICUT ALL RIGHT.; DEMOCRATS CONFIDENT ON BOTH STATE AND NATIONAL ISSUES.
The Democratic managers are fully aware of the big effort that Mr. Carter and his associates propose making to carry Connecticut. Its capture of that State is one of the things that Mr. Carter has cut out to do -- If he can. The managers at the Democratic National Headquarters are in frequent conferences these days with those who are managing the Democratic campaign in that State. 
--------
1183-> THE SIEGE OF THE CARNEGIE MILLS.
The situation at Homestead ia unexampled in the history of labor troubles, and has given rise to some extraordinary claims with reference to the rights of workingmen even in so grave a body as the United States Senate. Nothing could be more pernicious or more subversive of essential principles of private right than some of the doctrines announced by men claiming to be statesmen. 
--------
1184-> SEVEN DEAD IN A WRECK; SHAMOKIN EXPRESS CRASHES INTO EMPTY COAL TRAIN. OVER A SCORE OF PERSONS INJURED ON THE READING RAILROAD NEAR PHILADELPHIA -- THE TRAINS COME TOGETHER ON A CURVE -- CONFLICT OF OPINIONS AS TO ORDERS.

Seven persons were killed outright. 
--------
1185-> AMUSEMENTS.
"DIPLOMACY." People who were of the playgoing public fourteen years ago went to see "Diplomacy" at the Star Theatre last evening with some sort of misgiving. They liked the capital English version of Sardou's "Dora" so well in 1878, their memory of it was so precious -- for we have had few better plays than "Diplomacy" in a whole century -- that they were naturally afraid of disappointment. 
--------
1186-> MADSTONE IN A GOOD RACE; HE DEFEATED TOURNAMENT IN THE TOBOGGAN HANDICAP. GARRISON MADE A GRAND FINISH AND SO DEFEATED THE SUBURBAN FA- VORITE -- KENNEBEC WON THE BAY- CHESTER STAKES VERY CLEVERLY.

--------

--------

WASHINGTON, Dec. 22. -- The Rev. H.H. George, General Field Agent of the American Sabbath Union, Col. Shepard President, called upon Secretary Foster at the Treasury this afternoon in some alarm to treat the news to Mr. Foster that an injunction had been applied for in Chicago to prevent the closing of Jackson Park, in which the World's Fair is to be held, on Sunday.

Lampe had prepared.

1342-> CLUB NEWS AND GOSSIP.
Perhaps the most notable phase of the extraordinary development of the club ideas on this side of the water within the last decade is the craze for so-called "dining" clubs, which, in reality, are "luncheon" clubs. Ten years ago there was hardly a club of the kind of any consequence in New-York City; to-day there are at least a dozen of them south of Canal Street with an aggregate membership of nearly 5,000. 
--------
1343-> A COUNTERFEITER GOES FREE.; THE COUNTRY FLOODED WITH $2,000,000,000 OF COUNTERFEIT MONEY IN THE PAST YEAR, AND PRONOUNCED BY GOVERNMENT EX- PERTS TO BE AS GOOD AS THE GENUINE GREENBACK.
The failure of the United States Court to convict Joseph Reed, alias Banks, alias Moore, and many other aliases, one of the most skillful and expert counterfeiters in this or any other country, is a great disappointment to the Chief of the Secret Service.

--------
1346-> Editorial Article 3 -- No Title
The salient point in the management of Indian affairs for the last year, as presented by Commissioner MORGAN'S annual report, is perhaps the continued reduction of reservations by purchase and opening to settlement.

The subject of the greater part of Senator SHERMAN'S speech last Monday night was the tariff.

Looking over the Tribunes verbatim report of it, we find some curious assertions. 
--------
1352-> THE BRITISH OFFICER.
There is nothing at all surprising in the news that a company of the Army Service Corps at Portsmouth has shown its displeasure with its officers in various irregular ways, and especially in cutting to pieces the harnesses issued to it and intended for its horses. The Army Service Corps consists of non-combatants of the Supply and Transport Department, and is not at all like the Horse Guards, an aristocratic organization. 
--------

1356-> WHY HE PAYS DUTY ON THE "PANTS."
Some rather fine distinctions are drawn in the matter of customs decisions by the Treasury Department. A citizen of Detroit went over to Canada and bought a pair of trousers, which he wore home.

--------

BOSTON, Mass., Aug. 12. -- The firm of Gilman, Cheney  Co., flour and grain commission merchants, Chamber of Commerce Building, assigned to-day to C.P. Searle.

--------
1368-> THE FINANCIAL WORLD.
In a narrow and therefore professional market like the present, speculation is necessarily concentrated, a few stocks being active and the general list remaining dull. In the past week, the active speculation died out in the coal stocks and Northern Pacific, and sprang up in New-England, Chicago Gas, and, with less force, in two or three other stocks. 
--------
1369-> A JACKET COOLED TOO QUICK; THIS CAUSED THE ACCIDENT AT THE WASHINGTON ORDNANCE SHOP.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 9 -- The accident to the thirteen-inch gun at the Washington ordnance shop, as reported in THE TIMES'S Washington dispatches last night, is one of the few serious accidents which have occurred, at this establishment since it has been in operation.

1376-> Article 17 -- No Title
THE SPIDER AND THE WASP. -- I have no great sympathy with wasps -- they've done me so many bad turns in my time that I don't pretend to regard them as deserving of exceptional pity -- but I must say Eliza's way of going at them was unduly barbaric.

The Church of St. Mary Woolnoth, which stands out conspicuously at the King William Street corner of Lombard Street, was closed ten months ago, and it is clear from the stataments of the rector that the step was not premature.

BUFFALO, Sept. 1O -- An emergency such as that which arose at Buffalo a month ago was all that was necessary to bring to light the defects in the organization of the New-York National Guard.
