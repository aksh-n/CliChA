398-> Romantic Spying.
There's nought to reason why about the screen version of "Three Faces East," which was adapted from the play of that name by Anthony Paul Kelly. Here we have a box office pictorial conception of secret service work, for motion-picture producers would scorn to think that secret service agents during the war ever conducted themselves like ordinary mor or used a card index instead of writing on walls and banisters. There are some incidents in this production that are too much even for the credulous gallery gods, especially the idea of having a dubious young woman strumming the piano to the Morse code, who, when she is asked what she had been playing, coolly tells the asinine young flying officer that the name of the composition is "The Betrayal."The most worthy of the secret service plays was "The White Feather." Mr. Kelly's play reminds one too much of the San Domingo gentleman who was caught one day in a tailor's shop ordering a uniform with a red, green and yellow collar; a cocked hat with green, red and blue feathers; red and yellow stripes down the trousers and light blue spats. He was asked by the tailor what such a uniform might be for. He answered with no little pride: "For the San Domingo Secret Service." Although they wear no such uniform in this film, they might just as well do so, for they all forget that there is much more suspicion attached to stealth and whispering than there is to walking like a ton of bricks and shouting inaccurate information. In this plush-covered yarn of espionage and contra-espionage the agents have their numbers on clinical thermometers, on rings and in bracelets. It is supposed to be a melodrama, but to any one who has worked in the Secret Service of any country it is a farce.It seems as easy as pap for the pussy-footing agents to gain employment or to be guests of the British Minister of War, and apparently all is air in the Secret Service. You may be wounded and on very weak legs, but when one of your own ilk comes along, he or she may make matters all the worse for you, just to hammer in a little suspense.Granted that the former Kaiser loved pomp and ceremony, it is hardly likely that he would have made a lot of fuss about one Secret Service agent, and he was far too military in bearing to strut about as Rupert Julian portrays him in this picture.There is an air raid which gives Germany credit for having almost as many airships as she had Generals. It is quite an impressive sight until one stops to think, and then one avers that it fits in very well with the rest of the tale.Jetta Goudal is seen as the Secret Service agent. She is attractive, but artificial in most of the episodes. Henry B. Walthall figures as the British Secretary for War. He is capable in some stretches, but quite the motion-picture actor in others. Clive Brook, an English actor, is cast in a Teutonic rôle, and Robert Ames, who is by no means slender, poses as a Secret Service agent in a flying officer's uniform. THREE FACES EAST, with Jetta Goudal, Robert Ames, Henry B. Walthall, Edythe Chapman, Clarence Burton, Edward Brady and others, adapted from the play by Anthony Paul Kelly, directed by Rupert Julian; overture, "Musical Comedy Favorites"; "Reelviews," a scenic novelty; "A Whole Orchestra," with Ruth Brewer; "The Western Quartette" in "Bits of Harmony"; "Vocal Athletics," with H. C. Gels at the orchestra. At the Railto.

IN a stuffy little room of a damp French fortress there sat day after day a young man.

Hour after hour he sat before a plain table writing, writing, writing, methodically and unhurried.

501-> THE SCREEN; Fun and Thrills.
The fine weather did not interfere with the business yesterday at the Rialto, where Harold Lloyd's blunderbuss of fun, "For Heaven's Sake," is holding the fort. The theatre was packed to the doors, hundreds of spectators having to content themselves temporarily with standing room, and outside there was a line of expectant faces extending as far as Forty-third Street."For Heaven's Sake" guns for loud laughter. It is a strenuous affair, a comedy of gags that follow upon each other with amazing rapidity. The story itself is of little consequence, but the hilarious action, which brought forth volley after volley of laughter, might even make a Sioux chieftain forget his reputation for stoicism. It mattered not whether Mr. Lloyd ate a powder puff or a sponge in mistake for a cake or, in error, tossed kerosene on a blaze, the full-throated mirth arose in every corner of the theatre. The throngs were convulsed by the quiet way in which Mr. Lloyd approached these tasks, and they also manifested appreciation by his subsequent expression of mild surprise.Here Mr. Lloyd impersonates J. Harold Manners, who is probably as wealthy as Mr. Lloyd himself, but he is far more reckless with his money. One little boy who couldn't read and was therefore having to rely upon his father for information from the captions, asked why Mr. Lloyd had to make out a check every time he wanted money. It was evidently the youngster's idea that Mr. Lloyd had missed a bet by not carrying a few million dollars with him wherever he went.Mr. Manners becomes the unintentional benefactor of a mission, which is run by the heroine and her father. This particular place appears to be frequented chiefly by burglars and pickpockets. A policeman who is hot after a culprit leaps into the mission and Mr. Manners calmly offers him a hymn book. The bluecoat finds the singing contagious, and he fails to observe that one of the most vociferous vocalists is beating time with a blackjack, while another can't resist the temptation to steal the policeman's watch.There is an endless chase in which the interest is whetted by the cleverly contrived gags. The latter chapters keep up the same feverish pace, when Manners is endeavoring to collect, and return to the mission with a group of hefty thugs, who do everything from mounting a horse attached to a milk wagon to running a bus, which part of the time speeds through the thoroughfares without anybody at the steering wheel. There are also struggles on top of the bus that caused the audience to gasp, especially when one of the crooks walks along the rail as the vehicle plunges along, balancing himself with an old umbrella.Mr. Lloyd shows himself a master of comedy in this subject and although it is boisterous he continually displays his skill as an actor. Jobyna Ralston officiates as the heroine, and Noah Young, as the Roughneck, does some good work. Fun and Thrills. FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE, with Harold Lloyd, Jobyna Ralston, Noah Young, James Mason, Paul Wiegel and others, directed by Sam Taylor; overture, "Tunes of the Day"; H. C. Geis, organist; "Songs of the Surf," an Education scenic; special prologue. At the Rialto.Prior to the presentation of "The Flaming Frontier" at the Colony Theatre at midnight on Saturday, Brig. Gen. Edward S. Godfrey, U. S. A., retired, who fought off the Indians after the Custer massacre, was introduced. General Godfrey, who is 85 years old, arose and bowed to the throng of spectators. In the course of his introduction it was explained that General Godfrey after the massacre held the redskins at bay for two days until General Terry arrived with relief troops. It was General Godfrey who found General Custer's body, and it was the same venerable fighter—there in a theatre box at midnight—who while on the Faculty at West Point wrote the official history of the massacre. The same old warrior commanded Troop K. Seventh Cavalry, under Custer at the Battle of Little Big Horn, June 24, 1876. After listening to this information scores in the audience stood up and many would liked to have shaken the veteran's hand. It was a stirring moment."The Flaming Frontier," however, is not as inspiring as was the presence of General Godfrey. Like many pictures of its type, it has its good side, its effective exterior scenes and here and there some excellent contrasts in the string of situations. Hoot Gibson plays the part of the invincible and self-sacrificing young hero. He is an excellent rider, a regular centaur on a horse. But the producers have clothed him during one or two chapters in a West Point uniform, for which he appears a wee bit old and not sufficiently trained down. Then for some strange reason he wears a wig toward the end of the production which causes one to reflect that he has almost changed from a fair-haired young man to the blue-black hair of an Indian.The story of "The Flaming Frontier" centres around the Custer massacre, but it is obvious that Edward Sedgwick, who wrote the yarn and directed the filming of it, had to make his situation fit in spite of robbing some of the characters of intelligence. Apparently there was no such thing as sending out scouts, and it seems highly improbable that an old inebriate, good-natured though he is, should be intimate enough with General Custer to be able to slap him on the back.There are some hand-painted flame scenes in this production which are extremely poor. It would have been infinitely better to have tinted the whole print rather than portray a red flame which sheds no glow on a single face.The West Point angle of the story is very similar to that of "Classmates." Here the hero goes to fight the Indians and ride the pony express, while in "Classmates" he went to South America. The hero of this current production, Bob Langdon, makes his big sacrifice for Senator Stanwood's son, who also is a cadet at West Point.Sam Belden is the oily villain, the sort of chap who wouldn't stop at anything to gratify a whim. He has the gall to become intensely interested in a game of solitaire while other men are fighting Indians. Belden has the conventional scoundrel's leer, carefully twisted mustache and superb nonchalance.Walter Rodgers gives a sterling portrait of General Grant, and Kathleen Key strives to make the rôle of the heroine interesting, but she undertakes too much when she makes a dash on horseback with an odd-looking hat. Dustin Farnum is quite good as General Custer, but he might have insisted on a little more military discipline.Dr. Hugo Riesenfeld has compiled an admirable music score to accompany the unfolding of this production. The Custer Massacre.THE FLAMING FRONTIER, with Hoot Gibson, Anne Cornwall, Dustin Farnum, Ward Crane, Kathleen Key, Eddie Gribbon, Harry Todd, Harold Goodwin, George Fawcett, Noble Johnson, Charles K. French, William Steele, Walter Rodgers, Ed Wilson and Joe Bonomo, written and directed by Edward Sedgwick; special music score by Dr. Hugo Riesenfeld. At the Colony.The Film Associates, Inc., whose last offering was "The New Enchantment," presented yesterday at the Klaw Theatre for two performances only, the German picturization of the fairy tale, "Cinderella," produced by Ufa and directed by Dr. Ludwig Berger. This enchanting photoplay was prefaced by an abstract subject entitled, "Of What Are the Young films Dreaming?" It was made by Comte Etienne de Beaumont, and is a queer medley of reflections, facial expressions, impressions of movement and speed, strange manifold exposure effects and glimpses of a forest with silver trees and a black sky, such as one finds on a negative. Like Dudley Murphy's "Ballet Mecanique," it is mindful of the work of futuristic painters. It might be a nightmare or a day's piled-up thoughts. Mr. Murphy's odd film dealt with rhythm, while Comte de Beaumont's piece of work endeavors to evoke varying emotions through the photography of different forms, such as crystal, smoke, trees, machinery, or by the rhythm of regular action of men and machines, or by a mere sensation such as that of speed.Going from a silver forest and a train that flew off into the skies to the quiet charm of "Cinderella," was pleasing, and although some sterling portions of this picture could not be shown because they had unfortunately been destroyed, that which was exhibited was most engrossing. The stage settings are so convincing that they struck one as being real. There was an old court yard, a mysterious little cemetery, the ball room of a royal palace and a quaint old kitchen.This production is extraordinarily well cast. In lieu of having a sinister-looking person to play the part of the step-mother, the director has elected to put a handsome woman in this rôle. It is her actions that alone count in her disfavor. In one scene her hair is dressed so as to give a mere suspicion of Satan, but her countenance, except for an occasional vexed expression, remains good-looking. Her two daughters are not homely, but quite attractive. Helga Thomas fills the part of Cinderella. She is beautiful, a type that never seems quite real, and in some scenes she reminds one of a graceful figure on a piece of Sevres china.The portion of the picture that was haplessly destroyed chances to deal with the transforming of the mice into footmen and rats into horses, for the entrancing glass carriage. However, the sequence in which a golden rain brings a wondrous metallic gown to Cinderella, is splendid and so are the scenes in which castles fade into nothing.Here they have an ordinary shoe instead of the glass slipper, and the godmother is able to bring all her witchcraft out with explosions and the subsequent imprisoning of her victims in giant jam jars. The story runs along with easy grace, and one can readily imagine that children would be fascinated with this subject, which incidentally provides its full quota of entertainment for adults. The audience was so pleased with it yesterday that it is probable that the Film Associates may show it again next Sunday at the same theatre.Other Photoplays.Norma Talmadge in "Kiki" is the offering at the Capitol."The Blind Goddess," with Jack Holt and Esther Ralston, is at the Rivoli.John Barrymore in "The Sea Beast" is the attraction at the Mark Strand."The Night Cry," with the police dog Rin-Tin-Tin is at Warners'."The Grand Duchess and the Waiter" is the offering of the International Film Arts Guild at the Cameo."The Big Parade," with Renee Adoree, is at the Astor; "Stella Dallas," with Lois Moran, is at the Apollo; "Ben Hur" is at the George M.

Miss Enters proved herself an artist of originality and distinction.Her dances had the essence of the dramatic. She became for the time being the character she represented. In "Le Moyen Age" she was the personification of irresponsible cruelty, a Pavanne and Sarabande partook of the cynicism of the period.In direct and violent contrast, Miss Enters portrayed a simple country girl and a timid débutante to the life.She danced to airs by Frescobaldi, Beethoven and Debussy played by Mr. Bibb. The tone of the entertainment was kept to its high level by the solos of Mrs. Bibb on the harpsichord, of Mr. Barrere on his flute and of Oscar Seagle's singing of several French airs.Harvard Instrumental Club Concert.The Harvard Instrumental Club will give its first New York concert on Saturday at Aeolian Hall.

502-> The Gallant Old Constitution.
So much happened last night at the Rivoli Theatre, the scene of the launching of James Craze's great picture, "Old Ironsides," that it seemed like a very full evening. In the first place, the picture was filled with adventaure, humor and romance. Then Secretary of the Navy Curtis D. Wilbur made a brief talk during the intermission and unveiled a painting of the Constitution, reproductions of which, are to be sold all over the country, the proceeds to go toward the fund for restoring the gallant old war vessel. And, as an additional feature of the entertainment, the scene that ended the first half of the picture was a startling surprise, for the standard screen disappeared and the whole stage, from the proscenium arch to the boards, was filled with a moving picture of a replica of Old Ironsides. This brought every man and woman in the audience to their feet and Dr. Hugo Riesenfeld's orchestra and a chorus of voices further stirred the spectators with "Ship of State."Some conception of the magnificent effect of this enlarged screen can be galned from its dimensions, which are 30 by 40 feet, whereas the usual screen in the Rivoli is about 12 by 18. Following the intermission most of the scenes of "Old Ironsides," were depicted by this apparatus, a device discovered by Glen Allvine of the Famous Players-Lasky Corporation. Mr. Allvine said that he called the idea or invention a magnascope. It is a magnifying lens attached to the ordinary projection machine.This wide angle screen was tremendously effective in the scenes of fighting aboard the old frigate off the coast of Tripoli, and also in those pictures of the imposing productions of the forts, with old-fashioned guns booming and the missiles splashing in the sea.In this picture Mr. Cruze, for the first time, gives a true conception of a frigate at sea. It was no millpond when these "shots" were photographed, the ocean being covered with white caps.The story has its full share of hokum, but it is the sort of stuff that one enjoys. Esther Ralston, as the Girl, wears semi-décolletée gowns throughout this photoplay, and her blond tresses are always waved to the pink of perfection. As an aid to the romance of this picture, Laurence Stallings, who is responsible for the story, has introduced a bark called the Esther, aboard which most of the principals are beheld during a tidy part of the adventure.The narrative contains a plentiful supply of excellent comedy, which is handled in vigorous fashion by those able screen actors, Wallace Berry and George Bancroft. Hence the audience one moment was stirred to outbursts of patriotic feeling, while the next episode caused them to roar with laughter. There were impressive scenes in Independence Hall, in Philadelphia, in which the famous speech concerned with "not one cent for tribute, but millions for defense," was made. This was soon followed by Mr. Berry as a bos'n, with tattered trousers, a wig and earring's, on the lookout to shanghai victims. He first encounters the Boy, who is eager for adventure, and while he is putting this youth into "condition" to take aboard the Bather the greedy ex-gunner of the Constitution moves across the saloon to the bos'n's table and invites himself to have a drink. The bos'n is a calculating sort of scamp, and in the end he fills the Gunner up with greg and shanghaies him as well as the young man. This comes as a surprise to the audience, as the Gunner is a formidable fellow with a pigtail curled over the nape of his neck.The high light of the story is, of course, concerned with the defeat of the Barbary Coast pirates, but in order to have a love theme the Boy and the Girl meet on the Esther. He has been warned while at the helm to keep his gaze on the stars, which he finds a very difficult matter when the girl insists on fixing him with her deep blue eyes. There are kissing scenes at most inopportune moments, even when the Boy is shackled to three other men. And after this love scene, the quartet, who have escaped from the pirates, flop over into the water and, in a second or so, they get into a boat and are bound for the open sea.Mr. Cruze evidently delighted in eliciting humor from Mr. Beery and Mr. Bancroft, and he even has the two fighting each other, forgetting their manacles. When the Bos'n and the Gunner are rescued by the Constitution, it is the Gunner who has the upper hand. Stephen Decatur, then a Lieutenant (played by Johnny Walker) sentences the Gunner to 200 lashes, and when the time comes for the ordeal, he, Decatur, counts "one hundred" after the first stroke of the whip, and "two hundred" after the second; so the Gunner gets off pretty lightly for his crime of desertion. To add a touch of the olden sea days, salt is smeared on the Gunner's welted back, after which every one seems fairly cheerful.Mr. Cruze exhibits his skill by "shots" from all angles, and some of the most striking ones are those pictured from the masts of the Constitution. He has also introduced some sterling miniature photographs, which, in this case, fit in nicely with the other scenes.Commodore Preble of the Constitution is seen in his cabin shaving. Decatur suggests going over in a small boat and blowing up the Philadelphia, which had been captured by the pirates. The Commodore scoffs at the idea, but young Decatur goes forth in his small craft and carries out that daring scheme, which called forth the highest praise from Lord Nelson. You see the Philadelphia, and the pirates aboard being hoodwinked by Decatur, whose disguised men pretend that they have lost their anchor. The second the small craft gets alongside the Philadelphia, scores of men are uncovered and they clamber up the sides of the frigate, setting fire to the powder magazines. There is a thrilling flash when the vessel is beheld gradually disappearing below the water.Honors are fairly evenly divided among the performers, although Beery and Bancroft, if anything, get the best of the show. Miss Ralston is attractive as the heroine. Charles Farrell is exceptionally competent as the Boy. George Godfrey vies with Beery and Bancroft as a comedian. He, it is, who as a ship's cook does not believe in women aboard a ship. He has a habit of spitting through crossed fingers to kill any bad luck, and loud laughter greeted this trick each time he was seen doing it. Charles Hills Mailes gives a clever characer sketch of Commodore Preble.Besides Admiral Plunkett and a number of other naval officers, 300 marines and bluejackets formed part of the audience. OLD IRONSIDES, with Charles Farrell, Esther Ralston, Wallace Beery, George Bancroft, Charles Hill Mailes, Johnny Walker, Eddie Fetherston and George Godfrey; written by Laurence Stallings, directed by James Cruze; special music score arranged by Dr. Hugo Riesenfeld.

The House of Representatives has not rushed through its approval of the war debt settlement with France. Ample time for discussion was given. The debate did not perhaps change votes, but it gave occasion for the expression of changed views about the whole question of the war debts. 
--------
1261-> ARMAMENTS AND "RESOURCES."
Doubtless, as was once said of resumption, the way to disarm is to disarm. Yet when Sweden insists on including under armaments "the moral and physical prowess of peoples"; when France adds chemical factories and industrial equipment generally; when Holland insists upon the military value of dikes and fog-horns, pigs and chickens, the result is something more than "opera bouffe," as the British at Geneva called it.

--------
1267-> HE HARD-BOILED VIRGIN. By Frances Newman. 285 pp. New York: Boni & Liveright. $2.50.
IT was inevitable that the search for fresh improvisations on an old theme should, sooner or later, produce a novel of the calibre of "The Hard-Boiled Virgin." It is only a few years ago since the gates were let down before what bad hitherto been deemed the permissible, and the writer who took advantage of the new license have been demeaning themselves rather exuberantly than artistically.

--------
1274-> PARK DEFENSE AND TRIBUTE.
In announcing the incorporation of the Central Park Association it is natural that Mr. W.B. ROULSTONE emphasizes the need of protection from invasion.

1276-> WAR OF CHEMISE GOES MERRILY ON; Treasury Department Insists on Inspecting French Costs, and French Press Calls This "Economic Espionage"
AUSTRIA and Serbia once went to war over a pig. The same animal nearly caused a war between Great Britain and the United States and between France and the once independent Republic of Texas. In the present day we see a surprising to-do over a mere shirt -- a French chemise, in short. This little garment has occasioned a severe strain on Franco-American relations. 
--------
1277-> Crime Reduction a Job for Scientists
I read with interest your editorial of May 27, "Obiter Dicta on Crime." What you had said is no doubt true concerning the reckless generalization about criminals, though I should well imagine that such a statement by Warden Lawes, that only two out of every one hundred criminals are caught, is highly probable.

I fancy many of your readers would be glad to possess an autograph of our deeply regretted Cardinal Mercier, and so great in every way that the world may not see his like for many a century to come.

In today's TIMES Bishop Dunn replies to my letter of yesterday in regard to the Marlborough-Vanderbilt annulment.

--------
1285-> Over There
SENATOR MARCONI, made a member of the Italian Senate as a reward for his discoveries, does not take his Senatorial job very seriously. He spends most of his time in London, and when he does pay a flying visit to Italy he is likely to keep away from the Senate sessions. Consequently he is none too popular among those Senators who think that being a Senator implies a certain responsibility. 
--------
1286-> SOVIET PENSIONS NINE REGICIDES; Of Those Who Took Part in the Assassination Of Czar Alexander Only a Few Minor Accomplices Survive
THE Soviet Government commemorated on March 14 a "revolutionary anniversary" -- the anniversary of a momentous event. For no one knows what course the Russian history would have taken if Czar Alexander II had not been assassinated in St. Petersburg forty-five years ago, on March 14, 1881.

1347-> David W. Griffith's New Picture.
A silk-hatted Satan glides across the screen in David W. Griffith's pictorial transcription of Marie Corelli's novel, "The Sorrows of Satan," which was presented last night with due pomp at the George M. Cohan Theatre before a notable gathering. In swinging from squalor to pomp, depicting wretchedness on one side and passionate orgies on the other, Mr. Griffith reveals himself a master, and in this present offering he has made a photodrama that excels anything he has done in recent years. The theme of the story remains unchanged, but incidents are coupled together for the sake of dramatic effect.It is a marvelously beautiful film, in which Mr. Griffith has obtained some gorgeous lighting effects. Sometimes there are only the silhouettes of characters, and the first glimpse one has of Prince Rimenez, the Satan of the story, is his weird, long shadow in the humble hallway of the dwelling in which Geoffrey Tempest and Mavis Clare rent rooms. The Prince appears during a thunder storm immediately after Tempest has delivered his rage against the Almighty. Prior to that one learns of the love affair between Tempest and Mavis, and of the young man's disgust at the rejection of the manuscription which he prided himself.Mr. Griffith makes it plain that when the devil takes hold he brooks no interference, and therefore, with the lure of gold and the beauty it can buy, Tempest finds himself a puppet in the Prince's hands. The producer draws his contrasts splendidly, revelry being depicted with its wantons and sordid tastes, and then the gentle love of Mavis for Tempest. Mavis is seen suffering, brooding, hoping, while Tempest enjoys his fabulous wealth.One of the effective touches in this picture is where Mavis puts her frugal meal on the table. There is a piece of steak and a couple of jam tarts on bits of cardboard. At that moment Tempest is seated at a table in a hotel, like the Savoy, in London, enjoying the richest of foods and permitting his gaze to wander to Princess Olga's dark, fiery, round eyes. Again one returns to Mavis. She has covered her repast with a newspaper, and the dawn is shown gradually filtering in through the cheap lace curtains. A brief note from Tempest dictated by the Prince had informed her of the decision of the man she was to wed.There are vistas in the scenes of reckless luxury that challenge the most discriminating eye. Bright lights glisten during some periods and then soft shadows drift across the beflowered halls. Women, dressed none too extensively, are beheld in a variety of poses. When Griffith comes to the wedding of Tempest and the Princess Olga he portrays it as a regal ceremony, with a Bishop in lawn sleeves officiating. The maids of honor walk with measured paces, and, as might be expected, outside in the hot sun, standing in the throng, is Mavis, too nervous to weep.In a palace of shining floors, Tempest and his bride live after their honeymoon, each wondering why they had married. In the poor, winding street, in a back room, one is made aware that Mavis still is using her typewriter."The first half of this production is far more absorbing than the latter chapters. It is possibly not all due to Mr. Griffith's work, but largely to the melodramatic flavor and the drop in the story, with Tempest returning to Mavis. Tempest's terror of Satan is not a little overdone, for a shadow with Satan's bat-like wings slowly follow the frightened man. Perhaps it would have been just as effective to have clnng to the shadow of the Prince's top hat and fur coat. The initial episodes are more real than the fantastic summing up. However, the Prince is seen finally in the doorway of Mavis's room. Tempest, having succeeded in fleeing from this pursuing Mephisto.Adolphe Menjou is remarkably fine as the Prince who enjoys the ruin of his victims. He is distinctive, almost gentle in setting forth his temptations. Carol Dempster's acting is something exceptional. She imbues the part with pathos and eagerness. She presents the portrait of undying hope, and not even in "Isn't Life Wonderful?" did she give an idea of the talent she displays in this new film. Lya de Putti depicts the siren with a sinuous ease, denoting by her half-closed eyes the nature of the Princess. She is not pretty, but she is striking and somewhat exotic. Another remarkable characterization is that of Ricardo Cortez in the rôle of Tempest. He seems, however, far more in earnest in the first part of the production than in the scenes where Tempest is terror-stricken. Ivan Lebedeff does well in the minor part of the Prince'a secretary. THE SORROWS OF SATAN, with Adolpe Menjou, Carol Dempster, Ricardo Cortez, Lya de Putti, Ivan Lebedett, Marcia Harris, Lawrence D'Orsay, Nellie Savage, Dorothy Hughes and others, adapted from Marie Corelli's novel and play of the same name, directed by David W. Griffith; musical settings and orchestral arrangement by Dr. Hugo Riesenfeld. At the George M. Cohan Theatre.

1485-> Beauty as a Lawyer.
Light though it is, the film transcription of Frederic and Fanny Hatton's play, "The Waning Sex," is sufficiently well stocked with feminine beauty and diverting incidents to be a pleasant entertainment. There isn't much waning about either the hero or the heroine, except that the latter, Nina Duane, is well able to take care of herself as a lawyer and as a swimmer. It is true that she carries her watch, during business hours in her waistcoat pocket, but when the sun has set she is partial to lovely gowns and is not averse to the powderpuff or the lipstick. Even in the court room it is quite obvious that her eyelids have been touched up, which is by no means a handicap in her legal battles.The man in the case—Philip Barry—is a district attorney who finds Nina so distinctly feminine that he falls in love with her. Despite his penchant for sitting on straw hats, he is otherwise an economical young man to whom love is more important than the law. He wins from Nina in a swimming race, but she triumphs before the jury.The only instance of a character mindful of the title, is Hamilton Day, whose actions are the antithesis of the athlete. He is meticuluous regarding the yardage of silk handkerchief that must hang from his pocket, and, judging by the titles, he shrieks rather than shouts. This part is cleverly portrayed by George K. Arthur, an emphatically manly young actor.This breezy piece of work was directed by Robert Z. Leonard, who can be relied upon invariably for amusement and impressive settings. Here, he rather overdoes the idea of smashing hats and now and again fails to credit his characters with ordinary powers of observance. He forces comedy from telephone conversations and is most careful about the audience seeing what the poor heroine is not supposed to notice.Norma Shearer, looking if anything more attractive than ever, does extremely well with the rôle of Nina. She is evidently a clever swimmer even though she has not had time to tackle the English Channel, and her bathing costume, worn under a frock, is bound to find favor in both masculine and feminine eyes. It is set off with a turban which does not detract from her good looks even if it covers her fair hair. The rôle of Philip is well handled by Conrad Nagel, whose talent is well suited to this style of narrative.A short Ufa film called "A Jungle Round-Up" together with a good surrounding program makes a stay at the Capital quite interesting. THE WANING SEX, with Norma Shearer, Conrad Nagel, George K. Arthur, Mary McAllister, Charles McHugh, Tiny Ward, Martha Mattox and others, adapted from the play of the same name by Frederic and Fanny Hatton, directed by Robert Z. Leonard; overture, "Marche Slav"; Caroline Andrews, soprano; "The Jungle Round-Up," a Ufa short subject; Colin O'More, tenor; "The Arbor of Flowers." At the Capitol.
