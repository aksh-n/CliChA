0-> Soviet Ship Fire Toll Is 11
The death toll in a fire on the Soviet cruise liner Priamurye reached 11 today, with 35 people injured. The 4,870-ton Priamurye, sailing from Vladivostok with 129 crew members and 295 passengers, was in Osaka harbor on a three-week tour of Japan when the fire broke out. Japanese firefighters struggled for 11 hours to put out the fire. The police said they were investigating.

1-> Heat Spurs Air Pollution Alert in Parts of Midwest
Residents of parts of the Midwest were warned yesterday of unhealthy air pollution trapped by a stifling heat wave, and Wisconsin officials said rural school projects would be delayed because the drought would cut taxpayers' income. In a nation made fire-prone by drought and heat, firefighters battling a five-day-old, 16,000-acre blaze near Mount Rushmore National Memorial in South Dakota finally had the weather on their side. Milder temperatures, higher humidity and lower winds benefited the firefighters as they reinforced existing fire lines before digging new ones. In Alaska, 32 fires were burning, four of which had consumed more than 290,000 acres. Fires also burned in Wyoming, Utah and South Carolina. On the drought-choked Mississippi, a shallow point in the lower part of the river was dredged near Natchez, Miss., to let barge traffic move again. Senators Seek Relief Thirteen senators from states along the Mississippi asked President Reagan to authorize an emergency diversion of water from the Great Lakes to help the diminishing river, a plan the Canadian Justice Minister, Ray Hnatyshyn, opposes. Senator Jim Sasser, Democrat of Tennessee, urged the President in a letter to direct the Army Corps of Engineers to increase the flow of Great Lakes water to the Illinois Waterway and the lower Mississippi from 3,000 cubic feet per second to 10,000 cubic feet per second for 100 days. The senators' request came after Government officials met in Memphis with members of a newly formed committee of towboat company executives. They say shipping delays caused by the low water will cost their industry $60 million this summer. There was immediate opposition to the diversion from several Midwest lawmakers, led by Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, who said such a move would be illegal unless approved by all Great Lakes Governors. The White House said President Reagan will travel Thursday to the Midwest to talk to farmers.In addition, the Transportation Secretary, Jim Burnley, announced the creation of a special unit headed by Vice Adm. John Costello of the Coast Guard to deal with transportation problems that develop because of the drought. Meanwhile, temperatures broke records again yesterday. Louisville, Ky., tied its record of 102 degrees; Huntington, W. Va., hit a record 101 and records of 100 were listed at Alpena, Mich., and Harrisburg, Pa. Nashville tied a record of 101 that was first set in 1874. The Nati The hot weather has been blamed for At least 39 deaths since June 1, 22 of them in Missouri. Others were in Kansas, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky and Pennsylvania. Three areas of Illinois, including Cook County, were advised yesterday that heat-related air pollution was at unhealthful levels for the second straight day, said Bob Swinford, supervisor of air quality analysis for the State Environmental Protection Agency. Heavily industrialized southeastern Michigan, including Detroit, also remained under an air stagnation advisory.

3-> Review/Ballet; Stretton McKerrow And Gregory
Major cast changes resulted in fresh nuances of interpretation in two works offered by American Ballet Theater Monday night at the Metropolitan Opera House. Ross Stretton partnered Amanda McKerrow in the second pas de deux in George Balanchine's ''Stravinsky Violin Concerto.'' Because of an injury to Ricardo Bustamante, Ethan Brown appeared with Leslie Browne in the first pas de deux. Despite the slight difference in the spelling of their professional surnames, the dancers are brother and sister. Although both have been featured in previous performances of this ballet, they have usually appeared with other partners. Surrounded by four men in the opening ensemble, Ms. McKerrow looked delicate, even frail. Unfortunately, some of her steps also looked needlessly small in scale. However, her delicacy proved effective in the pas de deux, and her dancing grew increasingly lucid. The tall Mr. Stretton was a tower of strength and, when Ms. McKerrow leaned against him, she appeared - without investing the choreography with unnecessary dramatic touches - to be seeking, and finding, a loving protector. Whereas Mr. Stretton was a princely dancer, Mr. Brown exemplified the dancer as athlete, and Ms. Browne moved confidently through space. However, a sense of strain was occasionally evident in some of the complex entwinings of their pas de deux. Mr. Stretton also made his debut in Mikhail Baryshnikov's staging of the Grand Pas Classique from ''Raymonda,'' partnering Cynthia Gregory. His movements were appropriately grand in scale. Even grander were those of Ms. Gregory. A doubly powerful dancer, she possesses both an astonishing technique and a commanding stage presence. Drawing upon both sources of power, she danced with aristocratic authority. Because she was in control of her own powers, she easily commanded attention and elicited admiration. The program opened with a repeat performance of ''Les Sylphides.'' Emil de Cou and Charles Barker conducted. Lawrence Shapiro was the soloist in ''Stravinsky Violin Concerto.''

4-> Review/Music; Salsa Spice From Miami
Gloria Estefan and Miami Sound Machine, who arrived at Radio City Music Hall on Monday evening for two nights, make perky middle-of-the-road music that reflects the assimilation of the Cuban emigre population into the city from which the group takes its name. Founded in Miami by Cuban-Americans, the ensemble churns out bilingual pop songs that integrate conga rhythms and salsa into the spare Southern Florida disco style that was developed in the mid-70's by K. C. and the Sunshine Band. The group, whose latest album, ''Let It Loose,'' has sold nearly two million copies, recently enjoyed its biggest hit single with ''Anything for You,'' a straightforward pop ballad that shows off the striking vocal resemblance of its lead singer, Ms. Estefan, to the late Karen Carpenter. Miami Sound Machine's music aspires to be nothing more than fluffy party music and disposable car-radio fare. And as concerts of such music go, the group's opening-night show was an exercise in bland competence somewhat undermined by piercing sound. The evening's liveliest moment was an exuberant performance of ''Conga,'' the group's first and most rhythmically animated American hit. Performed by a nine-member ensemble that included three horn players and two percussionists, it transplanted the exuberant ambiance of a Havana nightclub directly to Manhattan.

5-> EXEMPTIONS LIKELY IN DRIVING PERMITS
The Transportation Department says it is taking steps that could exempt farmers and firefighters from new Federal rules that force all truck drivers to obtain commercial licenses. Agricultural interests called the department's plans a victory in their fight against proposed regulations requiring a commercial license for driving a truck weighing more than 26,000 pounds or any vehicle with a hazardous cargo. The regulations are to take effect in July. Farmers complain that the rules could cover some large trucks used to transport grain and hay or pickup trucks carrying a bulk fuel tank and some fertilizers. Waivers to Be Considered The department said Thursday that it would open a special proceeding to consider waivers to exempt some classes of farm vehicles and drivers as well as some firefighting trucks. The regulatory step is necessary before the agency can grant an exemption. ''We apparently have won the fight to exempt farmers,'' said Representative Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas. ''I can't imagine opening up a comment period and then not granting an exemption for farmers and firemen.'' The regulations stem from a 1986 law to improve highway safety by establishing a uniform system of licensing for truck and bus drivers. Senator John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri, chief sponsor of the law, applauded the department's announcement, calling it ''an important step toward insuring that the 1986 act does not necessarily burden farm families that operate trucks in the course of daily business.'' The law gave the Secretary of Transportation the power to exempt categories of vehicles from the licensing provisions, which in general would require an extensive written and road test for a commercial driver. Under the new law, states will continue to issue licenses, but Federal minimum standards for drivers of large, commercial trucks must be met. The department has not issued its final licensing regulations spelling out those standards. Gradual Imposition of Law Rural lawmakers contend that the proposed licensing requirement would burden volunteer fire departments as well as farmers. Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley said in a statement that the Federal Highway Administration would move ''as expeditiously as possible toward resolution of this issue.'' Legislation has been introduced to exclude farm trucks used locally and firefighting vehicles. Even though the new Federal standards will take effect this year, the law is being imposed gradually so states have time to change their licensing systems. Truck drivers generally will have until April 1992 to get a new commercial license that complies with the Federal standards, although states could set earlier deadlines.

6-> BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY; Anti-Corrosion System Gaining
Engineers are applying a principle familiar to high school physics students to create giant ''backward batteries'' to fight corrosion of steel supporting bridges and highways. The anti-corrosion system is rapidly being adopted across the country after several years of Government testing found that applying a small voltage to wire mesh embedded in the structures' concrete could arrest rusting of steel. The system, which is called cathodic protection, is perhaps the first viable treatment for the growing number of crumbling bridges, engineering experts say. The Federal Highway Administration estimates that about half the nation's 500,000 bridges are structurally deficient and cannot carry the loads for which they were designed. By the next decade, the ailing bridges will require about $50 billion in repair work, mainly because of corrosion, agency officials said. The recent problem with the Williamsburg Bridge in New York City is but one example. ''Cathodic protection is the only proven method that stops corrosion in bridge decks,'' said Donald Jackson, who heads the Highway Administration's cathodic protection demonstration project. Since 1974 the agency has financed installation of the systems in more than 100 bridges. Mr. Jackson said that in the majority of the test bridges corrosion had been drastically reduced or eliminated. The system could also mean higher profits for engineering concerns that specialize in the rehabilitation of bridges and other structures that contain steel. ''As more states and local governments learn of the benefits of this protection, we expect demand to skyrocket, and there should be an abundance of work for engineering firms,'' Mr. Jackson said. Engineers said parts of the Williamsburg Bridge might benefit from cathodic protection. ''Those parts of the bridge where the corrosion is in steel embedded in concrete would benefit from cathodic protection,'' said Shiv Kumar, an engineer with the Raychem Corporation in Menlo Park, Calif., an engineering company that installs cathodic systems. ''Steel structural elements exposed to the air but not embedded in concrete would not benefit.'' New York City officials have said that they are considering cathodic protection for the Williamsburg and other city bridges. The primary cause of corrosion in bridges is salt that is spread on bridge decks to melt snow or that comes from the water below. The salt mixes with water and seeps into the bridge's reinforced concrete, which acts like a rigid sponge. Once in the concrete, the salt decomposes. The resulting chloride ions attack the reinforcing steel bars. The effect is similar to one that powers a car battery. In a battery, lead plates bathed in sulfuric acid are corroded away to form a current of electrons. As the steel in a bridge corrodes, rust expands the bars and places stress on the surrounding concrete, causing cracks and potholes. The holes allow more salt and water to reach the steel bars, accelerating the corrosion. In a cathodic protection system, an electric current is used to counteract the corrosive effect of salt. The current has a polarity opposite of that producing the corrosion. It creates a sort of backward battery, neutralizing the corrosion effect. The low-voltage current is introduced through a metal mesh laid over the bridge deck and also wrapped around its structural parts. The mesh is then covered with a layer of concrete. The electric current usually comes from the bridge's lighting system or nearby power lines. For a medium-sized bridge of about 100,000 square feet, only about 500 watts of power are required for the system, the amount of electricity that a small space heater uses. In the largest cathodic protection bridge project to date, engineers recently installed the system on two bridges covering 250,000 square feet on the Jones Falls Expressway in Baltimore. The project cost $800,000. Two leading engineering concerns specialize in cathodic protection materials and systems: Raychem and the Elgard Corporation, in Chardon, Ohio. Michael R. Tighe, Elgard's vice president and general manager, said that because cathodic protection is the first technique that stops corrosion of reinforcing steel, it will be the company's major growth business in the 1990's as state and local governments devote more money to bridge repair. Mr. Tighe said market studies showed that about 200,000 bridges in the United States were candidates for cathodic protection systems. ''Once the salt is in the concrete there is nothing, aside from cathodic protection, that can be done to prevent the steel bars from corroding,'' he said. Raychem's cathodic protection business more than doubled last year and has become the principal operation of its pipe protection division. Raychem, a materials science company, is working on more than 100 cathodic protection projects for bridges and parking garages. The system has been installed in new bridges as well as those contaminated with salt. It has been used to protect other reinforced concrete structures like tunnels, parking garages and elevated expressways as well as pipelines, underground storage tanks and offshore platforms. It has been applied to bridge decks for 14 years, but only in the last five years has the business started to grow. Gee Kim Chou, Raychem's marketing manager for cathodic protection products, attributes the growth to a decline in the cost of installing the systems and an increase in engineers' knowledge of how steel corrodes. Mr. Chou said that in the last three years the price of installation had dropped to $3 to $4 a square foot, from $9 to $10. ''Engineers are much more aware today than they were 5 and 10 years ago of the impact that salt water has on steel and how to control it,'' he said.

7-> Practice Nepotism, But Affirmatively
Loved her, hated him. That used to be only a social dilemma. But now employers are discovering how difficult it is to get one half of a couple when they don't particularly want the other. And so prospective employers in professions involving mobility - corporate business, the military and diplomatic services, higher education - end up spending a significant amount of time with other people's so-called significant other. Suppose you run an academic department that has an opening for a solid-state physicist. For months, your search committee has been screening candidates. It has delicately refrained from inquiring into their private lives; that would have been improper, if not illegal. Now it's down to three eminently qualified candidates, and serious negotiations begin. Over moo shu pork, there is no more talk about lab space. You are now going to hear about the physicists' love lives. Candidate A is married to a specialist in the Romantic poets who refuses to budge without an appropriate job offer. Candidate B lives with a ''Big Bang'' theorist who wants a position in your department - and it had better be tenured. Candidate C is engaged to a pilot. All are devoted to their respective partners' professional happiness. Now that they've heard what you are offering them, what are you going to do for the beloved? You try to place candidate A's spouse in the English department, where you don't know anyone, but the only need is for a deconstructionist Chaucerian. Then you try comparative literature, where you are reminded that you once scorned a nonequilibrium thermodynamicist who was married to a peerless comp lit candidate. Pleas that you will be more receptive next time go unheeded. Candidate B's ''significant other'' isn't all that good, and besides you don't have a second tenured position. Anyway, why should you make a permanent commitment to someone to whom even B won't? If you are lucky, your institution is near another school, and you could give this person a hearty recommendation - until your colleagues there learn that you are using them as a dumping ground. Candidate C's true love is professionally portable, and seems like a godsend. Never mind the snickers from your colleagues about the judgment of someone who would choose a sex object over a person who can debate faculty politics all night. It seems only fair to consider the candidates on their merits alone. Naturally, you oppose nepotism. But you're not in favor of breaking up families, even incipient families (it's getting harder to make the distinction), like an antebellum slave dealer. You can only muse about what a shame it is that love is blind to academic merit and sees things in people that search committees don't, and that there are no mom and pop jobs in academia. But wishful thinking and under-the-counter deals will no longer do in professions where the dual-career couple is the rule, not the exception. The realities of recruitment violate the ideal of individual merit; job qualifications are not supposed to include sleeping with the right person. Giving a job to a ''significant other'' without a general search means handicapping candidates who are less lucky in love. All the same, it is necessary to pursue a policy of affirmative nepotism. Dual-career couples turn out to be another class of disadvantaged people. In a vast country in which mobility is necessary for many kinds of successful careers, they are not free to compete individually for the best jobs in the nationwide market. This means that employers will have to recognize their responsibility for placing spouses and that candidates will have to accept being evaluated as a package. Affirmative nepotism should not be considered an underhanded tactic practiced by streetwise recruiters. Rather, it should be an open policy that, as fairly as possibly, reconciles our traditional beliefs in the sanctity of the merit system and of the family with our modern belief that couples should have equal opportunity to follow careers consonant with their talents and interests.

8-> FUTURES/OPTIONS; Corn and Soybeans Drop; Crude Oil Prices Also Fall
Corn and soybean prices fell yesterday, partly because many market participants have begun to liquidate or hedge their positions as they await a special Agriculture Department report on Tuesday on the estimated crop damage caused by the nation's worst drought since the 1930's. Chicago brokers also said that conflicting weather forecasts prompted many traders, particularly those with large paper gains, to cash in a greater percentage of their profits than they normally do before the weekend. Meanwhile, crude oil prices resumed their decline after the oil platform explosion in the North Sea that caused a heavy loss of life on Thursday. Spot August crude oil futures plunged 38 cents a barrel, to $15.45. Among the precious metals, spot gold was unchanged at $439.10 an ounce; silver gained 6.5 cents, to $7 an ounce, and platinum fell $6.70, to $569.30 an ounce. The Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 basic farm and industrial raw materials plunged 2.22, to 261.04 of its 1967 base of 100. This brought the actual index closer to the spot July bureau futures, which closed at 261.45, off 0.25 on the day. Forecasts of rain and cooler weather depressed the corn and soybean markets. Spot July corn closed down 10.5 cents a bushel, at $3.095. Soybeans, which are less vulnerable than corn to the weather in July, nevertheless finished with losses ranging from 10.5 cents a bushel on the spot delivery to as much as 40 cents on the post-harvest November contract. But wheat prices overcame continued heavy hedge selling stemming from the winding down of the winter wheat harvest. Chicago wheat prices responded to a flow of large export orders and the spot July delivery closed up 8 cents a bushel, at $3.86. Wheat prices in Kansas City, Mo., and Minneapolis posted smaller gains. Prices plunged for most live cattle, all feeder cattle and hogs, as well as for pork bellies (raw bacon) contracts, as the drought continues to force more livestock raisers to cull their herds. This caused the prices of soybean meal, a major livestock feed supplement, to tumble as well, while bean oil closed mixed. Elsewhere in the farm commodity markets, cotton futures were essentially unchanged, but world sugar was again in demand. The spot October world sugar delivery climbed 0.39 cent a pound, to 13.93 cents.

9-> Its Bonus Checks Inviolate, Alaska Nears a Crisis
In 1983, Gov. William J. Sheffield urged the Alaska Legislature to end the year-old program giving Alaskans a personal slice of the state's oil wealth, which meant an annual check of several hundred dollars for each resident. Mr. Sheffield said the plan, the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend Program, could be abolished with minimal political risk that year. ''This may be our last chance,'' he warned, ''because next year is an election year and after that, the dividends will be an institution.'' Mr. Sheffield is no longer Governor, but his warning proved prophetic. Alaska's distribution of wealth to the people survived a legislative vote in 1983 and drew scant challenge in 1984, when 50 of the 60 legislators were up for re-election. Now, four years later, many Alaskans feel they are as entitled to the annual checks as they are to highway maintenance. Pressure From Falling Prices But the continuing decline in the price of oil is putting pressure on the state to find other sources of revenue to pay for an array of government services, from schools to social service programs. The contract price of North Slope crude oil has fallen to about $13.50 a barrel after selling for as much as $36 a barrel in the early 1980's. The state will spend about $2 billion this year on government services. It will spend an additional $423 million to pay Alaska's 530,000 residents a dividend of nearly $800 each. Since payment of the first dividend, $1,000 a person in 1982, the state has spent more than $1.3 billion on the program. But even as the state government struggles to provide basic services, the politician who suggests it be reduced or abolished does so at his own political peril. ''We have created a monster,'' said State Representative Terry Martin of Anchorage, one of the few Alaska politicians who speaks out against the dividend program. ''There are a number of others who wish they could do something, but they feel it's hopeless,'' Mr. Martin said of other legislators, Last year the newly elected Governor, Steve Cowper, a Democrat, proposed that Alaskans either give up their dividends or be willing to bring back the personal income tax that was abolished in 1979. His suggestion aroused public protests. A few months ago, the Governor withdrew the proposal. 'Entitled' to Money Paul Montgomery, an unemployed laborer who was drinking beer at Chilcoot Charlie's, a bar in Anchorage, said, ''Alaskans endure a lot of hardships, and we are entitled to some kind of money for living here.'' Another bar patron, Richard Ryan, said Alaskans generally put their dividends to good use. ''Not everybody just goes out and blows it,'' said Mr. Ryan, a student at the University of Alaska. When a friend kiddingly asked him how he spent his 1987 dividend of $708, Mr. Ryan grinned sheepishly and said, ''I blew it on clothes and stuff.'' The Alaska fund is somewhat similar to one established in 1976 by the Province of Alberta, Canada, with more than $1 billion in oil revenue. A principal difference is that earnings from the Alberta fund go into government coffers to keep taxes down. The Alberta fund, which now has assets of about $12 billion, is expected to earn about $1 billion this year. Perhaps the Alaska dividend program's most powerful single defender is former Gov. Jay Hammond, a Republican. Mr. Hammond, who helped create the program, writes a regular column for The Anchorage Daily News. He uses the column to scold those who would threaten the dividend program. Dividends Called Efficient Mr. Hammond contends that the dividend is the fairest and most efficient way for the government to serve its citizens. Better that public wealth flow directly into citizens' pockets than into feeding a bigger bureaucracy, he says. Moreover, he maintains that the dividend program is the best way to protect the permanent fund, whose earnings pay the dividends. Established by constitutional amendment in 1976, the permanent fund receives 25 percent of the royalty and lease payments from state-owned oil land on Alaska's North Slope. The fund, which now totals about $8.5 billion, is earning about $800 million annually from investments in stocks, bonds and real estate. The tumble in the stock market last October did not have an adverse affect on the fund because it had sold about half of its stocks in February and March 1987, realizing a capital gain of $221 million. The fund's remaining stocks are those with long-term earning and dividend potential. By law, half of the earnings must be used to pay dividends. Another generous chunk must be returned to the principal to offset inflation. Another portion, which now totals $550 million, is regarded as surplus. This amount, which is not included in the total value of the fund, can be spent at the discretion of the Legislature. Governor Cowper recently suggested setting aside $700 million in surplus earnings over the next two years as an endowment for public education, which has suffered from the decline in oil revenue. The idea has stirred no interest in the Legislature and has drawn opposition from several quarters. ''There is a group of people in this state who believe that not one cent of permanent fund earnings should ever be spent for anything but dividends,'' the Governor said. ''These people are preventing reasonable and rational debate on the best ways to pay for government services. The time will soon come when we will have to have an income tax or use fund earnings, or both, to pay for government.''

10-> Rested Henderson Restless
Rickey Henderson paused a moment from the dominoes game that occupied his attention and flexed his left hand. He wanted to show that it was nearly healed, that the sore ring finger no longer really bothered him and that when Friday arrived, he would be ready. Henderson has been sitting since last Sunday, when Billy Martin decided to give the left fielder a few days off to rest his sore hand and rejuvenate his spirits in anticipation of the three-game series against Oakland that begins tomorrow night at the Stadium. So Henderson has spent his afternoons at one of the two large tables in the Yankee clubhouse, his attention drawn to the games he plays with his teammates, Claudell Washington and Charles Hudson. He rested again last night when the Yankees' game with the Seattle Mariners was called off because of rain and rescheduled for tonight. Henderson may sit out tonight, too. Martin, the Yankee manager, has pampered Henderson as he has no other player on the team, giving him time to heal his wounds and rest his legs, which have helped him steal 32 bases in 34 game. That puts him on a pace to swipe 136, which would snap his single-season record by 6. But Henderson has chosen to avoid talk of a new mark, acknowledging only the fact that it can be done. ''I'm capable of breaking it,'' he said. ''Any runner is capable if he gets on base enough. But I never set goals like that. I've got a chance to steal 100, but everything has got to go right. You've got to get on base, walk a lot and hope nobody is in front of you. And you can't be hitting home runs and triples. ''It could happen.'' The greatest obstacle to a stolen-base record could also be the offense that Henderson leads. The Yankees, a team that scores runs suddenly, have hit 41 homers, ranking only behind the Athletics in the American League. But Henderson's presence on the bases is surely felt. The Yankees have won 20 of 24 games in which he has scored at least one run; they have won 13 of 16 games in which he has scored at least one run and stolen at least one base. ''We have such a great hitting club,'' he said, ''but when the guys aren't hitting, you want to make something happen. When they get hot, it's very hard to run and make something happen. But when things fall right and you get the opportunity, you can run.'' Henderson has thrived under Martin's care, hitting .353 this season and .302 for his career. Under other managers, he has a .280 career average. With Martin as his manager, Henderson has stolen an average of 117 bases per 162 games, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Under other managers, his average drops markedly, to 81 steals. Martin, who was Henderson's field manager at Oakland when he broke the stolen-base record in 1982, has demonstrated great care with the player, who is given to occasional mood swings. He gave Henderson time off this week and even ordered the outfielder a special pair of sliding gloves to protect his hands. Henderson jammed his finger sliding into second base May 6 at Texas. Martin said that the rest would bring Henderson to full strength, both physically and mentally. ''It's good for a breather,'' Henderson said of the break. ''I'll be fired up again. But if my hand wasn't hurt, I wouldn't have missed these games. Oakland is playing well, and we want to be able to meet them at full force.'' The A's, who will bring baseball's best record into the game, are not the team that Henderson played for from 1979 to 1984, when he was traded to the Yankees. Carney Lansford and Tony Phillips remain, but others -Dwayne Murphy, Tony Armas, Steve McCatty, Mike Heath - have moved on or are out of the game. Martin Fined The Yankees announced that Martin had been fined an undisclosed sum by the American League for his dirt-kicking spree May 6 against Umpire Tim Welke at Arlington, Tex. Martin, who was ejected from the game, promised in the aftermath that he would refuse to pay the fine because he had not cursed Welke. Hours later, Martin was involved in an altercation at a nearby topless bar. . . . The team also moved Ron Guidry from the 20-day rehabilitation program to the 21-day disabled list. Mariners Stay Over The Yankees were rained out of a home game for the second time this season when the persistent downpour yesterday forced them to call off their contest against the Seattle Mariners. The game will be played tonight at 7:30 at the Stadium.

11-> Armenian Area in Azerbaijan Is on Strike, Moscow Reports
Armenian protesters have shut factories and schools and halted rail cargo in the capital of the region that is the focus of a territorial dispute involving two southern republics, Soviet newspapers reported today. The Government newspaper Izvestia said tonight that young men had tried to block buses bound for factories in the city, Stepanakert, and had threatened workers who insisted on going to work. The local authorities sent sound trucks through the city today, broadcasting appeals to workers to end the strike, Izvestia reported. Effects Are Widespread The newspapers did not disclose when the work stoppages began or whether they had hit other cities, but the reports said the economic effects of the strike were widespread. Stepanakert is the capital of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region, a mountainous wedge of land populated by an Armenian majority but governed since 1923 by the Azerbaijan Republic. A campaign by Armenians to annex the region to the neighboring Armenian Republic prompted street demonstrations last month. But after ethnic violence in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait, protest leaders called a one-month halt in demonstrations, then abandoned plans to renew the rallies last Saturday after authorities sent troops into the streets. An alternative plan for a stay-at-home strike fizzled. After a virtual blackout during the tense weeks of protest, the central newspapers have begun filing daily reports in the past week from the unsettled region. Today's reports from Stepanakert were the first to disclose in detail that protesters had resorted to strikes as a tactic. As news of the protests in Nagorno-Karabakh reached here today, dissidents in Moscow said that Paruir Airikyan, an Armenian nationalist active in those demonstrations, had been charged in Yerevan, capital of Armenia, with disseminating ''anti-Soviet slanders.'' The statute against slandering the state, which carries a prison term of up to three years, has fallen into disuse since the authorities released scores of political prisoners early last year. Mr. Airikyan has been an outspoken critic of the official handling the Armenian demands, and has publicly charged the Government with responsibility for the Sumgait rioting that left many Armenians dead. Moscow dissidents said Armenians in Yerevan staged a demonstration to demand Mr. Airikyan's release, but attempts to reach the Armenian capital tonight for additional information were unsuccessful. Pravda Calls Situation Grave The Communist Party newspaper Pravda reported that workers in Stepanakert had disrupted rail traffic throughout the region by refusing the unload cargo at the city stations. The capital, with a population of about 40,000, produces silk, dairy products, shoes and furniture. As of Sunday, the report said, 93 cars of flour, lumber, cement and other goods stood unattended in Stepanakert because most workers had stayed off the job. ''The grave situation at the Stepanakert station and at many enterprises in the region in February and March due to the fact that people did not show up for work aggravated the economic situation not only in Nagorno-Karabakh, but to some extent in the entire republic,'' Pravda said. An Izvestia correspondent reported that he awoke this morning expecting to find things returning to normal in Stepanakert, following ''stormy'' meetings Sunday at most of the city's factories. Azerbaijanis Honor Strike But everywhere he went - a shoe factory, a silk plant, and electrical parts plant - he found that workers had stayed home. The correspondent said Azerbaijani workers came to the plant gates but refused to work when they learned that the Armenians were on strike. ''They say that some young people tried to turn back the regular buses heading to the enterprises, stopped people on the streets and threatened them,'' Izvestia said. Pravda noted that in an attempt to placate residents of Nagorno-Karabakh, the Government last week announced a commitment to pour millions of rubles in economic development aid into the region. ''But the first condition for successful implementation of this is for machines not to stand idle, for freight cars to be unloaded, and for work in the fields to proceed,'' Pravda said.

12-> Sounds Around Town
Piano and Guitar Carol Britto with Bucky Pizzarelli, Fortune Garden Pavilion, 209 East 49th Street (753-0101). Carol Britto's strong, confident style as a pianist is given an added dimension tonight and tomorrow when she will be joined by the virtuoso guitarist Bucky Pizzarelli as well as the bassist Major Holley, who frequently appears with her. Mr. Pizzarelli, who began his career as a big-band guitarist (with Vaughn Monroe's orchestra), moved into the spotlight during the past 20 years as part of a guitar duo with George Barnes, as an unaccompanied soloist on the seven-string guitar, and as leader of a lively trio. With Miss Britto, he supplements her already strong rhythmic instincts and adds unusual colors to the trio performances. The trio plays tonight and tomorrow night at 9:30 and 11. On Sunday, Miss Britto and Mr. Holley will perform as a duo at 7 and 8:30 P.M. There is a $15 minimum. A Group of His Own Larry Willis Quintet, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, between 11th and Perry Streets (255-4037). Although Larry Willis is a veteran pianist who has paid his dues as a sideman with a wide assortment of groups - including Blood, Sweat and Tears, the Marsalis Brothers, the Woody Shaw Quintet and Herb Alpert's Tijuana Brass - and has played at the Village Vanguard for such leaders as Dexter Gordon and David (Fathead) Newman, he is heading a group of his own at the Vanguard for the first time this weekend. He has drawn on two generations of jazz musicians, with the bassist Buster Williams and the drummer Ben Riley, who have been playing together in the quartet Sphere, filling out his rhythm section and the trumpeter Terence Blanchard and the alto saxophonist Kenny Garrett, who came to prominence with Out of the Blue, contributing a younger point of view. Sets tonight, tomorrow and Sunday are at 10 and 11:30 P.M. and 1 A.M. There is a music charge of $12 and a $6 drink minimum. Peplowski Quartet Ken Peplowski Quartet, J's, 2581 Broadway, between 97th and 98th Streets (666-3600). Ken Peplowski plays both clarinet and tenor saxophone in ways that recall and extend the contributions that both these instruments made to the Swing Era, long before Mr. Peplowski was born. His clarinet playing includes a bit of both Benny Goodman and Buddy DeFranco, but there are also evidences of one of his most interesting saxophone sources, Ben Webster. His group includes the guitarist Frank Vignola, whose jazz roots go back even further to Django Reinhardt and Eddie Lang. They will be joined in J's airy second-floor room tonight from 9 P.M. to 1 A.M. by a bassist, probably Murray Wall, and a drummer. There is a $10 minimum at the tables, $5 at the bar, but no cover charge. Tribute to the Duke Jazz Album of the Week: ''For Ellington,'' the Modern Jazz Quartet (East-West). In the quadruple-threat jazz roles of composer, arranger, pianist and ensemble leader, Duke Ellington and John Lewis stand virtually alone, with the pioneering Jelly Roll Morton the only other parallel. So Mr. Lewis's interpretations of compositions by the Duke - mostly from the period 1939 to 1942, peak years for both the band and for Ellington as a composer - are of special interest as illustrations of the impact of one brilliant jazz mind on another. The transfer of such Ellington compositions as ''Jack the Bear,'' ''Prelude to a Kiss,'' ''Ko-Ko'' and ''Rockin' in Rhythm'' from the full Ellington ensemble with horns to the hornless Modern Jazz Quartet enables Mr. Lewis to develop the pieces in ways that often diverge from the Duke's treatments. Yet he is also able to find in the quartet suggestions of the ensemble colors of the full Ellington band.

13-> GOLF; McCumber Wins With Record Score
Mark McCumber, who gave up the landscaping business for the pro golf tour 10 years ago, completed a record score of 15-under-par 273 on the Tournament Players Club course today to easily win the Players Championship. The 36-year-old golfer, who was born in nearby Jacksonville and lives only three miles from the T.P.C. course, had a huge hometown gallery cheering him on as he ran away from the field to beat Mike Reid by four shots. David Frost and Fulton Allem, both of South Africa, were tied with Curt Byrum another shot back at 278. McCumber would have had to mow a lot of lawns and plant a lot of trees to make the $225,000 he earned by shooting three-under 69 in the final round of this $1.25 million event on the PGA Tour's home course. Tears came to McCumber's eyes as he waited to make the final two putts of the tournament. Then, despite a bogey at 18, it was his big smile that came out as he was surrounded by friends and family, including his wife, Paddy, and their two daughters. ''It was great because I won before people I grew up with,'' McCumber said. ''Before people whose lawns I mowed and whose yards I landscaped.'' Strong Pace for 1988 He and 39 other golfers had to come out early today to complete the third round, which was interrupted by heavy thunderstorms Saturday after only 30 of the field had finished. With a third-round score of 67 this morning to go with an opening 65 and a par 72 on Friday, McCumber continued his strong pace on the PGA Tour this year. Of the 23 rounds he has played so far in 1988, McCumber has shot par or better 22 times. McCumber saved par out of three waste bunkers and got a birdie out of a green-side bunker in this afternoon's final round, played in glorious weather that was a big contrast to the stormy blasts Saturday. Not only did he get one of the biggest checks in golf history, but by winning the PGA Tour's own championship event, McCumber earned an exemption that will automatically include him in all Tour events for 10 years. This should make it easy for the former landscaper to proceed with his family business, golf-course architecture and construction. The business also keeps his father and three brothers busy. Winning From the Bunkers McCumber flirted with trouble a couple of times on the front nine today when he drove into waste bunkers at No. 5 and No. 6. Each time, he extricated himself and put long approach shots from bunker to green to save par 4. But two straight birdies, at the 11th and 12th, put him far enough in front that he could easily play in for the victory. His bogey on the last hole was of little moment. McCumber's score broke the Tournament Players Club mark of 14-under-par 274 set by Calvin Peete in 1985 and tied by Sandy Lyle and Jeff Sluman last year. Lyle won the event last year in a playoff. Before making a big break from his closest rivals, McCumber got to the turn of the final round with another birdie at the 582-yard, par-5 ninth. ''That's my hole of the week,'' he said. He had shot an eagle there in the first round when he holed a 112-yard sand-wedge shot, then he birdied No. 9 in each of the last three rounds. He thus played the hole at five-under par for a third of his 15-under-par margin. His bogey on the 18th came because, as he said, ''I was just going to drive to the right there.'' That 440-yard, par-4 finishing hole has water all down the left side, and McCumber, playing safe, went into a difficult lie in right rough. Unable to reach the green in two, he chipped on his third shot and then two-putted for the 5. A similar bogey 5 by Frost was very costly for the South African, who has played so well in two years on the American tour without a victory. Instead of making $110,000 by tying Reid for second place, Frost made $65,000 for dropping into a tie with two others in third place - a $45,000 bogey.

14-> British Find the Past Enriching
Anthony Gaynor stands at the forefront of one of Britain's most promising industries of the future - the past. Mr. Gaynor is one of the creators of the Jorvik Viking Center, a slick but historically precise re-creation of a 10th-century Viking village here that has become one of the most popular admission-charging tourist attractions in Britain. Some 900,000 visitors a year are now ferried in motorized ''time cars'' past scenes of Viking life when the likes of King Erik Bloodaxe roamed the countryside. The sights, sounds and even the smells of a millenium ago have been painstakingly simulated. Mr. Gaynor's company, Heritage Projects Ltd., is one of the new breed of companies engaged in Britain's thriving ''heritage industry,'' a term used by both its enthusiasts and critics. The nation's rich past is the core of the tourist business, which is now Britain's fastest-growing major industry and second-largest earner of foreign currency, after North Sea oil. Tourism is a $24 billion-a-year business in Britain, employing 1.4 million people and creating 45,000 new jobs a year. A Chaucer Center ''We're making aspects of British history accessible and enjoyable to the general public,'' said Mr. Gaynor, the managing director of Heritage Projects, which is now creating a Chaucer Center celebrating the ''Canterbury Tales'' in Canterbury and an exhibit in Oxford on the 800-year history of Oxford University. ''And you can't do that if you wrap a museum in a lot of academic foliage.'' The Government of Margaret Thatcher is promoting tourist development and providing multimillion-dollar grants to help depressed former industrial cities like Liverpool, Bradford, Newcastle and Manchester find a post-industrial economic future. By the early 1990's, the Government estimates that tourist revenues will exceed $40 billion. No sane person comes to Britain for the weather or the beaches. They come to see the palaces and the stately homes, the birthplaces of Shakespeare and Dickens. They come for the heritage. That is especially true for Americans and visitors from former outposts of the British empire, whose language, roots and culture owe so much to England. Yet if outsiders are fascinated by this nation's past, the British themselves are obsessed by it - and increasingly so in recent years. The National Trust, founded in 1895 to preserve Britain's places of historic interest and natural beauty, has more than 1.5 million dues-paying members, more than any political party here. The National Trust's membership has tripled since 1975. The Heritage Mob Britain's cultural trend-setters, having long since replaced rival groups ranging from the punks to the Sloane Rangers, are the ''New Georgians,'' also known as the Heritage Mob. The more extreme of this breed of past-lovers appear to have stepped out of another century replete with stiff-neck collars, waistcoats and peg-top trousers. Most, however, do not go that far. But their numbers are large and many are young. And their influence is considerable. Prince Charles's periodic railing against the blight of modern architecture, for example, is pure New Georgian ideology. This is a country where a museum opens every two weeks. A survey of 1,750 museums last year by the British Museums Association found that half of them had been founded since 1971. ''You can't project that sort of rate of growth much further before the whole country becomes one big open-air museum,'' said Dr. Neil Cossons, director of the Science Museum, Britain's pre-eminent museum on science and technology. Industrial museums have become especially popular. In the Wigan Heritage Center and the Ironbridge Gorge Museum, people dressed up in period garb cast iron, make candles and generally act like their Victorian ancestors. The ''dark satanic mills'' of the Industrial Revolution, sanctified by the passing of time, have become museums and industrial archeology is a fast-expanding academic field. Critics See Commercialism To critics, the glorification of an idealized past is a threat to the present, reflecting a deep-seated pessimism about the future. They regard exhibitions like those staged by Heritage Projects as a ''Disneyland'' presentation of Britain's past, which trivializes history in a degrading display of commercialism. Their economic argument against tourism is that the jobs it creates are often low-paid, unskilled and seasonal. ''When museums become one of Britain's new growth industries, they are not signs of vitality but symbols of national decline,'' said Robert Hewison, author of the recent book ''The Heritage Industry: Britain in a Climate of Decline.'' Mr. Hewison added, ''We should be investing in science parks, not theme parks of the past.'' The notion that Britain has been too enamored of its past for its own good is not new. Economic historians, led by Martin Wiener, author of ''English Culture and the Decline of the Industrial Spirit,'' have argued for years that the concept of the past as a refuge from the present, promoted by 19th-century intellectuals, was an important reason why Britain had such difficulty adjusting to the economic changes of the 20th century. Ruskin's Love of the Old These historians argue that there has been too much of the attitude expressed by John Ruskin. That essayist, who was a founder of the preservationist movement in the 19th century, once said, ''I am by nature and instinct a conservative, loving old things because they are old, and hating new ones simply because they are new.'' For his part, Mr. Gaynor, who is 42 years old, dismisses the detractors of his style of commercialization of history as mostly elitist snobs. ''When our display techniques are critized as 'Disneyland,' I regard it as a compliment, given the source,'' he said. Heritage Projects is a leader in the fast-growing business of making Britain's past pay. It employs historians, craftsmen, engineers and other specialists, recruiting them from sources ranging from the Royal Shakespeare Company to the jobless rolls. But the York company also has finance and management specialists and acts as a design and operations consultant on a dozen projects. This makes Heritage Projects a conglomerate in what is essentially a cottage industry. The heritage business has several well-known design and consultant firms, including the L.&R. Leisure Group, A.Y. Grant Ltd. and Robin Wade & Pat Read Design Partnership Ltd. Yet they typically farm out the building of exhibitions to the army of preservation artisans that the industry supports, instead of maintaining large in-house workshops. Like many firms in the field, Heritage Projects has grown swiftly. It has a full-time staff of 161, up from 60 two years ago. The brainchild of Mr. Gaynor and a few others who spotted the commercial potential of an archeological dig of Viking artifacts at York, the Jorvik Viking Center generates revenues of $4.25 million a year. Local officials estimate that for every $1 spent at the tourist center an additional $7 are spent on meals, hotels, gift shops and other local enterprises, bringing the total wealth added to York from the Viking museum to nearly $30 million a year. Much of the money seems to be spent in the specialty retail shops that surround the Viking exhibition. They have helped rejuventate a once-shabby section of downtown York. Despite what critics say, researchers at Heritage Projects could hardly be accused of glossing over historical details. At Oxford, for example, they spent weeks calling experts to find out if the figure of Edmund Halley, the 18th-century astonomer who discovered the comet that bears his name, would have one eye closed when gazing through his telescope. Eventually, they decided to close one, despite a few dissenting views. ''Our questions are so thorough that experts sometimes say they are silly,'' said Lauren Gilmour, a Harvard-educated archeologist who is a senior researcher on the Oxford project. ''But to do this properly, the historical detail has to be authentic. We're opening up a lot of ideas to the general public.''

15-> Books of The Times; 'Paris Fashion,' Clothes as Extension of Culture
Paris Fashion A Cultural History By Valerie Steele Illustrated. 317 pages. Oxford University Press. $35. Paris and fashion have been so closely associated for so long that the link between them must sometimes seem like a fact of nature. But of course it isn't; and in ''Paris Fashion'' Valerie Steele has set out to analyze the phenomenon in terms of social values and culture. How did Paris acquire its supremacy as the international capital of style, and why, in spite of its relative decline, has it been able to retain such a commanding position? In searching for an explanation, Ms. Steele has found herself writing, as she says, ''a study of ideas about fashion'' rather than ''a history of the fashion industry as such.'' Her answer, briefly, is that Paris fashion has flourished because Paris has had a more sophisticated and more highly developed ''fashion culture'' than any comparable metropolitan center. In a book that calls itself a cultural history, that may sound like a piece of circular reasoning; but by the time you have finished reading her, it is hard not to agree. Nowhere else were new styles so paraded and so appreciated as they were in 18th-century and 19th-century Paris; nowhere else did fashion have such prestige, or generate such an institutional life of its own, or maintain such friendly connections with the other, less ephemeral arts. It is reasons such as these that account for the triumph of Parisian couture, rather than supposedly unique qualities of invention and craftsmanship. To account for the fashion culture itself you would virtually have to write a cultural history of France, to explore parallels in other areas (haute cuisine is perhaps the most obvious one) and delve deeper into the general history of taste. But that would be to undertake more than a single book could hope to encompass, except at a superficial level. As it is, Ms. Steele has achieved some heroic feats of compression, though without clogging her narrative. The story goes back a long way, at least as far as 15th-century Burgundy (''chic black,'' for example, first made its appearance among ''individual Burgundian and Italian dandies who were in the process of renouncing the gay colors of the late Middle Ages''); and at every stage the argument is buttressed with case histories and anecdotes. The 80 or so illustrations make an important contribution, too. They are not only well chosen but well integrated into the text, and the art of portraying fashion is itself discussed in illuminating detail. There is a particularly valuable account of the evolution of the fashion plate, from the 18th century onward. It takes in such topics as the neglected achievements of the Colin sisters, outstanding fashion illustrators in the middle years of the 19th century; the international impact of magazines of the same period like Le Moniteur de la Mode, which had eight foreign editions (American, British, German, Russian, Belgian, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese); and the Art Deco fashion plates of artists like Paul Iribe and Georges Barbier, which not only reflected the radically new styles of the years before World War I, but also influenced their development. Men's clothes as well as women's find a place in the book, most arrestingly in a chapter on Baudelaire, who began as a romantic dandy and gradually turned toward the more austere dandyism of dressing entirely in black - on the face of it, something not so very different from the conventional bourgeois garb of the time. (I hadn't realized until reading Ms. Steele that he designed all his clothes himself.) If Baudelaire is the only poet to figure significantly in ''Paris Fashion,'' two chapters center on the work of major novelists. Balzac, who early in his career wrote a ''Treatise on the Elegant Life,'' may not have practiced what he preached (he was notoriously slovenly in his personal appearance), but Ms. Steele demonstrates that in his fiction he was both an accurate historian of fashion and a keen student of its symbolism. So, in a more subtle way, was Proust, and we are given a good deal of interesting information about both the clothes his characters wear and the couturiers mentioned in his work. Most of the couturiers, apart from the Italian-born Mariano Fortuny, are only dimly remembered today. Even Mme. Paquin, who presided over more than 2,000 employees in her heyday, barely rates a mention in most fashion histories (although Ms. Steele might have added that she has achieved literary immortality of sorts: there is a reference to her in a much-quoted passage in Ezra Pound's ''Pisan Cantos''). One result of her research into the careers of figures like Mme. Paquin has been to persuade Ms. Steele - and she persuades the reader in turn -that women have played a much greater role in the history of fashion as designers than the textbooks give them credit for. But she isn't out to prove a simple thesis, feminist or otherwise; and without playing down the extent to which fashion is shaped by wider social forces, she insists that it also has a dynamic of its own. Only at the end, I think, does she falter: she doesn't really put forward an adequate explanation of how Parisian fashion managed to make such a fighting comeback after World War II. But it's a complicated subject, one that needs more space than she can give it here, and it would be nice to see her returning to it another time. Meanwhile her book offers many insights and pleasures, including some excellent quotations. I cherish the summing up by a rival designer of the Chanel look, popularly supposed to have been inspired by ''the simple dress of the working girl,'' as ''deluxe poverty,'' and to anyone who takes a sternly disapproving view of fashion as a whole, I commend a reflection of Jean Cocteau: ''Fashion dies very young, so we must forgive it everything.''

16-> Jubilant Jackson Stresses His Record in Connecticut
A jubilant Jesse Jackson, fresh from a stunning victory in the Michigan Democratic caucuses Saturday, brought his campaign to Connecticut today, telling cheering supporters that he has a better record of service here than any of his opponents in the Connecticut primary Tuesday. Mr. Jackson, who attracted crowds of more than 400 in Stamford and Bridgeport, reminded the audiences that he had worked in the state as an advocate of civil rights and had fought for organized labor. He also pointed out that although the state was regarded as the wealthiest in the nation, its urban areas, such as Hartford and Bridgeport, share many of the problems of cities in less affluent areas. 'Economy Is a Disaster' ''Three hundred thousand people without health insurance; 15 percent of the babies born without prenatal care; one in five children don't finish high school, 20 percent of our children in born in poverty,'' Mr. Jackson said. ''And yet against this backdrop, we're the people that can make a difference.'' At one point, speaking to a crowd of about 800 at Bulkeley High School in Hartford, Mr. Jackson exclaimed: ''I can't wait to defeat George Bush in November!'' The placard-waving audience, half-black, half-white, then rose to its feet and began the chant that was heard throughout the day by the Jackson campaign: ''Win Jesse Win!'' A couple of hundred people gathered this evening to hear Mr. Jackson speak on the green in the center of New Haven. ''The economy is a disaster and he's the only one who's taking people seriously,'' said William Dunlap, a professor and associate dean at the University of Bridgeport School of Law. ''He has populist positions that I like: disarmament, jobs, education. I know a fair number of people at the university who aren't black or radical who will vote for him. I think he'll do fairly well in Connecticut.'' He also told the crowd: ''Michigan pulled their weight. Connecticut, don't let me down. When you needed me, I was here. Now I need you.'' Mayor Carrie Saxon Perry of Hartford, who has endorsed Mr. Jackson, said: ''We're hoping for a little bump from Michigan. I would like to break Dukakis' stranglehold on New England. We are going to need all the cities to come out very strong.'' Thirman L. Milner, a former Mayor of Hartford who is state chairman of the Jackson campaign, said: ''We get 24 percent - it's a victory.'' 'Expansive, Not Expensive' The campaign plans to spend very little money here, with most of the funds going to a few television commericials to be aired Monday and Tuesday in Hartford and New Haven. ''Our campaign is an expansive campaign - not an expensive campaign,'' Mr. Jackson said in Stamford today. Mr. Jackson said that part of the secret of his success in this campaign was his message that ''we are breaking the shackles of cynicism and despair.'' While pleased with the win in Michigan, Jackson campaign officials emphasized that such widespread support should not be unexpected. ''I'm surprised at the size of the victory, but I'm not surprised that he won,'' said Frank E. Watkins, the national political director for the Jackson campaign.

17-> CONSUMER'S WORLD; Coping: With Hobby Collections
Hobbyists take holidays too, in the summer's heat and haze. There are fewer hobby shows and fewer opportunities to buy, sell and trade. So this is a good time to put a collection in order. You will get more enjoyment from your hobby when activity resumes in the autumn, and if your collection ends up in someone else's hands, he or she will thank you. Collectors of stamps or coins, of matchbooks, wine labels or rock-and-roll memorabilia, very often baffle their families and friends. What is the attraction of these bits of colored paper and tarnished metal? Far too frequently, the bafflement turns to frustration when a collection must be disposed of. Such possessions are often left in attics when children move on, and they are sometimes willed to unprepared heirs. If you are a collector, avoid having your pastime turn into someone else's headache by following some basic steps. Draw up an inventory of the collection, with an assessment of its value. This should include instructions for evaluating and disposing of the collection, the names of hobby organizations, information on insurance the hobbyist carries and the names and addresses of fellow collectors who can be counted on for advice. If you are the recipient of a collection, the first thing you need to do is make sure the material is not going to deteriorate while you are deciding what to do with it. In the case of paper items especially, consider such factors as heat and humidity. Keep the collection in an air-conditioned room, away from direct sunlight and radiators. If you keep the collection in your home, check your insurance to see if the collection is covered. Other choices are a bank safe-deposit box or a commercial depository, which offers more space; again, review insurance provisions. Now, to evaluate the holdings. For stamps and coins, there are highly reliable hobby associations that can help. The American Philatelic Society will arrange for an informal evaluation of the collection of any member, said Keith A. Wagner, the executive director. In the case of nonmembers, the society will suggest dealers in your area. (Box 8000, 100 Oakwood Avenue, State College, Pa. 16803; 814-237-3803.) The American Numismatic Association will authenticate and grade coins ($20 a coin for small lots; $12.50 a coin if more than 50 are involved), but it will not evaluate them. J. P. Martin, of the group's certification service, suggested checking dealers in Coin World or Numismatic News, two monthlies, or in The Numismatist, the association's publication. (818 North Cascade Avenue, Colorado Springs, Colo. 80903; 719-632-2646.) Many stamp dealers also belong to the American Stamp Dealers Association (5 Dakota Drive, Lake Success, N.Y. 11042; 800-645-3826). This group also offers a booklet, ''Selling a Stamp Collection,'' and a list of specialized dealers. The American Philatelic Society, the American Numismatic Association and the American Stamp Dealers Association are very strict about membership, and dealers who are members should prove reliable. Having gained a sense of what the collection is worth, the next decision is what to do with it: sell it, or give it away. If the collector bought material regularly from one company, that supplier should be contacted. Many suppliers include in their sales contracts a commitment to buy back material. These would include producers of commemorative medallions, deluxe editions of classic literature and ceramic items issued in series, like Christmas plates. Suppliers of stamps and coins do not usually make such commitments, but they are a good place to look first when considering a sale. In the case of particularly valuable material, the seller is likely to be well informed about the provenance of the items, and presumably has developed a resale market. Do not be surprised if cash offers are well under the estimates of an evaluator. For the most accurate appraisal, ask the evaluator what he or she would be willing to pay for it. Many collectors have spent years working on their hobbies but have bought items for fun, not for an investment. If the collection is modest, consider giving it away. The first choice would be a family member or a close friend of the hobbyist. The second choice should include school groups and Veterans Administration hospitals. Postmasters and school principals are often involved in Ben Franklin clubs, which promote stamp collecting among children. At V.A. hospitals, stamp and coin collections are used as a part of therapy. For other types of collections, consult the advertising in specialty magazines. Consider keeping part of the collection as a memento. Select a few pieces that you find attractive and have them mounted. A pair of colorful wine labels, a striking coin or an interesting stamp hanging in your home can evoke warm memories of the person who once treasured it.

20-> Ecuador Halts Bank Talks
Ecuador formally suspended talks with its foreign bank creditors today, bringing to a standstill an unratified $5.1 billion rescheduling accord reached in October, the Finance Minister, Eduardo Cabezas, said. Mr. Cabezas said Ecuador, which has not made payments to foreign banks since January, could not meet the interest payments due under the October agreement. Debt analysts said the announcement formalized a prolonged stalemate between Ecuador and the banks, which had not signed the October rescheduling agreement. Mr. Cabezas projected Ecuador's total foreign debt would rise to $10 billion at the end of the year, from $9.17 billion at the end of 1987. He said the country was desperately short of foreign exchange because of falling oil prices and an earthquake in March 1987 that shattered the country's main pipeline, halting oil exports for five months. Mr. Cabezas said negotiations on government-to-government debt with the Paris Club, a group of creditor governments, would continue, as would Ecuador's servicing of its debt to international financial institutions.

21-> Restaurants
Late July may not be the most opportune time to talk about a steakhouse - as the temperature soars, thoughts often turn to salads and seafood -but Brandywine is a special place, and the summer menu there is varied enough to offer something for all tastes. Opened last December, this Gramercy Park restaurant is owned by Phil Suarez (who also owns Positano on Park Avenue at 20th Street), Robert Maisano (owner of a German restaurant called Rolf's on Third Avenue near 21st Street) and Ben House. Brandywine is not one of those macho locker rooms where brusque waiters slam a side of beef on the table, then make lame jokes about whether you can eat it all and still walk out the door unaided. The 30-seat main room has a warm and neighborly feel with its dark cherry wood paneling, antique brass sconces, equestrian art, and leather banquettes. A cozy little back room is a delightful spot for a private function. The staff at Brandywine is cordial and caring and well-versed on the menu and wines. Speaking of wine, the primarily American and French selection here is extremely well matched to the menu and very well priced. Among the many recommended bargains are the 1985 Chateau St. Jean, La Petite Etoile, sauvignon blanc ($21); the 1984 Sequoia Grove cabernet sauvignon ($24), and the Chateau Rausan-Segla from Margaux ($24). An Irish acquaintance with prodigious experience in the field of martinis declared the bartenders' alchemy here ''very good indeed.'' The same can be said of some of the food by Doug Vincent, the chef (formerly of Restaurant Raphael on West 54th Street), starting with the tender little baked clams with garlic and oregano. Other good starters are the simple but lovingly prepared broiled shrimp under garlic butter and mixed herbs, and the light, lustily seasoned mushroom soup specked with chives. When the kitchen doesn't overdo the vinegar, the house salads are impeccable. Serious beef lovers will be happy to see hefty porterhouse and T-bone steaks on the menu. Both are cut from the loin with centerbone intact; the porterhouse has a slightly larger fillet section. Both are thick, juicy and cooked precisely to order, then served with coarse mustard butter. The steaks' flavor, however, was a bit disappointing. This may be a temporary problem related to the Midwest drought. In the last six weeks, supplies of the best prime beef have dwindled and prices have soared, leaving some restaurants in a cost bind. Better bets for now are the well-marbled and richly flavored sirloin and the buttery filet mignon. Also recommended is a dish called steak a la stone, a sliced sirloin smothered in sauteed peppers, onions and mushrooms. The center cut veal chop is superbly tender and delicious, as are the lamb chops with roasted garlic cloves and fresh mint. Among the side dishes, home fries are winners, and if the restaurant offers its sublime mashed potatoes as a special, don't miss them. On the lighter side, there is an occasional warm weather special called barbecued chicken salad, which is a rather awkward combination of grilled chicken in a smoky sauce over mixed greens. Seafood is exceptionally well turned out here. A special of grilled salmon was outstanding, lightly crisped and faintly smoky, along with sauteed snow peas and soothing creamed spinach. Halibut in a tarragon butter sauce was flawless, as were moist, dill-accented swordfish in a pristine white wine sauce, and grilled jumbo shrimp energized with coriander butter. For dessert, there is a bet-you-can't-finish-it-all creamy cheesecake and relatively light yet potent chocolate mousse cake. Dense lemon tart is a distant third. Brandywine is an unpretentious neighborhood spot that offers value for the dollar and civility, a rare and laudable combination. Brandywine ** Third Avenue, near 21st Street, 353-8190.

23-> Boron Said to Be Crucial to Bone Formation
BORON, an element best known for its use as an eye wash and a roach killer, plays a critical role in the body's ability to use calcium to form bone, new research indicates. If further studies confirm the finding, they will establish boron as a ''new'' essential nutrient, to be added to the list of trace elements, those needed in tiny amounts in the diet for normal growth and development. The preliminary studies suggest that in women past menopause, boron may stimulate hormones, mimicking the effects of estrogen replacement therapy. Currently, estrogen treatment is the most effective method of preventing postmenopausal bone loss, which can lead to osteoporosis and debilitating fractures. Boron's potential role in nutrition was serendipitously discovered in the course of another study by two researchers for the Federal Department of Agriculture: Dr. Forrest H. Nielsen, a biochemist and director of the Human Nutrition Research Center in Grand Forks, N.D., and Dr. Curtiss D. Hunt, an anatomist at the center. They had been trying to unravel the role of arsenic in nutrition when the chicks they were studying had unexpected growth problems and developed leg abnormalities. Skeptical Reception The researchers found that lack of a previously unrecognized nutrient, boron, caused the problems. When boron was added to the chicks' diet, their bones developed normally as long as other factors critical to bone growth, such as activated vitamin D, were present. Dr. Nielsen and Dr. Hunt first presented their finding to an international meeting of nutrition researchers in Australia in 1981, and it was skeptically received. But the researchers were convinced that they were on to something important. They continued their research, first showing that boron was essential to normal growth in rats and then looking into its role in people. The human studies were done in a metabolic unit, where 12 postmenopausal women lived for six months, receiving all their food only from the nutrition center. In this way, the researchers precisely controlled each participant's diet. When boron intake was increased from one-fourth of a milligram to three milligrams a day, there was a marked decline in the urinary loss of calcium and magnesium, an indirect measure of how much of these minerals was available to form new bone. In addition, when the women received the extra boron, there was an increase in the amount of the sex hormones estrogen and testosterone in their blood. According to this study, which needs to be repeated to be certain of the finding, estrogen levels rose to those typically found in postmenopausal women on estrogen replacement therapy. Limited Sources in Diets Dr. Nielsen said the diets of many Americans are likely to be very low in boron because of the emphasis on animal foods like meats and dairy products. Even people who eat a lot of grains and root foods would not get much boron, he said. Only plants known as dicotyledons, which start growth with two leaves, have a significant amount of boron. Among these are fruits, legumes, nuts and vegetables in the cabbage family. This may explain in part why Seventh-Day Adventists, a religious denomination that advocates a vegetarian diet, have a much lower incidence of osteoporosis than meat-eating Americans. It may also explain why Eskimos, who eat almost no fruits and vegetables, have a high incidence of the bone-wasting disease. Boron was discovered in seeds in the mid-19th century. Several decades later, it was found to be toxic to animals, accounting for its usefulness as an insecticide. Like all known trace elements boron is toxic when consumed in amounts signficantly larger than those necessary for good nutrition. Just two grams of boric acid can kill an infant, and 45 grams is lethal to an adult. Early in this century, boron was recognized as essential to the normal growth of plants, which die when boron is lacking in the soil. However, scientists still do not know exactly what physiological role the element plays in plant development. Similarly, experts do not know what role boron has in human development. Dr. Hunt said he ''suspects that the body needs boron to synthesize estrogen, vitamin D and other steroid hormones, and that it may also protect these hormones against rapid breakdown.'' Advice on Nutrients The North Dakota researchers are now conducting additional studies on 14 people living in the metabolic unit and 15 people, including five men, living in the community but getting all their food from the research center. Dr. Nielsen, meanwhile, cautioned against taking boron supplements or consuming any boron product because of the toxicity of the element. ''The best way to increase boron intake is to eat fruits and vegetables, the way the body most naturally handles it,'' he said. Dr. Walter Mertz, an expert on essential nutrients and a member of the National Academy of Sciences Food and Nutrition Board, said the new finding underlined the importance of not relying on supplements to meet nutritional needs. ''The discovery clearly demonstrates that we cannot be sure at any given time we've identified all the important nutrients,'' he said. ''And, of course, what is not identified cannot be put into a supplement.'' Although most foods have yet to be tested for boron content, among those known to be especially good sources are apples, grapes and pears. A small apple weighing four ounces contains about half a milligram of boron, one-third to one-half the likely human daily requirement.

25-> Topics of The Times; A Boy No More What happens to an aging playboy?
In the case of Hugh Hefner, he suffers stress, depression and a little stroke, and suddenly begins to appreciate things he once scorned - like marriage. Mr. Hefner, the 62-year-old founder of the Playboy empire, announced Wednesday that he planned to marry Kimberley Conrad, a 24-year-old model featured in Playboy magazine last January. That seems an act of apostasy for the man who propounded the ''Playboy philosophy'' of unfettered hedonism. But Mr. Hefner, sounding like a 24-year-old himself, had an explanation. ''In this relationship,'' he said, ''I have found something I never found before. . . .'' He didn't say exactly what he had found, though it apparently has to do with a shared love of animals and of ''simply hanging out'' at home - the foundations of the best marriages. In a more revealing statement, Mr. Hefner contrasted his relationship with Miss Conrad to an earlier one that turned out badly - and produced a palimony suit that was later dropped. ''I just didn't pick the right person,'' he said of Carrie Leigh, with whom he lived for four and a half years. ''This time I realized it is inconceivable there is somebody else ideally suited to me.'' Enough said, about the playboy and his philosophy.

26-> BUSINESS PEOPLE; Allied Fills Presidency, A Job Vacant Since '85
Alan Belzer, an executive vice president of Allied-Signal Inc. and president of the company's engineered materials sector, was named president of the huge technology company yesterday. The president's position had been vacant since November 1985, when Michael D. Dingman left Allied-Signal to head the Henley Group, a collection of 30 operations that was spun off after Allied acquired the Signal Companies for $5 billion earlier that year. Henley's lines of business range from real estate to chemicals. Earlier this month, Henley announced that it would split its operations into two publicly owned companies. In addition to overseeing the company's daily operations, Mr. Belzer, 55 years old, will also serve as chief operating officer and a company director. With the appointment, he will take over some of the duties of Edward L. Hennessy, the strong-willed chairman and chief executive of Allied-Signal who has built the company through a series of acquisitions in recent years. But Mr. Belzer played down speculation that he is the heir apparent to Mr. Hennessy, who plans to retire in 1993. ''At this point, I have a job to do, and I've long since stopped thinking about what the next one will be,'' Mr. Belzer said. ''What comes next, the board will decide.'' Mr. Belzer said much of his focus would be on consolidating the company's rapid growth in recent years. ''We did lots of acquisitions, and then came a time of focusing the company,'' he said. ''We are in the normal transition in running those operations and building on those operations, and so it seems a natural time to have a chief operating officer.'' Mr. Belzer graduated in 1953 from New York University, where he majored in accounting. He joined the company as a financial analyst in 1955, when it was the Allied Chemical and Dye Corporation. He has spent his entire professional career at the company, serving in various jobs until he became the president of the engineered materials sector in 1986.

27-> Growth in Consumer Credit At a Slower Rate in May
Americans increased their installment borrowing at a modest annual rate of 4.6 percent in May, as growth in consumer credit slowed from the rapid expansion of earlier this year. The Federal Reserve Board said today that consumers took out $2.42 billion more in credit than they paid off in May, compared with a net growth of $3.85 billion in April. The annual rate of growth in May was well below the 7.3 percent rate in April and less than half of the 10.7 percent rate for the first three months of the year. Consumer credit grew 7.2 percent last year. Automobile Credit Slower Slow expansion of automobile credit contributed to low overall growth in May. Borrowing for automobiles rose by $597 million, an annual rate of 2.6 percent, compared with 7.8 percent in April and 15.9 percent in March. Economists had been expecting a drop in consumer credit in May, although a less sharp one, because of rising interest rates during the month and previously reported weak sales. Michael Evans, head of Evans Economics Inc. in Washington, said the May credit report represented a temporary lull from faster expansion. 'Fewer Tax Refunds' ''May was a bad month for consumer spending,'' Mr. Evans said. ''My theory is first we had a rise in interest rates and secondly we had fewer tax refunds than usual. Often people use their tax refunds as a down payment for some big-ticket item and that means more credit.'' ''Interest rates eased in June,'' he added, ''but a lot of people in May thought they were going a lot higher and a lot of people who had variable rate mortages thought they were really going to get socked and took it easier on their other credit.'' Consumer spending rebounded in June. Major department stores on Thursday all reported gains. Auto sales for the month jumped from an annual rate of 10.2 million units to 10.6 million. In May, the category that included credit card debt continued a string of strong increases, rising by $1.69 billion, a 12.1 percent annual rate, compared with rates of 12.4 percent in April and 16 percent in March. The credit report said the category that includes bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate grew by $196 million, a 1.5 percent rise, compared with a 2.2 percent increase in April. Borrowing for mobile homes fell $60 million, or 2.8 percent, after a 1.5 percent rise in April. The various changes left total consumer debt at $631.8 billion at the end of May, up 9.4 percent from a year ago.

29-> Charter Panel To Hear Plan From Its Chief
The Charter Revision Commission will hear its chairman's proposal for revamping the New York City government today, at a meeting bound to irritate further the frayed tempers of elected officials who favor the status quo. The chairman, Richard Ravitch, is expected to propose disbanding the Board of Estimate and distributing its powers among an expanded City Council, a new land-use panel, the mayoralty and the borough presidents. The commission is moving in that direction because its legal consultants have advised that trying to save the board runs a serious risk of violating Federal civil rights legislation. In a 1986 decision now on appeal to the Supreme Court, a Federal judge found the board's structure violated the Constitutional principle of one person, one vote because each borough president had one vote despite the widely varying populations of the boroughs. Mr. Ravitch is also expected to submit an alternative proposal, which he does not favor, to replace the Board of Estimate with a panel whose 15 to 20 members would be elected from districts of equal population. Board Roles Eliminated All of the board members except Mayor Koch disagree with the proposals to disband the board, and their legal consultants have just submitted a memo arguing that the board can be preserved by imposing weighted voting and that enhancing the mayoralty would violate the Federal Voting Rights Act of 1965. ''It constitutes, in reality, a massive transfer of power to the mayor,'' the memo says. The memo's central argument is that abolishing the board would dilute, not enhance, minority-group power, and would therefore violate the Federal Voting Rights Act by eliminating the board roles of the Manhattan Borough President, David N. Dinkins, who is black, and Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer, who is Puerto Rican. But the commission's legal consultants, in four separate memos, concluded that the Justice Department would probably find weighted voting in violation of the Voting Rights Act on the ground that it would actually reduce the power of minority groups to elect candidates of their choice. Mr. Ravitch declined to comment yesterday on the memo that supports weighted voting. He would also not discuss the commission's proposal, but it has been the subject of so many consultations with elected officials and their advisers that its main points are common knowledge in and around New York City government. City Council Would Grow The plan starts, according to those familiar with it, by eliminating the Board of Estimate, which controls land-use decisions, most contracts and franchise approvals, and which must pass on the New York City budget. Although the board would no longer exist, its members - the mayor, Council president, comptroller and five borough presidents - would keep their titles but have different responsibilities. Under the proposal, the Council would be expanded from 35 to 60 members, would pass on the city budget and would consider zoning changes proposed by a new land-use panel. That panel would be composed of 11 members - 5 appointed by the mayor, 5 by the borough presidents and 1 by the Council president. Mayoral agencies would pass on contracts. The borough presidents would propose their own capital and expense budgets to the mayor and the Council. The comptroller would be limited to a fiscal role.

30-> Soviet Closes a Magazine Extolling Openness
The editor of the independent magazine Glasnost said today that the authorities had confiscated his printing equipment and destroyed his files and manuscripts, leaving the future of the best-known Soviet dissident journal in doubt. The editor, Sergei I. Grigoryants, who was released Monday from a week in jail, said tonight that he had also received indirect reports that the Soviet prosecutor was preparing to charge him with defaming the Soviet state, a crime that carries up to three years in prison or internal exile. The dissident editor, who has grown increasingly disillusioned about the prospects for change, charged that the crackdown on his magazine and other recent police moves against dissent were a deliberate presummit message to President Reagan from Soviet police and the K.G.B. that they, not Mikhail S. Gorbachev's liberal supporters, still control the rights environment here. The crackdown on Glasnost magazine - named after Mr. Gorbachev's favorite catchword for greater official tolerance of public expression - was a major setback for an unofficial publication that has become, in a little more than 10 months, the largest and most influential of the new generation of dissident literature. The journal of dissident news and opinion is issued twice a month in editions of about 200 copies, and articles are widely reprinted in other independent magazines around the country and published in translations abroad. Mr. Grigoryants said that while he was imprisoned the police and plainclothesmen had ransacked the house outside Moscow that he used as his editorial office, leaving him without equipment to continue publication. Speaking to reporters today at his apartment in Moscow, Mr. Grigoryants said he was barred from the house Tuesday by a cordon of police and plainclothesmen, but had managed to inspect it through the open windows. Mr. Grigoryants said officials in the Ramensky district had told him to file documents proving that the house and the equipment belonged to him, a process that he said the authorities could easily stretch out for a year or more. Mr. Grigoryants has spent more than eight years in prisons and labor camps, including a term for ''anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda'' for his work on an earlier underground bulletin. He was one of scores of political prisoners set free early last year under a mass pardon. The editor was arrested May 9 as he waited at his editorial office for a delegation from a newly organized group, the Democratic Union, that recently proclaimed itself an opposition party. Mr. Grigoryants said today that he was doubtful that the new group had the potential to become a serious political force, but he endorsed the general idea of an opposition front and had agreed to help the organizers of the Democratic Union publish a paper. After what he described today as a mock hearing, in which no lawyers or witnesses took part and the only question put to him was his name, he was found guilty of resisting arrest and ordered to spend a week in jail. Shortly after the arrest, the Soviet press agency Tass, in a bulletin distributed only to English-language clients, strongly suggested that Mr. Grigoryants's detention was intended as a warning against disturbances that might mar the summit meeting. One of the organizers of the Democratic Union, Viktor Kuzin, was arrested along with Mr. Grigoryants and served five days. On Tuesday, Mr. Grigoryants said, another Democratic Union organizer, Valeria Novodvorskaya, was arrested and sentenced to 15 days for taking part in an unauthorized demonstration last week. In announcing his plans to publish Glasnost last summer, Mr. Grigoryants declared his intention to work entirely in the open, even sending copies to the Communist Party Central Committee, as a test of Mr. Gorbachev's sincerity. Since then he has been denounced in the official press and occasionally harrassed, but the authorities have not prevented him from distributing his magazine. Scores of other independent journals have followed him in a resurgence of independent publishing.

31-> WILLIAM CARTER, DANCER-CHOREOGRAPHER, DIES AT 56
William Carter, a dancer and choreographer, died of AIDS on Thursday at Mt. Sinai Hospital. He was 56 years old and lived in Manhattan. Mr. Carter was best known as a leading dancer with the American Ballet Theater, where he played characters as diverse as the genial Champion Roper in Agnes de Mille's ''Rodeo'' and the mysterious Charlatan in Michel Fokine's ''Petrouchka.'' Critics described him as an eloquent, eminently serious artist who could bring distinction to the most lifeless roles. But Mr. Carter also had an unusually varied dance career, performing as a principal with the New York City Ballet and Ballet Theater, as a modern dancer with the Martha Graham Dance Company and with Pearl Lang, and as a Spanish dancer with Maria Alba. He was also a founder of the First Chamber Dance Quartet and headed his own ballet and flamenco touring company in the early 1980's. Born on March 21, 1935, in Durant, Okla., Mr. Carter began to study dance with Coralane Duane at the age of 12 to try to strengthen his legs, which had been weakened by polio. He went on to study with Carmelita Maracci, a noted ballet teacher in Los Angeles. Mr. Carter moved to New York in 1957, joining Ballet Theater that year and leaving when it disbanded briefly. Roles in Graham Company He joined City Ballet in 1959, dancing with that company until 1963, when his work with the First Chamber Dance Quartet became too demanding. He rejoined Ballet Theater in 1970 and danced with the company nine years. With the Graham company, he danced roles that included Tiresias in ''Night Journey,'' the figure of death in ''Clytemnestra'' and the Dark Beloved in ''Deaths and Entrances.'' He was also known for his dancing of Channon, the possessed lover, in Miss Lang's ''Dybbuk.'' Mr. Carter choreographed for many companies in the United States and abroad, among them the Milwaukee Ballet and the Athens Opera and Athens Opera Ballet. He created the ballet for the 1975 film ''In the Rehearsal Room,'' starring Cynthia Gregory and Ivan Nagy. In 1986, Mr. Carter was named acting artistic director of the Rome Opera Ballet, where he served with Vasilis Iracledes, his companion of 19 years. Mr. Carter is survived by a brother, Robert, of Greenville, Tex.

35-> U. of Michigan Selects New President
After an extensive nationwide search, the University of Michigan has chosen as its new president James J. Duderstadt, who is now the school's provost and vice president for academic affairs. Dr. Duderstadt, a former dean of the College of Engineering, will become the university's 11th president on Sept. 1. His nomination ends a year-long search to find a replacement for Harold T. Shapiro, who resigned to become president of Princeton University. Robben W. Fleming, a former president of the University of Michigan, has been interim president since Mr. Shapiro's departure at the beginning of the year. Dr. Duderstadt, 45 years old, who graduated summa cum laude from Yale in 1964, has spent his entire academic career at Michigan. After receiving a master's in engineering science and a doctorate in engineering science and physics from the California Institute of Technology, he came to Michigan in 1969 as an assistant professor of nuclear engineering. He became dean of the college of engineering in 1981 and provost and vice president for academic affairs in 1986. In a suit filed in Michigan Circuit Court last month, The Ann Arbor News, joined by The Detroit Free Press, charged that the university was in violation of the state Open Meetings Act and the Federal Freedom of Information Act because of the secrecy surrounding the presidential search. On May 26, the court held that the university was in compliance of the law, a decision that the newspapers are appealing. The court also ruled that the interview with the final candidate had to be held in public. As a result, Dr. Duderstadt was interviewed by the university's Board of Regents at an open meeting Friday before it voted 6 to 0 to elect him. He spoke about the need in this country for a new model for research universities and stressed that Michigan should take the initiative to develop that model. Dr. Duderstadt, as provost, was involved in the promulgation of a new anti-discrimination code that went into effect last month after a number of racial incidents at the university.

Apple Computer Inc. said today that it had purchased Orion Network Systems Inc., a small company in Berkeley, Calif., that makes software allowing non-I.B.M. computers to communicate over networks with I.B.M. machines. Terms were not disclosed. The purchase, the second one for Apple recently, is part of an effort to sell more Macintosh computers to large corporations by allowing the computers to communicate with those of the International Business Machines Corporation that are already being used in those corporations. In March, Apple bought the Network Innovations Corporation, another small private company that makes data communications products. In a separate matter, Novell Inc., a leading supplier of local area networks that link personal computers, said today that its Netware system would now support Macintosh computers. This will allow Macintoshes to be connected to I.B.M. and other compatible personal computers in companies with the Novell networks. ''The transparent integration of Macintosh and PC's in the office environment allows customers to add value to their data with Macintosh while preserving their existing investment,'' said John Sculley, Apple's chairman.

38-> Review/Film; Childish Tricks and Facial Tics
While it would be impossible to prove scientifically that ''The New Adventures of Pippi Longstocking'' is the longest children's film ever made or Pippi herself the most irritating of characters, it would be difficult to persuade any audience otherwise. Pippi is the freckle-faced, irrepressible heroine with the braids that stick out parallel to her shoulders, and one of the film's only points of interest is the star's hairdo. The angle of those stiffly wired braids varies subtly from scene to scene. ''The New Adventures of Pippi Longstocking,'' which opens today at the Plaza and other theaters, has a cast of players who deliver each line as if they've just received slight electrical shocks, with Tami Erin even more wide-eyed than the others in the title role; a favorite tic of Miss Erin's is the broad wink accompanied by the open-mouthed smile. A pretty, vixenish 13-year-old actress, Miss Erin appears in brightly colored, ragtag outfits featuring baggy bloomers and garters to hold up her trademark stockings. Done up this way, she seems dressed for another type of film altogether. Although Pippi's signal quality is her ability to ignore adult rules of decorum and find free-spirited fun in any pursuit - one of the film's big musical numbers is about washing the floor - the film reduces this to a series of food fights. These play better when they're compressed in the montage that closes the film than they do scattered through the otherwise-uneventful narrative. In any case, such frolicsome scenes and Pippi's way of grinning delightedly at very minor occurrences, like the sight of her pet monkey eating a banana, become grating in a very short time. The film does contain several punchy songs that would sound better in any other context than they do here. The only sparks of wit come from Eileen Brennan, as the story's requisite meanie.

39-> Experimental Treatment Shows Promise for an Enlarged Prostate
An experimental treatment for enlarged prostate glands shows promise as an outpatient alternative to surgery that hospitalizes about 400,000 American men a year, researchers say. An enlarged prostate makes urination difficult by constricting the urinary tract. The experimental procedure widens the narrowed passage by insertion of a balloon, according to one of the researchers, Dr. Flavio Castaneda of the University of Minnesota. Test results show complete or significant resolution of the urination problem in about 80 percent of patients with the most common type of enlargement, Dr. Castaneda said in a recent telephone interview. The half-hour procedure is done with only a local anesthetic and does not require an overnight stay in the hospital, Dr. Castaneda said. Standard surgery requires general anesthesia or a spinal injection that numbs the lower part of the body and a hospital stay of several days. The prostate is a walnut-sized gland that surrounds the urinary passage, the urethra. In older men, the prostate frequently enlarges and exerts pressure on the urethra. The experimental technique was described recently by Dr. Castaneda's colleague, Dr. Wilfrido Castaneda-Zuniga, at a meeting of the Society of Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology in Orlando, Fla. More than 60 patients have been treated with the experimental procedure, balloon urethroplasty, at the University of Minnesota, Dr. Castaneda said. The patient takes a tranquilizer and the urethra is numbed with local anesthetic. A thin, flexible tube with the balloon on its tip is inserted into the penis and guided to the narrowed portion, where the balloon is inflated. For the Minnesota patients, the urination problem was erased or significantly eased in almost 80 percent of cases in which most enlargement was from the side lobes of the prostate, rather than the middle lobe, Dr. Castaneda said. Most patients have predominant enlargement of side lobes, he said. When the main problem was the middle lobe, the success rate dropped to about 30 percent to 40 percent, he said. No recurrence of symptoms has been seen in any patient helped by the procedure, he said, with 48 of them followed for more than six months after the procedure. One patient was followed for three years, he said. Dr. Castaneda said researchers did not know at present how long the relief of the symptoms would last. Abraham Cockett, professor and chairman of the urology department at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York, called the concept interesting. But he said more patients must be studied and for periods longer than a year after the procedure to better assess its effectiveness. Removing prostate tissue with standard surgery relieves symptoms for about 15 years, said Dr. Cockett, who is secretary of the American Urological Association.

41-> Waste Drowns Summer Along the Jersey Shore
Hotel rooms were empty; beaches were deserted; stores were closing early, all prompting plenty of discussion Wednesday night at a crowded meeting of government officials and frustrated business owners. Most of the talk was of Asbury Park, the town to the north where many here believe that the sewage fouling Monmouth County beaches originated. ''We finally had to broaden the focus of our problems because things got so emotional,'' said Alyn Heim, who with his wife, Sally, operates House by the Sea, an inn on the beach here. ''There is plenty of blame to be spread around.'' Environmental officials now say that there is no one source of the pollution that is responsible for the closing of the beaches. But in many shoreline communities, residents are searching for answers to why the pollution occurred and how they can survive the rest of the summer without too much more damage. 'Started Out as a Super Season' ''It started out as a super season, even through July Fourth,'' said Mrs. Heim. ''It was hot, there was no rain, and people were coming and coming.'' Then, beginning July 13, medical waste and fecal bacteria were found and officials began to close beach after beach. On Wednesday, swimmers were allowed back on beaches in Belmar, Spring Lake and Loch Arbour, but bathing is still banned in Asbury Park, Ocean Grove, Bradley Beach and Avon-by-the-Sea. Beaches at Sandy Hook at the Gateway National Recreation area were closed on Wednesday after six syringes and other medical debris were found. Subsequently, the publicity over the beach closings here and in New York caused tourism all along the 127-mile New Jersey shore to decline, residents and officials said. The meeting Wednesday night was called by the Ocean Grove Chamber of Commerce to determine what course of action to take next. After hearing from a lawyer, those participating rejected, at least temporarily, the idea of filing a lawsuit against the operators of the Asbury Park sewage plant that has been blamed in part for the recent spate of beach closings. ''It's not so much a case to use legal avenues as it is to build public awareness,'' said Barry Slott, who represents Save Our Shores, a group that has been fighting for legislation to protect the ocean from dumping and other forms pollution. ''The best thing to do is keep having meetings to build the awareness, then, more pressure can be exerted where it counts.'' Joshua Weinstein, owner of the Ormond, an inn in Ocean Grove, said that a lawsuit appealed to many people but that it would be premature. ''The County Prosecutor has yet to complete an investigation of possible causes, and we realized that there are a lot of laws on the books that are not being enforced,'' said Mr. Weinstein, who is also acting president of the Ocean Grove Chamber of Commerce. Various Sources of Pollution Officials from the State Department of Environmental Protection said a cumulative effect of several sources might be responsible for the pollution. Those sources include discharges from Sylvan Lake in Monmouth County, pollution from storm water runoff and tributaries full after the recent rains, and the Asbury Park sewage treatment plant, which will be replaced beginning Saturday with a new secondary wastewater treatment plant. A spokesman for the state environmental agency, Richard Fulton, said that the possibility of the sewage plant being responsible was ''purely circumstantial,'' and that when the new plant went into operation officials would be better able to determine whether the old plant was the source. The worries of the residents go beyond the immediate decline in tourism. All along the shore, many residents express fears of a long-term effect on beach attendance. ''Many people feel they are the victims of circumstances outside of their control,'' said Gregory Hunt, a co-publisher of The Ocean Grove and Neptune Times. ''So in that sense, it wouldn't be fair if there was a larger effect.'' County Begins Tourism Campaign The worries go beyond Monmouth County, where the pollution has been heaviest. Seaside Heights in Ocean County has not been affected by pollution this year, but Mayor George E. Tompkins said publicity about beach closings had caused such a decline in tourism that he would ask Governor Kean to declare the town a disaster area to get economic aid for merchants. Meanwhile, in Ocean Grove, merchants who would normally be busy serving tourists are instead waiting for customers to come. ''We can never recoup what has been lost,'' said Mr. Heim. ''And we can only hope that the rest of the season can improve.'' The lasting effects also extend beyond the business community. Joan S. Cardinale of West Milford has been coming to Ocean Grove for 56 summers. ''I'm very careful about my trash,'' she said. ''I go out of my way to sort it all out. Then I saw this beach so disgustingly dirty last week. I'm asking myself why bother?''

42-> Three Policemen Are Arrested
Three police officers were arrested yesterday in separate cases on charges that included perjury, illegal drug possession and public lewdness, officials said. In the first case, a 38-year-old officer assigned to 81st Precinct in Brooklyn was arrested and charged with perjury and official misconduct. He was accused of planting a gun on a man and then making a false arrest. A 14-Year Veteran The officer, Larry Torini, a 14-year veteran of the force, was charged in an indictment that was unsealed yesterday after his arrest, according to Louis Haber, a spokesman for Brooklyn District Attorney Elizabeth Holtzman. Officer Torini, who lives in West Babylon, L.I., entered a plea of not guilty at his arraignment before State Supreme Court Justice Philip Lagana, who released the officer on his own recognizance. The man, who became a witness in the case as well as a victim, was not identified. He charged that Officer Torini placed a .22 caliber pistol in his back pocket, then falsely arrested him last Sept. 11, at a public housing building at 995 Myrtle Avenue, in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. Two other witnesses supported the man's testimony, officials said. In the East New York section of Brooklyn last night, a police officer suspended last December for feigning illness was arrested at the corner of Pitkin Avenue and Pine Street after he was seen buying a ''small amount of cocaine,'' according to Sgt. Edward Burns, a police spokesman. The officer, who was still under suspension at the time of his arrest, was identified as Francis Ruggiero. He joined the force in 1983. He was charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance and loitering for the purpose of purchasing drugs. He was held overnight for arraignment. In the third case, a Housing Authority officer was arrested at 11:30 P.M. at 783 East 168th Street in the Morris Heights section of the Bronx. The officer, Thomas Murray, was charged with public lewdness. The police said they acted on a complaint by a woman who said the officer, in plain clothes, exposed himself while sitting in a parked car.

47-> School Basketball; Tolentine Savors Its Finish
A couple of nights ago, somebody asked John Sarandrea, the coach at St. Nicholas of Tolentine, one of the top-rated high-school basketball teams in the nation, what it had been like to coach under the scrutiny and pressure his Wildcats saw this season. ''Pressure? I'll tell you what pressure is,'' said Sarandrea, who besides coaching basketball and teaching history at Tolentine is a New York City fireman. ''Pressure is being awoken out of a deep sleep at 4 o'clock in the morning, jumping on a fire truck and getting to a burning building and seeing fire popping out of the top two floors. You know somebody could be trapped in there or even dead. Now that's pressure.'' Tolentine's season, which was capped by winning the State Federation championship at the civic center here Saturday night, might pale by comparison, but it was still remarkable. To nail down its place as the No. 1 team in the nation, the state and back home in the Bronx, Tolentine had to come to this town halfway between New York City and Montreal and knock off two other Bronx powerhouses: Adlai Stevenson, the Public Schools Athletic League champion, and Our Saviour Lutheran, the defending State Federation champion. Records for Sealy In the semifinal Friday night, Malik Sealy, the 6-foot-7-inch Tolentine center, scored 38 points, grabbed 12 rebounds, had 3 assists and blocked a shot in a 85-54 rout of Stevenson. His 17-for-22 shooting broke the Section A record for field goals set in 1981 by Xaverian's Chris Mullin, who became an all-American at St. John's, where Sealy is going in the fall. In the final Saturday, Sealy dropped to his season average of 21 points, but grabbed 15 rebounds, blocked 2 shots, stole the ball 4 times and had 2 assists. The Wildcats used a balanced attack to overwhelm Our Saviour Lutheran, 95-69. Two Tolentine sophomores, Brian Reese and Adrian Autry, scored 21 and 19 points, respectively. Sealy's 9-for-14 shooting tied Mullin's two-game tournament field-goal record of 26. ''It was good to win the states up here and go out as the number one team in the country, but I was more excited when we beat Molloy, first at their place to open the season and then again for the C.H.S.A.A. championship, because they had always beaten us ever since I had been at the school,'' Sealy said, referring to the Queens high school. ''The way these guys were crying in the locker room last night, you would have thought we had lost by 30 points,'' said Sarandrea. As his team ate breakfast this morning, Sarandrea decided that they should do one more thing together. ''Fellows I think we should all go to Mass because we certainly have a lot to be thankful for,'' he said. So the entire team walked across the street to St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church for Palm Sunday services. Afterward, a deacon shook Sarandrea's hand and said, ''I'll see you next year.'' Sarandrea replied, ''I certainly hope so.''

48-> Ad Campaign Sidesteps the 'O' Word
It's not every corporation that would put together a multimillion-dollar Olympic promotion and then assign it a 10-word name in which the word ''Olympic'' does not appear. But then it's not every company that gets turned down when it seeks to become an official Olympic sponsor and has to go it alone. To put it another way, it's not every company that makes whisky. That, more or less, explains the ''Seagram's Coolers American Team Family Fund Send the Families Program.'' That mouthful means that Joseph E. Seagram & Sons wants to send relatives of more than 500 American athletes to Seoul, South Korea, so they can watch their loved ones perform in the 1988 Summer Games. Actually, the company wants the public to send the relatives to Seoul, or at least pick up most of the projected $2.5 million tab. Although Seagram is putting up $500,000 in seed money and has pledged to make up any shortfall, the promotion is designed as a fund-raising campaign. To make sure its line of wine coolers gets full credit for the gesture, it plans to spend heavily on advertising and promotion. Governing Bodies Go Along In developing the program, Seagram was forced to make individual arrangements with the American governing bodies of various Olympic sports because when it inquired about becoming a corporate sponsor of the entire United States team, the United States Olympic Committee said no. The refusal was partly because as originally proposed, the promotion was not narrowly focused on the company's line of wine coolers but on the company itself, and, by inference, on all of its products, including hard liquor, with which the name Seagram is closely associated. In rejecting the proposal, the U.S.O.C. also expressed concern about an even more explicit promotion the company ran before the 1988 Winter Games. As a sponsor of the United States ski team, it advertised a ''Seagram's Seven Crown Go For the Gold Sweepstakes,'' that focused on the company's flagship brand of whisky. According to John Krimsky Jr., the deputy secretary general of the U.S.O.C., the promotion violated rules established by the International Olympic Committee. The I.O.C. allows tie-ins with beer companies, but in a concession to those who believe that alcohol and athletics shouldn't mix, it bars arrangements with hard-liquor products, even though, as Seagram has been in the forefront of pointing out, standard servings of beer, wine and whisky contain the same amount of alcohol. The Wine Cooler Alternative As it happens, the I.O.C. specifically allows tie-ins with wine coolers, which are blends of wine, carbonated water, sugar and fruit juices and have about half the alcohol content (6 percent) of regular wine. The U.S.O.C. decided to reject any Seagram promotion for 1988, but told the company it would consider establishing wine coolers as an official product category for 1992. In the face of the U.S.O.C. rejection, Seagram changed the promotion to focus on its line of coolers and then approached the national governing bodies of the 29 Olympic sports. It got 23 of them to go along, which means that more than 500 of the 650 or so United States Olympic athletes will be able to designate one family member to receive a free trip to Seoul along with accommodations and living expenses for the two weeks of the Olympics. Whatever the U.S.O.C.'s reservations about embracing wine coolers for 1988, Seagram had no trouble finding luminaries to serve on the program's advisory panel. They include four former Olympians, Bob Mathias, Rafer Johnson, Marty Glickman and Wilma Rudolph, who are being paid to take part in a national tour promoting the campaign, as well as both of Alaska's senators, Frank Murkowski and Ted Stevens, who are serving without fee. They, it turns out, were eager to help Seagram's Olympic promotion because they're doing some Olympic promotion of their own. They want the 1994 Winter Games to be held in Alaska. If, after all its 1988 efforts, Seagram is unable to get the U.S.O.C. to designate wine coolers as an official Olympic product for 1992, the company may have another way to crack the Olympic corporate fraternity without offending those concerned about linking alcohol and athletics. Seagram is in the process of buying Tropicana Products Inc. for $1.2 billion; if all else fails, it could end up with the official orange juice of the 1992 Games.

49-> U.S. Places Car Theft Losses At $29 Billion Over 13 Years
More than 12.3 million cars, trucks, vans and motorcycles valued at $52 billion were stolen over a 13-year period, the Federal Government said today. The Bureau of Justice Statistics, an arm of the Justcice Department, said it had found that about 65 percent of the stolen vehicles were recovered, leaving the losses at an estimated $29 billion in 1985 dollars. The bureau's analysis of its National Crime Surveys for 1973 through 1985 said insurance payments reduced actual losses to vehicle owners to an estimated $16.1 billion. A Drop in Thefts Stu Smith, a bureau spokesman, said the report was based on a new computer analysis of the extensive crime surveys the statistics bureau conducts every six months. He said officials believe the statistics were more accurate than police reports because they were based on actual interviews with people in the households surveyed and covered crimes not reported to the police. Among other things, the analysis showed that the number of thefts per 1,000 registered vehicles fell 33 percent over the surveyed period, from 9 to 6, the bureau concluded in the analysis of its semiannual surveys of more than 40,000 households nationwide. Over the period, the number of estimated vehicle thefts per 1,000 households also declined, by 21 percent, from 13.3 in 1973 to 10.5 in 1985. Most Attempts Unreported In addition to the vehicle thefts in the period, there were an estimated 7 million attempted thefts, said the statistics bureau director, Steven Schlesinger. About 64 percent of those were not reported to the police, he said, and 13 percent of the actual vehicle thefts also went unreported. Half of the thefts involved a loss of $2,455 or more before recoveries and insurance payments. About 10 percent involved losses of $10,000 or more. The vehicle stolen in 76 percent of the cases surveyed was a car. The rest were trucks, vans and motorcycles. Thefts most often took place at night and in parking lots, on the street or near the victim's home. In 7 percent of the thefts, the vehicle was in a garage at home. The most likely to be victimized by car thefts were blacks, Hispanics, households headed by people under age 25, people in multiple-dwelling units, central city residents and low-income households. Those least likely to be victims were people 55 years and older, homeowners and rural residents.

52-> Review/Pop; Leonard Cohen Reflects Darkly On the World
Leonard Cohen occupies a special niche in the roster of composer-performers who achieved prominence in the late 1960's. The singer, poet and guitarist, who played at the Ritz on Tuesday and moved to Carnegie Hall on Wednesday, writes authentically poetic songs whose quasi-Biblical lyrics transform personal experience into the language of sacred myth. Set in an idiosyncratic musical style that partakes of American country, Middle Eastern folk and electronic pop, his songs reflect darkly on mutability and human nature while holding up for worship an idealized vision of feminine tenderness and compassion. The Canadian troubadour is now 53 years old. As he has matured, the world beyond his own mythic imaginings has increasingly impinged on his songs. And his newest album, ''I'm Your Man,'' evokes chaos and cultural disintegration with a tight-lipped humor that has an almost celebratory edge. The album's most direct song, ''Everybody Knows,'' purports to state the brutal facts of contemporary life - that the dice are loaded, that the good guys lost the war, that sex has been despoiled, that everything held sacred is in the process of being blown apart - in jaunty quatrains. Onstage at Carnegie Hall on Wednesday, Mr. Cohen, who bears an eerie resemblance to Dustin Hoffman in his Willy Loman makeup for ''Death of a Salesman,'' presided like an eloquent funeral director at a countercultural wake. Performing with a five-piece band and two backup singers, he interspersed his songs with mordant, carefully worded anecdotes, the spiciest being his recollection of a liaison with Janis Joplin in the Chelsea Hotel 20 years ago. Mr. Cohen sang songs that ranged across the breadth of his career, from ''Suzanne'' to ''Everybody Knows,'' to two versions of his recent song, ''First We Take Manhattan,'' in which the fashion world and drugs are held up as symbols of the terminal decay of New York. But the turning point of the evening was Mr. Cohen's spare voice-and-guitar rendition of ''If It Be Your Will,'' one of his two or three finest meditations. A prayer for mercy murmured to the void by a world wearing ''rags of light all dressed to kill,'' it received a haunting interpretation in Mr. Cohen's sepulchral bass-baritone growl.

53-> Food; FEASTS AGAINST FROST
IT IS A BROMIDE, of course, to say that fresh air - particularly fresh snowy air - fires the flames of hunger. At mealtime on the slopes, the skiers I have observed over the years have been discriminating but unpretentious eaters. They would more willingly savor the joys of a steaming-hot and hearty soup, a selection of cold meats and cheeses with a good crusty loaf of bread and a bottle of robust red wine than the effete likes of truffle-studded foie gras or pearls of caviar. In fact, until recently, ski resorts simply offered large amounts of slightly elevated cafeteria fare, meant to satisfy the appetite but not necessarily the palate. That is changing. From Sun Valley, Idaho, to Vail, Colo., to Stratton Mountain, Vt., restaurants are beginning to cater to a skier's mountainous appetite with flavorful, stylish dishes. One of the finest is the Deer Valley Resort, in Park City, Utah. Even lunch on the slopes ventures from the standard hamburgers and chili to roast leg of lamb, salade composee and homemade bread. Julie Wilson is the 29-year-old chef in charge of the three main kitchens of the 7,000-acre operation. ''All the food I prepare for a skiing clientele is fresh and honest, nothing showy,'' she says. Needless to say, ''We don't go in for the small portions of nouvelle cuisine.'' The skiers at Deer Valley don't seem to care about calories, but Ms. Wilson believes that even hearty food should not be filled with butter and cream. The cold-weather dishes she favors include an uncommon pizza topped with sliced pears and blue cheese, an earthy but refined wild rice and mushroom soup, a casserole of clams and Chinese sausages, and a delectable blend of cornmeal-fried fresh oysters with spinach and the unsmoked Italian bacon known as pancetta. ''Skiing is hearty and clean; it makes you honest,'' says the young chef. ''That's what I try to strive for in my kitchen.'' Ms. Wilson's beginnings as a chef bordered on the comic. After cooking for two summers for a family of 10, she was hired at a place in Southampton, L.I. ''It was all very elegant,'' she says. ''I wore a frilly cook's outfit and my main job was to prepare food for the lapdog, a Chinese pug. I had to put a placemat on the floor to hold his plate and the eggs had to be poached to the proper degree of softness; the toast properly crisp; his milk warmed; things like that.'' By the end of the 1970's, she had decided to pursue cooking professionally, so she enrolled in the prestigious La Varenne cooking school in Paris. After graduation in 1979, she was engaged by a now-defunct restaurant in Salt Lake City called Le Dejeuner as executive chef. ''I'd fallen in love with the terrain,'' she says, so when she learned, in 1980, that a private club and ski resort was going to be built on a high mountain near Salt Lake City, she met with James A. Nassikas, president of the Utah resort and of the Stanford Court Hotel in San Francisco. Her place at Deer Valley was assured. Julie and her 33-year-old husband, Heggie Wilson, are avid skiers. Their favorite outing is a cross-country trek with a backpack holding an avalanche shovel, a rescue beacon and food for picnicking. A typical menu for such an outing includes assorted cheeses, pasta salad, mushroom pate, cold meats, homemade breads, nuts and smoked shellfish. Dessert tends toward fruit, and wines are mostly reds - a Beaujolais, for example, or a Rioja from Spain. CASSEROLE OF CLAMS AND CHINESE SAUSAGES 40 small littleneck clams 1/3 cup each of roasted, thinly julienned sweet yellow and sweet red peppers 2 sweet cured Chinese sausages (lap cheung), available in stores that specialize in Oriental produce 2 tablespoons plus 1 1/2 teaspoons butter 1 teaspoon finely minced garlic 1 cup finely chopped scallions 1 cup dry white wine 1/2 cup fresh or bottled clam juice. 1. Rinse the clams and drain well. Prepare the pepper strips and set aside. 2. Cut each sausage on the bias into quarter-inch-thick slices. There should be about one-half cup. 3. Heat two tablespoons of the butter in a heavy casserole and add the sausage, garlic and half the scallions. Cook, stirring, about one minute and add the wine and clam juice. Cook over moderately high heat about two minutes or until the liquid is reduced to about one and a third cups. Add the clams and pepper strips. Cover closely and cook three to five minutes. As each clam opens up, remove it. If the cooking liquid has evaporated excessively, add a bit of water. Swirl in the remaining butter. Put the clams in a shallow serving dish and pour the sauce over all. Sprinkle with the remaining scallions. Yield: Four appetizer servings. CORNMEAL-FRIED OYSTERS WITH MUSTARD SAUCE 16 large oysters 1 cup oyster liquor or a blend of oyster liquor and clam broth 1/4 cup finely chopped shallots 1/4 cup white-wine vinegar 2 teaspoons finely minced garlic 1 cup dry white wine 3/4 cup heavy cream 1/3 cup Dijon-style mustard 6 tablespoons cold butter 1 cup cornmeal, preferably stone ground, available in health-food stores Salt to taste, if desired Freshly ground pepper to taste 1 1/2 teaspoons paprika 1/2 teaspoon chili powder 1 cup vegetable oil. Spinach with pancetta ( see recipe). 1. The oysters may be shucked at home or by the fish dealer, reserving the liquor. If there is less than a cup of liquor, add enough clam broth to make a cup. 2. Combine the shallots, vinegar, garlic, oyster liquor and wine in a saucepan. Bring to the boil and cook 45 minutes or more, until the liquid is reduced to about a third of a cup. Add the cream. Bring to the simmer and cook about 20 minutes, until reduced to one cup. 3. Stir in the mustard and bring to the simmer. Add the butter in small pieces, stirring rapidly with a wire whisk. Line a bowl with a sieve, preferably of the sort known in French kitchens as a chinois. Strain the sauce, pressing with the back of a spoon to extract as much flavor as possible from the solids. There should be about one cup of strained sauce. Set the saucepan in a bowl of simmering water to keep it hot. 4. Blend the cornmeal, salt, pepper, paprika and chili powder in a shallow dish. Dredge each oyster in the mixture and shake off the excess. 5. Heat the oil in a skillet and add the oysters without crowding. Cook, turning the oysters, one to two minutes depending on the size of the oysters. Do not overcook. As they are cooked, transfer the oysters to paper towels to drain. 6. Divide the spinach with pancetta among four plates. Spoon the sauce to one side of the spinach and arrange four cooked oysters on the sauce. Yield: Four servings. SPINACH WITH PANCETTA 1 1/4 pounds spinach in bulk or 3/4 pound spinach packaged in plastic 2/3 cup (about 1/4 pound) small cubes of pancetta, unsmoked Italian bacon, available in Italian food shops, or use smoked lean bacon 1 small red onion, peeled Salt to taste, if desired Freshly ground pepper to taste 1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice. 1. Rinse the spinach well and drain it. Remove tough stems, center membranes and blemished leaves. There should be about 10 cups reasonably well-packed. Break the spinach into two-inch pieces 2. Heat the pancetta in a skillet and cook until rendered of fat. 3. Cut the onion into quarters. Cut each quarter crosswise into the thinnest possible slices. Add the onion pieces to the pancetta in the skillet. Add the spinach and cook, stirring, until it is wilted. Add salt, pepper and lemon juice and cook about one minute. Serve immediately. Yield: Four servings. WILD RICE AND MUSHROOM SOUP 2 cups dried imported mushrooms, such as morels, chanterelles or porcini, about 3 ounces 5 tablespoons butter 1/4 cup finely minced garlic 2 cups finely chopped leeks 1/3 cup flour 1/2 cup dry white wine 4 cups fresh or canned chicken broth Salt to taste, if desired 3/4 cup wild rice 6 ounces fresh mushrooms, preferably shiitake, although cultivated mushrooms may be used; thinly sliced, about 3 cups 1/2 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 teaspoon dry Sherry wine Freshly ground pepper to taste #1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh thyme leaves, or use half the amount dried. 1. Put the dried mushrooms in a mixing bowl and add eight cups of lukewarm water. Let soak for 30 minutes or longer. When the mushrooms are softened, massage them to extract any sand or soil, then squeeze them dry. Set aside, reserving the soaking liquid. Line a sieve with a double thickness of cheesecloth and strain the soaking liquid through it. There should be about seven cups. Set aside. 2. Meanwhile, heat two tablespoons of the butter in a four-quart kettle or casserole and add the garlic and leeks. Cook, stirring often, about five minutes. Do not brown. 3. Coarsely chop the soaked dried mushrooms and add them to the kettle. Sprinkle with the flour and cook over low heat, stirring often, about five minutes. Stir briskly from the bottom to prevent sticking. Add the wine, chicken broth and reserved soaking liquid. Simmer, uncovered, about an hour and 10 minutes. There should be about 9 1/2 cups of soup. 4. Meanwhile, heat two tablespoons of the butter in a saucepan and add one and a half cups of water. Bring to the boil and add the salt and rice. Cover closely and cook 50 minutes, or until the rice has absorbed most of the liquid and is tender. 5. Strain the soup, reserving both liquids and solids. Put the solids into the container of a food processor or electric blender and blend thoroughly, then return them to the kettle and add the strained-off liquid. 6. Heat the remaining tablespoon of butter in a skillet and add the sliced fresh mushrooms. Cook about one minute, stirring. Stir in the lemon juice and Sherry. Add the sliced mushrooms and wild rice to the soup. Add salt and pepper to taste. Sprinkle with thyme. There should be about 10 cups of soup. Yield: Eight to 10 servings. BLUE CHEESE AND PEAR PIZZA The Pizza Dough 1 1/2 cups lukewarm water 2 teaspoons granular yeast 1 teaspoon dark brown sugar 3/4 cup rye flour 2 3/4 cups, approximately, all-purpose flour, plus enough for rolling out dough Salt to taste, if desired 1 tablespoon olive oil Oil for greasing a bowl The topping: 4 firm, ripe, unblemished pears, about half a pound each 1/2 lemon Cornmeal for sprinkling on tin 2 1/4 cups grated Gruyere cheese 1 1/3 cups crumbled blue cheese 1/4 cup melted butter, approximately. 1. Put the water in a warm bowl and sprinkle the yeast and brown sugar on top. Stir to dissolve and set aside. 2. Combine the rye flour, all-purpose flour, salt and olive oil in a mixing bowl and blend well. Add the yeast mixture and blend. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board and knead about 10 minutes. The dough should not be sticky. Add a litle more flour if necessary. 3. Shape the dough into a ball. Lightly oil the inside of a mixing bowl, place the dough in it and cover closely with a sheet of clear plastic wrap. Let the dough stand in a reasonably warm place until it is doubled in bulk, 45 minutes to an hour. Punch the dough down, shape into a ball and return it to a clean, lightly oiled bowl. Let stand again until doubled in bulk, 30 minutes or so. 4. Meanwhile, peel the pears and rub them with the lemon to prevent discoloring. Cut the pears in half lengthwise and remove the cores with a melon-ball cutter. Cut the pear halves into the thinnest possible slices. There should be about six cups. 5. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees. 6. Punch the dough down and divide it into thirds. Roll out each third into a 10- to 11-inch circle. Sprinkle three pizza tins or baking sheets lightly with cornmeal and place a circle of dough on each. 7. Arrange a first layer of pear slices close together in concentric circles on each round, leaving a margin of about one inch from the outer rim of dough. Scatter a third of the grated Gruyere over each. Cover with a slightly smaller portion of pear slices and sprinkle with crumbled blue cheese. Brush the rim of each pizza with melted butter. 8. Place the pizzas on a rack in the oven and bake 10 to 12 minutes. Yield: Six to 12 appetizer servings.

54-> Authorities in Burma Round Up Dissidents
The Burmese authorities seized more than 10 critics of the Government and the Burmese correspondent of The Associated Press, Western diplomats contacted in Rangoon, the Burmese capital, said today. The diplomats said it appeared that the regime's most vocal and prominent critic, 70-year-old retired Brig. Aung Gyi, was among those rounded up in the nighttime sweep Friday night and this morning. Mr. Aung Gyi, a former supporter of U Ne Win, the dictator who announced his retirement last week, had written a series of letters critical of economic and political conditions in Burma. The Government made no official announcement about the seizures, which follow the ruling party's election this week of U Sein Lwin as its chairman and as Burma's President. Mr. Sein Lwin is regarded as a hard-liner on dissent. The diplomats, contacted by telephone from Bangkok, said the Associated Press correspondent, Sein Win, was taken from his home in the northern suburbs of Rangoon by the authorities at around midnight Friday. Mr. Sein Win, former publisher of the English-language Guardian newspaper, was jailed for three years in the 1960's in connection with his journalistic activities. On Friday, students shouted slogans and put posters with anti-Government phrases on the Shwedagon Pagoda, Burma's holiest Buddhist shrine. There were no reports of violence or confrontation with the authorities.

55-> SPORTS PEOPLE; Indoor Soccer Woes
The Major Indoor Soccer League, which lost two more franchises yesterday to reduce its membership to seven teams, will begin discussions next week to determine the future of the league, Commissioner Bill Kentling said. The Tacoma Stars and the Chicago Sting, who failed to post a $400,000 letter of credit by the deadline yesterday, joined the St. Louis Steamers and the Minnesota Strikers, who ended operations two weeks ago. The San Diego Sockers, who also failed to post a letter of credit, were on the verge of going under after the team's principal owner withdrew his offer to buy the club out of bankruptcy after Tacoma and Chicago folded. United States Bankruptcy Judge Peter Bowie granted the Sockers at least another 48 hours of life yesterday by issuing a preliminary injunction barring the M.I.S.L. from terminating the franchise for failing to post the letter of credit.

56-> Reviews/Music; Sibelius Quartet, From Finland, In a New Work
Vladimir Agopov, a Ukrainian composer who teaches in Finland, recently delivered a new string quartet to his colleagues of the Sibelius Academy Quartet. They in turn brought the piece - Mr. Agopov's second in the genre - to listeners at the Merkin Concert Hall Thursday night. It is interesting and affecting music - impressionistic, although the impressions are not of scenes or moods but more about the techniques of composition itself. Thus the first movement promises a slow contrapuntal unfolding (one thinks of the Beethoven C sharp minor Quartet or early Bartok), but the promises are not fulfilled. Contrapuntal lines start to build, then crumble into a haze rich and evocative in its own, unexpected way. The quick middle movement has surprises, too. It is brief and eccentric, like a perpetual motion machine that has wobbled off its axis. Mr. Agopov's quartet draws from a Romantic tradition, which he manages both to use and to keep at arm's length. One of the unspoken operating methods of the First New York International Festival of the Arts has been to cast a vast net over the whole of contemporary art and hope that a few interesting fish will be landed. This piece is one of them. Elsewhere, the Sibelius players roared through the Ravel Quartet with a plump, dark tone more Brahmsian (or perhaps Sibelian) than French. They are competent technicians and a little less than virtuosos. Indeed, lots of international quartets could have played the fast movement's of Sibelius's ''Voces intimae'' more precisely than they. But what they do is in a well-tuned, thoughtful spirit of cooperation. It is a satisfying group. Merkin Hall, relatively small, is a wonderful space for string quartet sound but seldom used as such. Perhaps it is a matter of economics. Nearby Alice Tully Hall accommodates more than twice as many ticket buyers (about 1,100) but at a sacrifice of musical intimacy. Merkin listeners in summer, however, must bear the cost of humming air-conditioning, which soothed the burning flesh on Thursday but lay sodden on the ears.

58-> More Beaches Are Shut but Cause Is in Doubt
Amid reports of medical waste washing ashore for a third day, 15 more miles of ocean beaches in New York City and on Long Island were closed to swimming yesterday, and it appeared likely that they would remain closed for part of the weekend. But Federal and state investigators said yesterday that the wastes that had closed about 25 miles of ocean beaches on Long Island and kept tens of thousands of bathers away since Wednesday did not appear to be hospital wastes, but rather seemed to be common household and boating garbage and probably did not constitute a major health hazard. Disagreement and confusion marked the third day of the episode as sharply differing evaluations of the dangers were offered by Federal, state and local officials. [ Page 30. ] Some beaches were reopening even as others were being closed for the first time and thousands of bathers were wondering about the extent of the danger, if any. Rockaways Beaches Closed The seven-mile beach along the Rockaway Peninsula in Queens was closed to bathers for the first time by the New York City Health and Parks Commissioners after authorities found nine syringes and a vial containing red fluid. About eight miles of Long Island beaches in the town of Babylon were closed for the first time yesterday, either in response to new findings of what appeared to be medical wastes or as a precaution. In addition, Tobay Beach and six small Fire Island beaches were closed, as they had been on Thursday. Another 10 miles of beaches on Long Island - Jones Beach and Robert Moses State Park - were closed to swimmers in the morning and reopened in the afternoon as lifeguards and health officials searching the surf late in the day found no new traces of syringes, bandages, vials of red fluid or other wastes. As temperatures climbed into the 90's and forecasters predicted a sweltering weekend that would beckon beachgoers to the shimmering sands of the South Shore, the signals from health and environmental officials were conflicting, with some officials cautiously imposing swimming bans and others arguing that the facts and fears had been exaggerated. Federal environmental officials, after examining all the refuse found on 25 miles of Long Island beaches since Wednesday, said it amounted to a total of three dozen needles of a type that might be used by a diabetic to inject insulin, three blood vials, one piece of plastic tubing and half of an old prescription bottle. ''We don't believe this is a medical or hospital-type washup,'' said William J. Muszynski, the deputy regional administrator of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency. He noted that fears had been raised last month when vials of blood that washed up on the New Jersey shore had been found to contain traces of the AIDS virus; he said those fears were renewed by the findings of recent days and exaggerated news reports. Crack Vials, Popsicle Sticks August V. Sellitto, an assistant United States Attorney in Brooklyn who has been investigating, said: ''It appears less and less likely that we are talking about hospital waste. A lot of it was household waste. A number of crack vials were found. There are millions of crack vials in this city.'' Mr. Sellitto said that much of the refuse had simply been mistaken for medical waste. Popsicle sticks were mistaken for tongue-depressors, a carpenter's mask was thought to be a surgical mask and a pair of household rubber gloves used by a lifeguard to pick up wastes from the beach were taken for surgical gloves, he said. Madeline Lewis of the State Department of Environmental Conservation, which is seeking the source of the wastes, said: ''Part of it is people were jumping to conclusions before the evidence was in. The material that was recovered would not fill one shopping bag.'' The Federal and state officials were not critical of local officials for ordering the beaches closed. ''People are very concerned,'' Ms. Lewis said. ''I think there is a tendency to overreact. But I think that the most important thing is to make certain that the health and safety of the people who use the beaches are assured.'' Hospitals Must Label Bags At Mayor Koch's behest, the city's Sanitation Commissioner, Brendan Sexton, issued emergency regulations yesterday requiring 89 hospitals whose waste is picked up by the city to bag it with labels identifying the hospital. The order will also apply to clinics and other medical facilities. Mr. Sexton asked the State Health Commissioner, Dr. David Axelrod, to issue similar regulations covering 27 other hospitals in the city whose refuse is picked up by private carters. Mr. Sexton said hospitals that failed to comply would have their collections suspended. Some city hospitals already label their refuse. There were other calls yesterday for regulations governing medical wastes. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, joined New Jersey's Democratic Senators, Bill Bradley and Frank R. Lautenberg, in pledging legislation to require Federal environmental officials to create a program to track infectious wastes. The judgments of the state and Federal officials that the wastes probably did not come from hospitals or seem hazardous were given in telephone interviews late in the day, and authorities on Long Island who had closed beaches earlier were unaware of them. Commissioners Defend Actions Early last night, the views of the state and Federal officials were described to the New York City Health Commissioner, Dr. Stephen C. Joseph, and the city's Commissioner of Parks and Recreation, Henry J. Stern. Commissioner Stern referred questions to Dr. Joseph, who said he disagreed with the state and Federal officials, insisted that the waste did appear to be of medical origin and defended his decision to close the beaches. ''I think that we can assume that, if we're picking up syringes and blood vials, that's definitely medical waste,'' he said. The results of tests to determine if the red fluid was actually blood will not be available until after the weekend, but he added, ''It's probable that it's not ketchup.'' Dr. Joseph had said earlier that ''this medical waste is apparently a portion of that which has recently washed ashore on Long Island and has been moving from east to west.'' Pollution Hotlines Opened On Wednesday, beaches on Long Island, including Jones Beach and Robert Moses State Park, were closed. On Thursday, 10 miles of beach on the western end of Fire Island were closed to swimmers and sunbathers. Yesterday, the Rockaway beaches were closed to swimmers, but not to sunbathers, in two stages, the eastern part in the morning and the western in the late afternoon. Commissioners Stern and Joseph said they would be on the Rockaways beach at Beach 86th Street at 7:45 A.M. today to re-evaluate the situation. The Parks Department opened a hotline, (212) 397-3131, for information on the beaches, and the Health Department asked anyone sighting of medical wastes and other pollutants to call (212) 340-4494. Dr. Joseph stressed that the principal danger of medical wastes was in being cut by infectious materials, such as by stepping on syringes or broken glass vials in the shallows. AIDS Highly Unlikely The chances are ''very, very small'' of being infected with the AIDS virus, even if it should be present in a blood vial, Dr. Joseph said. ''You need a significant injection to be infected with AIDS, and AIDS is a very fragile virus - it doesn't survive in salt water.'' The risk of hepatitis is higher, he said, because the virus is ''more robust.'' About 18,000 people used the Rockaway beaches yesterday, according to a Parks Department estimate, but most were on the western end that was not closed until late in the day.

59-> Boxing; Starling Is Stopped
It was a night of strange endings. In the final bout of a welterweight title doubleheader, Marlon Starling, the World Boxing Association champion, lost his crown to Tomas Molinares of Barranquilla, Colombia, when Starling was counted out after the bell in the fifth round of a 12-round bout. Joe Cortez, the referee, ruled that the right-hand punch by Molinares was in motion before the bell sounded and therefore legal. Larry Hazzard, the New Jersey boxing commissioner, supported the referee, saying that the punch may have landed ''a fraction of a second after the bell'' but that Molinares's punch started before the bell. However, when Ross Greenburg of Home Box Office, which televised the bout, replayed the sequence, the tape seemed to show that Molinares's punch started after the bell sounded. Honeyghan Retains Title In the night's other feature bout, Lloyd Honeyghan of London retained his World Boxing Council title when his opponent, Yungkil Chung of Seoul, South Korea, was unable to get to his feet in the five-minute recovery period allowed after a fighter is struck an unintentional low blow. Honeyghan was announced as the winner by a technical knockout at 42 seconds of the fifth round of that scheduled 12-rounder. Michael Buffer, the ring announcer, told the crowd that by New Jersey rules a fighter hit by an unintentional low blow cannot win a fight by disqualification. Through four rounds, Honeyghan was ahead on the scorecards of all three judges. The ringside physician, Dr. Frank Doggett, entered the ring with an icepack after Chung was struck. When the 5 minutes passed, the bout was declared over and Chung was helped to his corner. Booing followed, and supporters of Chung rushed to ringside shouting angrily. Honeyghan, 28 years old, has a 33-1 record with 22 knockouts. Chung drops to 25-4-2 with 17 knockouts. Slight Ankle Sprain Starling, of Hartford, dropped sideways to the canvas when he was hit by the controversial right-hand blow of Molinares. He rolled onto his back and apparently injured a leg. As Starling was carried from the ring on a stretcher, he asked reporters if he had been counted out. When he was told he had been, he said -very much surprised - ''I was?'' Starling was taken by ambulance to Atlantic City Medical Center, where a preliminary examination disclosed a slight sprain of the right ankle. Mort Sharnik, Starling's adviser, said that his fighter would protest the decision. Going into the last round of the bout, Starling was ahead on two scorecards, with the third judge having the bout even. Molinares's record is 23-0 with 20 knockouts. Starling falls to 42-5-1.

60-> Mets Run Into Caution Signs
For the Mets, the omens weren't good: The Houston Astros hadn't beaten Dwight Gooden in four years and hadn't beaten anybody in five games, so they were probably coiled and dangerous. And, sure enough, they broke both streaks tonight. They nailed Gooden for 10 hits and four runs in six innings, and beat him for only the second time in his career and the first time since May 6, 1984, when he was a rookie. And they finished the job by beating the Mets, 4-2, in a tour de force of four-hit, offspeed pitching by Bob Knepper. ''He just outpitched me,'' Gooden said later. ''I've got to tip my hat to him. I didn't have any rhythm early in the game. Maybe I didn't warm up long enough. But he outpitched me.'' Swinging at Bad Pitches ''Doc pitched well enough to win,'' Dave Johnson said, ''but the other guy was outstanding. That's his type of game. He makes you swing at bad pitches.'' This was a return match for Gooden and Knepper. Last Saturday night in New York, they met with different results. Knepper was gone after five innings, Gooden went the full nine and won the game. Since then, both have been named to the National League team for the All-Star Game next Tuesday night. Gooden will arrive with 11 victories and five defeats; Knepper with nine victories and two defeats. ''If Knepper can throw the way he did tonight,'' Gooden said, speculating on who would start the big game, ''he should get the ball.'' High-Risk Situations Knepper did his best throwing in two high-risk situations when the Mets had two men on base and Kevin McReynolds batting. In the fifth inning, McReynolds hit a lusty drive to deep center field for the third out, and later learned that he did it with a cracked bat. But in the seventh, he swung a solid bat and struck out on a tantalizing change-up. ''That's all he does, change speeds,'' McReynolds said. ''He doesn't throw hard. He changes speeds off his change of speed.'' The Astros started with a run in the first inning after Bill Doran singled with one down and took second when a balk was called on Gooden for not stopping in his motion. Gooden struck out Terry Puhl for the second out, but went to two balls and no strikes on Glenn Davis, who lined the next pitch to center for a single and a 1-0 lead. In the second, they attacked with three hits for two more runs, starting with a double to the left-field wall by Rafael Ramirez and a walk to Craig Biggio. Then, again with two down, Gooden was stung when Gerald Young lined a single to left, and Ramirez scored from second, sliding home in a photo finish with a strong throw from McReynolds. Umpire 'Rules' on Scoreboard The Mets argued the call, but lost, and then came one of those signs of the electronic times. The video scoreboard in center field showed a rerun of the play. So Terry Tata, the home-plate umpire, went to the Houston dugout and telephoned the scoreboard operators to tell them not to show controversial plays. Then Doran followed with a single to center, and this time Biggio scored from second and the Mets trailed by three. Now it was catch-up time and the Mets responded in the third when Kevin Elster led with a triple into the right-field corner. Gooden, with 11 hits this season, obliged by lining out to right and Elster tagged and scored. It was the ninth run batted in for Gooden, the most for any pitcher in the big leagues. Two innings later, Dave Magadan opened with a double, Elster singled and Mookie Wilson grounded out for another run, bringing the Mets within one. But that was as close as they came. In the home fifth, Terry Puhl singled and stole second and crossed with two down when Buddy Bell singled behind second base for a 4-2 lead for the revived Astros. Myers Doesn't Mind No, Randy Myers said, wincing at the thought, he didn't mind not being named for the All-Star Game next Tuesday. He could always go home to Vancouver, Wash., and look at the mountains for three days. Myers had one of the best relief-pitching records in baseball in the first half of the season: 5 victories, no losses, 13 games saved and an earned run average of 1.26, plus 36 strikeouts in 35 innings. But he was not one of the eight pitchers named by Whitey Herzog of the St. Louis Cardinals, the manager of the National League team. Only two relief pitchers made it: Todd Worrell of the Cardinals and Mark Davis of the San Diego Padres. ''I would have been honored to make it,'' Myers said. ''I guess it means if the Cardinals got the bases loaded, Whitey would rather face me than Mark Davis.''

61-> Continental vs. the Labor Unions: A View From the Cockpit
To the Editor: As a Continental Airlines pilot, I congratulate you on your editorial ''Bushwhacking Texas Air'' (April 15). It was gratifying to see you expose the innuendo, half-truths and political-arm twisting that Eastern Air Lines' labor unions have utilized in their public relations war with Texas Air's management, a strategy that not only endangers Eastern's health but also threatens the livelihood of nearly 40,000 Continental Airlines employees. What did Continental do to deserve this attack from the union bosses? We survived. We survived their first attempt five years ago to put Frank Lorenzo, Texas Air's chairman, out of business by sacrificing our jobs. Now, using the same, tired scare tactics, the union bosses are willing to sacrifice the jobs of thousands of dedicated Eastern employees in order to insulate union members at Eastern's competitors from the realities of a deregulated airline industry. I'd like to discuss the safety issues from the perspective of a Texas Air pilot who is willing to take credit for his comments and not hide behind a veil of anonymity. Never during my career at Continental have I or anyone with whom I've shared the cockpit been asked or pressured to fly an aircraft we felt was in any way unsafe. To the contrary, we are required to assure the airworthiness of our aircraft before each flight. Not only is this good safety policy, it's also good business. Eastern's unions strain credibility when they assert that Texas Air believes the best way to run a profitable airline is to run an unsafe airline. Unsupported allegations about safety procedures make great headlines, but they insult the professionalism of the 5,000 former People Express, Frontier, New York Air and Continental pilots and others who make up Continental's pilot force. Combined, they bring to Continental a safety record and tradition of excellence that our detractors in the Air Line Pilots Association would do well to emulate. Those of us at Continental who choose not to be represented by the national unions are used to, and welcome, scrutiny. It means that we must be a cut above the rest in order to survive. The A.L.P.A. exposed its real goals in hearings this month before the National Mediation Board with a bid to have the Texas Air companies designated as a single carrier. Recently the association amended its bylaws to deny membership to anyone who has participated in ''strikebreaking'' activities. This would disenfranchise 2,500 Continental pilots whose only strikebreaking activities have consisted of refusing to sacrifice careers to protect our competitors' cost structures. The A.L.P.A. thereby hopes to gain a free hand to place Continental pilots at the bottom of a combined seniority list, thus risking our jobs for years of losses at Eastern that predate Texas Air by a decade. We at Continental hope the mediation board will consider that Continental's pilots voted to remove the A.L.P.A. three years ago, and that various Continental employee groups have rebuffed repeated organizing attempts by the very same unions that now tell the board we need the unions to protect us from Mr. Lorenzo. As for the future, this Continental employee wants his counterparts at Eastern to know he is not unlike them and most other American workers. I am ready to fight for fair compensation industry-wide. Where I part company with the Eastern unions is that I am willing to work for better pay and benefits in a way that assures me a company from which to retire. I wish my counterparts at Eastern success in making their company viable for the long term. In the meantime we at Continental will be working hard to make our airline the traveler's choice.

62-> Lilco Accord Facing Foes; Unanimity Is Ending Over Shoreham Issue
On Monday, Governor Cuomo endorsed ending his battle over the Shoreham nuclear power plant by negotiating with the Long Island Lighting Company to abandon the $5.3 billion plant. The next day, Lilco's chairman, Dr. William J. Catacosinos, called a settlement the best way to end the ''uncertainty'' surrounding the utility, adding that his talks with New York State officials could ''put to bed an issue that has plagued our community for more than 20 years.'' But the unanimity is soon to end. Key members of the Suffolk County Legislature have scheduled a news conference on Thursday to announce their opposition to the settlement under discussion. Intense Opposition ''We are going to blast the settlement from one end of Suffolk County to the other,'' said Wayne Prospect, a Democratic legislator from Huntington, who has been instrumental in the Shoreham fight. The key problem now facing state officials is to find a way to insure that a settlement that would close Shoreham in return for allowing Lilco to remain an independent, investor-owned utility survives the intense opposition of the people who have so far managed to stop the plant from operating and who want a public takeover of Lilco. Only Two Choices To do so, state officials say they will argue that at this point Long Island faces only two choices: Lilco can receive a fair price for abandoning the Shoreham plant, or it is likely to succeed within a few months in its years-long fight for an operating license for Shoreham. Lilco, in seeking a license, has made what it calls a ''realism argument'' that in a nuclear emergency, county and state officials who have refused to participate in emergency planning would, in fact, help. But in making their argument, state officials look back to an order last December by the State Public Service Commission, which suggested that Lilco would never abandon Shoreham if doing so led to its bankruptcy. ''This,'' one state official said, ''is the realism argument.'' Although a full-power license is still months away, concern is growing that the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission is preparing to grant Lilco approval to run the plant at 25 percent of power. Until now, Shoreham has only operated at 5 percent of its 809-megawatt capacity. Although negotiators for the state and Lilco have yet to reach a settlement, they have agreed on several key details, including that under the plan Lilco would sell the Shoreham plant to the state for $1, in return for assurances of additional generating capacity and guaranteed rate increases of 5 percent for three years. Under the settlement, Lilco would be returned to an investment-grade utility, with its investors regaining partial dividends on their common and preferred stock by 1989. Completed in 1983 The Shoreham plant was completed in 1983 but has yet to receive an operating license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission because of the refusal by the state and Suffolk County to cooperate in preparing an emergency evacuation plan. In 1983, the impasse over the plant brought Lilco close to bankruptcy and the utility has not paid any dividends since mid-1984. Proponents of a settlement argue that it is the best way to resolve the main questions surrounding Shoreham: how to close the plant while still insuring an adequate energy supply and reasonable electric rates. ''Clearly, no matter which way you go,'' said Richard M. Kessel, the executive director of the State Consumer Protection Board and one of Governor Cuomo's key Shoreham advisers, ''there are going to be increasing electric rates on Long Island.'' ''No one is happy with this,'' said Mr. Kessel, who is also a member of the Long Island Power Authority and a longtime Shoreham opponent. ''The Governor is not happy with this. I'm not happy with this. But the sooner we guarantee the closing of Shoreham and we set reasonable rates for Long Island, then the better off we'll be. We can then move forward.'' Much More Costly But the state's opponents on the issue contend that the settlement under discussion would be terribly expensive, much more costly than a takeover of Lilco by the Long Island Power Authority, which has made a $7.85 billion offer to purchase the utility. ''From what I have seen,'' said Stephen Liss, a member of the power authority and q Lilco opponent, ''every indication is that it is monstrously more expensive than a takeover.'' According to a letter being circulated in Albany by Assemblyman Paul E. Harenberg, the original sponsor of the legislation that created the Long Island Power Authority, objections to the deal include Lilco's receiving a full return on its Shoreham investment, plus a profit, and the calculation that the settlement would bring Lilco's market value to about $18 a share. The state's settlement would therefore exceed the plan of the power authority, which has offered $12 for each of Lilco's 110 million common shares. 'Very Difficult to Defend' Maurice Barbash, the chairman of Citizens to Replace Lilco, the powerful grass-roots organization that is credited with beginning the movement that led to the creation of the power authority, was infuriated by his understanding of details of the agreement. ''I don't think this is going to hold water,'' he said. ''It will be very easy to shoot it out of the water. Governor Cuomo is going to find it very difficult to defend this.'' But amid the growing firestorm of criticism, some longtime Shoreham opponents who have not been involved in the negotiations are adopting the Governor's philosophy. ''From what I know of the settlement, the rates would be competitive,'' said Leon J. Campo, a powerful leader of the anti-Shoreham forces and a power authority trustee. ''Our crucial objective - closing Shoreham - would still be met.'' Adopting military parlance, Mr. Campo said winning the war over Shoreham through a public acquisition of Lilco would represent an ''unconditional surrender.'' The Governor's approach, he said, ''is also to win the war, but through a conditional surrender.''

64-> YACHTING; Regatta Is for Yacht Clubs to Enter
A different kind of regatta has surfaced on the West Coast. The event downplays the superstars of the sport in favor of the yacht clubs that have produced them. The purpose of the United States Yacht Club Challenge is to find the best yacht club out of the 2,000 in the nation. A selection committee began compiling data last October, and settled on 12 finalists. Among them are the Larchmont Yacht Club of Larchmont, N.Y., and the Manhasset Bay Yacht Club of Port Washington, L.I. Each of the 12 finalists is expected to send a team of eight crewmen to Newport Beach, Calif., April 6-10 for the third biennial United States Yacht Club Challenge. Bill Ficker, a former America's Cup skipper who was chairman of the nine-member selection committee, said recently that a point system was used to decide the results. Among the factors considered were: the yacht racing achievements of each club; the number of major regattas each has organized; the kind of facilities at each club, and the youth programs they sponsor. The first of the biennial yacht club challenges was sailed in 1984. The event, sponsored by Rolex Watch U.S.A. and organized by the Newport Harbor Yacht Club, appears to be gaining in stature as it matures. Ficker said the club doesn't want sailing superstars at the helm for fear they would overshadow the character of the event. In 1986, for example, Dennis Conner participated, but he sailed as a navigator instead of a yacht skipper. The rules prohibit anyone from competing as skipper who has won the America's Cup, the Congressional Cup, or an Olympic class world championship. The teams race in identical Shock 35 sloops. Other clubs selected to compete this year are: the Balboa Yacht Club, the California Yacht Club, the San Diego Yacht Club, the Long Beach Yacht Club, the Newport Harbor Yacht Club, and the St. Francis Yacht Club, all from California; the Bayview Yacht Club of Michigan; the Bay-Waveland Yacht Club of Mississippi; the Chicago Yacht Club of Illinois, and the Eastern Yacht Club of Massachusetts. Sailors in northwestern Montana have found a way to bridge the gap of winter and summer. As sportsmen, they are unwilling to ignore the last powder skiing of winter at Big Mountain near Whitefish. But they're also ready to begin sailing on the 35-mile long Flathead Lake at Bigfork. Acknowledging that it is possible to do both, the locals are planning for the start next week of the fourth annual North American ski-yachting championship. ''It's the best time of year for wind here,'' said Garry Jones, chairman of the event. ''I'm open for some real gang-buster winds. There's no ice on Flathead Lake. It's wide open.'' In 1985, the first year for the Montana regatta, the lake was solid with ice until a few days before racing was to begin. The event this year is scheduled for April 6-9.

65-> Army Rethinks Plan for a Utah Test Site
The Army has decided to reconsider its plan to build a laboratory in Utah for testing defenses against biological weapons. The decision came after a week marked by increasingly intense local opposition. Longtime opponents to the proposed laboratory at the Dugway Proving Ground, about 70 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, have been joined in recent weeks by Utah scientists, the Governor, who is a Republican, and a Democrat who represents the district in Congress. On Friday the conservative Republican Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah joined the opponents, calling the Army's approach ''reckless endangerment.'' The Dugway laboratory is meant to give the Army a tightly sealed facility where aerosols of organisms that could be used in weapons can be tested against possible defenses. The planned research is to be defensive because the United States has pledged not to develop or possess biological weapons. For years opponents have forced delays in the plan to build the $5.3 million laboratory, which would be designed to meet the strictest requirements for containment for biological laboratories in the United States. In February the military published an environmental study declaring that the facility can be built with little if any risk of accidentally spreading deadly viruses, toxins or bacteria. Army Surprised by Fight Despite the history of resistance, the military appears to have been surprised by the vigorous opposition that coalesced so swiftly. Jay R. Sculley, the Assistant secretary of the Army for research and development, said in an interview today that he had discussed with other senior Army officials whether the plan can proceed in the face of the mounting political opposition. He will meet this week with John W. Shannon, Assistant Secretary in charge of installations, to review the matter further, he said. Mr. Sculley said no final decision has been made on whether to cancel or alter the plan. But a leading opponent of the facility, Jeremy Rifkin, president of he Washington-based Foundation on Economic Trends, said the swelling opposition leads him to believe the Army is ready to abandon the effort to build it at Dugway. An aide to Representative Wayne Owens, a Utah Democrat, said the lawmaker's staff had been told the Army is considering a change in its plans. If it decides to press on, the Army appears now to be facing fights on three fronts: in the Federal courts, in state and local regulatory agencies, and in Congress, where funds for the project must be approved. One alternative would be to build a facility on the remote Pacific islands of the Johnson Atoll, where the Army has storage facilities for outmoded chemical weapons. However, the Army prefers the Dugway site, where it has conducted chemical and biological research in the past. Resistance to Retreat The Army is reluctant to retreat, in part because its entire program of biological research is under challenge by Mr. Rifkin's environmental group and others. The Army describes the Dugway laboratory as ''a small but critical part'' of a broader research effort into defenses against biological agents. The military fears that advances in biological science require a defense against weapons based upon novel biological agents. The Pentagon has asserted that the Soviet Union makes biological weapons, and the military and others have raised the possibility that other nations or terrorists could gain access to the technology. The Army already tests defenses against micro-organisms that can cause a number of known diseases, such as anthrax and tularemia. It expects to identify other possible disease agents for testing in the future. The main feature of the new laboratory at Dugway would be its capacity to test actual biological agents, rather than harmless simulants, in the form of aerosols. Aerosols are considered the most effective form of agent because they could be spread by wind and because their tiny droplets, penetrating the lungs' passages, would be especially infectious. But the prospect of this research has stirred deep opposition in Utah, where years ago the Army used to conduct biological warfare tests in the open air rather than in the tight containment system now being proposed. 'Until Hell Freezes Over' Hundreds of people attended a special two-hour hearing called by the Army on Tuesday in Salt Lake City, and no one spoke in favor of the facility. At the hearing, Mr. Rifkin said his organization, which opposes some applications of biotechnology and won a 1985 court case that led to the latest review of the laboratory's safety, would continue to fight the Dugway facility in court ''until this facility is abandoned or until hell freezes over.'' Among the other organizations opposing the laboratory were the Tooele County Department of Environmental Health, the Utah Medical Association and the Utah Wildlife Federation. The Army viewed with special concern the opposition of Gov. Norman H. Bangerter, who declared last Monday that the state would fight the plan. The Army might need permits issued by the state to begin building. The concern was compounded when Representative Owens, who sits on the Interior Committee's environmental subcommittee, said he would seek hearings on the plan. In March, the Salt Lake City television station KSL broadcast an editorial urging the state to ''officially and actively oppose additional test facilities for biological agents.'' The Deseret News, a Salt Lake City newspaper, in an editorial opposed building the plant ''until satisfactory answers are provided'' to questions about its safety. Both the television and the newspaper are owned by the Mormon Church. Although such editorials are independent of the church's views, the statements are seen by some as a sign that the leaders of the church, an influential force in Utah politics, would prefer that the plant be built elsewhere.

67-> Hebron Has a History of Jewish Expulsion
To the Editor: A paragraph in your March 4 news story datelined Hebron, Israeli-occupied West Bank, about a knifing and Purim, requires clarification: ''The Jews here today came in 1968 with guns and zealotry and defiance to live beleaguered lives in enclaves that assert their claim to one of Judaism's four sacred cities, vacated by Jews after Arab riots in 1929.'' You do not mention that the ''riots'' were a bloodbath, in which 67 unarmed men, women and children were murdered, 60 others were wounded, synagogues were razed, torah scrolls were burned, and an entire community was wiped out. In 1931, 35 families returned to resettle. One would think that the Hebron community, plagued by remorse for what it had done, would welcome the returnees and do everything to make them forget the ''bloodbath of Hebron.'' But although the Jews slowly rebuilt, everything was again destroyed in the riots of 1936. The night of April 23, 1936, the British evacuated all Jewish inhabitants of Hebron. This is how the Jews ''vacated'' Hebron, the city where the patriarch Abraham paid 400 silver shekels ''current money with the merchant'' to Ephron the Hittite for a burial place for his wife, Sarah, and where King David established his royal city before moving on to Jerusalem. There was another expulsion, by the Crusaders in the year 1100. But the Jews returned and rebuilt until they were driven from their homes in the ''Arab riots'' of 1929. To suggest erroneously the Jews are troublesome outsiders in Hebron leads to the conclusion that they should leave, that after all the persecution they experienced, the Jews should cross off the city - the cradle of Jewish history - and make it off-limits for Jews.

68-> THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Cable TV Monopoly Is Suggested
Technological advances may eventually dictate that a single entity provide cable television services nationwide, the president of the nation's largest cable system operator told a Congressional panel today. John Malone of Tele-Communications Inc. told the House telecommunications subcommittee that a ''supermonopoly'' might be the most efficient way to serve viewers. New technologies, like fiber-optic cable, are much more efficient than coaxial cable at transmitting video images, he said, but only a regulated monopoly would have the resources for a national network. The telephone companies have expressed interest in using their systems to provide cable services, although at this point they are banned from the cable business. Mr. Malone said telephone companies, however, should not be able to use profits of telephone operations to subsidize cable operations. If the Government required equal access to cable channels, a supermonopoly could end criticism by the entertainment industry and some Government officials that a few major cable system operators control what Americans watch. A supermonopoly might take the form of a joint venture between cable companies and telephone companies, a spokesman for the National Cable Television Association said. Most cable companies are widely diversified in telecommunications and entertainment. Tele-Communications, for example, has expressed interest in the telephone business, and its holdings include movie theaters and satellite dish systems, among other things.

69-> Clean Up New York's Scandalous Voting Mess
To the Editor: Your editorial ''One Person, More Than One Vote'' (April 23), and WCBS-TV's recent expose, which inspired it, once again calls attention to the serious holes in New York's voting process - holes that lawmakers have chosen largely to ignore. Four years ago, a Kings County grand jury report revealed a 14-year pattern of voter fraud in Brooklyn primary elections for Congress and for the State Senate and Assembly. Individuals voted under fictitious names and under names of dead people. In a single legislative race, approximately 1,000 bogus voter-registration cards were filed. One particularly industrious constituent had been voting illegally since 1968, sometimes casting more than 20 ballots in an election. In its report, the grand jury made several recommendations for reform, a number of which unfortunately have not been acted upon. We are left with the worst of all possible combinations - a system that facilitates fraud and also is discouraging to new and old voters alike. Registration cards routinely get lost, aged voting machines break down, and would-be voters who are roused by the last few heated weeks of the campaign are not allowed to register. It is time for the Legislature to focus on reforming the election process, particularly now that we have had another demonstration of how easy it is to vote illegally. It is likewise time to depoliticize the Board of Elections, to take it out of the hands of the political parties and to create an election apparatus that is modern and efficient. Steps should be taken to simplify and computerize the voting process, as well as to set up effective mechanisms to combat fraud. ELIZABETH HOLTZMAN District Attorney of Kings County Brooklyn, May 5, 1988

70-> Answering the Mail
Q. We left a yellow rubber bath mat in the bottom of our tub for a couple of months. When we picked it up we found that it has left a yellow stain we cannot seem to remove. We tried scouring powder, then fine steel wool, but the latter left a gray stain, probably because of the tub's age (34 years). Is there a rubber dissolving chemical I can try that might remove the stain without causing further wear of the thin enamel? A. The steel wool was a mistake; you may have scratched through the enamel or porcelain finish. Try scrubbing with Zud, a cleanser sold in hardware stores, supermarkets and plumbing supply outlets. It works exceptionally well on plumbing fixtures. If this doesn't do the trick, try covering the stain with a piece of turkish towel and soak this with a bleach solution, 1 part laundry bleach to 3 parts water. Let this sit for an hour, then remove the toweling and rinse with water. Q. My house is built on a sloping piece of property so the driveway is quite steep. This driveway is blacktop and applying a sealer can make it slippery. What can I do to get maximum traction ? A. The most common way to solve this problem is to mix coarse sand or similar aggregate in with the sealer when you apply it. This will create a gritty surface that will help improve traction. The sand will tend to wear off quicker than sealer alone, but to keep the sand from wearing off so quickly, apply a second coat of sealer on top of the sanded finish after the first coat has dried. Questions should be addressed to Bernard Gladstone, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York, N.Y. 10036.

71-> WHAT'S NEW IN HANDLING INFECTIOUS MATERIALS; Machines That Cut the Mess to a Manageable Size
A NEW industry has been developed over the last few years by companies offering to handle infectious waste ''from cradle to grave,'' transporting the red-bag garbage in special plastic boxes and burning it in incinerators or autoclaving. Red-bag waste is estimated to account for 10 percent of a hospital's garbage, but it can account for more than half of the disposal budget. There are five companies now attempting to offer such service nationally, as well as a host of regional ones. Waste Management Inc., the nation's largest garbage company, recently announced plans to enter the field. MedX, a Miami-based company that was recently bought by Attwoods P.L.C., a British waste management concern, was one of the first companies dedicated exclusively to the disposal of medical waste. According to Carlos Campos, president, the company services 160 of Florida's hospitals and 600 smaller waste generators, like doctors' offices and laboratories, and is expanding to other East Coast states. Most large hospitals rely on traditional methods of red-bag disposal, either burning it in incinerators or sterilizing it in autoclaves. Incineration is the preferred method, since autoclaves do not reduce the volume of garbage to be hauled away. In state-of-the-art incinerators, the heat is used to generate steam, but even these have their drawbacks. While these incinerators reduce the volume of red-bag waste by 90 percent, the ash, often loaded with heavy toxic metals, must be dumped in special landfills. The growing expense and dissatisfaction with the existing ways of dealing with the red-bag garbage has hopsitals searching for alternatives. One approach is offered by Medical Safetec Inc. in Indianapolis. Last year, the company began marketing two high-speed hammermill machines that work something like a sink garbage disposal: infectious waste is fed along a conveyor belt into the machine, where it is treated with liquid chlorine and ground into a fine granular debris by blades that spin at speeds up to 225 miles an hour. The large machine, which costs $250,000, can reduce a bag of infectious waste to one-tenth its original volume in 15 seconds. So far, acceptance of the machines has been slow. Only 17 have been sold, and most of these are the smaller model, priced at $30,000. Mr. Naber of Infectious Waste News said hospitals were simply hesitant to try a new technology. One institutional customer that says it is ''extremely satisfied'' with the machine is the Underwood Memorial Hospital in Woodbury, N.J. It has used the smaller hammermill machine since June. ''Autoclaving was messy and there was no bulk reduction,'' said Michael Joyce, a vice president. ''Landfill operators wouldn't accept a lot of the material we were generating. Now we've got a cost-effective method that saves space, money - and most importantly, doesn't pollute.

73-> Military Government in Haiti Orders Canadian Priest Out
The military government expelled a Canadian priest accused of disturbing Haiti's social and political order after he refused to reveal the names of his parishioners, radio stations reported today. The Rev. Rene Poirier, a Roman Catholic parish priest in the southern town of Grand Goave, was accused by the regime of making ''insulting public declarations which are liable to disturb the social and political order established in the country,'' Radio Metropole reported today. Father Poirier, 54, was said to have refused a demand by a local police official in Grand Goave that he submit a list of members of his congregation who attended one of his recent religious services, Radio Haiti Inter reported. Though it is unclear why the official wanted the names, Father Poirier is known to be a member of the radical wing of the Roman Catholic Church which opposes the military government and calls on the poor to organize themselves politically.

74-> Banned English Paper Reopens in Malaysia
Malaysia's liveliest English-language newspaper, The Star, has resumed publication after a five-month ban. But its leading columnist, Tunku Abdul Rahman, who was Malaysia's first Prime Minister, cautioned that because of restrictions on publishing, ''readers will not get the message from me in my column as frankly as I would have liked.'' All newspapers are licensed by the Malaysian Government, which has almost total control over the print and broadcast media. The Star and its associated paper, The Sunday Star, were closed last October, along with a Chinese-language daily paper and a weekly Malay paper. At the time, the Government of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad closed the papers and arrested 106 political opponents and members of public-interest groups. The detainees were accused of provoking racial tensions. Thirty-eight people remain in detention without charge or trial, including the leader of the opposition Democratic Action Party, Lim Kit Siang, and his deputy, Karpal Singh. The party rejects the Government accusations but has almost no legal recourse under the Internal Security Act. Spokesmen for the Chinese paper, Sin Chew Jit Poh, and the Malaysian periodical, Watan, said they hoped to resume publication soon. The Star and The Sunday Star are owned by the Malaysian Chinese Association, an important component of the Prime Minister's governing coalition, the National Front. Ethnic Chinese make up 37 percent of the Malaysian population. Malays make up about 48 percent and ethnic South Asians and the indigenous people of Borneo account for the rest.

76-> BASEBALL; Clark Uncertain When He'll Return
Jack Clark limped from the trainer's room to his locker to the whirpool and back. It was obvious he still felt some of the pain from the torn muscle in his left calf, but as he spoke about it today, his voice carried distinct shades of optimism. Clark is still walking with the aid of crutches, although he said he was putting more weight on his leg and that he intended to discard the crutches altogether by Tuesday or Wednesday. It sounded good, but the fact is that when the Yankees break camp Friday and head to Montreal for a two-game exhibition series this weekend, Clark will be not available. And when the season opens a week from Tuesday, he may be on the disabled list. 'Up in the Air' ''That's still kind of up in the air,'' he said today before the Yankees improved their spring record to 18-8 with a 7-5 victory over the Detroit Tigers. ''They're not putting pressure on me. There's been no decision about traveling with the team, and nothing's been said about the d.l. We'll just wait and see.'' By the time the Yankees won their 10th game in the last 12, Clark had already left camp and returned to his hotel. Dr. Dan Kannell, the team physician in spring training, reported that Clark was progressing on schedule and could possibly be available during the first week of the season. Two other Yankees - Ron Guidry and Wayne Tolleson, both coming off shoulder surgery in the off season -also reported progress. Guidry pitched five minutes of batting practice for the first time, and Tolleson continued taking ground balls at shortstop. Clark suffered his injury March 17 stepping out of the batter's box after hitting a home run against Baltimore's Mark Thurmond. Sounding Upbeat At the time, he was struggling. His batting average was .219, he had struck out 10 times in 32 times at bat, and the only home run was the one that put him on the trainer's table. But he tried to sound upbeat about his rehabilitation and expected return. ''It's coming along,'' he said. ''It just takes time. I'm still using the crutches, but I'm using them differently now. I'm putting pressure on the leg, which I couldn't do before. I don't want to push it, but it's coming along.'' Clark said he is still hoping to be back by April 8, which would be the fourth game of the season. Guidry appears further ahead of schedule, and he was visibly enthusiastic after warming up in the bullpen in the morning, then throwing to several batters and getting the ball consistently over the plate. ''If I could throw like that all the time,'' he said, ''it would be no problem. I was worried about whether I'd be close enough around the plate so the guys could swing. There was no pain. I was throwing as easily as I could.'' Remaining Behind Guidry, who underwent surgery on his rotator cuff in December, said he intended to stay after the team leaves. ''I'm sure I will,'' he said. ''I can't help the team now. There's no use taking up space.'' Tolleson, who also had rotator cuff surgery, is also likely to remain here and probably will be placed on the disabled list with Guidry. But he said he was making throws from short and taking batting practice from both sides of the plate. ''I feel I can reach back and throw hard,'' he said, ''but I don't know how many times I can do it in a row. I realize it's still tender. Every day I don't go out and push it, it's better for me.'' But Tolleson acknowledged he has been trying to get back quickly, knowing that Manager Billy Martin has spoken of the team's need for an infielder capable of playing second, third and shortstop. ''I'm aware of that,'' he said. ''Nobody in this room wants to play more than I do. It's an incentive. I won't say it makes it more difficult, but if I can play, then I'm going to play.'' Skinner's Blast Joel Skinner, who has virtually won the job as the Yankees' starting catcher, hit a three-run homer and a run-scoring double to key the victory. Skinner drove in four, giving him 11 runs batted in this spring, behind only Mike Pagliarulo (15) and Don Mattingly (12). . . . The Yankees' 18 spring victories is the most since the club went 18-11 in 1973. No Yankee team has won more than 18 since the team moved from St. Petersburg to Fort Lauderdale in 1962. . . . Dave Winfield, batting just .171 this spring, made two superb throws from right field. In the fourth, he threw out Matt Nokes at second base after the Detroit designated hitter lined a ball into the corner, and in the eighth, he got Nokes trying to score from second on Mike Heath's single. . . . Rick Barry, a former professional basketball player, was a guest of George Steinbrenner at the game.

77-> Bridge; Two Foursomes Face Each Other in the Vanderbilt Knockout Team Final at the Spring Nationals
Two tough foursomes, liberally supplied with both skill and stamina, fought here this afternoon in the final of the Vanderbilt knockout team championship at the American Contract Bridge League's Spring Nationals. One team in the final is headed by Eddie Kantar of Los Angeles and includes Alan Sontag, Roger Bates and John Mohan, all of Manhattan. Opposing him is the formidable Pakistan star, Zia Mahmood, supported by David Berkowitz of Old Tappan, N.J., Ron Smith of Chicago, and Billy Cohen of Marina Del Rey, Calif. After 48 deals of a scheduled 64, Zia led Kantar by 9 imps. In semifinal play Saturday, both matches proved one-sided. Kantar led from the start against a group headed by Jim Cayne of Manhattan and eventually won by 51. Zia was even more impressive, winning 64 imps in the first 16 deals against Jim Mahaffey of Winter Park, Fla., and his team, then winning finally by 103. To Qualify for Playoffs Whatever the result, the Kantar team will qualify for playoffs to determine the 1989 United States world championship team. Since Zia is a foreign player his team is ineligible. In the final of the national intercollegiate championships here, Harvard qualified to meet Illinois following semifinal playoffs Saturday. A remarkable psychic double on the diagramed deal helped the Zia team to build up its early semifinal lead. The two-heart cue-bid promised a club fit and virtually denied possession of four spades. It will be seen that the four-spade contract, on a four-three fit, was due to succeed, thanks to the even splits in both black suits. The double by Berkowitz, sitting East was an impertinent bluff. He knew that the opponents were in a four-three fit, and created the impression that the spades were breaking badly. He induced them to retreat to five clubs, in which the same ten tricks were available. In the replay, four spades was played by Cohen and Smith, undoubled, and the result was a gain of 13 imps for the Zia team.

78-> Market Place; Japanese Portfolio Insurance Grows
THE Japanese are known for copying American fads and the latest to appeal to them is portfolio insurance, which was cited as a chief contributor to the selling panic on Wall Street last October. ''It's getting popular,'' Hideo Karino, general manager of Nikko Securities Ltd. in New York, said of portfolio insurance. Nikko's Tokyo office is offering the service to Japanese institutions in a joint venture with Barra, a consulting firm based in Berkeley, Calif. Several other Japanese and American organizations are offering them the service as well. And officials at Nomura Securities International are using the strategy on a modest amount of securities in a Japanese-based mutual fund. An executive at Leland O'Brien Rubinstein Associates, the firm that created the strategy, said Japanese investors were showing more interest than in the past because they wanted to hedge their risks in worldwide markets. Because the Japanese stock market has a larger market value than the New York Stock Exchange, Mr. Karino and others who follow the Tokyo market predict that the volume of portfolio insurance could be bigger there than it once was in New York. Mr. Karino said the amount of assets devoted to this strategy was small but growing, and would probably surpass the estimated $90 billion of pension assets that had been covered last fall in the United States stock and futures markets. Already, several Japanese life insurance companies and trust banks have begun to use the strategy on small portions of their funds, he said. He did not have a specific figure on how much in assets was covered by the strategy. This trend could be disruptive to capital markets in the United States if there is a repeat in Tokyo of last October's Wall Street selling frenzy. Professional investors here watch anxiously as the Nikkei stock index sets new highs, approaching the 28,000 level yesterday. Should prices in Tokyo crack with the intensity of October's collapse in the Dow Jones industrial average, some experts predict that Japanese investors will dump some of their huge holdings of United States Government bonds and stocks. That, in turn, would send interest rates in the United States soaring and cause stock and bond prices in New York to fall. David N. Dreman, managing partner of Dreman Value Management, which invests $3 billion in United States stocks and bonds, said, ''Anything that could be a potential trigger, like portfolio insurance, is inherently dangerous.'' Portfolio insurance is a mathematically based strategy that involves the selling of stock index futures contracts after incremental stock market declines. The sales offset the falling value of the investor's stock portfolios. Many investors believe that the strategy helped send the Dow soaring past 2,700 last summer as pension fund managers continued to buy stocks, thinking they were hedged. The executives found they had no problem executing the strategy when the market was going up. But many were unable to sell enough futures, or even stocks, during the panicky days of October. Moreover, those executing the portfolio strategy exert additional pressure on a declining market because they are sellers of stock index futures, which in turn can drive stock markets lower. The large-scale selling of futures was considered one of the triggers in the panic in the United States equity markets. Aggressive traders and money managers, who knew those executing the insurance strategy would sell futures after the market began falling in mid-October, sold hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of stock, according to the Presidential commission that investigated the crash. There was a snowballing effect, which culminated in the 508-point drop in the Dow on Oct. 19. Since then, pension officials have cut back sharply in their use of portfolio insurance. But portfolio insurance may not have the same effect in Japan, some experts say. Unlike the markets in New York, the Japanese market has circuit breakers that could cushion selling pressure by those using portfolio insurance. When stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fall by a certain percentage, depending on their price level, trading is suspended until the next day. In addition, the Ministry of Finance in Tokyo is considered by some as the ultimate circuit breaker. Mr. Karino and others have said that ministry officials called them in on Oct. 20 and strongly encouraged them to buy when prices fell. Experts say Japanese investors find portfolio insurance appealing for two reasons. First, they are fascinated with American customs, even when those customs appear to have passed their peak. And second, Japanese institutional money managers are basically trend followers. They do not like to be early in their purchases of stocks or stock groups, preferring to buy after a trend is well established and prices have moved. Portfolio insurance, which unlike traditional investing instructs managers to buy stocks after they have increased in price and sell after they have fallen, appeals to this point of view. So far, the Japanese have been using the Osaka 50 stock index futures contracts to execute portfolio insurance. But in the next couple of months they will be able to hedge their funds using new contracts on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Because Japanese individuals and institutions continue to have confidence in their stock market, Japanese professionals say they are not worried that the strategy will produce the same results it did in the United States. ''The New York market is sick,'' Mr. Karino said. ''But the Tokyo market is very healthy.''

79-> With Rights Bill Override, Reagan's Limp Begins to Show
THE morning of the votes that, as expected, overrode his veto of a major civil rights measure, President Reagan traveled to Capitol Hill to deliver a pep talk to Republicans. He opened by saying: ''Our job in the next few months is to keep the leadership on the other side of the aisle from ramming through legislation that would send the longest peacetime economic expansion on record into a tailspin.'' Many of the people Mr. Reagan was talking to were worrying about something he did not address: If many of those measures reach the President's desk, they could send Republican political prospects into a tailspin, too. For Republicans as well as Democrats are looking to life after the Reagan Administration. And in the view of many in the President's party, Mr. Reagan's rejection of a mainstream consensus that favors the use of Federal power to enforce antidiscrimination principles - his 63d veto - may have pleased some of his right-wing constituents, but it also demonstrated his own declining influence on Capitol Hill. In the Senate, 21 of 45 Republicans joined a solid Democratic majority to override the veto 73 to 24. In the House, 52 of 175 Republicans went against the White House, for an override vote of 292 to 133. It was the ninth override of his term. ''When you lose on a large issue like this,'' conceded a Republican strategist with close ties to the White House, ''your standing does recede somewhat on the Hill, and your image as someone who is able to shape the legislative agenda is diminished.'' The difficult politics of the Civil Rights Restoration Act, which reversed a Supreme Court ruling that had restricted the reach of basic civil rights laws, was demonstrated by Vice President Bush. Before the override vote, he said he supported the veto, emphasizing his loyalty to Mr. Reagan. After the vote, reiterating his support for civil rights bills when he was in Congress, he declined when asked to say whether he would have vetoed this one. Congressional Republicans fear that the Democrats are preparing to ship them a long list of measures that could prove equally difficult, from an expansion of child care and parental leave benefits to a higher minimum wage and expanded insurance coverage for home health care. ''Remember,'' a senior White House official said, ''Ronald Reagan attracted a fair amount of blue-collar support. And if I were a Democrat, I would want to try to get those blue-collar types back in November. Therefore, I'd confront the President with these labor issues.'' An aide to Senate Democrats painted a different picture. ''Democrats are being more pragmatic this time around,'' he said. ''You can be pro-worker without being antibusiness.'' Indeed, the potential for confrontation could be tempered if the Democratic leadership heeds Southern and border state legislators who counsel a cautious approach to domestic spending, warning that many voters who went Republican in the last two elections can be drawn back to the party only by fiscal prudence. ''If we vote for seven or eight of these things in a row,'' said an influential Democratic senator, ''many small-businessmen who are now prepared to vote Democratic will fall off in droves. We're headed right down the road of 1980.'' Meanwhile, Republicans who have heeded Mr. Reagan's warning are trying to harass the Democratic majority at every turn. Many bills face filibusters in the Senate. Last week, the Democrats tried and failed to end debate on one of their top priorities, a bill that would force companies to inform workers when they have been exposed to hazardous toxins. Such issues highlight the problems that face Mr. Reagan - or any President - during his final months in office. Lyndon B. Johnson postponed for three months the announcement that he would not run again in 1968, according to James R. Jones, who was then White House chief of staff. Mr. Johnson, who made his intentions known in March of that year, knew that his power would wane as soon as he became a lame duck, Mr. Jones said, and so wanted to give his legislative program a final chance to be enacted. By the summer, President Johnson lacked the political power to withstand the arguments of conservative senators conducting a filibuster against Justice Abe Fortas, his choice to replace retiring Chief Justice Earl Warren, that Mr. Johnson's successor should be the one to fill the vacancy. Jimmy Carter did not know that 1980 would be his last year until the voters told him so in November. But according to Stuart E. Eizenstat, his domestic policy chief, the Carter White House really lost its power to initiate legislation when its public opinion rating plummeted in mid-1979. Mr. Reagan has now passed a crucial point: He can no longer propose legislation with much hope that it will become law. Any President retains special powers in foreign affairs; hearings on Mr. Reagan's proposed treaty with the Soviet Union banning intermediate-range nuclear weapons ended last week with strong endorsements from Senate leaders and good prospects for ratification. By and large, however, the President's remaining legislative power is the veto threat. But that power can be considerable. As House and Senate conferees draft a trade bill compromise, they are worrying about a veto and reshaping the measure to make it acceptable to Mr. Reagan. (The politics of trade, page 5.) Still, a White House aide conceded, ''the clock's ticking.'' As Mr. Eizenstat put it, ''Congress, like sharks, sense that somebody is dying. They tend to circle, and whatever little cohesion there is in our system between the White House and Congress diminishes.''

82-> Alcatraz Journal; Rock May Be a Hard Place for Casino
Suppose you had a beautiful city by the bay with a projected budget deficit of $172 million. Suppose that bay had a 12-acre rock sitting in it, formerly the home of an infamous Federal prison and now a tourist attraction that draws nearly 800,000 people each year. Naturally, you would think of turning the former prison on the rock into a casino to raise revenue. At least that's the way some people who run the city by this bay feel, and they have put a measure on the June 7 ballot to give the voters a chance to state their preference. Forget that the rock is owned by the Federal Government and maintained by the National Park Service as part of the Golden Gate Recreation Area. Forget that the former prison is a National Historic Landmark. Forget that most gambling is illegal in this state. San Francisco didn't earn the nickname ''The City That Knows How'' for nothing. Wendy Nelder, one of the six members of the 11-member San Francisco Board of Supervisors who is supporting the concept, said she believes the city could recoup between $100 million and $150 million a year from the casino. While experts point out that New Jersey receives only $225 million per year from 11 Atlantic City casinos, Ms. Nelder said her projections assume the Alcatraz casino would woo the California gamblers who now travel to Nevada. The Park Service is not amused. Its director, William Penn Mott Jr., has called the idea ''ludicrous.'' Brian O'Neill, superintendent of Golden Gate National Recreation Area, was more discreet. ''Congress would have to vote to turn over a Federal asset to the City of San Francisco to use to retire its deficit,'' he said. ''It's not going to happen.'' For many, the idea of a casino conjures up the image of elegant men and women in designer clothes gliding past spinning roulette wheels while sipping champagne from crystal flutes as croupiers exhort them to place their bets. Apparently this fantasy of Monte Carlo on The Rock, as Alcatraz was called in the days when it was a Federal prison, is not precisely what its supporters had in mind. ''I envision the casino with slots and keno,'' Ms. Nelder said. ''There would be stands selling hot dogs and pizza.'' Keno? Hot dogs? ''Well, a variety of quiches, too,'' she said. In the unlikely event that the city should gain control of the island, it would still be left with the task of dealing with the G-word. Off-track betting at certain race tracks is allowed, as are poker parlors approved by local voters. But when the voters approved a state lottery in 1984 with proceeds going to benefit public schools, they also strengthened laws forbidding casino gambling. The voters made it clear that they did not wish to have the modern equivalents of Al (Scarface) Capone and George K. (Machine Gun Kelly) Barnes, Alcatraz alumni, running business in their state. It would now take a constitutional amendment to allow casino gambling. There have been more than 300 proposals for the use of Alcatraz since the Federal Government abandoned the prison in June 1968, declaring that the combination of deteriorating buildings and the lack of water supply or waste disposal rendered it unusable. (When Alcatraz was a functioning prison, water had to be brought in by boat and barge and waste had to be taken out the same way.) Early ideas included the erection of a peace monument, a pigeon sanctuary and a home for hippies. The Texas multimillionaire Lamar Hunt wanted to build a 364-foot tower on the site, while others favored a replica of the Statue of Liberty or a 250-foot globe of the world. In one of its most troubling periods, the island was occupied from November 1969 through June 1971 by a small group of Indians from various tribes in a failed attempt to claim the abandoned land by ''right of discovery.'' After 19 months in which a small child died in a fall, a fire destroyed several buildings and an arrow was shot at a ferry, Federal marshals ousted the remaining 15 people and re-established the lighthouse and fog warning signals on the island. It will be fitting, in a way, if the debate over Alcatraz is never settled. After all, prisoners were sent to Alcatraz because they had been judged incorrigible. Once there, they had little to do but wait for the time to go by as the waves beat against The Rock, over and over and over.

83-> Bradley Works to Recapture 1986 Pace
Richard and Kathleen Bradley of Westford, Mass., have a tradition: they ring a Swiss cowbell on the front porch of their colonial house every time their daughter wins a golf tournament. Kathleen Bradley started the tradition when Pat Bradley, who turned 37 years old last Thursday, won her first of 22 official tournaments as a professional, in Australia in 1975. ''Pat called at 3 o'clock in the morning to say she had won, and I had to do something right away to let people know,'' Mrs. Bradley said. ''I'm so embarrassed to tell you this,'' she said by telephone recently from the family's ski shop in Westford, ''but I picked up the bell and started ringing in the driveway at 3 o'clock in the morning, waking up the neighborhood.'' Five Victories in 1986 The Bradleys had their busiest bell-ringing season in 1986, when Pat won five tournaments and was named the player of the year of the Ladies Professional Golf Association. When 1986 was over, Bradley had an L.P.G.A. one-year earnings record of $492,021 and edged JoAnne Carner by six weeks in becoming the first female golfer to earn $2 million. Since Bradley's tremendous success in 1986, she has won only once, when she captured the Standard Register Tourquoise Classic in Phoenix on March 29, 1987. As a result, Bradley went from first in 1986 to 15th in 1987 to virtually unranked this year. ''I think I imitated Bob Tway and Greg Norman in having a bad year after such success in 1986,'' Bradley said recently. ''My problem was that I couldn't let go of 1986. I was so caught up in it. The calendar read 1987, but I was so possessed with 1986.'' She said she intended to play a full schedule this year, despite missing the cut in three of the five tournaments she has played thus far. She is hoping things will improve at this week's Nabisco Dinah Shore tournament, which she won in 1986 and in which she finished tied for third last year. Not Enough Rest Bradley said that part of last year's lack of success was her failure to take time off after the Nabisco Dinah Shore tournament. She missed a short putt that would have put her into a playoff with Patty Sheehan and Betsy King, the eventual winner. ''I was planning to take two weeks off if I had won,'' Bradley said. ''I should have still taken the time off, although I finished third. I started pushing after that and I think I could have used the rest.'' Bradley said she was convinced that she had the physical and mental strength to overcome her problems on the course and raise her game back above last year's level. Bradley said she was confused last year about the way she stood over the ball. She has been working with a new instructor, and over the last two weeks, he has changed her set-up. She said her driving and putting had improved, but she was quick to point out that she still had plenty of trouble with her long irons. ''I've already seen some improvements this year,'' Bradley said. ''I'm sure I'll be able to overcome my problems and raise my game. I've been in tougher situations before and I've been able to overcome my problems. All it'll take is a good week and I'll be happy walking the fairways again.'' Hoping for Hall of Fame Bradley will enter the Dinah Shore tournament with 22 victories to her credit. To qualify for the L.P.G.A. Hall of Fame, a player must win 30 tournaments, including two majors, or 35 that include one major. Bradley admitted she will have difficulty winning eight more tournaments. ''The Hall of Fame is for the elite, and I feel I'm one of the elite players,'' Bradley said. She is the only active player with a tournament named after her: the Planters Pat Bradley International, which will take place Aug. 4-7 at Willow Creek Golf Club in High Point, N.C. ''It's certainly an honor to have a tournament named after you,'' she said. ''I'm not dead and I'm not retired, so it's a confidence-booster, and I need all the confidence I can get right now.''

84-> DANCE VIEW; Ice Dancers Who Spin Tales of Romance skates.
YOU DIDN'T NEED TO KNOW A time step from a soft shoe when you watched Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire. And you won't need to tell a death spiral from a flying camel or any other picturesquely named skating move when the British skaters Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean arrive in town Wednesday with the Ice Capades. What you will know is that, like Rogers and Astaire, Torvill and Dean (as they are called) exude an unmistakable aura of romance that reaches beyond a single art form. Even for those who yawn at the now-familiar idea that ice skating can be a means of artistic expression, Torvill and Dean represent something new. For the millions who have seen them in person or via satellite television - especially during their gold-medal victory in the ice-dance category at the 1984 Olympics - the two champions have become identified with more than technical perfection: They stand to be regarded as the great romantic team of the 1980's. Skaters first, Torvill and Dean are also, in the wide sense, actors and dancers. But unlike so many in the field who make their mark as soloists, they have formed a professional partnership that works hard at creating an image: male and female swathed in passionate rapport. An early duet, danced to Larry Adler's recording of Gershwin's ''Summertime,'' contained a typically ecstatic motif: The skaters touched cheek to cheek and palm to palm just before Miss Torvill arched back upon Mr. Dean's bent-over body. There is no mistaking the powerful mix of sensuousness and tenderness that pervades their performances, a quality that has ranged from young love to sophisticated encounters. The result has prompted others in their field to wax neo-spiritual: ''Watching them skate, the way they caress the ice, it's like watching God skate'' was the way Bernard Ford, a prior British ice-dance champion, felt compelled to describe them. A spectator is as drawn to their faces as to their skates. ''We work on eye contact,'' Mr. Dean says, singling out one aspect of the rapport that distinguishes them from other ice dancers. Indelibly, they remain players in a continuing love story. Imagery lies at the core of every duet Torvill and Dean have created for themselves, and their multifaceted range is evident in the distinct originality of each of their dances. It is easy to get carried away by the technical ability, pioneering choreography and personal chemistry that radiate from the British duo. Yet, hyperbole could hardly be the charge leveled at all nine ice-dance judges at the 1984 Olympics in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, after each awarded Torvill and Dean history-making scores of six for artistic impression. Six means perfect in skating competition. New Yorkers will see how perfect when Miss Torvill, 30 years old, and Mr. Dean, 29, make their professional local debut as guests with the Ice Capades at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday (through Jan. 31). They will also appear with the revue at the Meadowlands in East Rutherford, N.J. (Feb. 2-7), as well as at the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale,L.I. (Feb. 9-14). Viewers throughout the world readily recall the stunning images beamed from Sarajevo four years ago when Mr. Dean, a blond, haughty bullfighter, flung the petite Miss Torvill - his human cape - to the ice in their ''Paso Doble.'' In their now-famous ''Bolero,'' the couple offered their interpretation of Ravel's pulsating score. And in this instance, both skaters - passion personified -hurled themselves with near-suicidal fervor toward the ground. Ice dancing, now the most glamorous event in skating, is nonetheless not synonymous with Torvill and Dean. Many a couple in ice-dancing competition has waltzed out onto the rink as if on assignment. Ironically, the ice-dance category, whose rules differ from that of figure skating, was not admitted to Olympic competition until 1976 because it was rooted in ballroom forms and not considered athletic enough. Ice dancers are not allowed the multiple spins or air turns required of figure skaters. Nor are they supposed to execute the athletic ''throws'' or high lifts practiced by those skaters in the pairs category of competition, whose partnered moves are remote from the social dance rhythms at the base of ice dancing. Too often, however, even competitors in ice dance treat each separate element in their choreography as a trick. Well before they turned professional in 1984, Torvill and Dean aimed at something else: to project character as total artists. ''Some people do skating moves and jumps without any reason,'' Mr. Dean said during a series of interviews. It is in reaction to this trick-to-trick athleticism in ice skating that Torvill and Dean's own esthetic bias can be understood. There are no isolated moves, no ''unlinked elements'' in their seamless skating, no empty spaces in between. Each trajectory is packed with dramatic gestures, steps and emoting. In ''Barnum on Ice,'' a circus-theme duet that they have performed outside the Ice Capades, both skaters mime a kaleidoscopic assemblage of juggling, clowning and acrobatic feats. There is a comic touch as they pretend to put on clown makeup while whizzing by; a deadpan expression turns into an impish grin. The ''Paso Doble'' is indisputably the most startling of their dances -not only because it ingeniously offers a human cape being flung around by a matador but also because this conceit becomes still another metaphor for passion in male-female relations. Because it is so well known, having been repeatedly replayed during televised skating competitions since 1984, this duet has become a model of the thoroughness that goes into Torvill and Dean's approach to skating. The music is taken from Rimsky-Korsakov's ''Capriccio Espagnol,'' and as both skaters stand at the center of the rink, the surprise to come is kept literally under wraps. Miss Torvill clings to Mr. Dean's back, a hand draped over his right shoulder from behind. Dressed in a bullfighter's costume, he reaches across his chest as if holding a cape. Then, in a second, this is what Miss Torvill ''becomes.'' Her black, winglike sleeves held out, she spins off - flung away by her partner. As both skaters move continuously in serpentine paths around each other, Mr. Dean whirls, twirls and twists the shape that is his partner. The most spectacular moments are those when the matador drags his cape behind him - that is, Mr. Dean pushes forward emphatically to an insistent rhythm, as Miss Torvill is pulled along, gliding on one knee. Typically, the duet includes other dramatic subtleties. A death spiral is a familiar skating move in which the woman, held by one hand, drops parallel to the ice with her head perilously downward. In their ''Paso Doble,'' Miss Torvill makes this set move barely recognizable as such. It is transformed instead into a suggestion of a piece of fabric swept toward the ground - an example of a bullfighter's flamboyant exhibitionism. The final moment, no matter how frequently seen, preserves its power to surprise. Mr. Dean, eyes flashing, suddenly throws his ''cape'' to the ice. Miss Torvill falls prone, revolves on her stomach and comes to rest. Like the grandest of all toreadors, her partner salutes the crowd, one arm raised in triumph. What the audience may not catch is that while Miss Torvill is always on the move, she is also doing her best to portray, as Mr. Dean notes, ''an inanimate object.'' Miss Torvill adds: ''I have to be very bland and expressionless, not a lady.'' Not every partner might agree to look deliberately passive while being extraordinarily active. But it is typical of the Torvill and Dean approach that there is an overriding concept in everything they do. Mr. Dean's view of himself as the bullfighter is highly specific: ''The bull is imaginary,'' he says. ''I try to focus, not necessarily on Jayne but more on the line of the cape. From then on, the matador is arrogant. I show the cape off, but I relate to the bull. My relationship is to something in the distance. In my own thought, that is what I do - for the credibility of what we're doing.'' ''We wanted a drum roll as in a bullfight, and we went back to the original Spanish form of how things were done - not the ballroom paso doble,'' Miss Torvill says. Their purpose would be served, they felt, with Rimsky-Korsakov's ''Capriccio Espagnol.'' The most characteristic aspect of their work was their insistence on researching as much as possible about bullfights. ''We couldn't afford to go to Spain,'' Miss Torvill says, ''so we looked at pictures and old books about bullfights.'' Mr. Dean's concern was ''how the cape was flung, the look of the shoulder and how the cape is used to taunt the bull.'' Mr. Dean spent close to a year choreographing and rehearsing the short piece, discarding a second version that was ''too busy.'' ''Bolero,'' which is being performed on some of the Ice Capades national tour, has an underlying scenario that hints at a love gone tragically wrong. It was Mr. Dean's idea to avoid the repetition in movement that Ravel's repeated melody usually suggests to stage choreographers. ''We wanted to build,'' he explains. ''We started slow and moved faster.'' First kneeling toward each other on the ice, the two skaters ''moved from the floor up, progressing like the music,'' he says. Another formal element in this progression was the way the skaters moved further apart. The music's crescendo is eventually equated with the intensity of the couple on the ice. Human passion peaks when the music does. The love story that Torvill and Dean continuously describe on ice, just as Rogers and Astaire did on film, is as changeable in mood as love itself. Their relationship off the ice is platonic, they insist. Yet, artistically, their programs over the years have marked an evolution from teen-age infatuation to sophisticated romance. It is hard to believe that Miss Torvill and Mr. Dean once considered themselves incompatible when they initially joined up as skating partners as teen-agers in their native Nottingham. ''The sun didn't shine and the bells didn't ring,'' they say in near unison. At first, Mr. Dean, at 5 feet 9 inches, seemed too tall to properly partner Miss Torvill, who is 5 feet 1 inch. Other obstacles were encountered and overcome. At the age of 19, Mr. Dean became a policeman and stayed on the force until he was 25. Mismatched practice schedules with Miss Torvill, then a secretary and underwriter in an insurance office, complicated their training. And yet, in the end, their sheer genius molded the pair into a team that has set new artistic standards in the skating world. The city of Nottingham, which supported them with a crucial grant early in their amateur career, has made them Freemen, an ancient honor that gives them, among other privileges, the right to herd sheep in the center of town. ''All England was behind them,'' says Barry Hagan, a California skater who toured internationally in the company that Torvill and Dean formed and headed in 1985 and '86. Two days after Thanksgiving last year, following a successful swing through England, Australia and Canada, Mr. Dean broke his wrist and the company's American tour was canceled. Although they are still hoping for the financial backing to form their own troupe again, Torvill and Dean's appearances with Ice Capades are based on the premises that motivated them in their own troupe. In short, the image they project must take into account skating's specific properties. Unlike most skaters, Torvill and Dean had never studied ballet during their amateur career; after forming their own company, they took ballet class with Andris Toppe, an Australian teacher. Skating, they believe, has to do with speed, flow and distance. Technically, Mr. Dean is praised by fellow skaters for his ''depth of edge,'' the way his blades cut into the ice to push off with centrifugal force and sustain momentum. Miss Torvill, Mr. Dean's choreographic muse, is lauded as a brilliant technician. The three Ice Capades numbers recently choreographed by Mr. Dean for himself and his partner are keyed to the revue's themes. Its ''Salute to Hollywood'' gives them a pretext to perform a duet inspired by Rogers and Astaire, but both skaters are firm in insisting it is not meant to be an imitation. Instead, they speak of how they hope to extend skating's forms, concentrating on the syncopation and ''breaking up of rhythms'' they see in the Astaire style. Similarly, in their duet to the waltz from Stephen Sondheim's musical ''A Little Night Music,'' which is part of a chess-theme segment called ''Noir et Blanc,'' their aim is ''to make it interesting.'' And in ''Winter Dreams,'' they skate to part of Rimsky-Korsakov's ''Snow Maiden'' as a snow king and queen, but their choreographic focus is on technical innovation. Because skaters land on a blade when they jump, they have seemingly been unable to execute the ballet jete that requires landing on the ball of a foot. Yet here, Miss Torvill says, ''we are moving in fast and nonstop jetes,'' invented by Mr. Dean. ''The new pieces are an extension of where we left off in our own company.'' Unlike many dance choreographers, Torvill and Dean do not think in terms of pure movement. There is always an underlying story in their work, expressed in dramatic terms. Mr. Dean says: ''I find it hard not to have a picture within whatever the music is saying.'' Coming from the land of Barbara Cartland romances, both skaters know very well how popular entertainment can evoke a universal response. ''People can relate to romance,'' they say. If ''Bolero'' and ''Paso Doble'' are the grand-passion chapters in their ongoing serial, there has also been room along the way for the fun they had with ''Song of India,'' a piece of erotic kitsch created for them in 1984 by the Australian choreographer Graeme Murphy. Two other duets - their 1982 ''Mack and Mabel,'' which they perform with the Ice Capades on the West Coast, and the 1983 ''Barnum on Ice'' - illustrate a more domestic aspect. Both are overtly show-biz numbers concerned, in fact, with show-business couples. The Mack and Mabel of the title are the same as those of Jerry Herman's 1974 Broadway musical based on Mack Sennett, the American film director, and his star, Mabel Normand. Whatever the underlying anecdotal thread inspired by their characters' lives, Torvill and Dean turn the duet into a huge crowd-pleaser - a collage of silent-movie images. The drama of the ice rink is foremost in Torvill and Dean's view. ''In an arena, a dancer would look frantic trying to cover the distance we do,'' Mr. Dean says. ''It's important that you know what skating is about -whether we are calling it sport, art or entertainment. The title doesn't matter.''

86-> Athens Says U.S. Seeks Arab in Attacks on 2 Jets
A Greek police official said today that the United States was demanding the extradition of a Palestinian in connection with two mid-flight bomb attacks on American passenger planes. The United States Embassy declined to comment on the report. [ In Washington, the State Department had no official comment. ] The police official said the Palestinian, Mohammed Rashid, was arrested in Athens last week on a tip from the American authorities. Mr. Rashid is believed to have been involved in the August 1982 bomb attack on a Pan American World Airways jet on a flight between Honolulu and Tokyo, the official said. A 15-year old boy was killed and 15 people were wounded. The official said Mr. Rashid was also wanted in an explosion aboard a Trans World Airlines jet as it flew between Rome and Athens in 1986. Four people were blown out of the plane, including a 15-month-old baby. The official was unable to give Mr. Rashid's age or to identify him further. Greek press reports say the Greek Government will not extradite Mr. Rashid because it considers the evidence provided by the American authorities to be inadequate. The reports said Greece had also explained that Mr. Rashid would have to be tried under Greek law, and that even an American extradition request would have to go before the courts here. That process could take several years. The reports said L. Paul Bremer 3d, a senior State Department official involved with combating terrorism, flew to Athens last week to press the Greek Government to extradite Mr. Rashid. The case was also discussed last week at a meeting between the American Ambassador to Greece, Robert Keeley, and Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, the local press reports said. A United States Embassy official confirmed that Mr. Bremer visited Athens last week, but added that the trip had been planned long in advance and that the extradition issue was not discussed. The official would not comment on the contents of the talks between Mr. Papandreou and Mr. Keeley. A Government spokesman, Telemachus Chitiris, said: ''Greece cooperates with all in combating terrorism. We are dedicated to the struggle against terrorism and impose stiff penalties against terrorists, in accordance with Greek law.'' Mr. Papandreou's Socialist Government has supported the Palestinian cause and refuses to grant full diplomatic recognition to Israel, citing Israeli policies in the occupied territories.

87-> Bangladesh Parliament Votes To Make Islam State Religion
Parliament approved a constitutional amendment tonight that makes Islam the state religion of this south Asian nation. Opposition parties rejected the change and said they would resist it. The bill was formally introduced last month by the ruling Jatiya Party at the behest of President H. M. Ershad, who heads the party. Moslems constitute 87 percent of the nation's 105 million people. Hindus, Christians and Buddhists account for the rest. The move had been opposed by major opposition forces, including the Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, as well as by professionals, minority groups and organizations of students and women.

91-> Wimbledon; Chang's Loss Is Good Lesson
At 16, Michael Chang came to Wimbledon for the experience more than with any expectation of writing a storybook ending the way Boris Becker did in 1985. Becker was only 17 when he won Wimbledon for the first time, an accomplishment that appears even more remarkable after listening to Chang explain his goal here. ''This year was an experience year and that's why I played in the French Open and Wimbledon,'' Chang said. ''So I'm not disappointed; it's not hard for me to take this loss.'' Chang, who won his first round match Monday, was beaten today by Henri Leconte, who is seeded seventh, 2-6, 7-6, 6-2, 6-3. Leconte was a finalist in the French Open and has reached the quarterfinals and the semifinals at Wimbledon. Chang was realistic enough to understand that his European trip would be ending today. 'Very, Very Fast' And yet, he was only one point from taking a 2-0 lead in sets, which might have made the fiery and totally unpredictable Leconte more than a little concerned. Chang is the youngest in the men's draw to play on Centre Court since 1927, but the Frenchman was properly impressed. ''He is very, very fast,'' Leconte said, motioning with his hand how fast Chang moved around the court. ''He was all over the place. I was surprised he played this way on grass. He's good for a 16-year-old. He has potential.'' Chang is only 5 feet 8 inches tall and 135 pounds, and lacks the big serve and consistent power required to win on a fast surface like grass. He is at his best keeping the ball in play, trying to force mistakes. The strategy was working today until Leconte pounced on a weak serve to save that set point in the second set, then eventually win a tie breaker to turn the match in his favor. An Altered Serve Chang is working with Brian Gottfried, who was recently hired by the United States Tennis Association to coach first-year Americans on the tour. Gottfried altered Chang's serve for Wimbledon, giving him a slice serve that would compensate for his lack of power. The highlight of his spring in Europe was playing John McEnroe in the French Open, said Chang, who referred to his fellow American as Mr. McEnroe. That was a bigger thrill than playing on Wimbledon's Centre Court, which he described as ''just a court.'' Among the women today, Steffi Graf, who is seeded No. 1; Zina Garrison, No. 12; Hana Mandlikova, now of Australia, No. 9, and Barbara Potter were the more notable winners. Graf, who did not lose a game in her opening match Tuesday, defeated Karine Quentrec of France, 6-2, 6-0.

92-> THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; New England Monthly Is Bustling
THERE'S a lot of activity inside the old brick brass works on the Mill River in Haydenville, Mass., and it is being felt thoughout New England and beyond. The 113-year-old, three-story building is the headquarters of New England Monthly magazine, a four-year-old publication that hopes to be operating in the black next year. It thinks of itself as sort of a New Yorker and its editor, Daniel Okrent, refuses to do things by the book. A detester of cliches, he has been described in Folio magazine as having ''a far-out, fast-paced approach.'' Whatever it is, it has brought the magazine two general excellence National Magazine Awards in 1986 and 1987. That has never happened before. That kind of award helps to impress ad agencies and advertisers and surely had something to do with the 50 percent increase in New England Monthy's national advertising. Indeed, national advertising now constitutes about a quarter of the 597 advertising pages the magazine carried last year and some 35 percent of its $2 million in ad revenues it had as of the end of its fiscal year March 31. The New York market contributed 16 percent of the total ad pages thanks to the work of William Good, owner of Good Magazines. So good was Good that the magazine decided to reopen the advertising sales office that they closed three years ago when the Good rep organization took over. According to Perry Edgar, New England Monthly's associate publisher and advertising director, who made the New York scene yesterday with Robert Nylen, the publisher, the magazine will install its own person in Detroit as well while continuing to work through reps in Miami, Philadelphia, Chicago, San Francisco, Dallas and Denver. It has six advertising salespeople in its main office in Boston, which is still the source of most advertising and the home of half the readers. It is also the home of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, an advertiser and supporter from the very first issue and it is instituting a new program of giving subscriptions to the magazine as a thank-you gift to guests who visit the hotel twice a year. Mr. Edgar expects the program to add 7,500 high-demographic subscribers to a circulation that has grown to 115,000 from the 45,000 the magazine started with four years ago. Demographically speaking, the subscribers are already up there. Their average household income is $82,500, 80 percent of them are college educated and 74 percent of them are in professional, managerial or technical occupations. As far as competition goes, the management of New England Monthly considers it to be more of a Boston and Connecticut magazine than Yankee, which was first published in 1935. Comparing New England Monthly to Yankee, Mr. Nylen said, is like comparing The New Yorker to Reader's Digest. When Mr. Nylen and Mr. Edgar are together, there are certain things they tend to talk about - like being infantry officers, and about what a wonderful magazine The New Yorker is. Before opening an agency of his own in Vermont Mr. Edgar was New England sales manager of The New Yorker. And Mr. Nylen was formerly associate publisher and ad director of Texas Monthly, whose managers were also inspired by The New Yorker. Like The New Yorker, New England Monthly strives to make the advertising part of the reading package for the subscriber and, like The New Yorker, it keeps high advertising standards. They do take cigarettes and spirits advertising, yes, but they don't take plastic surgeons, time-sharing real estate deals or discounters. You've got to draw the line someplace.

93-> About New York; 90 Subdued Years Of Funerals For the Famous
Quietly (and how!), Frank E. Campbell, ''The Funeral Chapel Inc.,'' the city's undertaker to the stars, is celebrating its 90th anniversary this year. It's a hushed affair. There will be, according to an official, ''no formal celebration, no formal acknowledgement'' outside the building at 81st and Madison - and not much within. That's the place where, at the end, one could find Elizabeth Arden, George Balanchine, Bernard Baruch, James Cagney, Terence Cardinal Cooke, Frank Costello, Joan Crawford, Jack Dempsey, Thomas E. Dewey, Tommy Dorsey, Perry Ellis, Judy Garland, George Gershwin, Oscar Hammerstein 2d, Rita Hayworth, Jacob K. Javits, Howard Johnson, Sammy Kaye, Robert F. Kennedy, John Lennon, Margaret Mead, Ethel Merman, Dorothy Parker, J. C. Penney, Otto Preminger, Damon Runyon, Vincent Sardi, David Sarnoff, Bishop Fulton J. Sheen, Toots Shor, Ed Sullivan, Arturo Toscanini, Amy Vanderbilt, Jimmy Walker, Mae West or Tennessee Williams, to alphabetically name-drop but a few. ''To create a service so sublimely beautiful, in an atmosphere of such complete harmony as to alleviate the sorrow of parting, is to render a service to mankind,'' Frank E. Campbell himself said a very long time ago. Mr. Campbell got his start at age 12, in 1884, at a funeral home in Camp Point, Ill., helping to make caskets. By 1893 he was earning $10 a week in New York at the Stephen Merritt Undertaking and Cremation Company. By 1898 he was in business for himself on West 23d Street. The rest is the stuff of mortuary legend. According to an in-house history of the concern, it was the founder's business genius to recognize a need peculiar to New York and fill it. The custom at the time was to have funerals at home. That may have played well elsewhere in the land, but the majority of New Yorkers lived in apartments or residential hotels. This made for a cramped, to say nothing of crabby, funeral. Mr. Campbell ''combined the facility of viewing with the atmosphere of the church'' and set the industry on its ear. Most funeral parlors of the period were just basic storefronts. Mr. Campbell's place was a showcase of mellow light, decorative furniture, potted palms and art. By the time he buried Enrico Caruso, in 1921, the parlor had been moved to Broadway and 66th Street. By the time he buried Rudolph Valentino, after a riot at the bier, in 1926, his reputation was writ in stone, after a fashion. The parlor outstripped the competition for celebrity trade. By the time the business moved to 81st and Madison in 1938, Mr. Campbell was dead and buried four years (solid bronze sarcophagus placed in the family mausoleum in North Bergen, N.J.). His widow, Amelia Klutz Campbell, ran the business until she died in 1948 (cremation, ashes in the mausoleum) and it was sold off. There have been three owners since, but the name has remained, because of the reputation. Long after his death, Frank E. Campbell was quoted widely, particularly after Jessica Mitford's savagely witty 1963 expose, ''The American Way of Death,'' helped shore up a national assault on undertakers by clergymen. Writing about these critics in The New York Times, Homer Bigart said: ''They demand a curb on what they call the neo-pagan corpse worship of the modern funeral. Never keen on embalming, cosmetology, fancy coffins and other frills of funerary art, they want a return to simple, inexpensive and austere rites.'' Eventually the din died down, and funerals got neither cheaper nor less elaborate - they are still the third biggest-ticket purchase for most Americans, after homes and cars - but not before one president of Frank E. Campbell told the press: ''These dames that write these books - they don't want to hear anything good. If you kill sentiment, you're a dead pigeon. The world runs on sentiment.'' Today the business is owned by a Houston outfit, Service Corporation International, the largest funeral parlor operator in the country, whose chairman has characterized it as ''the True Value Hardware of the funeral service industry.'' The chain, according to Eugene Schultz, assistant regional manager of the funeral division, considers Campbell the jewel in its crown. Having said that, Mr. Schultz offered a tour of the facility, volunteering that the 90th anniversary has been duly marked with a $500,000 restoration. Mr. Schultz walked somberly, at a loss for anecdotes, saying the famous dead are brought here because of quality and service and the knowledge that ''we will do everything possible to carry out any family request.'' Asked if he could recall any extraordinary requests, he said, ''Not offhand.'' The five-story funeral home was cool, with air-conditioners humming on each floor, quiet, and lovely, even though the elevator was exceptionally narrow, given its depth.

94-> Wimbledon; Cash Endures For 5-Set Victory
In Argentina, grass is for picnics, not playing tennis. In all of South America, for that matter, red clay is the preferred surface, which might explain why Javier Frana absent-mindedly tapped his shoes with his racquet today during his match against Pat Cash of Australia. Frana, who is ranked only No. 80 in the world and No. 3 in Argentina, is not quite a household name in a country that worships Gabriela Sabatini and considers Guillermo Vilas its patron saint of tennis. Thus, it did not figure that Crocodile Cash, the defending champion at Wimbledon was going to be hard-pressed by a player he beat handily two weeks ago in the Queens Club tournament in London. While Cash did emerge from his second-round match with a victory, his performance was not exactly the tour de force he might have expected it to be. Playing on Court 1, where Boris Becker was upset in the second round last year, Cash was extended to five sets before outlasting Frana, 6-2, 4-6, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4. Lendl Loses a Set On a day when the yellow caution flag was raised for two other highly seeded players, this was the closest of the close calls. Ivan Lendl, who is seeded No. 1, lost the first set to Darren Cahill of Australia, before rallying to advance, 5-7, 6-2, 6-4, 6-4. Henri Leconte of France, No. 7, overcame the loss of the first set to defeat Michael Chang, the 16-year-old American, 2-6, 7-6, 6-2, 6-3. From the balcony of the player's tea room today, all looked serene on the courts below as the seeded players moved on and few shouts of anxiety or frustration could be heard. Cash, though, did begin to get more testy than usual after Frana broke him in the eighth game of the third set, then served out the set to lead, two sets to one. ''Cash made a lot of mistakes,'' Frana said. ''He didn't return well. And I did not come here with any illusions. Once you get on the court, you don't notice where you are.'' The 21-year-old Frana, who has played in seven grass-court tournaments in the last two years, said the surface suited him just fine. He has a hard first serve and a more-than-adequate second serve that kept Cash off balance. His play at the net, though, was mostly an adventure. He appeared content merely to hit his volleys over the net. Cash, on the other hand, handles his racquet like a sword, stabbing, parrying, blocking volleys as well as anyone in the game. He was able to pick off enough of Frana's passing shots to stay in the match until fatigue and the magnitude of the occasion were too much for the Argentine. 'Three Good Sets' ''He played two great sets and I played three good ones,'' Cash said. ''I had a lot of chances throughout the match, but he pulled them out and snuck away. I had to keep putting pressure on him. I didn't think he could keep hitting great shots, and if the match went five sets, I'd win.'' In fact, it looked as if Cash would coast in the final set after breaking Frana twice in the fourth to win easily. The teen-agers who squeal on every point Cash wins - giving the All-England Club the raucous feel of Flushing Meadows - unnerved Frana, who complained to the chair umpire that they were cheering during the points. Still, Frana refused to give up. He won the first game of the final set at love, giving himself a pep talk as he walked to his chair during the break between games. And when he was broken in the third game, he broke back in another display of resolve. The set was even at 2-2. The turning point came in the fifth game with Frana serving and leading, 40-15. He hit a drop volley that Cash raced in to retrieve and smack right back. Undaunted, Frana tried another drop volley, but the deceptively quick Cash speared it again, sending the game to deuce. ''I remember that,'' Frana said in English, the only time he did not use a translator in the interview. Rattled, he then punched a forehand volley over the baseline, then hit a backhand volley wide. Cash had broken for a 3-2 lead and served out the match, losing only 2 points in his last three service games. After Frana walked off the court, Cash indulged his fans, tossing four of his trademark checked headbands into the stands. He did not look like Houdini, making another escape. ''I wasn't that unhappy with my game,'' he said. ''You make it sound as if I played the worst match of my life.

95-> Witness Rebuts A Bribe Charge Against Simon
A defense witness in the racketeering trial of Representative Mario Biaggi testified yesterday that Stanley Simon, the former Bronx Borough President, could not have been at a 1984 meeting in which prosecutors say Mr. Simon extorted money from the Wedtech Corporation. The witness, Harriet Morton, who handled reservations for a reception at Yonkers Raceway, testified that neither Mr. Simon - nor Fred Neuberger, the Wedtech executive from whom Mr. Simon is accused of seeking a bribe - were at the track on June 20, 1984, when the prosecution said the bribe was requested. Ms. Morton, a legal secretary who said she supervised reservations for an annual reception at Yonkers Raceway by the Men's Club of the Hebrew Home for the Aged, in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, said neither Mr. Simon nor Mr. Neuberger, a co-founder of Wedtech, were on her list of people who attended or made donations for the event. Date in Dispute Mr. Simon, who has sat passively through weeks of often embarrassing testimony about his personal and professional life during the trial, chewed his fingernails nervously as another witness, Claire Fraistat, a secretary for the Hebrew Home, said the reception at the raceway attended by Mr. Simon and Mr. Neuberger took place on Nov. 14, 1984, and not in June, as prosecution witnesses had maintained. The defense is expected to argue that the difference in dates is crucial to determining Mr. Simon's guilt or innocence in extorting $50,000 from Wedtech for his help in obtaining approval from the New York City Board of Estimate for a lease by Wedtech of a waterfront property in the Bronx needed to qualify for a Navy pontoon contract. The lease was approved by the city board in July 1984, four months before the Yonkers Raceway meeting described by the defense witnesses. In opening the defense case, Mr. Simon's lawyer, Maurice N. Nessen, produced a photograph of Mr. Simon and Mr. Neuberger taken at the raceway in November. The photo was authenticated by a witness who formerly wrote picture captions for press releases in the Bronx Borough President's office. Mr. Simon, Mr. Biaggi and five others are on trial in Federal District Court in Manhattan on charges of turning Wedtech into a racketeering enterprise that bribed public officials for their help in advancing the company's business interests. Eviction Proceeding Another witness, Susan Frank, a former City Commissioner of Ports and Terminals, testified that Mr. Simon had sought an adjournment of an eviction proceeding by the city against Freedom Industries, the prior tenant of the 100,000-square-foot waterfront plot whose lease was sought by Wedtech. Mrs. Frank, who testified that she had jurisdiction over the property, acknowledged receiving letters from Mayor Koch expressing irritation that Freedom Industries was in arrears on its lease and indicating an interest in finding a more reliable tenant for the city-owned property. Later, Mrs. Frank said, Mr. Simon supported the plan to lease the property to Wedtech. The testimony seemed to diminish the importance of Mr. Simon's role in obtaining the Hunts Point property. At a time when, according to Mrs. Frank's testimony, Mr. Simon was acting on behalf of a prior occupant of the land, the Mayor had already been urging his Ports Commissioner to seek another tenant for the land. Mrs. Frank, who acknowledged testifying in favor of the Wedtech lease, said Mr. Simon ultimately urged his colleagues on the Board of Estimate to approve the lease.

96-> BRIDGE; What's in a Name?
IN the early days of contract bridge, more than half a century ago, Ely Culbertson and his associates were quite imaginative in naming various maneuvers that can arise in dummy-play and defense. They were defeated, however, when it came to a maneuver designed to cut the opponents' communications and called it, rather feebly, the ''coup without a name.'' Another quarter-century passed before the better term ''scissors coup'' came into use. A fine bit of scissoring was executed on the diagramed deal by Marty Bergen of White Plains, one of the country's best players. He was playing with Luella Slaner of Scarsdale N.Y., with whom he has reached the final of the Vanderbilt Knockout. A normal result at other tables was for East-West to play three no-trump scoring 430 or 460. But Bergen, who likes to get into the bidding, arrived in three hearts doubled as shown. His cue bid of two spades was for the upper suits, in this case hearts and diamonds. The size of the penalty, as Bergen was well aware, was crucial: Down two would mean 300 and a top score for him, while down three would 500 and a bottom. The latter seemed much more likely. Recognizing that South would need ruffs, West made a good lead of the heart queen. When this held the trick he shifted to the spade queen. South was in serious trouble, knowing that he would lose at least 800 if East could gain the lead to draw two more rounds of trumps. But there were some clues to the high-card situation: West probably had both minor-suit aces to justify his double of two no-trump. It was time for the scissors, and Bergen produced them. He won the second trick with the spade ace and led the club king, discarding his remaining spade. West won with the ace, should have returned a club, but chose a spade. South ruffed and led the diamond king, another royal sacrifice designed to prevent East from gaining the lead. West won and returned a diamond, as good as anything at this point, and it was ruffed in dummy. Now two more minor-suit ruffs left dummy on lead in this position: Another club was led from dummy and East did the best he could by discarding a spade. When South ruffed and led a diamond he could not be prevented from scoring another trump trick en passant. Bergen the escapologist had wriggled out of his troubles with the aid of his scissors, losing 300 and scoring a matchpoint top. Now consider what might have happened if North had bid three hearts, as she might well have done, instead of waiting for her partner to make that bid. East would no doubt have doubled and led the heart king, crashing his partner's queen. That would be profitable, but not for the declarer. East would continue trumps, and North would be left struggling to make six tricks by establishing the fifth diamond in the dummy. The penalty would be 500. Which suggests another thought: If the East player against Bergen had overtaken the heart queen with the king, arranging his own honor sacrifice before South could demonstrate his own talents in that department, the penalty would have been 500. The sacrifice loses one trick but gains two. The heart queen was a snare and delusion: if West had held a small singleton East would not have missed his way.

97-> Report Accuses Burma Of Torture and Killings
Army units in Burma have killed and tortured members of the country's ethnic minorities in gross defiance of Burmese and international law, according to an Amnesty International report published today. The report by the human rights group says that although many of the reported violations have taken place in areas where ethnic insurgencies have flourished for decades, ''none of the killings or torture by Government forces took place in the context of actual combat.'' Troops appear to be abusing civilians at will, the report says. Amnesty International said that since it was not allowed to send a delegation to the country, the report was compiled from interviews with exiles who fled Burma. The report details 60 cases of what the organization calls ''extrajudicial executions'' of ethnic Karen civilians who were rounded up in their homes or fields. People from the Mon and Kachin ethnic groups also reported cases of forced labor, torture and death at the hands of Burmese counterinsurgency units, as Burma's autocratic head of Government, Ne Win, tries to subdue minorities who do not accept rule from Rangoon. ''So numerous and similar are the accounts of human-rights violations given by the refugees that in Amnesty International's view they show a consistent pattern of gross violations of human rights,'' the report says, adding that none of the refugees questioned had been able to appeal to legal authorities. The report details rapes, stabbings, mutilations and beatings with bamboo sticks. It also describes a technique of rolling bamboo poles up and down over a prisoner's shins until the skin peels from the bones. Some people also said they had been detained in deep underground pits for long periods.

98-> Palestinian Dies in Gaza City From Bullets in Army Clash
A 37-year-old Palestinian man died in a Gaza City hospital this morning of gunshot wounds sustained Sunday. Palestinians said the man, Hani al-Turk, was shot three times in a clash with soldiers. The army confirmed that the wounded man had died. His death brings to at least 209 the number of Palestinians killed since the uprising began in December. After Mr. Turk was buried this afternoon, several hundred mourners marched from the cemetery to his home in the al-Baraj neighborhood of Gaza City. The marchers chanted and waved the outlawed Palestinian flag. Soldiers intervened in the demonstration when the marchers built roadblocks and burned tires in the street near Mr. Turk's house. Troops fired tear gas to disperse the crowd, and several Palestinians were hospitalized for gas inhalation.

102-> Maine Dams Removing Obstructions to Salmon
The winding Saco River meets the sea at this southern Maine city and it is here that John Cadwallader fishes for brown trout, striped bass and bluefish. But he yearns for an Atlantic salmon. Mr. Cadwallader's chances of hooking an Atlantic salmon are not good. A series of dams have stopped most of the fish from traveling up the river beyond Biddeford for perhaps 100 years. Now Mr. Cadwallader and other conservationists want to change that. They are pressing for improved facilities to allow transit by fish held back by the dams. The conservationists have asked state and Federal agencies to tie the re-licensing of hydroelectric facilities at seven dams on the main stem of the 120-mile-long river to the construction of facilities to allow the passage of fish. Conditional License Issued The Central Maine Power Company, which owns six of the dams, is in the process of to re-licensing one of them, the Cataract project. It is actually four impoundments bridging two islands in the river between Biddeford and Saco. The license for the Cataract site expired in December 1987 and it is operating with a temporary permit until the issue of fish transit facilities is resolved. The licenses on two other power company dams on the Saco River will expire in 1993. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has already issued a new license for one dam with the stipulation that a fish passage plan be worked out. What is happening in Maine, as Federal and state agencies, conservationists and the state's largest power company wrestle with how best to return fish to a native habitat, will likely be repeated elsewhere. The licenses for 245 hydroelectric facilities on rivers throughout the country have expired or will expire by 1993. Central Maine Power has offered a plan for fish passage on its Saco River dams, even though they are not all subject to relicensing. The company, which has been trapping salmon and driving them upstream for some time, expects to spend nearly $7 million on fish passage equipment on the Saco River dams, said David Flanagan, senior vice president for law and administration for the power company. Revived River Habitats As president of the Saco River Salmon Club, Mr. Cadwallader has a particular interest in the drive to restock the rivers but he sees a wider concern. ''We're all proud to live in the state of Maine,'' said Mr. Cadwallader, who is a product development engineer for an electronics company in Biddeford. ''We feel the eagle belongs in our skies, the moose in our forest and the Atlantic salmon in our rivers.'' At one time, many of Maine's rivers were so polluted that their water literally peeled the paint off houses. Paper mills, textile mills, tanneries and log drives dumped waste into the rivers, driving out many of the native fish, especially the Atlantic salmon, which are highly sensitive to water quality. The rivers have since been cleaned up under the rules imposed by the Federal Clean Water Act. Wild salmon, once found in 34 rivers in Maine, remain in only 7. Fisheries agencies have been implementing a restoration plan on the Penobscot River since the late 1960's and taking steps to protect the habitat on the rivers that still have wild Atlantic salmon. Focus on Saco River Now, members of the Saco River Salmon Club, the American Salmon Federation and American Rivers Inc., a river conservation organization based in Washington, D.C., say attention should be paid to the Saco, said John Phillips, executive director of the American Salmon Federation. Mr. Phillips said the Saco is a cool, fast-flowing river with a gravel bed, ideally suited for salmon spawning. Federal and state fisheries agencies have asked the power company to build new fish passage facilities at Cataract by 1990 and at Skelton by 2005. The remaining facilities would be installed by 2010 or later, according to the agencies' draft report. Power company officials said the upstream fish passage at Cataract would be operational within two years of the renewal of the license, which may be decided next year. Plans for Hatchery The company said the timetable at all sites should reflect the need for fish transit. ''We believe we should base it on the numbers of fish in the river,'' said Sarah A. Verville, an attorney for the power company. The Saco River Salmon Club hopes to give them the numbers. It is looking for a site for a fish hatchery, which would provide 100,000 one-inch-long salmon for stocking each year beginning in 1990. The state put 25,000 10-inch salmon, or smolts, in the river for the past two years and will continue to stock that many fish until at least 1992, said Ed Baum, program coordinator of the Maine Atlantic Sea Run Salmon Commission, a state agency that oversees salmon management.

103-> U.S. Embassy Holding Up Visas for Soviet Emigres
The American Embassy has temporarily stopped issuing refugee visas to Soviet citizens seeking to emigrate to the United States, preventing thousands of Armenians and dozens of Jews from moving to the West. American diplomats said the suspension, which went into effect Monday, would last until Oct. 1. They said the action, ordered by the State Department over the weekend, was required because of a sudden surge in the number of applicants and budget constraints in Washington. The embassy issued 2,000 refugee visas in June, mostly to Armenians. The number was more than the total approved in the entire 1987 fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, 1986. Earlier this year, State Department officials warned that they might have to suspend refugee admissions because of financial constraints imposed by the Federal budget. A State Department official said in March that the Federal refugee admissions budget - $119.5 million dollars this year - imposed ''an absolute upper limit'' on the number of refugees who could be admitted and at the time warned that ''without additional resources, there will be no way to avoid the suspension of all, or part, of the worldwide refugee admissions program'' in June or July. The suspension does not affect most Soviet Jews seeking to emigrate to the West. Most of them leave the Soviet Union with Israeli visas and apply for refugee status to enter the United States when they reach Western Europe, usually on their regular first stop in Vienna or later in Rome. American diplomats said it was their understanding that the State Department order covered only the American Embassy in Moscow and that the order would not limit refugee visas issued to Soviet citizens in other European capitals. Dozens of Armenians, stunned and angered by the news, waited outside the embassy today, many facing uncertain futures because the exit visas they received from the Soviet Union expire before Oct. 1. Would-be emigrants must get through a long tangle of bureaucracy to receive their Soviet exit visa; only then can they go to the American Embassy and request a United States entry visa valid before the Soviet exit visa expires. The exit visa can almost always be extended, but that process, too, is difficult. ''We gave up our jobs and homes, sold our possessions, said farewell to our friends and came to Moscow with our families in the belief we would soon be departing for the United States,'' said one of the Armenians, Andronik Terzyan. ''Where do we go now, what do we do?'' he asked as he held aloft his Soviet exit visa, which expires July 30. Telegram Sent to Shultz One of the Armenians displayed a notice he had received from the embassy last week inviting him to come to Moscow to pick up his visa on July 8. The notice is now invalid. He said he had sent a telegram to Secretary of State George P. Shultz appealing for help and a reversal of the suspension. Margot Squire, an embassy spokesman, said in a telephone interview: ''We wish to emphasize that this is only a postponement of departure interviews. The embassy is continuing to accept applications from Soviet citizens with exit permission who wish to emigrate to the United States.'' A departure interview with a consular officer is usually the last step before an applicant receives an American visa. The postponement of departure interviews means the postponement of visas as well. Ms. Squire added that the decision was necessitated by ''an unexpected and very large surge in Soviet refugee applications and severe budget constraints.'' A number of other American diplomats said they were distressed by the State Department order both because of the pain to individual applicants and because the decision seemed to contradict longstanding American policy that the Soviet Union should permit increased emigration. Reagan Urged Gorbachev During his visit to Moscow last month, President Reagan urged Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, to remove restrictions on emigration. ''This is a classic case of bureaucratic stupidity and insensitivity,'' an American diplomat said of the State Department order. Because the decision affects primarily Armenians, it may stem in part from a determination in May by State Department lawyers that Armenians were improperly being accepted as refugees without any finding that they have been persecuted. The lawyers said the practice appeared to violate the Refugee Act of 1980, which defines a refugee as a person with ''a well-founded fear of persecution.'' Approval of refugee applications from Armenians has been virtually automatic until now, even though they did not claim persecution when interviewed by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. By gaining refugee status, an immigrant can move to the United States without delay and without meeting various qualifications, including an invitation from a relative living in the United States who is an American citizen. WASHINGTON CONFIRMS MOVE WASHINGTON, July 7 (Special to The New York Times) - State Department officials confirmed today that the embassy was postponing interviews of would-be refugees until October. The Administration recently doubled the refugee ceiling for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, to 30,000 for the current fiscal year. But the Administration did not request, and Congress has not provided, money to pay for additional refugees. State Department officials say the United States pays about $1,800 for transportation, lodging and resettlement aid for each Soviet refugee.

107-> Question of the Week; Are the Red Sox In for Another Fall?
Although the collective shadows of past tragedies loom large (Mike Torrez, Bill Buckner and Calvin Schiraldi), the present squad consists of the exciting blend of veterans, trade acquisitions and youngsters developed from the farm system. Roger Clemens, the consummate power pitcher, may extricate the franchise from the curse of Babe Ruth once and for all. This team seems capable of putting the distractions (the Wade Boggs and the Jim Rice incidents) behind them and concentrating on the matter at hand. The A.L. East has purchased the script of the other divisions, a competitive race in August. MICHAEL R. STINER Macungie, Pa.

108-> ABROAD AT HOME; The Two Americas
Listening to George Bush on Thursday night, I heard echoes of two clashing themes in American life, two strains that have been in conflict through almost all this country's history. One theme is openness, generosity, inclusiveness. It is the spirit that welcomed people of diverse cultures and beliefs - the tired, the poor, the revolutionary - and built them into one nation, indivisible. It is the spirit of freedom, protecting the right of Americans to differ with their neighbors. The other is intolerance, suspiciousness, paranoia. It has been there from the burning of witches in Salem through the Know Nothings of the last century, the Ku Klux Klan, the hatred of Catholics and Jews, to the waves of Red Scares that have stained America in this century. Through much of his acceptance speech, Vice President Bush was deliberately and very effectively inclusive. He spoke as a leader who could put partisan differences aside and bring us together. He borrowed the names and the rhetoric of Presidents who are Democratic heroes. ''I hate war,'' Mr. Bush said. Those of us who are old enough could hear the voice of Franklin D. Roosevelt speaking those same words with such memorable emphasis just before the United States was engulfed in World War II. Then Mr. Bush did the once unthinkable and actually mentioned Franklin Roosevelt's name at a Republican convention. He brought up to date F.D.R.'s 1940 slogan that the country shouldn't change horses in midstream. He invoked the name of John F. Kennedy. And he used the old Democratic cry about Social Security: ''Don't let them take it away.'' All that is fair enough in politics. Indeed, it is more than fair. The President of the United States has to speak for all of us. It is wise for a candidate to articulate what we have in common. George Bush was Presidential when he spoke that way on Thursday night, just as Michael Dukakis was at the Democratic Convention. He made us think of this as one country, where political opponents respect each other's patriotism. But that was not all of the speech. ''My opponent,'' Mr. Bush said, ''sees America as another pleasant country on the U.N. roll-call, somewhere between Albania and Zimbabwe.'' It was a crude appeal to the xenophobic strain in American history, the fear of and contempt for foreigners. Then came the red meat for the radical right. Mr. Bush had a laundry list of proposals treasured by the religious fundamentalists and movement conservatives who now dominate the Republican Party. It was the so-called social agenda: capital punishment, school prayer, guns, making abortion a crime again. A few minutes before, Mr. Bush had said: ''I believe that power must always be kept close to the individual.'' But now he was saying that the state should deny individual women freedom of choice in their most fundamental personal decision. He was demanding that schools engage in the religious exercise of prayer even though that would isolate some individual children and hold them up to the contempt of the majority. And there again was the attack on Governor Dukakis because he vetoed a bill to make all schoolchildren recite the Pledge of Allegiance - a bill that would have violated a Supreme Court decision. It was a classic example of the worst strain in American politics, the attack on an opponent's patriotism: as if patriotism could be engendered by forcing some people to voice words in violation of their religious faith. The convention audience loved it, of course. That is why Mr. Bush said those things, and said them in the emotional way he did. He has to prove himself one of them. He has to show that a sophisticated Easterner, a former Ambassador to the United Nations, is really suspicious of foreigners. He has to sound intolerant of people with different social and religious values. He has to sound like Pat Robertson. Mr. Bush accomplished a lot in that speech. He fairly emphasized prosperity and peace. If he sticks to those issues, he will be a formidable opponent to Michael Dukakis. But he missed the ultimate opportunity to be a statesman. He still left us in doubt about who the real Bush is, and whether he knows himself. ''I hope to stand for a new harmony,'' he said, ''a greater tolerance . . . I want a kinder, gentler nation.'' If only he had kept to that spirit himself.

109-> Review/Recital; Five Works for Organ
Marilyn Mason has spent the last 41 years commissioning and performing new concert works for the organ, and so when she was named International Performer of the Year by the New York Chapter of the American Guild of Organists, it was natural that she should select the program of her award recital - given Tuesday evening at Riverside Church - from the repertory she has brought into being. Five works were played, two short and three long. An opening ''Flourish and Chorale'' by Michael McCabe, composed last year, was surprisingly triadic (ending on a lush added-sixth chord) and had the tone of Stravinsky's neo-Classicism or even of slightly austere Puccini. The other single-movement piece was a ''dithyramb'' from 1960 by Alec Wyton, attractively put together but well mannered in a way that would suggest some other title. Edmund Haines's ''Suite for Organ'' was the very first work Miss Mason commissioned, and it holds up well, each of its three movements short and to the point, the overall feeling one of confident, unadventurous mid-century American traditionalism. The ''Organbook II'' of William Albright (who studied with Miss Mason at the University of Michigan) is a kind of Halloween triptych, with a ''Night Procession'' of scampering sounds and tu-whit-tu-whoos, a ''Toccata Satanique'' that sounded right for a spooky animated film, and a movement with electronic tape called ''Last Rites,'' ending in a sonic buildup that ultimately registered as sub-musical but impressive. The program closed with William Bolcom's fourth book of ''Gospel Preludes,'' imaginative treatments of familiar hymns and spirituals that drew on popular and (beautifully, in ''Sweet Hour of Prayer''), Ivesian models. In all this, Miss Mason was an expert advocate, playing with firm rhythm, rationing out the bone-crunching climaxes so as to preserve their effectiveness and using the varied resources of the big organ musically.

110-> N.F.L.; Quebec Welcomes a Taste of the N.F.L.
In English or en francais, the message should be clear to Canadians: the Americans are coming. Today, a contingent that included Quebec's Minister of Tourism and more than 20 Canadian reporters visited the Jets' training camp to interview the players and coaches about the Molson Challenge, an exhibition football game to be played in Quebec Aug. 18. While the Jets and the Cleveland Browns may look at it as just another preseason game, some Quebecois see it as a chance to show that they can support N.F.L. football. Chance to Show Support ''There are a lot of political aspects involved, but some people are saying it is a game to demonstrate that Montreal could generate enough interest for an N.F.L. franchise,'' said Michel Gratton, the provincial Tourism Minister. The game will be held at Olympic Stadium, where the Alouettes of the Canadian Football League played before dropping out of the C.F.L. two years ago. At one time, the Alouettes averaged almost 60,000 fans, but they folded for lack of interest. Molson will join the International Management Group, a sports-oriented firm, as sponsor of the game. IMG has negotiated television contracts for the Olympics and for the N.F.L.'s overseas exhibition games. Barry Frank, the senior group vice president of IMG, was cautious. ''Officially, no one is saying this is a demonstration game,'' he said. ''It's just a way for Molson's to get summertime interest.'' The Jets and the Browns have each been guaranteed about $300,000. Promoters could make that much or more if crowd estimates are correct. Gratton said that 25,000 seats of 59,000 have already been sold, and he predicted that the game would be sold out. Attention From the North This game will be closely watched on both sides of the border. There is interest in putting N.F.L. franchises in Montreal and Toronto, although that is thought to be unlikely as long as the C.F.L. remains in business; the Canadian Government has made it clear that it would try to block such efforts. Toronto has a C.F.L. team, the Argonauts. Canada is also attractive to the N.F.L. as a place to expand its television market. Gratton thought it amusing that the county he represents as a member of the provincial government is Gatineau. He posed for pictures with Mark Gastineau of the Jets and explained that Gastineau was the original spelling of Gatineau. Gastineau, pursuing the French-Canadian connection, said his great-grandfather had emigrated from Quebec. Visitors Are Welcomed The Jets' president, Steve Gutman, wore a Molson Challenge sweatshirt as he welcomed the Canadian visitors to the Jets' new auditorium, a room with more than 60 large seats, a screen that slides into the ceiling, and an overhead projector. It was the first time anyone had used the room, which was finished minutes before the news conference began. Gratton said the Jets would be the home team against the Browns. He said that about 25 percent of those attending the game would be from outside the province. The Jets will fly to Montreal the day before the game and practice on the field. The game, which starts at 7:30 P.M., will be televised in New York later that night on Channel 11. ----Line Shaping Up The Jets finally got the new left side of their offensive line working together when Mike Haight returned to his left-guard spot this afternoon. He had been suffering from back problems. . . . Dave Cadigan needed only one practice to install himself, as expected, as the new left tackle. The projected starting line still has not worked together. Reggie McElroy was given the afternoon off at right tackle. . . . The Redskins' scrimmage against the Jets, in Easton, Pa., on Saturday will be televised in Washington. Last week, a broadcast of the Redskins' rookie scrimmage against the New England Patriots outdrew a major league baseball broadcast in Washington.

111-> Baseball: American League; Red Sox Beat Royals, 7-6, on Homer in 9th
Leading off the ninth inning today, Kevin Romine hit his first major league home run, capping a comeback from a 6-0 deficit and giving the Boston Red Sox a 7-6 victory over the Kansas City Royals. Romine hit Steve Farr's second pitch into the left-field screen for his first homer in 108 times at bat in the big leagues, giving the interim Red Sox manager, Joe Morgan, his third victory without a loss. Kansas City, swept in a doubleheader in Morgan's debut Friday, led, 6-0, through five innings, but the Red Sox scored four runs in the sixth and tied it in the eighth on Dwight Evans's two-run homer. Evans did not start because of a hamstring pull, but he got into the game as a pinch-hitter in the sixth. The Royals jumped to a 2-0 lead in the first on George Brett's sacrifice fly and a run-scoring double by Danny Tartabull. Bo Jackson made it 3-0 with his 12th homer in the second, hitting Dennis (Oil Can) Boyd's first pitch of the inning off the back wall in center to the right of the flagpole. Seitzer's double and a single by Brett made it 4-0 before Boyd left with no outs in the third. Mark Gubicza blanked Boston on three hits until he wilted in 98-degree heat in the sixth. The Red Sox broke through on singles by Marty Barrett, Wade Boggs and Mike Greenwell. With one out, Jim Rice walked, filling the bases. After Todd Benzinger fouled out, Rich Gedman lined a two-run single, making it 6-3. Gubicza then walked Evans, with Rice scoring on Mike MacFarlane's passed ball on ball four. Gubicza was replaced by Jeff Montgomery, who got out of the inning. In the first game Friday night, a 3-1 Red Sox victory, Roger Clemens pitched a five-hitter and struck out 16 Royals for the second time this season. He lowered his earned run average to 2.29. Clemens pitched his ninth complete game and increased his major league-leading total to 202 strikeouts, the third straight season he's had more than 200. He fanned at least 10 for the 10th time this season and 31st time in his career, both team records. Tigers 10, Angels 1 ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) - Jeff Robinson continued his mastery over California with a four-hitter over eight innings, and Matt Nokes and Gary Pettis hit homers in a five-run fifth inning as Detroit ended the Angels' seven-game winning streak. Robinson (11-3) improved his season record against the Angels to 3-0. The first two victories were complete games, and he has allowed only 12 hits and two runs in the three games. ''To me, the Angels aren't any different than the Yankees or Boston or any other team,'' Robinson said after he stopped the Tigers' three-game losing streak. ''Every game, I just try to make them hit the ball and hope someone makes the play. We do have a great defense.'' ''He pitched another very strong game,'' the California manager, Cookie Rojas, said of Robinson. ''He changes speeds well on the curve and slider and comes right at you.'' The Angels took a 1-0 lead in the second inning on Tony Armas's sacrifice fly. But the Tigers, held hitless for three and one-third innings by Willie Fraser (6-9), took control in the fifth. Luis Salazar and Dave Bergman singled with one out and scored on Nokes's 11th homer. Ray Knight singled to keep the rally going, and Pettis followed with his third homer. Robinson carried a two-hitter into the seventh inning, but California threatened on singles by Bob Boone and Devon White. Johnny Ray hit a sharp line drive down the first-base line, but Knight made a diving catch and crawled to first base in time to double up White. The Tigers scored five more runs in the ninth, one on a balk by Stu Cliburn, two on Lou Whitaker's seventh homer and two on Darrell Evans's single. Guillermo Hernandez struck out the side in the ninth for the Tigers. Athletics 4, Blue Jays 1 OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) - Jose Canseco drove in three runs for Oakland, raising his r.b.i. total to 70. With three runs in the third, the Athletics took a 3-1 lead and broke a string of 19 consecutive scoreless innings. Luis Polonia tied the score with a run-scoring single and Canseco hit a two-run double. Canseco, now three behind Boston's Mike Greenwell among American League r.b.i. leaders, made the score 4-1 with a sacrifice fly in the fifth. Storm Davis (7-4) yielded six hits in seven innings, for the victory. Dave Stieb (10-6), without a victory in his last four starts, was the loser. Dennis Eckersley pitched two hitless innings for his major league-leading 27th save. He entered the game with runners on second and third and no outs in the eighth and got a strikeout and two fly outs to end the threat. Twins 4, Orioles 3 BALTIMORE (AP) - Kirby Puckett hit a two-run homer in the first inning, and Greg Gagne and Gary Gaetti added home runs for Minnesota. The Twins' starter, Fred Toliver, pitched seven innings of five-hit baseball in 90-degree-plus temperatures to record his first American League victory. The well-traveled 27-year-old, who began in the Yankee organization, is 1-1 this season. Puckett's homer brought home Dan Gladden, who opened the game with the first of his three hits, a double to left. Gagne hit his homer leading off in the fifth; Gaetti hit his as the first batter in the sixth. It was the 21st of the season for Gaetti, who is second in the league behind Oakland's Jose Canseco, who has 24.

114-> DINING OUT; Captivating Country Cousin
MANHATTAN is invading Long Island. This time it's more than the summer migration to the Hamptons. New York restaurateurs have found Long Island to be fertile ground. In the last year or two, Italian restaurants have led the parade of transplants: Sempre Vivolo in Hauppauge, Cirella's in Melville, Wainscott's Sapore di Mare and Villa Gattopardo in the village of Roslyn. Villa Gattopardo is owned by Mario Gattorna, who also owns Il Gattopardo on 56th Street in the city. This Long Island country cousin is quite a charmer. Located in a 130-year-old Italianate-style mansion in historic Roslyn Village, it captivates with elegance upstairs and homeyness down. The upper dining rooms have rich burgundy carpeting, white marble fireplaces, mirrors and cut flowers on the tables. Below, it's terra cotta tile floors, rush-bottom chairs and antique sideboards. The kitchen's successes mirror a stroll in the Appenines. Appetizers hold the low ground but salads begin the ascent. Pastas hint at the heights and entrees reach the pinnacle. Desserts descend back to the foothills. It's possible to have a mountaintop experience at appetizer time, though, by choosing the seafood salad. Served at room temperature, the full flavor of the tender calamari, shrimp and scallops comes through. Tantalizing, too, is its topping of chopped fresh tomatoes and basil. Among the appetizer also-rans, I recommend the filigree-crusted fried zucchini, the light and fresh stuffed eggplant and the tender clams casino bathed in a sweet red pepper sauce. But, clams posillipo are large and chewy. Carpaccio, listed with artichokes, had none. Crostini, toast topped with a thin slice of winter-quality tomato and melted mozzarella is overwhelmed by fishy-tasting sardines. (Not mentioned on the menu.) The pasta e fagioli (pasta and bean soup) got raves from our waiter but only a passing nod from soup eaters. There are three salads on the menu. The spinach is tops. It's slightly wilted, the bacon is crisp, the mushrooms abundant. Caesar is acceptable, but the tricolored salad disappoints. If there is endive there, I missed it. In its place is timid leaf lettuce. Also lacking in assertiveness is the listlessly seasoned dressing. Pastas are positives. The hay and straw (yellow and green noodles) intertwined with earthy porcini mushrooms is splendid. Also right on the mark are the light tomato sauces on the rigatoni and the penne. At entree time, it would be hard to beat the simple broiled veal chop. It's tender, juicy and everything it should be. For a better test of the kitchen's capabilities, roast veal stuffed with prosciutto, spinach, mushrooms and cheese and napped with a hearty wine sauce is a matrix of taste delights. It is rare that Brunello di Montalcino, Italy's premier wine, is used in a sauce. Beef lovers will find just that on two butter-tender filet mignons. The broiled sirloin steak is prime and cooked correctly. Chicken scarpariello is not. It's dry and remarkable only for its blandness. Pescavores are not forgotten. Broiled swordfish snuggled below a mantle of chopped tomatoes and basil is exemplary. Pleasing, too, is broiled salmon escorted by a tangy dijonnaise sauce. Shrimp sauteed with garlic, tomato and balsamic vinegar is an appealing assemblage. The sauce is smooth and highlights rather than smothers the seafood. Desserts, however, are a letdown. The chocolate mousse had the right dark, dense consistency but tastes only of sugar, not chocolate. Tiramisu was a soggy mishmosh one evening, more acceptable another. Pastries are brought in from elsewhere and are unexceptional. My favorite dessert was fresh strawberries and creamy vanilla ice cream, but the $7 price tag (not listed on the menu) seemed out of line with the $4 tab for other desserts. Villa Gattopardo has a wine list that is long on Italian choices and short on imagination. It offers exactly what you would expect: Chianti, Barbera, Corvo, Frascati, Orvieto. Prices begin at $16 and there are a good number of selections between that and $19. The Barbera D'Albe Aldo Conterno (1985), priced at $19, was a light, fragrant, tannic red wine suitable for summer drinking.

115-> BRITISH OPEN; Heavy Rain Forces A Rare Suspension
The third round of the 117th British Open was wiped out today by a steady rain that flooded a number of greens at the Royal Lytham St. Annes links. Then the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews, which conducts this tournament, the oldest in the sport, promptly set about causing considerable confusion about the next two rounds. At first, the club announced that the final two rounds would be played Sunday as a 36-hole affair for the 71 golfers left in the field. A tee time for each player was announced and posted in many of the hotels in Lytham St. Annes and Blackpool. But three hours later, at 6 P.M., as rains increased and the fairways became flooded, the club announced another change. Now the third round of 18 holes will be played Sunday and the final 18-hole round Monday. That will make this British Open the first of the 117 to extend to Monday. And the weather forecast is not good. 'I'll Believe Anything' Mark McCumber and Gary Player, who were staying in the Pembroke Hotel in Blackpool, learned of the change while eating dinner with their families. ''I'm not sure they can do this,'' McCumber said. ''Never heard of such a thing.'' ''Unbelievable,'' said Player, who won here in 1974. ''But I'll believe anything, I guess.'' When the third round begins, Nick Price of South Africa will be holding a one-shot lead over Seve Ballesteros of Spain. They have scores of five-under-par 137 and four-under 138, respectively. Nick Faldo, the defending champion, was tied with Craig Stadler at 140 with Andy Bean at 141. None of these golfers had teed off today when play was called at 12:23 P.M. But there were 35 players on the course, strung out from the first through the 16th holes, when play was halted. One was Hubert Green, who opened with five straight 3's and birdied five of the first seven holes. Since all today's scores were erased, Green and everyone else must start the third round again. The 41-year-old Alabama golfer, who won the 1977 United States Open, had just hit to the eighth green when the committee suspended play. Later in the locker room, Green shrugged and said, ''What can you do? I'm used to it.'' Tom Watson didn't seem bothered, although the five-time winner of the British Open was two under par for four holes today. Other Washouts This marked the first time in 27 years that a day of the British Open was completely washed out. In 1961, the third and fourth rounds were wiped out by a severe wind and rain storm on a Friday at Royal Birkdale, another English links 20 miles south of Lytham St. Annes and also on the Irish Sea. The two final rounds were played Saturday, when Arnold Palmer won the first of his two consecutive British Open titles. The year before that, at St. Andrews in Scotland, the closing two rounds Friday were washed out by a thunderstorm and played on Saturday. Kel Nagle of Australia won with Palmer second. The first round of the 1970 Open at St. Andrews was suspended by a storm and resumed the next morning before the next round. Tony Jacklin, the defending champion and the first Englishman to win the tournament in 19 years, was the leader at the time of suspension. But Jack Nicklaus went on to win that Open. Today's rare suspension came on a day with little wind but very heavy rains that started around midnight. Unlike most other links courses used for the British Open, Royal Lytham St. Annes sits low and flat about half a mile from the coast. The greens, many of which are nestled below the fairways, do not drain well. Also, the water table here is quite high and the soil is not very sandy. It was impossible, despite some work with squeegees, to keep the greens at No. 9, No. 10, No. 11 and No. 12 from accumulating water faster than it could be pushed off. Strong winds reaching 38 miles an hour plagued the original 153 players here Thursday. Then bright sunshine accompanied the strong breezes yesterday.

117-> Yachting; Gilmour Defending Liberty Cup Title
Peter Gilmour has gained a reputation in the last two years as the newest hotshot in sailing, a 27-year-old upstart from Western Australia who is not afraid to take on the likes of Dennis Conner. In person, Gilmour is soft-spoken and nearly shy. A tall, lanky redhead with blue eyes and a cherubic smile, he looks too polite to be a fighter. But Gilmour is all of that. In the final America's Cup races in Australia last year, Gilmour steered the 12-Meter Kookaburra III at the start of each race against Conner's 12-Meter, Stars & Stripes. Conner's boat won the regatta and the America's Cup, but it wasn't for a lack of effort from Gilmour. The sailor from Perth is in New York this week to defend his Liberty Cup title. The regatta, which began in New York Harbor yesterday, is one of 10 major match-racing events in the world. At the Liberty Cup, eight teams sail a series of round-robin races aboard identical 28-foot Beneteau sloops. The boats sail in pairs, one on one, until each team has sailed four races a day. The finals between the top two boats are scheduled for Sunday. Six Races Postponed Light and shifting winds yesterday forced regatta officials to postpone six races until today. Gilmour and his four-man crew beat Ryozo Tanaka of Japan in the first round, but lost to Pelle Petterson of Sweden in the second. The 1987 New York series was one of six match-racing events Gilmour won in the last year; he lost three others. ''Match racing is a very difficult club to break into,'' he said before the races yesterday. ''Sailing as I did in the beginning on Kookaburra, I was there only until they found someone better. But that second person never materialized. That experience two years ago gave me the invitation to go match racing now.'' The circuit is one of the most elite in yachting, a breeding ground for the best and brightest in the sport. For Gilmour, it is his tonic until another America's Cup regatta. ''We are really just marking time,'' he said. ''We are on standby.'' Gilmour is part of a revitalized Australian syndicate formed from the ruins of the Kookaburra campaign. The group is backed by Paul Ramsey of Sydney. Australian Endeavour, as the group is now called, is spending about $1.2 million each year biding its time. A team of 25 sailing experts work on the project, 14 of whom are devoted to boat design. Gilmour is the team's sailing director. Iain Murray, the former skipper of Kookaburra III with Gilmour, is manager. Waiting for Ruling The Endeavour group sits knee-deep in the same legal quagmire as other America's Cup hopefuls. No one can move ahead with a challenge until a court battle between New Zealand, as the 1988 cup challenger, and the San Diego Yacht Club, as defender, is resolved. In the 12-Meter world championship in Sweden last week, Gilmour and Murray won the regatta. They beat Conner, who wasn't on Stars & Stripes, but was sailing as skipper on Gilmour's old boat, Kookaburra II. ''It was quite fascinating to see the whole demeanor of our crew change the day we were to sail Dennis,'' Gilmour said. ''Everyone was up early. We got out there on the water, had an even start, and were no more than 10 feet from each other all the way through the run. When we got to the leeward mark, they fouled up a little, and we were able to sail around and underneath them. That was the race. I felt that Dennis was under a lot of pressure out there to win.'' Like most world-class yachtsmen, Gilmour grew up sailing. His first boat was an 8-foot dinghy, and he was 7 years old. His father, an orthopedic surgeon, encouraged the five Gilmour children to sail. Peter Gilmour could think of little else. ''Whenever I was out on the water, I would try to be steering,'' Gilmour said. ''Even when we were on a tow, I would sit there and steer. I guess it was kind of a funny relationship with the water. But I always wanted to be in control.'' Fails to Make Olympic Team As Gilmour grew older, his father urged him to go into medicine. Instead, he studied mechanical engineering for three years. In 1983, Gilmour left school to start his own marketing firm. At about the same time, he failed to win a place on the 1984 Olympic team, coming in second to the trials winner in the Soling Class. His business was going well, but he was still preoccupied by sailing. Two years into Gilmour's marketing venture, Murray telephoned. He was building the framework for a 1986-87 Kookaburra campaign, and invited Gilmour to join. ''It was too good to pass up, with the America's Cup in our own back yard,'' Gilmour said. ''I called my partner and said, 'It's all yours. I'm going sailing.' '' Gilmour looks at racing the way a mathematician looks at numbers. He thrives on strategy and a measure of the unexpected. In the Liberty Cup regatta, he has found large quantities of both. The currents are strong in the area of the race course - between Liberty Island and Battery Park -and harbor traffic is heavy. ''I enjoy it, but a lot of people don't,'' he said. ''It's far different from what you normally encounter in yacht racing. But it adds another parameter to the sailing. That's one of the problems in the world, there's no intellectual challenge.'' Jobson Leads Gary Jobson, skipper of the United States team, led at the end of yesterday's races with a 3-0 record. Other results were: Petterson, 2-0; Bertrand Pace of France, 2-1; Gilmour, 1-1; Tim Law of Britain, 1-1; Brad Butterworth of New Zealand, 1-2; Tanaka, 0-2; and Greg Tawaststjerna of Canada, 0-3.

119-> WASHINGTON TALK: NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH; BATTLING WITH CONGRESS OVER PRIORITIES ON HEART
In the latest flare-up of an old struggle, the National Institutes of Health, arguably the most important biomedical research institution in the world, is being forced by Congress to expand two areas of research it would rather avoid. Last week a small band of Senators, exerting pressure behind the scenes, forced Dr. Claude Lenfant, director of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, to reinstate an artificial heart program that he had chosen for termination. At the same time a far broader Congressional campaign, operating in the full glare of public hearings, seemed virtually certain to force the institutes to establish a new institute for research on deafness over the objections of top Federal health officials. The episodes raise anew the question of who should have the dominant voice in setting priorities for national health research, and how. They also vividly demonstrate a Washington truism: a politician's first priority lies with the people back home. Top institute officials typically argue that scientific administrators and experts know best which research areas are ripe for exploitation. The institutes should largely be allowed to exercise their best judgment, these officials say, free of the influence of politically powerful lobbyists who might force funds into unproductive areas. The View From Congress But powerful Congressmen often complain that the institutes take an elitist approach, ignoring the health problems the public considers most important, and that only Congress is truly fit to make the essentially political judgments involved in deciding whether to allocate major resources to a neglected area of health research. The National Institutes of Health are a conglomeration of 12 research institutes, most of them housed on a sprawling, green campus in Bethesda, Md. The institutes conduct research in their own laboratories and support most of the biomedical research carried out at medical schools, universities and other such centers around the country. In forcing the reinstatement of the artificial heart program, senators from states that had artificial heart contracts took the lead. But many senators say the institutes made a bad mistake in trying to close a high-technology program that could have important long-range effect on heart patients and on the race for international supremacy in biomedical technology. The quest for an artificial heart has consumed $240 million in Federal support in the past quarter-century. In the latest phase, the heart institute in January awarded contracts to four research teams to develop a fully implantable artificial heart, a major advance over the current artificial hearts that must be attached to bulky power sources outside the body. But only four months after the contracts were awarded, Dr. Lenfant announced that he would terminate them at the end of the fiscal year because new evidence showed that a lesser device, a partial artificial heart, the left ventricular assist, was nearly ready for clinical testing in humans. Two Senators Step In There was not enough money to pursue both devices, Dr. Lenfant said, so the total artificial heart, which would not be ready for 10 to 15 years, if ever, would be abandoned for the time being and funds transferred to test the partial heart. An advisory panel agreed that if a choice had to be made, the partial device should take precedence, but they urged that money be found to continue both programs. Then Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, which has long been the nation's leading center for developing artificial hearts, stepped in. According to his spokesman, the Senator telephoned Dr. Lenfant to urge him to change his mind and then called a meeting at which senators from affected states leaned on Dr. Lenfant. Finally, Mr. Hatch drafted legislation that would have required the National Institutes of Health to carry out existing programs like the artificial heart program before starting anything new in other areas. The pressure became irresistible after Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, a state that is also home to an artificial heart contract, joined the fray at Senator Hatch's request. Mr. Kennedy is chairman of the committee that handles the institutes' budget. and Mr. Hatch is its ranking Republican. Dr. Lenfant resisted at first, but in the end had little choice. His superiors, fearing that all their future programs would be in jeopardy, forced him to ''eat a little crow,'' as one official put it. Close associates say he was upset at the ''loss of face'' and resented the Congressional encroachment. No Effort to Debate, He Says Dr. Lenfant says he does not contest the right of Congress to make such decisions, but only the way this particular one was made, by a handful of senators in private negotiations with the institutes. ''I'm not upset to be overruled,'' he said. ''Even the President is overruled by Congress.'' But in the entire transaction, he said, ''nobody was much interested in my original reasons'' for canceling the program. ''If I see a weakness,'' he said, ''it was that there was no deliberate effort to debate the thing publicly. It troubles me that the issue became me against the four contractors instead of one scientific viewpoint against another.'' Dr. Lenfant said he would now cancel plans to accelerate testing of the left ventricular assist device and review his options. Meanwhile, the House Energy and Commerce Committee approved a bill last week to establish a new institute for the Federal grouping to conduct research on deafness and other communication disorders. The new institute is opposed by N.I.H. and the Department of Health and Human Services on the grounds that such research can be adequately carried out in other institutes at the existing institutes and establishing a new one will simply add annual management and costs of about $4.6 million for no good reason. Top N.I.H. officials have long held , that Congress is too likely to be swayed by ''disease of the month'' lobbyists to establish new research institutes. In 1984, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences, a prestigious private organization that conducts studies for government agencies, contended, ''N.I.H. has reached a point at which there should be a presumption - to be overridden only in exceptional circumstances -against additions at the institute level.'' But virtually all those who are familiar with the situtation agree that the proposed deafness institute is certain to win Congressional approval. It is backed by a wide range of Democrats and Republicans, including several top Congressional leaders. It has been promoted by Geraldine D. Fox, representing the New York-based Deafness Research Foundation. She has argued persuasively that the institutes have devoted far too little money to help this country's 2 million deaf people and about 26 million others with hearing impairments. ''We've been disappointed by the lack of commitment to the problems of deafness'' at the institutes, said Representative Henry Waxman, Democrat of California, who heads a House health subcommittee. But Dr. Samuel Thier, president of the Institute of Medicine, whose 1984 report urged establishing a formal administrative process to weigh establishing new institutes, lamented the rush by Congress to create the deafness institute. ''This is exactly what we were trying to avoid,'' he said. ''Creating more and more administrative structures puts more of the available resources into administration.''

120-> County's Savings Banks Still Profitable
The thrift industry, created to help Americans realize the dream of home ownership, is now in danger of having its foundation collapse. Five hundred and fifteen of the nation's 3,118 savings and loan institutions are bankrupt and another 300 to 500 are nearly insolvent. Almost one-third of the savings and loans in the country lost money last year - an estimated $13.4 billion - and the red ink continues to flow. According to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the federally insured savings and loans lost $3.78 billion during the first quarter of this year, with 20 of the worst-off institutions - mostly in Texas, where 133 of 279 savings and loans are considered insolvent - responsible for $3 billion of the losses. By contrast, the thrifts in New York State were among the most profitable in the nation during the first three months of the year, earning a total profit of $41 million. The thrifts in Westchester are among the most profitable of all those in New York State. Fourth Year of Strength According to Paul A. Schosberg, president of the New York League of Savings Institutions, a trade organization based in Scarsdale, savings institutions in the state are experiencing one of the longest periods of sustained growth in industry history. ''Although banks and thrifts have racked up losses in states like Texas, where the economy has been disrupted by crises in energy and agriculture, our savings institutions are in their fourth straight year of strong profitability,'' Mr. Schosberg said. According to Mr. Schosberg, the crisis in the thrift industry is partly because of the state banking-deregulation laws in states like Texas and California; these measures were instituted before deregulation of banking by the Federal Government and permitted thrift institutions to enter new businesses such as direct lending to commercial real-estate projects. ''The banking boards in those states gave their thrift institutions new powers, but they didn't beef up their ability to supervise and examine their activities,'' Mr. Schosberg said. ''On the other hand, New York State was one of the last to deregulate - as recently as eight years ago - and only after adequate safeguards and state examiners were appointed.'' Last year, the thrift industry lost $7.6 billion, making it the worst year since the Depression, yet in New York State the league's 64 savings and loan members and 20 savings bank members showed an increase. ''Total deposits held by our members, which now stand at $44.18 billion, had increased by $2.02 billion since May 1987,'' Mr. Schosberg said. He added that on the mortgage side of the business, league members closed $794 million in new mortgage loans in May and committed an additional $1.13 billion in loans to be closed within 60 to 90 days. Lending at 75% of Last Year's ''All mortgage lending has been running at a rate equal to about 75 percent of last year's record levels, or on a par with the activity in 1986,'' Mr. Schosberg said. ''We're encouraged by the fact that lenders committed some $2.5 billion to future loans in April and May.'' He added: ''Westchester has historically had exceptionally strong thrift institutions. Even during the worst period, a time of double-digit interest rates and inflation, Westchester thrifts had rainy day money, a strong cushion of reserves to fall back on.'' Mr. Schosberg said that the conservative management favored by Westchester banking executives was a prime reason for the stability of Westchester thrifts. ''The officials are skilled managers who set boundaries on their marketing areas; they don't compete head to head with large banking institutions,'' he explained. ''They are also very prudent when it comes to lending and expansion; they don't open branches on every street corner. Branches are very expensive propositions and rarely return a profit before the end of the first year. Bankers here tend more to concentrate on controling costs through the use of efficient operating procedures.'' In rating banks, size is no longer a significant aspect, Mr. Schosberg emphasized. ''Sound Federal Savings and Loan in Mamaroneck has assets of $137 million, making it a small institution, yet it is a very successful and profitable one.'' Planned Growth and Prudence Paul Starck, president and chief operating officer of Sound Federal Savings and Loan, said planned growth and prudent lending has kept Sound Federal profitable since its founding in 1891. Noting that the institution has almost twice the capital required by the Federal Home Loan Bank regulations, Mr. Starck said: ''Regulations require us to have a net worth of $4 million; however, our net worth is well above that figure, almost $10 million,'' he said. ''In all the years we've been in business, we have opened only two branch offices: one in Harrison and one in Rye Brook. And our prime source of business is still concentrated on making first mortgages to customers in those communities.'' Sound Federal has served generations of customers in the same family, Mr. Starck said. ''We have very strong roots in the community,'' he added. ''I have been with the bank since 1949, and many of our executives have been on the job for 15 to 20 years. When it comes to lending, local knowledge is important. We know our customers will pay us back.'' Richard F. Komosinski, president of the 100-year-old Yonkers Savings and Loan Association, the third oldest savings and loan in the state, agrees that strong roots in the community are important to savings and loan associations. Mr. Komosinski said the three offices of Yonkers Savings have been able to increase their mortgage activity this year thanks to competitive home-equity rates and through making loans to customers for cooperative apartments. 'Knowing Your Customers' ''Yonkers has a lot of apartments,'' Mr. Komosinski said. ''Co-op loans are becoming a nice area of business for us. The difference between success and failure is knowing your customers and your community; knowing where your investment is going. We stick strictly to the area we know best - Yonkers. About 85 percent of the loans we make are on properties in Yonkers and the other 15 percent on properties in adjacent communities. We wouldn't think of going out of state today. Last year we earned profits of almost $700,000, and this year we expect to be even more profitable.'' In discussing the billions lost by insolvent savings and loans institutions, Mr. Komosinski said: ''Some states allowed wheeling and dealing entrepreneurs and real-estate people who knew nothing about the savings and loan industry to enter it. The president of one institution was a dentist and another was in the construction industry and both were out to make a killing.'' And matters were made worse, in Mr. Komosinski's view, when the shaky thrifts began to raise interest rates to attract depositors, forcing the solvent banks to follow suit. ''Not only did they force us to raise rates,'' he said, ''but last year the insurance premiums - the $225,000 we had to pay to fund the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation - were in part due to these insolvent banks.'' Regulators in the state, Mr. Komosinski said, have enough safeguards in place to monitor the activities of New York savings and loans properly. ''A red flag is triggered whenever something out of the ordinary happens,'' he said, ''such as large investments in personal and commercial loans or changes in direction of management, and examiners will look at the institution before it gets in trouble.'' The profitability of New York's savings institutions has attracted out-of-state bank branches, said Mr. Schosberg, who added that the strong housing market and the economic diversity of Westchester business has made the county one of the most desirable locations for banking activities. 'Far Better Than Projections' The Great Western Bank of New York - whose parent is the third largest savings bank in the nation, Great Western Financial Corporation with headquartered in Beverly Hills, Calif. - opened an office in White Plains 10 months ago. In that time, said Malcolm Lewis, vice president in charge of the White Plains office, the branch bank has amassed deposits of $27 million. ''We have done far better than our projections,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''We opened in Westchester despite the heavy competition because we knew there is a lot of solid business to be had here. For one thing, the real-estate market here is excellent. We have already had to add staff and we expect to add more staff in the very near future.''

122-> Pageant Gets Real Fire and a Flying Jesus
The voice of God, digitally processed and 15,000 watts strong, boomed three times Thursday night down a hillside here and echoed out into an open field on the edge of this tiny farm town east of Rochester. He spoke once at dusk and a second time shortly after sunset. In between, the voice spoke backwards and as fast as Alvin and the Chipmunks; the tape was rewinding. The sounds, however, surprised few of the thousand or so people milling about on this cool and damp, pine-shrouded slope known as Hill Cumorah. After all, most of them wore Biblical garb and carried swords and spears, ready for their parts in the dress rehearsal for the historic Hill Cumorah Pageant, a Mormon spectacle until now generally considered long on scripture and short on showmanship. Scripture Meets Star Wars Tonight, though, when the 51st annual play opened here for a weeklong run, the audience would witness something dramatically different: a pageant performed with the spirit of a George Lucas techno-dazzler and the scope of a Cecil B. DeMille epic. ''It is a totally sensory experience,'' said the pageant's production designer, Eric Fielding of Salt Lake City. Gone from the script, which celebrates the beginnings of the Mormon faith, are anachronistic words such as ''thee'' and ''thou.'' Gone, too, are the antiquated lighting, ancient costumes and archaic public address system. Instead, each night some 10,000 to 20,000 spectators will see Hollywood-scale battle scenes featuring hundreds of combatants swinging swords and spears on a 30-foot-high pseudo-Meso-American stage. Complementing the new script by Orson Scott Card, a science fiction writer, will be a battery of special effects devised by Keith Richins, who orchestrated the high-tech tricks in ''Robocop,'' ''Rambo III'' and ''Red Dawn.'' They include a nine-ton, hydraulically controlled ship, waterfalls, explosions, real fire and a flying Jesus. ''This will blow their socks off,'' said the pageant's president, Roger Adams, chairman of the art department at Nazareth College in Pittsford, N.Y., and a former cartoonist at the Walt Disney Studios in California. Pageant officials, who would not give its exact cost, said they decided to redo the $1-million-plus production because crowds had dwindled. The pageant has been battered by amusement parks, rock and symphony concerts and other outdoor theaters. In five years, yearly attendance has fallen from 96,000 to 71,000. This year, officials hope to attract about 120,000. The pageant, 10 short one-act plays, starts at dusk each night through July 30. There are no performances on Sunday or Monday. Admission is free. Competition From John Denver ''Twenty years ago, this was the only thing around, but now there's a lot more to do,'' Mr. Adams said Thursday night during the full dress rehearsal. ''Tomorrow night, for example, John Denver will be performing at the Community College of the Finger Lakes.'' Pageant officials said the revamping was needed to make sure the pageant could continue into the 21st Century. They particularly emphasized the new, less stodgy score recorded by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and the Utah Symphony. They also said the new script is better organized, contains simpler dialogue and should make the 75-minute pageant - 30 minutes shorter than before - more accessible, especially for the many in the audience who are not members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. ''Too often people would go away saying, 'Great show! But what did it mean?''' said the publicity director, Bert Lynn, of Laguna Niguel, Ca. Once Dated and Didactic ''It was dated and very didactic, like a series of lectures,'' Mr. Fielding added. ''It's now in the contemporary vernacular.'' Even with all the modernization, the new show is by no means a Las Vegas night club act. After all, the pageant is produced and staged by 400 volunteers and a cast of 600 amateur actors who have only four days to learn how to lip-synch their lines to the tape and make the broad gestures necessary for the action to be seen 200 yards away. The story starts in 600 B.C., when a prophet of Israel is told to sail with his family to North America. After they arrive, the children and their descendants - the now-extinct Nephites and the American Indian tribes - spend the next few centuries arguing over whether to follow their father's religious faith. The story ends in 1827, when Joseph Smith, a farmer living near Palmyra, is led by God to the top of Hill Cumorah and discovers inscribed golden plates left behind by the angel Moroni, a resurrected son of Mormon, the last prophet of the Nephites. Christ's Visit to America With divine help, Mr. Smith translates the plates into the Book of Mormon, which tell of a visit by Jesus Christ to the Americas in 34 A.D., shortly after His Crucifixion and before the Nephite cities are destroyed by the Indians. Mr. Smith then organizes the church and becomes its first president. Brigham Young, the second president, led followers to what is now Salt Lake City, where the central Temple and administration of the church sit.. ''I don't see anything sacrilegious about the production,'' said Mr. Adams, whose 21-year-old son, Benjamin, portrays Jesus and, in the show's climax, magically appears 40 feet above the stage and descends to earth on a cable. The critics at Thursday night's rehearsal agreed. In fact, they raved. ''It was worth the drive,'' said Mary Russell, a 64-year-old church member from Blythe, Calif. Spectators who were not Mormon were also impressed. ''You can understand it,'' said Clara Clark, 67, of Palmyra, who has seen several shows over the years. ''I liked the beginning, especially - the trumpets.'' ''It's fabulous,'' added Sharon Sevigny, 41, a church member from Crestline, Calif. ''When Jesus was coming down it was like he was real.''

123-> BUSINESS FORUM: VOLUME AND VOLATILITY; Less Trading Means Calmer Markets
AMONG the worries economists nag about these days is an apparent loss of liquidity in the stock market. Much has been made of a report from Bridge Information Systems that in 1987 a purchase or sale of 155,000 shares was necessary to move the average stock 1 percent on the New York Stock Exchange, while in 1988 that number was down to 87,000 shares. ''The difference,'' The Economist of London noted sadly, ''is the measure of a less liquid - thus more risky - market.'' In fact, however, stocks have traded in a narrower intra-day band of prices in low-volume 1988 than they did in high-volume 1987. Despite the considerable drop in volume, the market was less volatile in April and May of this year than it was last year. During most of this decade, indeed, increased market liquidity (more trading) has been accompanied by rising market volatility (greater movement of prices during the trading day), and diminished liquidity has produced calmer markets. If the pool dries up, it seems, the giant pension funds that move the fastest with the mostest adjust their behavior as easily as a duck stops paddling and starts waddling. Our economic theory of the relationship between liquidity and volatility has gone out of whack. The first evidence that economic theory had failed came when Reuters screens and enhanced telecommunications made it possible for the giant banks to trade currencies among themselves worldwide and 24 hours a day. Before that time, rapid movements in exchange rates had brought new players to the game, smoothing price movements. Now, dealing in foreign exchange, most of it through VDT screens and Reuters communications, adds up to $200 billion a day. A trading operation like Bankers Trust, which made $335 million in foreign exchange profits in the fourth quarter of 1987, will jiggle positions in the currency options markets in Montreal and Philadelphia, plus a few lots of futures and options on futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, to play against long or short holdings in the ''real'' market. As a result, exchange rates jump around to a degree that would have been unimaginable 15 years ago. When central bankers succeed in stabilizing the United States dollar, as they did early this year, the dealers go stir things up between the pound and the mark, or in currencies like the Australian and Canadian dollars. Then when drought-induced fears for the American grain crop generate vast demand for dollars to buy grain and hoard it, the floods of liquidity return to the United States exchange market and buffet prices more than 1 percent a day. What goes wrong with the conventional theory that relates liquidity to volatility is the academics' failure to understand that once markets reach a certain dimension the players make most of the short-term motion themselves. A new theory of the relationship between liquidity and volatility must grow from the reality that computer-aided players have mastered the art of creating volatility in one market by leaning hard on another. The classical theory that increasing liquidity will smooth markets holds for trading volumes that were normal in the time when the classical economists wrote. If trading is light, (say, the 14 million shares a day traded in 1974), a smoothly growing volume of transactions will produce a tighter spread of bid-and-asked quotes on the trading floor. More rapid growth of volume, however, will cause spreads to widen, contrary to the predictions of the theory. The quadrupling of daily volume on the New York Stock Exchange from 1977 to 1983, for example, saw a reduction from 76 percent to 61 percent in the fraction of quotes where the difference between the bid and the asked was only one-quarter of a point or less. And as the volume of trading rose, prices moved more within the day, not less. This phenomenon occurs because of the institutional systems of the stock markets. The effort by pension funds to buy and sell in very large blocks of stock overloads the traditional auction process from which the classical theory derives, and leads to the growth of large firms that act more as dealers trading for their own account than as brokers acting for customers. They ''position'' such blocks themselves and sell them off (or buy up to eliminate a short position) over time. To do such business requires the commitment of firm capital. The trading department then must generate significantly enlarged profits to justify its use of capital. Such profits are far more likely to be made between markets than within markets. Efficient exploitation of differences between the price of real stocks and the price of ''derivatives'' (futures, options, options on futures, etc.) requires volatility. The ''commoditization'' of the stock market - its tendency to move erratically during the day in response to changes in the futures market - enables the large broker/dealer firms that execute three-fifths or so of all the trades to support expensive trading departments and gain returns that may run as high as 45 percent a year on the capital employed. As the process feeds on itself, growing volume generates steadily increasing volatility. This phenomenon has been observed before. Karl Marx noted more than a hundred years ago that ''all nations with a capitalist mode of production are seized periodically by a feverish attempt to make money without the mediation of the process of production.'' Half a century ago, Arthur Burns and Wesley D. Mitchell noted that ''cyclical advances become . . . progressively larger in speculative activity.'' Such essentially random speculation grows even more rapidly today because the technological means employed to build very short-term trends are beyond the comprehension of the customers whose trading sets off the oscillations.They are not, however, beyond the grasp of the insiders to get their own orders executed ahead of the tidal waves. Eventually, customer disgust with price variability brings trading volume down in the abused markets. The highly capitalized traders go elsewhere, Eugene Noser of the research and brokerage house Abel/Noser argues, because ''the sharks learn that shark meat is not very nourishing.'' On the hypothesis of an efficient market for markets themselves, trading volumes should eventually stabilize where volatility is least. Such stabilization may be occurring today, and should be welcomed rather than feared.

An article and picture caption in Business Day yesterday incorrectly described the Loehmann's store in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. The store has a separate 3,000-square-foot back room where designer-collection clothing is sold. In addition, a chart accompanying the article misstated the Loehmann chain's net retail sales and operating earnings; the chart omitted an explanation that the figures were in millions of dollars.

126-> CAMERA; New Model in the Luxury Line
HASSELBLAD, the Swedish company known for making medium-format cameras that are ultra reliable and nearly indestructible, has a new model on the shelves. Called the 503CX, it is essentially an update of the company's enduring classic, the 500C/M. With a selling price in the range of $2,800 (including body, lens and film magazine), the 503CX is not exactly everyman's cup of tea. I'd be surprised if there are more than a handful of readers of this column who will ever get to hold, much less own one. So let's not go into tedious detail about all its capabilities and professional advantages. Instead, let's look at the one big feature that separates it from its forebearers: automatic, off-the-film flash control. So-called OTF auto-flash control is fairly common in modern-generation 35-millimeter SLRs, usually in combination with automatic-exposure systems. In Hasselblad's case, however, ambient-light exposure setting remains a manual affair; you (or your rich relatives) have to carry around a separate meter for daylight shots. This may seem a curious combination of old and new, but the Hasselblad 503CX makes it work. In addition, the camera has the advantage of making the principles of OTF flash exposures comprehensible. Here's how OTF flash works with manual exposure. Let's say you're in a room lit by diffuse light coming in from a window. Your meter reading advises f/5.6 at 1/60 second. After connecting a flash that can mate to the camera's electronics (what's called a ''dedicated'' model), you set the suggested exposure, dial in the proper film speed on the OTF flash control, and fire away. The camera's internal light sensor ''reads'' the light of the flash and signals when enough of it has reached the film. The signal is sent to the flash, which has been trained to instaneously squelch its output. The exposure that results from this procedure will be equally influenced by the daylight in the room and by the light from the flash - a 1:1 ratio of the two sources. But let's say you want the main light to come from the window, with the flash used only to ''fill in'' the dark shadows on your subject's other side. Don't touch your aperture or shutter-speed controls! They will only alter the daylight exposure, making it lighter or darker. To decrease the flash output, you need to fool the camera's electronics into thinking that the film is more light-sensitive than it is. So you should adjust the OTF film-speed control to a higher ISO/ASA number. For a 2:1 ratio of daylight to flash, you'd double the film's speed, rating a ISO 100 film at an index of 200, for example. On the new Hasselblad, which doesn't have a built-in meter, the OTF film-speed dial is located on the right side of the body. With an automatic 35-millimeter camera, such as the Nikon F3, you can alternately use the top-mounted dial that's used for exposure compensation. In either case, you achieve quality fill-flash pictures almost effortlessly. What's more complicated to explain is how OTF flash control works in cameras that provide programmed automatic-exposure systems. Many of the newer ones - the Nikon 4004 and the Pentax SF-1, for example - have electronic flash tubes built in, just like point-and-shoot cameras. But even when the flash unit is a separate purchase, most of today's computer-governed cameras provide what's called automatic fill-in flash. Programmed exposure control means that the camera sets both the aperture and shutter speed according to a pre-set formula that usually is a compromise between depth-of-field and action-stopping capabilities. Sometimes a set of flashing numbers tells you which combination has been selected, but with most amateur-level cameras you're left in the dark. Things are even murkier when it comes to controlling programmed fill-in flash. Unlike the Hasselblad, which allows the photographer to adjust the ratio of daylight to flash, cameras with computer programs decide for themselves how much flash is the ''right'' amount. Camera engineers have figured out some devilishly clever ways to make this happen, and most photographers will find the prints or slides taken in this all-automatic mode perfectly wonderful. But for someone who wants to know what the picture is going to look like before it comes back from the processor, this isn't enough. If you're one of these fussbudgets, the only solution is to make sure whatever camera you buy allows you to control its OTF flash system. What this means is that the OTF system should function in an exposure mode other than programmed automatic. Whether it's aperture-preferred or shutter-speed-preferred automatic, or manual, doesn't matter. The important thing is that the camera, like the Hasselblad, allows you some input about the ratio between the existing light and the flash.

127-> Stormy History Of Endowment
The National Endowment for Democracy is a quasi-governmental organization created at the Reagan Administration's initiative in 1983 to promote democratic institutions around the world. It has distributed tens of millions of dollars to groups in many countries for activities ranging from restoring a village school system in Afghanistan to bolstering the South Korean opposition; from providing poll-watchers in Haiti to providing supplies to the Nicaraguan opposition newspaper La Prensa. Despite the balance of groups involved in the project from its inception, including the Democratic and Republican National Committees, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the Chamber of Commerce of the United States, its brief history has often been stormy. In several years, it has faced efforts in Congress to cut off its financing. In 1985, the endowment's chairman, Carl Gershman, asserted that a list of books chosen by American publishers for display at the Moscow Book Fair, financed in part by $50,000 in endowment funds, was ideologically unbalanced. Later that year, the disclosure that an extreme-right group in France, the National Inter-University Union, had received a $575,000 two-year grant from the endowment led to the suspension of the remainder of the grant. Among the projects receiving funds this year through the endowment's regular budget of about $15 million are two South African groups - the Institute for a Democratic Alternative for South Africa and the Black Consumers Union - which are receiving a total of $600,000.

128-> BASEBALL; Nunez Gets First Victory for Mets
The indignities had begun to pile up for the Mets even if no insecurity had begun to mount. And after six innings tonight, another affront appeared imminent. But the Mets, who have been vulnerable to everything except lapses in their own egos lately, scored single runs in the seventh and eighth innings tonight to rally for a 3-2 victory over the Braves before a crowd of 32,208. Roger McDowell worked himself into and then out of jams in both the eighth and ninth, each time managing to strand the tying run at third base. Short on Style Again for the Mets, who continue to eschew the notion that they are involved in a legitimate pennant race with the Pittsburgh Pirates, the victory was short on style. They allowed eight stolen bases, the most the club has even given up. They manufactured the decisive run in the eighth on an infield single by Dave Magadan and a bloop double to short right field by Kevin McReynolds. For McReynolds, it was his ninth run driven in in the last four games. ''I don't think it'll be a race,'' McDowell, who got the save in relief of Dwight Gooden, said of the what he thought the summer holds for the Mets. ''The only team that can give us a race is ourselves.'' The Mets then have recently decided to make it a tight one with their lead over the Pirates going from seven and a half games to two and a half in 13 days. Gooden, who has now won just two of his last seven starts, was hit hard but not hurt badly over six innings. He was then hit for in the seventh when Lee Mazzilli's sacrifice fly scored Mackey Sasser and tied the score at 2-2. Edwin Nunez, in his first appearance with the Mets since coming from Seattle, worked the seventh and got the victory. The Braves took a 2-1 advantage in the sixth. Dion James followed a leadoff double by Andres Thomas with a single to left to put runners at first and third with no outs. James then stole his third base of the game before Gary Roenicke struck out. A failed attempt to steal home earlier in the game had done little to dampen Atlanta's daring. Bruce Benedict, sticking his bat up almost more for protection than for offense, knocked down a head-high fastball for a successful suicide squeeze to score Thomas. The Mets, using the one power source that has functioned with little interruption this year, tied the score at 1-1 in the fourth inning on Darryl Strawberry's second home run in two games and his 23d of the season. Strawberry, whose blast off Bruce Sutter in the eighth inning the night before sent the game into extra innings, drove an 0-2 pitch from Pete Smith over the fence in center field. The ball nearly went into the raised first level of seats. Only the warning track separated the Braves from a 5-0 lead in the third. After they had rallied for a run with two outs on Ken Oberkfell's double, the Braves loaded the bases on an infield hit and an intentional walk to Dale Murphy. But after ripping one offering from Gooden sharply foul, Andres Thomas lifted a long fly ball to left that fell 15 feet short of the wall and safely into the glove of Kevin McReynolds. The Braves, who stole bases at will, tried to steal the lead again in the fifth. Gerald Perry, who was safe on a fielder's choice, stole his second base of the night and fifth of the game for the Braves before advancing to third on Murphy's groundout. Then, with Gooden's head bowed, Perry set off to steal home. He was easily tagged out by Sasser. Murphy's 10th-inning home run unceremoniously bounced the Mets Friday night. But aside from the most grudging of nods to the young Pirates, the Mets by and large insisted they were still securely in charge of their fate. ''It's not like I went back to bed last night and worried that the Pirates were now only two and a half games back,'' said Roger McDowell, a member of a bullpen that is struggling now. ''I didn't even know how far back they were until someone told me.'' A handful of Mets actually deigned to actually express frustration, which is about as close to a concession of vulnerabilty one is likely to discover in their clubhouse. ''I'm tired of hearing how we are not as good as we were in 1986,'' said Howard Johnson. ''I'm tired of hearing how we are not as good as we were supposed to be this year. We've got guys worrying about all sorts of things. ''Look, the division is better than it was, and we are different than we were. There's not a team in that division, though, that wouldn't want to swap places with us. The focus should be on now, and guys should be taking care of themselves.''

129-> Pentagon's New Rule Troubles a Contractor
A United Technologies Corporation executive said the company could not possibly comply with a new Pentagon directive requiring contractors to certify that they have not improperly obtained confidential inside information when bidding on contracts. ''They are asking us to make a representation that we can't reasonably make,'' said John A. Rolls, executive vice president and chief financial officer of the Hartford-based company. ''We will not certify, and I doubt other contractors will either.'' Mr. Rolls said bidding procedures were so complicated that it was often impossible to define what information was proprietary. He said the company could not be certain when materials later deemed proprietary would inadvertently fall into the hands of some employees. ''You can't possibly know because you can obtain it by accident,'' he said at a Wednesday meeting with securities analysts in New York. ''A Government employee could turn it over to you.'' The Defense Department announced its certification requirement and other procedures July 15 in response to the continuing Government investigation of accusations of weapons-procurement abuses. The new procedures were imposed upon 16 companies whose names arose in the investigation.

130-> CONNECTICUT OPINION; Are They Statistics or Guesswork?
I DON'T know about anyone else, but I'm very impressed with all the information we get from the Government in Washington. I'm especially impressed with statistics about the Gross National Product, the percentage of unemployment, the trade deficit, personal income and the like. Just think about the amount of work it takes to compile those figures and the number of people who must be involved. No wonder they can't reduce the Federal payroll. Take the Gross National Product, otherwise known as the G.N.P., for example. Think how difficult it must be to gather the figures necessary to compile the sum total of the value of all the goods and services produced by the whole country during a given period of time. Getting all that information from all the companies and individuals in the country who make something to sell must be a tremendous undertaking. Especially when you consider people like my Uncle Seth, who whittles small animals and sells them to neighbors. I know Uncle Seth would never fill out a monthly report on how many animals he made or sold and send it to Washington or anywhere else. Maybe, if people don't send in reports, they call them up. But that brings up the question of how they would know about people like Uncle Seth? Maybe the F.B.I. is involved. See what I mean about its taking a lot of people to do this? And we've just been talking about the goods produced. How about all the services? How do they know how much the paperboy made last month or the man who mows your lawn, or the baby-sitter? I'm sure this must take a lot of doing, especially when you're dealing with a lot of people like Uncle Seth who consider it an invasion of privacy if you ask him, ''Isn't it a nice day?'' Another thing I've wondered about is why I never got asked for a report or called or anything. I was in a service profession and not only wasn't I asked, neither were any of my colleagues in the same profession. Somebody goofed and I think that it's demeaning to be left out of such important data. Often the figures are so precise that you know they have to be accurate. The other night the man on the television news said that personal income was up 0.7 percent in September. Now that's what I call accuracy. How they ever came by that figure is a real mystery. Again, I wasn't asked what my income was in that month and none of my friends were asked either. F.B.I. again? Sometimes I find nongovernment statistics puzzling. I read the other day in a medical journal that 50 percent of all pregnancies miscarry in the first two weeks after conception. I can't figure out how they know that because at this time even the potential mother doesn't know that she is pregnant and if she doesn't know, who does? Maybe this has something to do with the business of the Government invading the privacy of the bedroom that everyone was arguing about recently. A recent press release from a Congressman's office mentioned a health statistic from Government sources. ''Fifty thousand lives are ended prematurely due to the airborne chemical precursors to acid rain,'' it said. ''That's 140 American lives per day.'' Come, come, Government, you can do better than that. Fifty thousand per year would actually be 136.98 or 136.61 a day depending on whether it's leap year or not. Diagnosing a death that is due to the precursor of air pollution is another matter. The release didn't say how that is done. I should make it clear that I am on the Congressman's side when it comes to acid rain and air pollution. I am sure that it is inimical to some people's health; I'm just not clear about the statistics. Maybe they need a few more people in the department of statistic gathering. When it comes to that, perhaps this isn't the way it's done at all. Perhaps no one is chasing Uncle Seth or has overlooked me or my friends. Perhaps the whole thing is done by a few bureaucrats sitting in a back room somewhere. I can see it all in my mind's eye. It's morning and they're sitting around drinking coffee when someone pipes up and says, ''Say, isn't today the day we have to give out the unemployment figures?'' ''Oh, yeah,'' someone else says, ''I did it last month. This time it's Tom's turn.'' ''O.K,'' Tom says, ''anyone know someone who lost his job or got one last month?'' ''I do,'' says one of them who is sitting in the corner. ''My cousin Hugo was out of work for over a year and last week he got a job at MacDonald's.'' ''Great,'' Tom replies, ''I think things are looking up. Let's make it 5.9 percent this month. While we're thinking about that, remember that tomorrow the figures on personal savings are due. Why don't one of you jokers call up a couple of banks and ask them if the balance in their savings accounts went up or down in November?'' On thinking it over, I believe that this is probably the best way to do it. No one has to send in reports, no one gets called on the telephone during dinner and asked if his bank balance is up or down this month, and best of all, the Government payroll doesn't have to go up. Speaking of getting called on the telephone, I always wonder who the people are who get to answer all the questions on the public opinion polls. I ask everyone I meet about getting called and so far no one I know has been. The respondents are supposed to be a representative sample of the population so I guess that makes me and my friends some kind of nuts. I'm sure that if I were called, it would be at a very inconvenient time and I would say the first thing that popped into my head. For instance, if I was called and asked whom I liked in the Presidential race, I would blurt out the first name that came into my head or I'd say, ''None of the above.'' Come to think of it, I might say, ''I'm sorry but the baby just ate the dog's dinner and I can't talk'' and then hang up. Maybe that's a common reaction and perhaps that's why we shouldn't pay any attention to the polls that inundate us. Better yet, maybe we should all swear off paying attention to any numbers that are tossed at us in a constant stream. As they say, it's better not to know than to know something that's wrong.

132-> Senate Approves New Statue Of Nurse for War Memorial
The Senate today approved a bill authorizing a bronze statue of an Army nurse at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial to honor the women who were part of America's longest war. The bill, which was passed, 96-1, and sent to the House, was sponsored by Senator David Durenberger, Republican of Minnesota. It had 75 co-sponsors and was endorsed by the Interior Department. The Vietnam Veterans Memorial was opened in 1982 and has become one of the city's most visited monuments. Its walls bear the names of the more than 58,000 Vietnam War dead, including eight uniformed nurses. Mr. Durenberger told his colleagues the statue would be ''an appropriate and long overdue symbol of this nation's gratitude for the sacrifices and contributions of the 10,000 women who served in Vietnam.''

133-> WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING; Tribute to Wallenberg
A special art exhibit paying tribute to Raoul Wallenberg, the Swedish diplomat who saved thousands of people from being sent to Nazi death camps, will go on view Tuesday in the Rotunda of the House Cannon Office Building on Capitol Hill. Twenty-seven abstract collages by Alice Lok Cahana, a Houston artist whose family was seized in the Nazi takeover of Hungary, will be on display. Titled ''From Ashes to the Rainbow: a Tribute to Raoul Wallenberg,'' the paintings incorporate many items that document Ms. Cahana's wartime experience, including photographs of her family and Mr. Wallenberg, fake passports that he issued and poems by children in concentration camps. The paintings, beginning with brooding, tormented pieces, evolve into rainbow colored works that reflect the artist's gradual understanding of her experience and her hopes for the future. They will be exhibited through March 30. The exhibit is co-sponsored by Representative Tom Lantos, Democrat of California, and the ARCO Foundation. Mr. Lantos and his wife, Annette, were among those Mr. Wallenberg saved by arranging for them to flee using fake Swedish passports. Ms. Cahana, then 15, spent 18 months in the Auschwitz, Guben and Bergen-Belsen camps. Her father was one of those saved by Mr. Wallenberg. On Wednesday, the House Subcommittee on Libraries and Memorials will hold hearings on a resolution introduced by Mr. Lantos authorizing a monument to honor Mr. Wallenberg on Federal land.

134-> Review/City Ballet; Devouring Female Of Species
The New York City Ballet offered much pleasure Sunday afternoon and evening at the New York State Theater. On both occasions, Patricia McBride was the Novice in ''The Cage,'' Jerome Robbins's ballet about the way certain female insects devour their mates. Her portrayal of the newborn insect included such notable details as her startled blinking when light first struck her and the quivering of her fingers as she felt her senses quicken. She went her lethal way like an efficient machine, killing Sean Savoye, the first male in her path. Ruling over her was Diana White who, as the insects' Queen, was appropriately athletic, but insufficiently domineering. When Miss McBride killed Kipling Houston, Mr. Robbins choreographically allowed her to feel faint affection for him. Such humane emotions may be sentimental entomology. Yet they helped turn ''The Cage'' into a parable warning human beings not to act beastly. Kyra Nichols starred in two works Sunday night. Partnered by Otto Neubert in ''Walpurgisnacht Ballet,'' she could have cut diamonds with the sharpness of her dancing. Set to music for a scene from Gounod's opera ''Faust,'' in which Mephistopheles shows Faust a revel, George Balanchine's work is bewitchingly pretty, and it received a pretty performance. Nichol Hlinka led the ensemble. Newcomers among the soloists were Miriam Mahdaviani and Marisa Cerveris, both of whom looked beguiling and danced with verve. Miss Nichols made a glamorous, languid entrance in Mr. Robbins's ''In G Major,'' to Ravel's Piano Concerto in G major. Although the ballet is plotless, its backdrop by the fashion designer Erte depicts sun, clouds and waves, and the choreographic fun is akin to that of beach parties. Lindsay Fischer might well have been a handsome lifeguard. Obviously strong, he nevertheless controlled his power. In their pas de deux, he and Miss Nichols emphasized the nearing and parting movements that make this sequence a shy courtship. Some of their complex entwinings could have flowed more easily, however. On Sunday afternoon, Mr. Fischer was especially admirable dancing Balanchine's ''Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux'' with Merrill Ashley, who combined fullness of gesture with great speed. Mr. Fischer has steadily improved since he joined the company last fall, gaining confidence in bearing and skill in makeup. A gallant partner, his turns were steady, and his jumps swept him across the stage. Gordon Boelzner conducted the matinee, which included ''Gounod Symphony'' and ''The Concert.'' Richard Moredock was the pianist for ''In G Major'' on Sunday night, when Hugo Fiorato conducted and ''Sonatas and Interludes'' was also danced.

135-> Western Union Reports Profit
A late-year restructuring plan helped the financially troubled Western Union Corporation report a $105.3 million profit for the 1987 fourth quarter on Friday, compared with a $459.9 million loss in the same period of 1986. Western Union's net income for 1987 was $88.1 million, or $2.58 per common share, compared with a loss of $531.2 million for all of 1986. The fourth-quarter and yearly gains were the result of the addition of $153 million from gains on extinguishing debt as part of the company's financial restructuring, completed in December. Western Union earned $3.99 per common share in the fourth quarter. The loss in the corresponding 1986 period resulted primarily from a write-down in the value of the company's Telex business. Total operating revenues were $190.9 million for the fourth quarter of 1987, down 10.7 percent from $213.5 million in the final quarter of 1986, the company said. For the year, the 1987 revenues were $801.9 million, down 9.8 percent from $889.2 million in 1986, the company said. Company officials credited the decrease in 1987 revenues to a decline in the Telex business.

136-> CITY RULES ON TRUCKS FAULTED
FEDERAL transportation officials have declared New York City's restrictions on the size of fuel tanker-trucks a violation of Federal law and an indirect threat to environmental safety in some New Jersey and Westchester County communities. The ruling, issued last month by Alan A. Roberts, director of the hazardous-materials transportation division at the Federal Department of Transportation, is an advisory opinion, not law, but can be used against the city in court. The American Trucking Associations, the nation's largest trucking-industry group, is suing the city in Federal District Court in New York. The Government ruled in response to a complaint by the trucking group, which contends that many unnecessary and potentially dangerous cargo transfers from large tractor-trailers to small trucks take place at suburban terminals so that deliveries can be made in New York City. According to the Department of Transportation, the city's regulations ''cause serious delays and diversions of hazardous materials, regulate areas that the law has defined as exclusively Federal and create obstacles to the execution of Federal laws.'' Several northern New Jersey communities are the sites of terminal operations of more than 50 oil, chemical and trucking companies. Consolidated Freightways, Roadway Express and St. Johnsbury Trucking, all national trucking companies, have major operating centers in Carlstadt. There also are terminals in Kearny, Lyndhurst, Newark, Elizabeth, North Bergen, Moonachie and other North Jersey communities. The Federal ruling stemmed from a double effort - in Federal court and through the Transportation Department, which has exclusive jurisdiction over interstate trucking - by the nation's trucking industry to force New York City to repeal its truck laws. The laws, which date to the 1940's, are the country's only local tank-truck regulations, the Transportation Department said. The city is expected to appeal the Federal ruling, said George Tenley, chief counsel for the Transportation Department's hazardous-materials transportation division. In Federal court, attorneys for the truckers' association have asked for a summary judgment based on the Federal ruling. But New York City wants the case to go to trial, said Tom Crane, chief of the city's general litigation division, part of the Corporation Counsel's office. ''Essentially, it is our view that the Federal regulations do not totally pre-empt the area of the law regarding the regulation of trucks,'' Mr. Crane said. If the city gets the opportunity, he said, it will argue that there are pressing safety reasons for keeping large tanker-trucks off crowded city streets. Mr. Crane dismissed the truckers' contention that the cargo transfers that had to be done in suburban areas were dangerous. ''It's the city's view that, on balance, the city's regulations certainly do promote a far safer means of transporting solvents and chemicals,'' he said. Documents filed with the Federal transportation agency show that in opposing the truckers' complaint, New York argued that its regulations were reasonable and justified by the conditions in the dense urban environment of the five boroughs. Environmental officials in New Jersey and Westchester said they had had few problems at terminals because such sites were tightly regulated, but they did agree that transfer operations were a potential problem. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection said it had had no major problems at truck terminals in the northern part of the state. ''In general, the greatest threat we've seen is from moving trucks, which is an area that no one at the state level seems to regulate,'' said James M. Staples, the agency's chief spokesman. But, he added, the D.E.P., like all state agencies, has little to say about the trucks until they actually spill something. Then their cargo becomes hazardous waste, largely a state problem. ''We found at the time that there was very little regulation of these vehicles beyond the Interstate Commerce Commission, which is really more of a licensing body than anything else.'' Mr. Staples said. Although the city rules have been in effect for decades, it has enforced them only since 1981, after a truck carrying propane gas began leaking and was stopped on the George Washington Bridge. ''The reason we instituted the complaint is for uniformity,'' said Jack Currie, director of safety for the trucking industry group. ''Every other state and city in the country allows standard trucks. New York City should be no exception.''

137-> The Stars and Stripes Must Be Homemade
To the Editor: Your July 4 editorial on importing foreign-made American flags neglected to address the principles that underlie the issue of having another nation produce our sacred banner. The American flag fidelity bill (H.R. 4817) would prohibit importing only the United States flag, not those of other nations, if passed into law. My constituents have pointed out that another nation may not have the respect required to produce our national symbol. When I introduced H.R. 4817 in the House of Representatives, I unfurled a standard-size Stars and Stripes with a Harley-Davidson motorcycle superimposed on it, and emblazoned across the gas tank the words, ''High Times.'' The label read, ''Made in Taiwan.'' Superimposing anything on the Stars and Stripes is a violation of the Flag Code. American manufacturers of United States flags must abide by this code or face penalty, while foreign companies may do anything to the design of the flag with relative immunity. To preserve the Flag Code, we must restrict the importation of foreign-made American flags. Further, the Flag Code states: ''The flag represents a living country and is itself considered a living thing.'' Therefore, a flag sent to us from abroad is not the integral part of our country it is meant to be. Such a flag is not carefully stitched, assembled or packaged by our workers. Such a flag does not stem from the roots of our society. How then could a United States flag made in another country be a true American flag? The American flag should not be manufactured on foreign shores by foreign workers. To preserve the symbolic and patriotic role of the flag, we must restrict the importation of foreign-made American flags. I am a protectionist only insofar as I believe that protecting the integrity of the American flag is a worthy endeavor. HARLEY O. STAGGERS JR. Member of Congress, 2d Dist., W. Va. Washington, July 15, 1988

138-> Sports People; Brooks Won't Be Back
Jack Ferreira, the new general manager of the Minnesota North Stars, said yesterday that Herb Brooks, who coached the team last season, would not be rehired. Brooks and his assistant coaches were dismissed on June 11 by George and Gordon Gund, the owners, in preparation for the hiring of a new general manager to replace Lou Nanne, who has been made president of the club. Ferreira had said last week that no search for a new coach would begin until it was decided whether or not to rehire Brooks. Yesterday, Ferreira said in d a statement: ''After one week of consideration, I have decided to go after a new coach. The tension and misunderstanding evident in my meetings with Herb made me feel unccomfortable having him as coach of the North Stars next season. We want to put past problems behind us. It is time for this organization to have a clean slate. I intend to find a new coach as soon as possible.''(AP)

141-> THE WORLD; OFFICIAL BELFAST BUSIES ITSELF WITH THE SIDE ISSUES OF STRIFE
THE burial of the dead inevitably is followed by the resurrection of politics in the ceaseless Irish-Anglo agony. But a striking quality in the latest episode of violence and despair, the worst in more than a decade, is how much of the post-mortem debate remains focused on surface points of conflict. While some of the gnarled roots of the modern struggle can easily be seen glistening here dankly in Whiterock, one of the worst sectarian slums in the British domain, ranking politicians spent much of their energies last week wrangling over how to police funerals, to somehow sort grief from rebellion. Equally did their efforts dwell on a resentment of the news media that captured graphic moments of the latest bloody deaths, and still more on doing something about the latest shipments of arms from the apparently bottomless ordnance market for the world's aggrieved rebels. The sight of heartsick English families burying the two British soldiers slain a week ago yesterday by Irish Republican Army executioners had followed, like night upon night, the earlier funeral tableaux here of terrible mourning, sectarian invasion and mob fury. Nearby seethed the bedrock problems that can help feed rebellion, exemplified by the noisome Whiterock slum of the west Belfast Catholic ghetto, a pro-I.R.A. precinct quarantined apart by highway and housing planners mindful of Protestant antagonists not too far away in their own angry enclave. Whiterock is a place of virulent hopelessness and resistance, with 56 percent male unemployment - two and a half times the figure for Protestant men in Belfast. It suffers comparable housing and health statistics. The routine level of street danger daily forces British soldiers in battle camouflage to scuttle with sniper-scope rifles at the ready, scanning crowds beyond the play of indifferent youngsters in their parochial-school uniforms, watching for the I.R.A. agent who sooner or later is waiting in ambush. Against such a hulking backdrop, so many of the larger headlines last week seemed ephemeral as they dealt with the Government's demands that television news crews ''give witness'' for the British dead, to help apprehend the killers by turning over to the authorities any unused tapes of the soldiers' slayings. Even more dominant was the attention invested in what to do about the paramilitary flourishes at I.R.A. funerals. The Royal Ulster Constabulary, the Northern Ireland police force, finally decided to end its low-profile experiment and move back toward heavy security at funerals, a step critics warned would probably mean more of the graveside scuffling over I.R.A. salutes and emblematic paraphernalia that so often reduced humble solemnity to morbid Irish self-parody in the eyes of the world. Bigoted Outbursts Tom King, the Thatcher Government's harried but resilient Secretary for Northern Ireland, cried out in frustration in Parliament at the need to dwell on such a mundane rite as if it were a battlefield strategem, which indeed it has become. Mr. King has the job that has made and broken countless English politicians across the centuries and he was careful, in the heat of mourning, anger and some vindictiveness discernible in the House of Commons, to work at maintaining his strategic balance. He bothered to note, for example, amid bigoted outbursts in some parts of the tabloid press, that most Irish are peaceful and opposed to the I.R.A. And when the Northern Ireland representatives of the Protestant loyalist majority called for harsher measures against the Catholic nationalist minority, he pointedly urged them to fill the political vacuum ''that breeds violence'' and end their own political boycott of the increasingly fragile agreement between Britain and Ireland. This is the two-year-old pact between governments that seeks sectarian compromise and has effectively deprived the loyalist politicians of their veto power over British initiatives in their homeland. The problem is that no glimmer of practical hope for dialogue has arisen so far from the pact, one reason why the politicians are left dwelling on symptoms of violence. Significantly, the latest opinion polls are measuring the British public's increasing frustration with the lethal status quo: Fifty percent of Britons now prefer that British troops be removed from Northern Ireland either immediately or within a set time limit, according to a new Mori poll for The Economist magazine. More important, little more than one in four thinks the province should remain part of the United Kingdom. Mr. King, undoubtedly tracking this mood, is said to be preparing a kind of shuttle initiative to try and end the loyalists' intransigence toward talking informally with more willing moderate leaders from the Catholic minority. In darker contrast, some Conservative party members are urging Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to resort more firmly to such antiterrorist measures as sweeping house-to-house searches for weapons and rebels. ''We are considering the security situation,'' Mrs. Thatcher replied. This brief remark is being kept well in mind by all Northern Irish factions as they approach still another pillory point in the familiar calendar of anguish, the marching season, beginning at Easter, when sectarian communities proudly parade in commemoration of the continuing conflict.

142-> Bridge
The world's oldest pair event, the Goldman, will be contested for the 60th time Saturday. Expected to take part is 96-year-old Jay Feigus of Middletown, N.J., who has the remarkable distinction of having played in every Goldman since it was instituted in 1929. This is without doubt the longest participation string in a major competitive event of any kind. About the time that Feigus played in his first Goldman, Ely Culbertson launched The Bridge World, the only one of his many enterprises to survive to this day. In the first issue he decided to have a little fun at the expense of his regular partner and close friend, Theodore Lightner. Worst Bid of the Year? Under a teasing byline, ''by an admirer,'' he announced that Lightner's final double of seven spades was the worst bid of the year. He may have been right, if the field is limited to experts, but it is doubtful whether he searched hard for rival candidates. The bidding was not very scientific, but contract bridge was only four years old and there was much to explore in the theory of bidding. Nobody could find fault with the final contract, which simply needs a normal 2-1 spade division. We may conjecture that it was late at night and that Lightner was half asleep, for he would not have doubled seven spades in normal circumstances. The result was that South had the clue he needed to make the winning play. He ruffed the opening lead in the dummy and finessed the spade ten to make his doubled grand slam. If would not have helped East to split his trump honors, for South would have ruffed his way back to dummy to lead another trump for a marked finesse. Lightner was left to wish that he had begun with one fewer diamond, for then an honor-splitting defense would have been effective. The episode must have made an impression on him, for shortly afterward he gave up penalty doubles of slam contracts and gave the world a most useful device: the Lightner slam double to direct an unusual lead. A double that might gain 100 points or lose 2470 is foolish. A double that can produce the only lead to beat a slam, gaining the large number, makes a lot of sense.

144-> It Will Take Years to Undo the Meese Legacy
To the Editor: To go by Bruce Fein's recitation (''Meese's Dramatic Conservative Legacy,'' Op-Ed July 8), Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d can now hang up his six-shooters, having dispatched the pornographers and criminals, while the few remaining ''activist'' judges sit quaking in their chambers. However, it is striking to note how much of the Attorney General's program was rebuffed by Congress, the courts and the public. Mr. Fein and other ''originalist'' commentators have credited Mr. Meese with stimulating public debate about the role of the Federal courts in interpreting the Constitution. But no Supreme Court Justice has embraced his absurd view that all constitutional questions can be resolved by simple reference to the literal text of the document, or to the ''intent'' of the men who drafted it 200 years ago. The vote on Judge Robert H. Bork's nomination was an explicit rejection of the Meese judicial philosophy. Mr. Meese was the Administration's point man for a repressive first few years of the Reagan Presidency, when a newly empowered Senate majority led by Strom Thurmond, Jesse Helms and others was going to pass constitutional amendments restricting abortion, restoring school prayer and even stripping the courts of their power to hear cases in these and other controversial areas? Remember the campaigns to gut the Legal Services Corporation, the Freedom of Information Act and the Voting Rights Act? Bipartisan opposition to these initiatives was so strong that in time the Administration virtually stopped trying. Nor has the Supreme Court, even with several Reagan Justices, cottoned very well to Mr. Meese's instructions. It rejected the Justice Department's arguments in key cases on abortion, separation of church and state, and race and sex discrimination, not to mention the recent ruling upholding the constitutionality of special prosecutors. This is not to argue that everything is rosy on the civil liberties scene. Edwin Meese and his allies have wreaked much havoc, and we will be working to undo it for years, in large measure because President Reagan has been diligent in packing the Federal bench with ideologues recommended by Mr. Meese, and they will be around for a while. If we are indeed ''marching to his constitutional drummer'' in years to come, that will be why. GARA LAMARCHE Brooklyn, July 11, 1988

146-> TOPICS OF THE TIMES; Tube Boobs
For several months a television advertisement for Dunkin' Donuts, a company that touts its product's freshness, has been badmouthing doughnuts that have been ''laying all night.'' Alert listeners were puzzled. Either Dunkin' Donuts was talking about pastry that produces eggs, or the copywriters had a little problem with the difference between ''lie'' and ''lay.'' Now those alert listeners have been rewarded for their phone calls, letters and concern for what's left of the English language. Dunkin' Donuts will re-record the ad to correct its grammar: ''lying'' will replace ''laying.'' Alert listeners, keep it up! And may your next campaign be aimed at defeating that soap opera staple ''Between you and I.''

147-> THE MASCULINE MYSTIQUE
ONE OF THE GUYS The Wising Up of an American Man. By Harry Stein. 269 pp. New York: Simon & Schuster. $17.95. Books about growing up male in America tend to be studiously sociological, ponderously psychological, hortatory, lamentatory, or all of the above. ''One of the Guys'' is none of the above; as the author's brother-in-law observes, it's a book about growing up male in America - as Harry Stein. And Harry Stein has made a career of writing about serious subjects in a manner that veers between the ironic and the comic. Mr. Stein's ability to laugh at himself is a rare quality in a writer who sticks so closely to the personal while showing, but hardly ever stating, that the personal is political. He tells stories about his own growth from boy to man, some funny and some painful, to weave through a man's relations with his father, friendship between males, the pursuit of women as sex objects and as human beings, marriage and the fathering of his own children - most of the major themes of male development. Mr. Stein fils saw Stein pere (Joe Stein, who wrote ''Fiddler on the Roof'') as often minimizing his accomplishments or treating him with indifference. He takes as a metaphor his father's going out to get magazines as his mother was led into the labor room to give birth to Harry in 1948. On his way back, Joe Stein was distracted by the television program ''Holiday Star Varieties'' on a set in a store window. He had written a sketch for the show. It was the first time he could see comedy material he had written, so he stopped in the street to watch and was gone from the hospital at the moment Harry was being born. As Harry grows older, however, he realizes his father was there when he was growing up in ways he hadn't recognized. He recalls Joe's generosity, his political courage, his ability to be passionate about and committed to his work, and his love for his children and grandchildren. The father-son passages make me sorry that Harry Stein says so little about his mother, who died of cancer in 1973. He obviously loved her and respected her, but he seldom shows any awareness that she must have had as much to do with shaping him as his father did, or more. Mr. Stein's treatment of his father, however, adds a dimension to the usual accounts of the son's hunger for the absent or indifferent father. That hunger has encouraged many deprived sons to become active fathers - the biggest single change in male behavior since the women's movement started. ''One of the Guys'' is also wonderful when Mr. Stein talks about his children, Sadie and Charlie. He spends as much time and energy with them as he does on his work as a freelance writer, which of course interferes with his masculine identification with his work. He confesses, ''Looking into the life of yet another politician truly does strike me at this point as less interesting than trying to fathom what is going on in the heart and mind of a two-year-old during one of those terrible, inexplicable tantrums; and, more to the point, in the broad sweep of things, ultimately as less important.'' Mr. Stein also has the grace to show, as few active fathers do, how a man's drive to get things done can hinder his care for his child. Mr. Stein is almost as good at describing his relations with his wife, Priscilla, whom he sees as ''someone to be counted on as an ally in an often hostile universe -and yet more than challenging enough to force upon me even unwelcome truths.'' He's clearly describing a rare happy marriage between equals, even as he talks about their quarrels, imbalances and power struggles. Mr. Stein unfortunately has a tendency to let the comic deteriorate into the smart-aleck and facetious, which is particularly noticeable in the sections on the male pursuit of the female. He also finds it difficult to integrate his particular experience with the general experience of men, his personal reality with other men's feelings and thoughts. For example, chapters on his friendships with another boy and another man don't refute the painful truth that most American men make few, if any, intimate friendships. Mr. Stein seems to think his exceptions disprove the rule and makes no endeavor to understand why it's usually true. I also wish he'd talked to or read a few more women. He'd be a lot more interesting if he had read books by Nancy Chodorow, Dorothy Dinnerstein and Lillian Rubin - authors who cast light on the differences between men and women. Despite these flaws, ''One of the Guys'' is full of pleasures and rewards. I found both in one topic: men's ambivalence about the changes that women have demanded in the way society works. He says he and most of his contemporaries (he's 39) believe in the broad objectives of the women's movement, but at the same time they feel the deep pull of traditional male values. The result is ''the continual hesitation, the ambivalence, the sense so many of us have of our best instincts being at war with other, safer perceptions of self.'' I like both the awareness of those ''best instincts'' and the recognition that they're involved in a war within the self. Mr. Stein also says that he and Priscilla, like millions of men and women, have been surprised to find that in the ''humanistic revolution,'' changing the laws and the workplace are the easy part; ''the heavy labor, the day-to-day dirty work, is in the effort to alter what we are deep inside.'' Harry Stein is clearly one of the men who are trying to make sure that the revolution continues. COCKY AND BRAZEN AND VERY NEEDY ''There's an endless curiosity on the part of women about the way men think and feel,'' said Harry Stein, author of ''One of the Guys,'' ''but almost everything that's been written seems pitched to what women expect to read - no one's honestly expressed what it's like to be a man in this era. I wanted to do that in a way that would ring true.'' Feminism has brought up questions without answering them, the 39-year-old author said in a telephone interview from his home in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. ''The perception that men are reluctant to share intimate feelings is on target. What's not understood - or even addressed - is why. One reason is that we're more fragile and vulnerable than commonly thought, so we try to cover up and protect ourselves. I see these same tendencies even in my 3-year-old son. He's cocky and brazen on the one hand, and also very needy.'' Mr. Stein, the author of two previous books, a contributing editor for Esquire and a syndicated humor columnist on children and family life, works primarily at home, where he shares child-rearing responsibilities with his wife, Priscilla Turner, a television writer. ''She still does more drudge work, but she made me face up to the responsibilities of parenthood. If I'd been born 30 years earlier, I'd now be totally devoted to my career. But I'm lucky that I had the license to fall in love with my family and experience a kind of joy that once wouldn't have been possible for someone like me. I think a lot of men now want women who will challenge them and push them to be more emotionally expressive.'' BARBARA LOVENHEIM

148-> Soviets On, After All
The 23 members of the Maly Theater of Leningrad who checked into the Marriott Marquis Hotel almost a week ago will be appearing on the New York stage after all. ''Stars of the Morning Sky,'' set in the Soviet Village where prostitutes were sent from Moscow during the 1980 Olympics, will be given 16 performances at the American Place Theater beginning June 20 or June 21, according to Ken Marsolais, the producer. Until last week, the Maly troupe had been scheduled to present a two-evening, seven-hour play called ''Brothers and Sisters'' as part of the First New York International Festival of the Arts. But the production was abruptly canceled. Short of Funds ''Basically what we did is use the funds we raised for 'Brothers and Sisters' for this show,'' Mr. Marsolais said yesterday. He added that he had never raised enough money to produce ''Brothers and Sisters'' but that he had enough funds to produce the more modest ''Stars of the Morning Sky.'' ''Stars'' will receive the same $150,000 subsidy from the festival that would have gone to the longer play. ''Brothers and Sisters'' would have cost $600,000; ''Stars'' will cost only half of that, Mr. Marsolais said. The Maly Theater had been staging ''Stars of the Morning Sky'' in Toronto. When the run ended, the troupe flew to New York, but 37 members of the company who were to have flown to New York from Leningrad to perform in ''Brothers and Sisters'' remained in the Soviet Union. Martin Segal, chairman of the festival, expressed pleasure that the Russian company would be appearing. ''We don't draw an artistic distinction between 'Brothers and Sisters' and 'Stars in the Morning Sky,' '' Mr. Segal said. Lev Dodin, the director of the Maly Theater, remained somewhat dissatisfied: ''Still I feel some bitterness about the company members who are in Leningrad at the moment, bitterness about something that was to have happened but hasn't,'' he said.

149-> Soviet Paper Reports Strike Has Spread Through Armenia
A general strike over a disputed Soviet region has spread from Yerevan, the capital of Soviet Armenia, to the rest of the republic, the Government newspaper Izvestia said today. ''Today in Yerevan and across the territory of the entire republic a considerable part, if not the majority, of industrial and construction enterprises and transport are still not working,'' Izvestia said. Izvestia said troops had left Yerevan's main square, which they patrolled and blocked on Wednesday. The square has been the scene of many demonstrations in recent months.

150-> Sports of the Times; Lee Weyer's Eyeglasses
IT started to rain that first game in Korakuen Stadium in Tokyo. Pete Rose recalled that Lee Weyer, the umpire, was going to get wet. Weyer had accompanied the Cincinnati Reds on this exhibition tour to Japan after the 1978 season, and now the Japanese umpires slipped on raincoats. They handed one to Weyer. ''Remember, Lee was 6-6 and this was before he lost some of his weight, so he was around 280,'' said Rose, now the Reds' manager. ''The raincoat they gave him was a Japanese raincoat. He put it on and it was about three times too small. The sleeves came up to about his elbows.'' Rather than hurt the hosts' feelings, Rose recalled, Weyer, with a smile on his broad face, umpired the rest of the moist game in his tight little coat. People were recalling Lee Weyer again this week. Weyer died of a heart attack Monday night, a few hours after having umpired at first base in the Giants-Cubs game in San Francisco. He was 51 years old, and had been a National League umpire for 26 years. ''I rate him one of the top,'' said Rose. ''If not the top.'' So did Dave Johnson of the Mets, in the other clubhouse in Shea Stadium. So did the players. Weyer umpired four All-Star Games and four World Series and was behind the plate when Rose got the hit that passed Cobb on the career list. When Henry Aaron passed Babe Ruth with his 715th career homer, he also passed Lee Weyer, who was umpiring at third base. Those were thrills for him, he once said. Besides being fair and aware, he was big, and confident - confident enough, the players say, ''to let a guy beef without runnin' him right away,'' unlike some of the newer umpires. And self-assured enough that when he blew a call in the seventh game of last year's World Series, he faced up to it. ''I got blocked out on the play,'' he said. Others, though, like Doug Harvey, the only National League umpire with seniority over Weyer, recalled something else. ''I remember when Lee came back from that illness and few thought he would,'' said Harvey. IN the spring of 1980, Weyer was stricken with a mysterious illness. His vision blurred, his arms and legs shook and his hands shook so badly he could hardly squeeze toothpaste on a toothbrush. He had been afflicted with Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare disorder that generally affects motor control and can also cause blindness. For a while, his life hung in the balance. When that threat passed, a doctor told him, ''I don't know if you'll ever be able to work a baseball game again.'' ''Why not?'' Weyer said. ''Being blind never stopped me from umpiring before.'' He went to watch the Dodgers play in Los Angeles and when a foul ball was hit in his direction, he ducked. He was embarrassed to find that the ball landed about 100 feet away from him. ''My depth perception was terrible,'' he said. Miraculously, with nature taking a positive turn and Weyer industriously embarking on a program of physical therapy and jogging to regain coordination, he improved. But his eyesight was still faulty. Umpires, as is commonly known, are allowed to be short or fat or bald or ill-tempered, but one thing the league insists on is that they be able to see. Weyer began wearing glasses, and when he returned to the field, he would sneak the glasses on just as play was about to start, and sneak them off and into his pocket when the inning ended, as if no one would see. BUT they did. Some kidded him. ''Hey, Clark Kent!'' And one time, when the umpires stepped onto a field, he heard someone in the stands begin to sing ''Three Blind Mice.'' By then, though, said Weyer, ''I was so glad to be back that it was music to my ears.'' A few other umpires had worn glasses, too. ''But, really,'' said Weyer, ''what difference does it make? Ballplayers hit .300 with 'em.'' Weyer was back and as good as ever, as happy as ever, as voluble as ever. ''He had this kind of high voice, I mean, if you didn't see him, and you heard his voice, you'd think he was a frail guy,'' said Johnny Bench, the former Reds catcher. ''When he was behind the plate, he always called out not just the balls and strikes, but the number of outs, too. Two balls, two strikes, two outs. I think he did it because he just loved being in the game.'' In Tuesday night's game at Shea, there was a close play at first base, and Doug Harvey, who umpired in the crew when Weyer broke into the majors in 1961, called out Chris Sabo, the Cincinnati runner. Manager Rose came hustling out of the dugout, obviously to argue the call. Shortly, he returned to the dugout. Doug Harvey later recalled that scene as he stood in the doorway to the umpires' room under the stands at Shea: ''Pete came out and said, 'You called it right, Doug, but I just wanted say that it was tough about Lee.' ''I said, 'Yeah, Pete, it was, and I'm having a tough time with it.' ''I looked at him and said, 'Well, if you're going to stand out here and talk, you might as well flap your arms, for heaven's sakes, so people will think you're doing something.' '' At the umpires' door, Harvey said: ''Lee was my good friend. It was like losing a brother. Really, that's all I can say now.'' And Doug Harvey, with his distinctive shock of snow-white hair and his eyes now rimmed with red, quietly disappeared behind the closing door.

151-> THE LAW; BIG FIRMS OFFER DEATH ROW DEFENSE
Miguel Richardson bears little resemblance to the securities brokers and corporate raiders that Steven Rosenfeld, a partner in Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, has always represented. Mr. Richardson, convicted of the murders of two Holiday Inn security guards in San Antonio, has been on death row in Texas since 1982. ''From the point of view of a typical corporate attorney, this is an entirely different clientele,'' Mr. Rosenfeld said. ''This sort of population is not the most popular in society and there is a certain reservation about doing this sort of work in the minds of a lot of people. But it's hard to pick a group of people who need help more but have less access to it.'' To an uncommon extent, many of the nation's most prestigious corporate law firms are volunteering for duty in a difficult area of criminal law: capital punishment. Some, like Paul, Weiss, have represented death row inmates before but are doing so more often. Many others, especially in the South and West, are taking on such cases for the first time. Represented All the Way The movement is a response to an acute shortage of criminal lawyers for capital appeals. While the defendants have a constitutional right to legal representation at trial and through at least one appeal, there is no constitutional right to a lawyer through the long process of appealing a death sentence all the way to the United States Supreme Court. Many states have mechanisms to provide representation for death row appeals, but there are not enough defense lawyers to go around, according to prosecutors, prisoner rights organizations and many judges. The entry of leading corporate law firms into death row appeals has brought complaints from some prosecutors who are annoyed by the delays and long legal briefs that the civil litigators have brought to this criminal matter. But the influx of sharp new legal minds is also welcomed in the legal community as bringing sophistication to the increasingly complex appeals process. To some in the legal community, it signals more willingness the legal establishment to examine the legal and social issues inherent in representing people who have been sentenced to death. ''There's been a noticeable change in atmosphere,'' said Michael Mello, a professor of the Vermont Law School, referring to Washington, where he previously worked on capital cases at Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering, as an associate. ''I think there's been a general raising of the level of consciousness that there's a problem with representation. Firms are just more receptive to taking death penalty cases.'' Even so, the condemned still vastly exceed the number of lawyers available to represent them. The nation's death row population is now over 2,000. More than 2,500 new inmates have been added since 1976, the year the Supreme Court re-established capital punishment, while only 100 prisoners have been executed. The NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund Inc. estimates that at least a third of death row inmates are without counsel at some point. In the last six months the American Bar Association, local bar associations and legal defense groups have started vigorous campaigns to recruit lawyers. The A.B.A. has received 1,200 responses to its recent mailings, said Esther Lardent, who directs its recruiting program. The results are most striking in the courts in Texas, where at least 35 civil firms, half of them from outside the state, have taken capital cases since last October. Advantages in Inexperience While most of the participating corporate lawyers have little or no experience in the field, experts say training and resources, and often the sheer love of challenge, more than compensates. Yale Kamisar, a leading constitutional scholar at the University of Michigan law school, said inexperience in death penalty appeals could even be an advantage in opening the way to novel approaches. ''People in private law firms come in and have certain visions and insights experienced criminal lawyers would not,'' Professor Kamisar said. ''A civil lawyer who takes a capital case is more likely to get fired up and think of every conceivable argument he can make.'' Also, the corporate firms can afford to spend far more time and money than nonprofit advocacy groups and overworked death row defense lawyers, who once had the field to themselves. ''It is a lot easier for me to help out than for an individual practitioner who would quite literally be giving up his practice to do the amount of work we've done,'' said Floyd Abrams of the Wall Street firm of Cahill, Gordon & Reindel. In May, he appeared before the Supreme Court on behalf of Samuel Johnson, convicted of the murder of a Mississippi state police officer. Mr. Abrams estimated that his firm spent over $1 million in legal time on the case before the Court overturned Mr. Johnson's death sentence last month. In Georgia, Andrew Legare has been sentenced to death three times in nine years. Each time, John H. Fleming of Sutherland, Asbill & Brennan in Atlanta, won reversals on the basis of such technical grounds as Mr. Legare's youth, jury charging and consideration of background in sentencing. ''There are a lot of things that firms like ours can do in developing the facts and briefing the law very fully,'' said Mr. Fleming, who normally litigates franchise disputes. Long Briefs Under Fire Some prosecutors say big firms are slowing the pace of justice with unnecessarily long legal briefs. ''They could cite 'Strickland v. Washington,' but they file a brief 10 pages long explaining it,'' William B. Hill Jr., Senior Assistant Attorney General in Georgia, said of the large firms. ''It's a paper chase. They've got the people and they try to build a record so voluminous it doesn't lend itself to quick review.'' Other prosecutors complain of delays granted to allow the new arrivals to familiarize themselves with the cases. ''Sooner or later, somebody's going to have to do some serious litigation,'' grumbled Robert S. Walt, a prosecutor in the Attorney General's office in Texas, which has 277 death row inmates. Other prosecutors are willing to coach the teams in criminal procedure. ''Start-up cost is involved,'' said Caprice Cosper, chief of the post-conviction writ section in the Harris County District Attorney's office in Houston, ''but if these firms are going to handle the death penalty cases from start to finish, there is a very real benefit that both sides will recognize.'' Some corporate lawyers experienced in capital cases caution, however, that cases taken by big firms are not always handled properly due to a lack of time or failure to take advantage of training and resources offered by defense advocacy organizations. Still, it is generally agreed that the civil firms' presence has meant more capital appeals can be handled more thoroughly. ''It is a given reality of the people on death row in Texas and most of the South -they've all gone through a system where they've gotten perfunctory representation,'' said Howard Haenel of Pryor, Carney & Johnson in Denver, which is handling a Texas case. ''You can't fault the lawyers. It's the system where there's not the money to pay lawyers to defend. You can't even romanticize it and pretend somebody's on some quixotic journey - the windmill's too big.''

152-> AT HOME ABROAD; Reason to Celebrate
To be present at a friend's triumph is a rare pleasure. It was mine last weekend at the opening of the new National Gallery of Canada, designed by Moshe Safdie. On a point of land overlooking the Ottawa River and the Victorian Gothic castles of the Canadian Parliament, Mr. Safdie has created a vision of light and mass, of steel and glass and rose granite. It is an art museum, large and functional, but it is more than that. Its form expresses higher aspirations, human and national. The crowds that poured through the gallery in its first days were drawn by some such feeling, I am sure. There were thousands, day and night, walking up the lofty colonnade to the great towered space where the two wings of the structure meet. They went on to the rooms of pictures. But the magic was in the building. ''What you have done for Canada!'' a man said to Mr. Safdie as he stood in the crush of the opening reception. That expressed what many clearly felt: a sense of national pride in the building. Here was something new in the world, dazzling - and Canadian. Its architect, its materials, its links to history: all Canadian. For a country divided between two cultures and sensitive about being a mere appendage to its superpower neighbor, that was something. It was as if Canadians, who can be so unsure of their national identity, could find it in this secular cathedral. The enthusiastic popular reaction was also an extraordinary personal vindication for Moshe Safdie. The Canadian weekly news magazine Maclean's entitled its cover story ''Triumph of an Outcast.'' Mr. Safdie was born in Haifa 49 years ago. His family moved to Canada when he was 15, and he got his architecture degree at McGill University. He made his first mark when he was only 29, with his stunning apartment complex at Montreal's Expo 67, Habitat. His radical idea of modular concrete units, stacked so that each had its own outlook and privacy, won prizes. But the idea, and Mr. Safdie, drew enemies in Canada, and he got no other commission there for 15 years. In 1982 Pierre Trudeau, then Prime Minister, decided to do what Canada had talked about for a century: build a gallery for its national art collection. The next year he and his Cabinet chose Mr. Safdie as the architect. In just five years, an unimaginably short time in the United States, Canada has a museum one-third larger than I. M. Pei's monumental East Wing of the National Gallery in Washington. The building is not only thrilling in itself but good for displaying pictures -which the East Wing, for all its beauty, is not. A novel system designed by Mr. Safdie brings natural light down to the lower floor through tubes lined with reflective Mylar. In addition to the National Gallery, Mr. Safdie has designed a new Quebec Museum of Civilization and an addition to Montreal's Museum of Fine Arts. He has just won an international competition for an opera-ballet house in Toronto. His spirit will inform an age of public architecture in Canada. In Jerusalem, too, he has had a significant role as architect and urban designer. New York City was the place of Mr. Safdie's one great recent disappointment. He did a striking design, full of pyramids and gardens, for the huge building planned at Columbus Circle. When some citizens protested its size and the shadow it would cast on Central Park, the developer threw Mr. Safdie to the wolves. The size, determined by politics and economics, was excessive. But I think New Yorkers will come to regret the loss of a building so much more interesting and humane in its design than the chichi inanities of post-modernism. Ottawa is a small and provincial city compared with New York. But one sees in it an impressive commitment to public places: gardens, a beautifully kept canal, a Museum of Civilization going up across the river from the new gallery. Politicians, Hugh Winsor wrote in The Toronto Globe and Mail, usually give us stodgy public buildings constrained by Babbitry and fiscal orthodoxy. ''But a few times in each century something bold, something imaginative . . . actually comes into being. It did in the National Gallery of Canada.''

153-> THE EXECUTIVE COMPUTER; Searching for a Friendly Interface
AS they build computers that are easier to use, computer makers have been making hardware and software that is more complex and more expensive. The Macintosh has long been cited as a friendly computer, but it is expensive. Efforts to bring Macintosh-like features to the PC have focused on Microsoft Windows, or OS/2 With Presentation Manager. But those alternatives are also costly, and learning to use them is not easy. Nor do these approaches help the estimated 18 million users of plain old I.B.M. PC's and compatibles. The Tandy Corporation believes that PC users should be able to take greater advantage of the features of those powerful programs, and it wants to offer more of those features at low cost through its Deskmate program. The two versions of Deskmate now available offer users many of the features found in more expensive and complex systems, but in very simple form. Tomorrow, however, Tandy will announce that by the end of the summer, a number of vendors will begin offering newly developed software to be used with Deskmate that will allow users to take greater advantage of such features. Not only will users be able to work with windows and menus in calling up word processing or spreadsheet programs, for example, but when those programs are called up, the user will be able to use click buttons and menus to control them. (The drive to develop Macintosh-like programs drew a pointed legal response last week from Apple Computer Inc. It filed a lawsuit accusing Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard of infringing on its patents regarding the Macintosh look. Whether that suit will have a chilling effect on software developers remains to be seen. A Tandy spokesman said his company had studied the suit closely. ''The use of menus and graphics on a computer screen is hardly copyright-able,'' he said. ''Deskmate is different from Windows and Apple.'') If Deskmate catches on, and if major software developers support it, the long-sought common interface - the screen that first confronts someone when the computer is powered up - may be at hand. To appreciate what a change that would be, compare the Apple Macintosh, which has a graphical interface, with the I.B.M. PC or compatible, which has a text-based interface. In the text-based interface, the user powers up the computer and is greeted with the A:G prompt, which is simply a demand that the user respond by giving the computer directions by typing a string of characters. The graphical interface used by the Mac, the Amiga, the Atari and other computers greets the user with a small picture - called an icon -that represents a function or activity. By pointing at the icon and clicking a mouse ear, the task is executed. The beauty of the graphical interface is that almost all software works roughly the same way. If you are somewhat familiar with one piece of Mac software, it doesn't take long to figure out how to get into unfamiliar programs. In the PC world, all bets are off once past the DOS prompt. Each program may look and act uniquely. Tandy hopes to create a common standard for applications, and is gathering support among software makers. Through Deskmate, a program that sits atop the DOS operating system and creates a Mac-like screen on the old PC and XT-class machines, the PC user would be able to take advantage of a host of Mac-like functions at a fraction of the cost. It's essentially a one-size-fits-all system best suited for small businesses, homes and education, although it runs well on the powerful machines too. For high-end business applications, Deskmate is no substitute for Windows, OS/2 with Presentation Manager or other advanced systems. Deskmate does not, for example, handle multitasking - the ability to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. But millions of people don't need all that power; they just need an easier way to use their computers. What is on screen is one way to make computers more friendly. But the software applications must also be easier to use. To that end, Tandy has persuaded several major software makers - including Activision, First Byte, Sierra Online, Intuit, Electronic Arts and Symantec - to develop products that take specific advantage of Deskmate. John Roach, Tandy's chairman, recently showed off Deskmate in his office suite here overlooking the vast Texas plains. Mr. Roach runs a $3.5 billion company, of which computers make up a mere $1 billion. He works with a computer at his right hand, and Deskmate provides his window into the Tandy information network. Mr. Roach opened six or seven different windows at once on his screen (arranged as tiles, rather than as the overlapping windows the Mac presents). One listed word-processing files, another electronic mail messages. Another had spreadsheet files. In another window, financial information about Tandy had been collected from a variety of sources. Above them ran a menu bar - a line of buttons, each representing a different function - that allowed him to execute a variety of applications, including word processing and communications, at the click of a mouse. Mr. Roach has customized the size and position of the windows, making the most important ones the most prominent. ON this day, as he tried to wrap things up before a week's vacation, the calendar feature was most prominent. At the click of a mouse a list of coming meetings appears. His assistants, whose machines are on a network with his, can tell at a glance what his schedule is. ''It also allows me to work with other people on the floor,'' he said. ''If I want to check the availability of someone for a meeting, I can check their schedule. Let's see: Mr. Hill is supposed to be skiing today, so his schedule ought to be pretty short.'' A mouse click called up Mr. Hill's daily schedule. Mr. Roach read the single line - ''Out all day, Denver'' - and smiled wistfully. Tandy's pursuit of Mac-like simplicity for its entire line of MS-DOS computers in the last few years has led to persistent rumors that it is preparing a Macintosh clone. Tandy advertised in trade journals for programmers familiar with Macintosh programming, and the speculation spread that Tandy was going to be the first to clone the Mac. Tandy insists that when it introduces some computers later this year, there will be no MacClone. More likely, Deskmate will be coded to a greater extent into the ROM (read only memory) of the new machines, making its use even more simple and automatic.

154-> Rockwell Pleas Entered
The Rockwell International Corporation and two former executives pleaded not guilty Tuesday to Federal charges accusing the aerospace contractor of overbilling the Air Force by $450,000. The pleas were entered in a hearing before United States District Judge Consuelo B. Marshall, who set trial for Oct. 11. A seven-count indictment filed earlier this month charges Rockwell and two former managers at the Seal Beach Satellite Systems division, Donald H. Carter, 59 years old, and Robert Zavodnik, 46, with overbilling a navigation system contract.

155-> Managua Journal; At Home, the Sandinistas Face a Businesslike Foe
Although the ideals of capitalism and unbridled free enterprise are viewed suspiciously in Nicaragua, a group of outspoken businessmen has remained in the country and emerged as a key part of the anti-Sandinista opposition. Nicaraguan political parties are traditionally weak and divided, but business groups are remarkably united. They have filled roles that in many countries are filled by opposition parties, and they have thus become prime targets of the Sandinista Government. This week, one of the most articulate spokesmen from the private sector, Ramiro Gurdian, was named to head the Democratic Coordinator, Nicaragua's main anti-Sandinista coalition. His predecessor, Carlos Huembes, is in jail awaiting trial for his role in a protest rally that the police broke up violently in the town of Nandaime on July 10. Testing the Sandinistas Undaunted by the arrests in Nandaime and other steps taken against the opposition recently, Mr. Gurdian is determined to test the limits of Sandinista tolerance. His ascension to leadership may signal a phase of new anti-Sandinista militance. ''We have to keep up the demonstrations,'' he said in an interview after assuming his new post. ''I'm trying to organize a march for the end of August in Managua. The idea is to put 100,000 people on the street.'' No anti-Sandinistra rally has ever attracted nearly that many people. But Mr. Gurdian believes the political climate here is rapidly changing because of the country's sharp economic decline. ''The situation today is much more acute,'' he said. ''The leader of the Nicaraguan opposition is called hunger. People are hungry now, and when people don't see any solution, economic discontent becomes political discontent.'' Business Groups Active The Democratic Coordinator includes anti-Sandinista political parties and trade unions as well as business groups. But the business groups maintain more offices around the country than all opposition parties combined. The Government views them as potentially dangerous because of their influence over much of the economy. Mr. Gurdian, 44 years old, is a graduate of Arkansas State University, and he converses easily in both Spanish and in English. He is among the most sophisticated opposition figures in Nicaragua, and also among the most militant. In 1983 his banana farm was confiscated after he made what were deemed to be unpatriotic comments about sugar exports. Two leaders of the private sector with whom Mr. Gurdian worked, Guillermo Quant Tai and Mario Alegria, are serving long jail terms on charges of having collaborated with American intelligence agencies. Mr. Gurdian said he would not be surprised if he joins them in prison at some point. But although he has business interests in Costa Rica, where his family now lives, he plans to remain in Nicaragua. Mr. Gurdian represents a minority of Nicaraguan businessmen who have resisted the temptation to throw up their hands in despair and leave the country. Many decorate their offices with copies of a poster that carries an outlined map of Nicaragua with the legend: ''I Need You. Don't Abandon Me.'' ''If I go, I won't wind up sweeping floors in Miami,'' Mr. Gurdian said with a shrug. ''But I'm staying because I love my country. Nicaragua has been good to me. I'd feel like a coward if I left.'' Sandinistas Are Suspicious Government leaders do not believe the motives of businessmen like Mr. Gurdian are purely altruistic. Their true mission, senior officials say, is to organize a movement that will ultimately overthrow the Government. ''Their conversion into shock troops of the Yankee embassy, their support for 'business strikes' and their demand for 'new governments' that could be imposed only by American intervention puts their associates on the verge of an extremely serious risk,'' said a recent editorial in the official Sandinista newspaper Barricada. Many Nicaraguan exiles say they believe that businessmen who have remained in Nicaragua are virtual collaborators with the Sandinista Government. But here they are reviled as rightists, a label Mr. Gurdian rejects. ''No one in the private sector who is still in Nicaragua, after suffering all that we have suffered, can be considered a rightist,'' he said. ''If you're a rightist, you go crazy, or they shoot you, or you leave Nicaragua. You don't stay here.'' But Mr. Gurdian does not deny the assertion that he wants to see a new government in Nicaragua. The removal of President Daniel Ortega Saavedra is not necessary, he says. But he is pressing for the election of a new Assembly to consider sweeping constitutional changes that would effectively cripple Sandinista rule. Land Program Scorned Mr. Gurdian reserves special scorn for the Sandinista land program, which he says has led to sharp drops in production and the expropriation of land from 25,000 peasants who owned private plots of less than 85 acres. ''The Sandinistas do not actually give land to anyone,'' he said. ''The title goes to a Sandinista cooperative. The peasants don't own that land. The Sandinista Front owns it.'' Vice President Sergio Ramirez Mercado smiled during a recent interview when he heard of Mr. Gurdian's proposal that private plots of land be given permanently to individual peasant families. ''For that to happen, Ramiro Gurdian would have to be Minister of Agriculture,'' Mr. Ramirez said. ''That cannot be.''

156-> The Electoral College's Cold Calculus
Americans have long hankered for formulas to predict elections. Some formulas work better than others. After the Roosevelt landslide of 1936, James J. Farley suggested dryly that the old cliche, ''As Maine goes, so goes the Nation,'' be updated to read, ''As Maine goes, so goes Vermont.'' Yet the inhabitants of Crook County, Oregon, have unerringly picked 26 consecutive winners, from Grover Cleveland through Ronald Reagan. This year's fashionable formula goes something like this: Despite Governor Michael Dukakis's edge in the early polls, the Republicans have a virtual ''lock'' on the Electoral College. This should, in turn, work to the advantage of Vice President Bush. The political analyst credited with the ''lock'' theory is Horace Busby, who once worked for Lyndon Johnson. Even before Jimmy Carter's defeat in 1980, Mr. Busby concluded that ''the Electoral College . . . is a Republican institution.'' He argued that the addition of important Sunbelt states like Florida and Texas to traditional Republican power bases elsewhere provided a recipe for long-term G.O.P. rule. It is an excessively mechanistic formula. But it merits careful examination. An American Presidential election is not one big exercise in democracy but a collection of separate contests in 50 states and the District of Columbia. Each state is allotted electors equal to its Congressional representation; all except Maine's must cast their ballots for the winner in their state. The 538-member Electoral College may be outdated 18th century political furniture. But it heavily influences campaign strategy, since it ultimately picks the winner. Indeed, on three occasions - 1824, 1876 and 1888 - it chose as President a man who received fewer popular votes than his opponent. Recent history seems to confirm a Republican tilt. In the last 5 elections, 23 states with 202 electoral votes have voted Republican every time. Thirteen more have voted Republican four times. In 1988, these 36 states would produce 354 electoral votes, far more than the 270 required for a majority. The reason for this tilt is not that there are more Republicans. On the contrary, there are more registered Democrats. The tilt occurs because of where Republicans live. The last half century has seen a steady migration from the traditionally Democratic Northeast to the South, Southwest and West. These shifts have robbed Democratic states of electors while strengthening the influence of more conservative states. Between 1932 and 1980, for example, New York's representation dropped from 47 electors to 41, while California's and Florida's more than doubled. In an article in The Atlantic, William Schneider, the political scientist, observes that in 1932 the Northeast and Middle West accounted for 54 per cent of the nation's electoral votes, the South and West for 46 per cent. Now those figures are reversed. To critics, however, the cold math of the ''lock'' theory overlooks warmblooded political realities: Hubert Humphrey's association with Lyndon Johnson's Vietnam policies; George McGovern's supposed radicalism; Jimmy Carter's disaster in Iran. The reason Democrats lost in 1968, 1972, and 1980, critics say, was not the Electoral College but their talent for shooting themselves in the foot. Besides, the Electoral College determinism looks less persuasive on closer examination. In 1976, California did indeed go Republican. But Gerald Ford won there by a less-than-staggering 1.7 per cent. In Ohio, he won by a razor-thin 0.2 per cent. There is a tilt in the Electoral College, and if there were any way to contrive a race in which both candidates were robots and all issues neutral, demographic trends would probably yield another Republican victory. But other things count - personality, for instance, and character and experience. The candidates are not robots - and neither are the voters of Crook County, Oregon.

157-> Review/Theater; Giving Voice to Beckett's Mordant Band
''Tears and laughter, they are so much Gaelic to me,'' says the title character in Samuel Beckett's novel ''Molloy.'' Those words resonate through ''I'll Go On,'' Barry McGovern's exhilarating one-man play drawn from Mr. Beckett's prose. Mr. McGovern, an actor with Dublin's Gate Theater, is performing ''I'll Go On'' at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater in Lincoln Center as part of the First New York International Festival of the Arts. Both the actor and the author are irrevocably linked, as was also the case in 1970 when Jack MacGowran presented his own signature evening of Beckett. Mr. MacGowran's anthology was drawn from the whole of Mr. Beckett's body of work - plays, fiction and poetry. In contrast, Mr. McGovern's ''I'll Go On'' concentrates entirely on the trilogy of novels ''Molloy,'' ''Malone Dies'' and ''The Unnamable,'' which, especially in the case of ''The Unnamable,'' are among the densest works of modern fiction. In his distillation, Mr. McGovern illuminates the accessibility of the novels, their Irishness and their brilliant, bitter humor. Though written in French and then translated into English, the novels are steeped in Irish character and wit, both of which are conveyed with indelible authenticity by Mr. McGovern. Admittedly, some of the comic emphasis results from the choice of passages to dramatize (the adaptation of the novels is by Mr. McGovern and Gerry Dukes). For one thing, the adapters concentrate on the first half of ''Molloy,'' stressing the relationship between the protagonist and his mother. But though this and the other novels are excerpted, ''I'll Go On'' retains the full flavor of the original. The author's primary obsessions in these books, as elsewhere, are with the brief distance between birth and death, with the composition of art and the decomposition of man. This is no dry staged reading, but an imaginative one-man play that uncovers a theatrical consanguinity in the dreamlike monologues. The evening is filled with the richness of the author's language, as delivered by the wonderfully expressive voice of Mr. McGovern. The striking direction is by Colm O Briain, with the scenic and lighting design, by Robert Ballagh and Rupert Murray, as an additional asset. After greeting the audience informally in an aisle of the theater, Mr. McGovern is discovered on stage in Molloy's mother's room. Dressed in floor-length greatcoat (lined for warmth with pages of the Times Literary Supplement), with his hair shorn close to his head, the actor looks like a mournful Beckett tramp. The mirthfully pessimistic Molloy, reduced to ''confabulation,'' tells us about riding his bicycle through the streets of Dublin in search of his departed mother. The misadventures include a collision with a dog; to his astonishment, the accidental killing is greeted with the owner's thanks since the animal was ''old, blind, deaf, crippled with rheumatism and perpetually incontinent'' and on its way to the veterinarian to be put to sleep. Then Molloy recapitulates his mathematical problem trying to avoid repetition while transferring ''sucking stones'' from pocket to pocket to mouth, an episode that ends with the cynical conclusion that none of the intricate ritual mattered because all the stones tasted exactly alike (this is one point at which Mr. McGovern's show overlaps with that of Mr. MacGowran). From there, Molloy moves to a great love of his life, whom he falteringly remembers as being named either Ruth or Edith. He met her in that favorite trysting spot, a rubbish heap. With a final curse of his mother, Molloy exits, to be replaced after an intermission by his kinsman, Malone, anticipating his own death. Preparing for that eventuality, Mr. McGovern's Malone is shrouded in a sheet and reclining on a tomb as if waiting for a Grim Reaper to cut him down in mid-paragraph. ''I shall soon be quite dead at last in spite of it all,'' he announces, but before he leaves he has a few colorful stories to tell -about friends such as Lambert, the pig sticker. For his close, the actor delivers a precis of the Unnamable's breathless monologue, ending with those most famous of Beckett last words, ''You must go on, I can't go on, I'll go on.'' From beginning to end, scarcely 90 minutes passes, but this is ample time to give us a microcosm of Beckett's mordant world. Though the words are from fiction, they have, in Mr. McGovern's interpretation, the life of theater in them. Coming from the 1950's, the period when he also created ''Waiting for Godot,'' the trilogy represents the author at the peak of his creativity, all of which is communicated by this eloquent actor. 'Sucking Stones' And a Pig Sticker I'LL GO ON, based on the novels ''Molloy,'' ''Malone Dies'' and ''The Unnamable,'' by Samuel Beckett; adapted by Gerry Dukes and Barry McGovern; directed by Colm O Briain; designed by Robert Ballagh; lighting design by Rupert Murray; production manager, Jeff Hamlin; general manager, Steven C. Callahan. The Gate Theater Dublin, presented by Lincoln Center Theater, Gregory Mosher, director; Bernard Gersten, executive producer, by arrangement with Ken Marsolais and Patricia Daily.

158-> Israelis Say U.S. Praise of Peres May Backfire
The unusually warm praise of Foreign Minister Shimon Peres by the White House on Tuesday, and the indirect criticism of his chief political rival, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, set off partisan bickering here today. But on at least one point both sides seemed to agree. Senior officers from the Likud bloc as well as the Labor Party said that while praise from President Reagan might please Mr. Peres now, ''it could boomerang in Israeli public opinion,'' as an official close to the Foreign Minister put it. ''Maybe to a lot of people it will look like the Americans have him in their pocket,'' the official added. A senior Likud ally of Mr. Shamir said: ''This is going to backfire. It will help Shamir in the elections.'' After Mr. Reagan met with Mr. Peres for half an hour on Tuesday, the White House issued a statement praising him for showing a ''positive attitude toward peace,'' adding that the Foreign Minister was ''creative and has the courage and wisdom to say yes when real opportunities arise.'' At the same time, the statement denounced ''those leaders who are negative, consistently reject new ideas'' and ''make progress impossible.'' Mr. Peres, the head of the Labor Party, has endorsed Secretary of State George P. Shultz's Middle East peace initiative, while Mr. Shamir, the Likud chief, has tried to deflect it. Publicly, the Prime Minister's office said, ''When the White House refers to foreign leaders with a negative attitude toward peace, they must be referring to Arab leaders who refuse to negotiate with Israel.'' But behind the scenes, Likud politicians close to the Prime Minister said they knew the statement alluded to Mr. Shamir. ''The Likud Cabinet ministers are enraged,'' an official said. ''It's tantamount to meddling in Israel's interior problems. And it shows the Foreign Minister using his official visit to Washington to get the American support for him in the political campaign.'' Mr. Peres, interviewed from the United States by the Israeli radio, said that ''I gratefully appreciate'' the White House statement, adding, ''It came as a pleasant surprise.'' Israel elects a new government in November, and the central campaign issue is almost certain to be what should be done with the occupied territories, where Palestinian protests are in their sixth month. One Palestinian was killed and nine were wounded today when villagers from the West Bank town of Abwein attacked an army patrol with stones and slingshots and soldiers opened fire, army and hospital officers said. The death brings the total killed to 169.

159-> Dr. Krim's Crusade
AS SHE SAT ON THE podium at Christie's, the auction house on Manhattan's Upper East Side, Mathilde Krim was in familiar company. She was sharing the stage with Leo Castelli, the SoHo gallery owner, and her friend Elizabeth Taylor, who set the tone for the evening by quoting Marcel Proust: ''Only through art can we get outside of ourselves and know another's view of the universe . . . and see landscapes which would otherwise have remained unknown.'' It was clear from the circumstances - a benefit auction last December for an ongoing effort called Art Against AIDS - that the denizens of the world the actress was trying to evoke were homosexuals and drug addicts. At this stage of the epidemic, they have suffered the most from the virus, which destroys the immunological barriers the body erects against a hostile world. Miss Taylor's remarks were a reminder of why artists, stars, socialites and scientists have come together to fight the disease - in no small part because of Mathilde Krim. Since last June, about 600 art works have been donated, the $2.4 million in proceeds from various sales going to the American Foundation for AIDS Research. An outgrowth of a group Dr. Krim helped establish five years ago in a basement in New York's Greenwich Village, AmFAR helps overcome institutional inertia by quickly giving grants to researchers whose ideas and enthusiasm may be more impressive than their curricula vitae. A small, quiet woman with blue-green eyes, who wears her long blond hair in a bun, Dr. Krim has drawn on her credentials as a scientist (she was head of the interferon laboratory at Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research) and on her social and political connections (her husband is Arthur B. Krim, chairman of Orion Pictures and a former finance chairman of the Democratic National Committee) to raise millions of dollars for AmFAR. As she moved through the well-dressed crowd at Christie's, Dr. Krim seemed as comfortable among celebrities - including Bianca Jagger, the writer Tama Janowitz, the actress Isabella Rossellini and the director David Lynch - as she does at a meeting of AmFAR's scientific board, where she discusses grant proposals with the likes of Robert C. Gallo, co-discoverer of the AIDS virus. ''I think Mathilde rather likes the limelight,'' says her friend Elizabeth M. Kummerfeld, who also raises money for AmFAR. Using AmFAR as her platform, Mathilde Krim has tried to defuse the atmosphere of mutual suspicion that exists between the gay community and the mostly heterosexual establishment. As much as anyone, she has made raising money to fight AIDS not only respectable but even fashionable. Whether she is speaking to a group of high-school students about the importance of prevention or engaging in a television debate with an official from the National Institutes of Health, her underlying message is the same: It is medically and morally wrong to dismiss AIDS as a gay plague or a scourge of the ghetto. ''There is always this notion of lumping people in groups as if some were outside humanity, not part of the 'general population,' '' she says, with the cool, dignified anger that has made her such an effective spokeswoman for her cause. Most epidemiologists now doubt that AIDS will quickly become as widespread among heterosexuals in the United States as it has in parts of Africa. But in her campaign to persuade the public that we are all members of one large risk group, Dr. Krim is adamant that we must guard against complacency. ''Everybody thinks of at least one person whom he has lost or is afraid for,'' she says. ''And I am no different. I have my little list.'' MATHILDE GAL-land Krim was born in Italy in 1926. Her mother, who was of Austrian descent, had grown up in northern Czechoslovakia; her father was Swiss. When Mathilde was a child, the family moved to Geneva. At the start of World War II, she remembers listening with fascination to stories about a sinister-sounding people called the Jews. ''I grew up not really knowing what was going on in the camps,'' she says, ''though I knew that there was a good deal of anti-Semitism in Europe. My parents were no worse than the others, but they were like the others.'' She was appalled when she learned what the Nazis had done. ''The idea that people of my society were responsible for what had happened - it was very shocking to me. And I became very interested in knowing who were those Jews whom everybody had been after. Because I heard those terrible stories, that they were exploiting others, and I wanted to see for myself.'' In 1945, she entered the cosmopolitan world of the University of Geneva, where she befriended some Jews from what was then the British mandate of Palestine. ''They were totally different from what I was told,'' she says. ''I thought, 'My God, if anything, I want to be like them.' '' Encouraged by her friends, Mathilde converted to Judaism and worked with the Irgun, a militant anti-British underground run by a radical Zionist named Menachem Begin. Mathilde helped smuggle weapons to Mr. Begin's group from sympathizers in the old French Resistance. (Years later, after he had become Prime Minister of Israel, he would be the Krims' house guest.) At the same time, Mathilde continued studying biology in Geneva and, in 1953, received her Ph.D. She married David Danon, a fellow student who was Jewish, and the couple moved to Israel, where she became a researcher at the Weizmann Institute of Science. In 1956, she was asked to give a tour of the laboratories to a New York motion-picture executive who was on the institute's board of directors. His name was Arthur Krim. Mathilde's first marriage had ended, and after a long-distance courtship, she married Arthur Krim in 1958 and moved to New York. Mathilde Krim continued her research. She had become interested in the possibility that cancer might be caused by viruses, and after working at Cornell Medical College to learn about virology, she transferred in 1962 to Sloan-Kettering, the most prestigious cancer institute in the United States. Because of her husband's political connections, she soon found herself moving in influential circles. Arthur Krim, aside from serving as finance chairman of the Democratic Party, was an adviser to Presidents Kennedy, Johnson and Carter. In 1966, Mathilde Krim was appointed to the President's Committee on Mental Retardation. Four years later, she was asked to join a panel that was preparing a study for Congress on the history of cancer research. WHILE WRITING the cancer-research report, which would play an important role in the passage of the National Cancer Act of 1971, Dr. Krim came across accounts of an obscure substance called interferon, a naturally occurring protein that seemed to ''interfere'' with viruses, including those that caused tumors. Some experiments even indicated that interferon was effective against the tumors themselves. As Arthur Krim recalls it, he and his wife were sitting in their study when she said, ''I've just read something that is absolutely the most exciting thing I've read in years.'' Most researchers found the case for interferon far less compelling - some of them bemusedly called it ''imaginon.'' But the possibilities of a naturally produced anticancer agent excited Dr. Krim's empathetic nature, so much so that she would later be accused of having let her heart rule her head. Then, as now, the treatments for cancer - surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy - often seemed as brutal as the disease itself. Interferon, Mathilde Krim hoped, could lead to a more humane, ''biological'' treatment. And so she embarked on a single-minded effort that would earn her a nickname: the Interferon Queen. In the process she learned firsthand about the politics of science. At the time, interferon research was time-consuming and extremely expensive, but when Dr. Krim lobbied the National Cancer Institute for money, she encountered a wall of resistance. She was persistent, and finally she convinced the cancer institute to sponsor an international conference on interferon in 1975. The evening before the conference, she and her husband held a reception for 100 at their Manhattan townhouse. ''She more or less singlehandedly rescued the field from oblivion,'' says Martin S. Hirsch, an interferon expert at Massachusetts General Hospital who is now involved in AIDS research. The N.C.I. finally agreed to spend about $1 million for interferon studies. The American Cancer Society jumped in and by 1981 had provided $6 million. Dr. Krim raised additional money from foundations and private donors. With interferon often touted in the press as a miracle drug, patients and their families anxiously awaited the news that would herald victory in the war on cancer. Experiment after experiment, however, proved bitterly disappointing. At first, Dr. Krim and her supporters argued that the problem was with the quality of the interferon - it was simply not pure enough. Then, in 1980, scientists announced that they had successfully cloned interferon. Now it could be manufactured cheaply, purely and in large quantities. But the disappointments have continued. After more than two decades of research, a type of interferon - the name is now given to a family of related proteins - has been approved only for the treatment of one rare kind of leukemia. (Still, interferon is being considered for use against a handful of other cancers, and basic research into it has helped untangle immunological complexities that may be fundamental to the fight against AIDS.) Some critics have argued that in her enthusiasm for interferon, Dr. Krim acted more like an evangelist than a medical researcher. ''There are many examples of fine scientists who, when challenged with the possibility of curing cancer, do not demonstrate the same rigor as they do with their own work,'' says Arthur S. Levine, who headed an interferon fact-finding group for the N.C.I. in the late 1970's. Sandra Panem, a former science and policy fellow at the Brookings Institution, summed up the feeling of many cancer researchers in a 1984 book: ''One clear lesson of the interferon crusade is that rational biomedical policy cannot be based on hype.'' Dr. Krim's promotion of interferon may have cast doubt on her ability to maintain the cool, clinical detachment necessary to succeed as a scientist, but it also showed that she had a talent for persuading powerful people to share her visions, to turn her passion into a cause. BY 1981, DR. KRIM HAD become director of the interferon laboratory at Sloan-Kettering. Though she clung to her belief that interferon and other ''biologicals'' would be important in treating cancer, she was finding her attention drawn to another, more mysterious disease. A year earlier, Joseph Sonnabend, a colleague who had left interferon research to open a medical practice in Greenwich Village, had come to her with an unusual story. ''There is something very strange going on,'' he told Dr. Krim. ''I see a number of people who have similar symptoms. They have big lymph nodes, and they have big spleens, and it looks like a reaction to an infection. But that's it - they have no other symptoms. And the funny thing is that they are all young gay men.'' This was before anyone had heard of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Dr. Krim agreed to help analyze some blood samples. As the testing continued, Dr. Sonnabend's patients began to die. In 1983, with interferon falling further into disrepute, Dr. Krim started the AIDS Medical Foundation, whose main beneficiary was Joseph Sonnabend's research into the fearsome disease. From the beginning, Dr. Krim found it extremely difficult to raise money, especially from large corporations and Wall Street investment houses. ''They felt that this was a disease that resulted from a sleazy life style, drugs or kinky sex - that certain people had learned their lesson and it served them right,'' she says. ''That was the attitude, even on the part of respectable foundations that are supposed to be concerned about human welfare.'' She had no illusions about the promiscuity in New York's gay community, but she was concerned that society might use the disease to persecute homosexuals. She remembered the stories she used to hear about Jews: They are dirty and evil; they deserve to die. ''I thought we had to enlarge our board and diversify - load it with straight people so that it's not one more gay organization,'' she says. By now, Dr. Krim was a veteran at marshaling powerful forces. The philanthropist Mary Lasker agreed to join the effort, as did Elizabeth Kummerfeld, whose husband, Donald D. Kummerfeld, is president of Magazine Publishers of America, a trade organization. In November 1984, Pauline Trigere, Bill Blass and other designers agreed to donate dresses and gowns to a $150-a-ticket fashion show that included a buffet planned by Craig Claiborne. Rosalynn Carter, a friend of the Krims, was also there. About that time, Dr. Krim heard that Michael S. Gottlieb, a Los Angeles immunologist and pioneer AIDS researcher, was establishing a foundation in California with $250,000 bequeathed by Rock Hudson, who had been one of his patients. Mr. Hudson's friend Elizabeth Taylor agreed to help. In 1985, the two groups joined to become the American Foundation for AIDS Research. ''Elizabeth brought on Barbra Streisand, although I asked her in the end because Elizabeth was too shy,'' says Dr. Krim, who also persuaded Warren Beatty and Woody Allen to lend their names to various AmFAR boards. WHILE DR. KRIM'S social connections have been enormously helpful in her new cause, what has made her most effective is her ability to speak the language of science as she presents the cause of the AIDS patient to the research establishment. In 1986, for example, she became embroiled in a controversy over an experimental AIDS drug called azidothymidine, or AZT, which was being tested on patients with advanced cases of AIDS. To gauge the drug's effects, half the patients were given placebos. Dr. Krim thought this was outrageous. By the time it was known if the drug was working, the control group might well be dead. ''People who are on their last legs should get anything they want,'' she says. ''We should just make sure we're not killing them with it.'' AZT, which has a number of harmful side effects, was not going to cure anyone of AIDS, but it might offer dying patients a few more months of life. In testimony before Congress, Dr. Krim opposed the use of placebos for people with full-blown AIDS. Many of her fellow scientists, who consider the need for ''double-blind'' drug trials an article of faith, thought she was wrong. Two powerful opponents - Samuel Broder, the top AIDS drug expert at the N.C.I., and Anthony S. Fauci, coordinator of AIDS research at the N.I.H. - were convinced that, at this point, classically controlled experiments were a necessary evil. Dr. Krim lost the battle. Placebo trials continued and AZT was shown to be reasonably safe and somewhat effective in prolonging life. As with her championing of interferon, Dr. Krim was accused of letting her heart rule her head. Nonetheless, she helped persuade the N.I.H. to end the placebo trials as soon as possible. Now, AZT is often used instead of placebos as a ''benchmark'' in trials of other AIDS drugs. It is a tribute to Dr. Krim's charm and diplomacy that even her opponents in the AZT debate count themselves among her admirers. Samuel Broder, in fact, has joined AmFAR's scientific advisory committee, helping to decide who gets research money. THE MORE THAN $5 million AmFAR spent last year for basic research is dwarfed by the budget of the N.I.H. and other Federal agencies. Rather than compete with the Government, Dr. Krim tries to ''spread the bets'' in the war against AIDS by encouraging AmFAR to finance innovative researchers whose work may be too preliminary to qualify for other funds. It can easily take a year and a half to get money from a Federal agency like the N.I.H. By giving seed money of up to $60,000 two months after application approval, AmFAR allows researchers to quickly compile data that might lead to a larger Government grant. In 1986, for example, William A. Carter, of Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia, was studying ampligen, a synthetic drug that seemed to amplify interferon's antiviral properties. Dr. Carter had it tested in vitro against the AIDS virus and found supporting evidence. But he needed $25,000 to produce enough of the drug to try it on a small group of AIDS patients. ''He was getting nowhere,'' Dr. Krim recalls. ''We gave him the $25,000 and he did his study.'' A year later, he published it in The Lancet, the British medical journal. With that came wider support. ''Du Pont has put up several million dollars to produce ampligen for a large trial,'' says Dr. Krim. She used this kind of philanthropic leverage to help build a sophisticated molecular-virology laboratory at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, a teaching facility for Columbia University, where, in 1986, she had accepted a position as an associate research scientist. The Federal Government requires laboratories working with large quantities of the AIDS virus to install a number of safeguards, including an airlock to keep viruses from leaking into the outside world. These so-called P-3 facilities are rare and expensive. AmFAR gave St. Luke's-Roosevelt $640,000 to help build one of the few P-3 laboratories in New York for AIDS research. This led, in part, to a $5 million grant to the hospital from the N.I.H. AmFAR is now an AIDS foundation that is solidly in the mainstream, financing not only basic research but educational projects. Recently, Dr. Krim convinced AmFAR to help establish a program that will encourage private physicians to work with pharmaceutical companies testing AIDS drugs on volunteers. Last year, to help pay for some of these efforts, Malcolm Forbes donated $1 million. Elizabeth Kummerfeld flew to Japan several times; with the help of Elizabeth Taylor, she finally persuaded Ryoichi Sasakawa, a Japanese businessman, to donate $1 million to the foundation. Joan B. Kroc, the heir to the McDonald's fortune, contributed the third million of the year, and Elizabeth Kummerfeld began speaking of plans to create an international ''Million Dollar Club.'' Even the large corporations were chipping in: Drexel Burnham Lambert, International Business Machines and Xerox, to name a few. Last spring, President Reagan - who for years would not say the word AIDS in public -agreed to address a formal dinner that was being held by AmFAR the night before the third international conference on AIDS in Washington. ''He and his advisers must have thought that this was a good opportunity to appear in public in front of people who would behave reasonably well,'' says Dr. Krim. A Presidential speechwriter talked to Mervyn F. Silverman, AmFAR's president, who suggested that he emphasize the themes of compassion and charity and avoid the controversial subject of systematic testing for the AIDS virus. ''The President said some of the right things, but he chose to mention testing,'' says Dr. Krim. ''So that was the undoing of the rest of his speech. Even in our audience some people resented it, and he was in fact hissed, which was not the polite thing to do. But he should have known better.'' AS MATHILDE KRIM WAS proving herself an effective champion of the war on AIDS, she was falling into disfavor at Sloan-Kettering. Her reputation as a researcher was tarnished by her identification with the interferon crusade, and Paul A. Marks, who had become president of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, was squeezing out scientists he considered unproductive. ''I was told very clearly that I should tone down my visibility,'' Dr. Krim recalls. ''He didn't want his institute to become known as an AIDS hospital. Bad blood developed and at one point I decided, 'This is enough.' '' (Dr. Marks would not comment on the dispute, but a spokesman noted that Sloan-Kettering continues to contribute to research on AIDS and interferon therapy.) In 1985, Dr. Krim left Sloan-Kettering, later becoming associate research scientist at St. Luke's-Roosevelt. She moved her laboratory equipment to the space she had been provided, and then just left it there. She knew that her days as a scientist were over. ''One day I said to Mathilde, 'Are you going back to research?' '' her friend Elizabeth Kummerfeld recalls. ''And she said, 'No, I've been away from the laboratory for nearly 4 1/2 years, and in 4 1/2 years things change. Every year is a discovery. I'm so far behind, I could never catch up.' '' In a way, Dr. Krim feels, it is for the best. She has never been satisfied with her career as a scientist. ''I could never give it 100 percent because of my husband's world and social life and house,'' she says. ''Once you become involved in public affairs, it is very difficult to work in a lab. You must be totally monochromatic, with your mind on what you're doing and nothing else. And I can't do that anymore. When I'm in the lab, I get terribly impatient. I worry about what goes on outside.'' With AmFAR, she feels that she has found her niche. Here, her interest in science, her political skills and her social connections all come together in service of a cause. ''I came to the conclusion that it's better if I stay on the outside and help people inside the labs,'' she says. ''I'm not such a genius that somebody else cannot do what I was doing. And these would be people who cannot do what I can.''

160-> TV VIEW
'Lincoln'- A Giant Seen As a Man A train arrives in Washington early on a chill February morning. Political turmoil is so heated that Abraham Lincoln, the President-elect, is virtually forced to sneak into the city. Four television hours later, at the end of ''Gore Vidal's Lincoln,'' a train leaves Washington carrying the body of the assassinated leader. Like Mr. Vidal's best-selling book, the TV film - beginning tonight at 9, with the conclusion tomorrow at the same hour - begins in 1861 and spans little more than four years in the history of the United States. But they were extraordinary years, overseen by an extraordinary man. The reverberations are still with us. The odd, often puzzling figure of Lincoln has entered the pantheon of historical giants. For all of its flaws and distortions and a naggingly inadequate performance in the title role, ''Gore Vidal's Lincoln'' offers a convincing and compelling version of his story. Mr. Vidal's novel actually began as a script for an eight-hour mini-series. When the TV project was dropped, Mr. Vidal went into print with a novelized version of his heavily researched project. His ''Lincoln'' is a long book, mixing only a few fictional characters into the larger story, while closely adhering to the ''facts'' as Mr. Vidal interpreted them. A good many historians quickly registered their objections, a tradition that clearly keeps academic adrenalin flowing. Then, a few years ago, Ernest Kinoy, the veteran TV writer (parts of ''Roots,'' more recently ''Stones of Ibarra''), was asked to turn the book back into a TV script. Such are the ironies of toiling in television. Forced to cram a huge historical novel into four hours, Mr. Kinoy falls back on the device of having major developments described hurriedly in casual conversation. In this way, the audience gets a running chronological sense of major events taking place nearby while the TV cameras stay fixed on the principal players. In addition to Lincoln himself and his wife Mary Todd Lincoln, attention is paid to figures such as William Seward (Richard Mulligan), the shrewd politician who initially underestimates the cunning style of the new President; Salmon P. Chase (John McMartin), the abolitionist with his own Presidential ambitions, and his daughter Kate (Deborah Adair), even more determined and conniving than her father; and Elizabeth Keckley (Ruby Dee), the black dressmaker, formerly employed by Jefferson Davis and now the troubled Mrs. Lincoln's confidante and protector. With the Civil War raging, some battles are re-created in ''Gore Vidal's Lincoln,'' but while effective they are relatively modest in scale, relying on tight close-ups instead of a cast of thousands to convey a sense of bloody carnage. In fact, as directed intelligently by Lamont Johnson, this version of the Lincoln story more often than not resembles a chamber opera. Apart from a grand Inaugural Ball scene, the film is played out in small, somewhat enclosed scenes with rarely more than a handful of performers. Accomplished actors have been recruited to flesh out what are sketchy bit parts: John Houseman as Gen. Winfield Scott, Cleavon Little as E. M. Thomas heading a delegation of influential blacks who listen aghast to Lincoln's comments about their people, and James Gammon as General Grant, the military savior of the Union who was considered by many to be a common drunk. And then there is the casting of Sam Waterston and Mary Tyler Moore as Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln. There's a surprise or two here. While the lanky Mr. Waterston would seem ideal for the gaunt, bearded figure of Lincoln, he never quite conveys the ''bulk'' of the man, the sheer presence that never failed to impress those who met him. Mr. Waterston, whose voice retains a boyish ring, too often looks and sounds like a high-school thespian determined to play Lincoln. On the other hand, Ms. Moore, she who is embedded in viewer memories as pert and adorable Mary Richards, constructs a strong and touching Mrs. Lincoln, a proud, disturbed woman whose outbursts of destructive behavior are attributed by Mr. Vidal's Lincoln to bouts of temporary insanity. Knowing how to use a TV camera to best advantage, Ms. Moore goes to the emotional core of the woman for a powerful performance. If Mr. Waterston falls considerably short of devising a memorable Lincoln, particularly in scenes demanding a public display of authority, he remains an accomplished actor who can make the most of other opportunities, most notably in moments dealing with the character's private torment. There are occasional glimpses of Lincoln's curious mystical leanings, his conviction that the preservation of the Union is divinely ordained. ''I'm done for anyway,'' he says after a failed assassination attempt. ''I was chosen to do a certain work - I must do it and then go.'' He treats the increasingly difficult Mrs. Lincoln with unfailing compassion, comforting her after the death of their beloved son Willie, saving her from possible charges of treason. Lincoln's story is already encrusted with myth. Mr. Vidal sought to penetrate that shell with a barrage of humanizing details, recording everything from the great man's chronic constipation to his ''messiah'' complex to his wonderfully wry sense of humor. In an election year and in an era when Presidential candidates seem trapped in processed images, the withdrawn and lonely figure of Lincoln is more intriguing than ever. That, more than anything, is what ''Gore Vidal's Lincoln'' has going for it.

161-> Baseball; Leary's One-Hitter Beats Phils
Tim Leary pitched a one-hitter, allowing only a third-inning single by Darren Daulton, and Mike Scioscia and Jeff Hamilton each hit two-run homers tonight as the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Philadelphia Phillies, 4-0. Leary (4-3) extended his scoreless-inning streak to 18 with his first career one-hitter and third shutout this season. Daulton opened the third with a line single to right field, the only time the Phillies came close to a hit. Leary struck out six and walked two. In his last start, on May 19, he shut out the Expos on seven hits and struck out 10. Scioscia hit his first home run of the season in the fourth after a single by Mike Marshall. In the seventh, John Shelby doubled and Hamilton hit his first home run off David Palmer (0-4). Mike Schmidt of Philadelphia went 0 for 3 and is hitless in his last 18 times at bat. Cardinals 6, Reds 0 ST. LOUIS, May 25 (AP) - Larry McWilliams pitched a two-hitter and Tom Brunansky hit his sixth home run for St. Louis. Cincinnati's only hits were Buddy Bell's leadoff single in the fourth inning and Dave Collins's two-out single in the sixth. McWilliams (3-0) struck out eight and walked six for his first shutout since Aug. 1, 1984, and his first complete game since June 16, 1985. He improved his earned run average to 1.46, second in the National League. The crowd of 40,168 sent the Cardinals' home attendance over the one-million mark at 1,003,465 for 24 home dates. Braves 2, Cubs 1 CHICAGO (AP) - Gerald Perry hit a tie-breaking single with two out in the eighth inning as Atlanta took two out of three games in its first series under Manager Russ Nixon. Rick Mahler (5-4), the fourth of five Atlanta pitchers, won his fifth successive decision despite allowing a game-tying single to Ryne Sandberg in the seventh. Bruce Sutter pitched the ninth inning and earned his sixth save. Expos 6, Padres 2 MONTREAL (AP) - Tom Foley hit two run-scoring doubles and Tim Wallach also drove in two runs, helping Dennis Martinez win his first game in more than a month. Martinez (4-6) gave up eight hits pitching his second complete game. He won for the first time since April 24. Ed Whitson (3-4) allowed five runs on eight hits in five innings. Pirates 4, Astros 3 PITTSBURGH (AP) - Jose Lind singled home the winning run in the seventh after Joaquin Andujar walked two batters with two out. Andujar (0-2), working in relief of Bob Knepper, walked two pinch-hitters, Sid Bream and Barry Bonds. Lind then lined a single into center field. Mike Dunne (3-2) gave up five hits over seven innings and Jeff Robinson pitched two innings for his fifth save. Tigers 4, Brewers 3 DETROIT (AP) - Jeff Robinson and Guillermo Hernandez combined on a one-hitter for Detroit. The Milwaukee hit was a three-run homer by Greg Brock. With the Tigers leading, 4-0, Robinson walked Paul Molitor and B. J. Surhoff to start the Milwaukee sixth. One out later, Brock hit his third homer, a opposite-field liner into the lower deck in left. Robinson struck out Glenn Braggs, then walked Rob Deer before Hernandez took over and earned his second save. Robinson (5-2) walked seven and struck out four in five and two-thirds innings. The Tigers scored three runs in the third off Juan Nieves (4-4). Athletics 8, Orioles 1 OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) - Bob Welch won his seventh consecutive decision and Dave Parker and Dave Henderson hit two-run home runs. Welch (8-2) allowed three singles and no earned runs in eight innings, striking out four and walking one. Twins 4, Royals 2 KANSAS CITY, Mo.

162-> THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Optimistic Survey for Book Industry
Conventional wisdom has it that fewer and fewer Americans are reading for pleasure and that those who do are reading less. Not so, according to a book industry survey. The truth is that the proportion of Americans who read more than one book a month is increasing, and sales of adult hard-cover books, juvenile books and professional books should increase over the next four years, according to an analysis sponsored by the Book Industry Study Group, a New York-based nonprofit corporation. The study, ''Book Industry Trends 1988,'' was compiled by a team of industry experts, analysts at the Center for Book Research and faculty members at the University of Scranton. Sales Growth Projections Over all, book sales should grow through 1992 at about the same modest rate as the economy - about 3.3 percent annually, the report said. If that is not exactly a bullish forecast, some trade book publishers - that is, publishers of general interest books - say it is better than what they might have expected. ''Considering the inroads into our business made by video games and VCR's, it may not be a cause for celebration but it's a comforting message,'' Lawrence Hughes, chairman of the Hearst Trade Book Group, said yesterday. The study is one of the most thorough done on an industry that is notoriously indifferent to statistics and analyses. The study found, among other things, that there are more than 22,500 active publishers (8,000 of which have started within the last five years), almost 12,700 non-college bookstores (more than twice the number in 1972) and more than 50,000 new titles published each year. Last year, publishers' sales reached almost $13 billion. Forecasts by Category For some categories of books, the forecast is decidedly mixed. Sales of mass-market paperbacks, flat for several years, should show ''fundamental improvement,'' the survey said. Yet publishers remain worried. ''Mass-market publishing is no breeze for anybody right now,'' said Mr. Hughes, whose responsibilities include William Morrow & Company and Avon Books, the latter a mass-market publisher. ''Book returns are still bad, it's still very costly to buy books for reprint and there is still a question whether you can sell books at more than $4.95.'' The return rate on mass-market books continues to exceed 40 percent, meaning that for every 10 books shipped to bookstores and distributors, at least four are returned unsold. (In actual practice, only the jackets are returned for credit.) Religious books will probably have a tougher time of it during the next several years, the survey concluded, selling fewer units and with only modest increases in sales dollars. A big reason for the projected fall-off is that the evangelical Christian revival of the 1970's, which created a surge in Christian publishers and Christian booksellers, appears to have subsided. Biggest Share to Trade Books Trade books, which include novels and nonfiction, led the publishing pack in 1987 with $3.5 billion in retail sales, followed by textbooks, at more than $3.3 billion. But the textbook share of industry revenues has been declining, from 30 percent to 26 percent since 1972. On the other hand, the sale of juvenile books could remain strong well into the next century, while the sale of professional books has virtually doubled since 1980. And the dollar volume of adult hard-cover books is expected to double through 1992, while unit sales should rise 45 percent. Bulls and bears alike can find support in the survey results. Heavy readers account for 30 percent of the reading-age population, and 90 percent of general book sales. Many heavy readers come from the baby-boom generation, now ages 25 to 44. Assuming the baby boomers carry their appreciation for books into their 50's and 60's, the report said, ''their support could sustain consumer book sales well into the next century.'' Also, 12.5 percent of the reading-age population buys books three to four times a year, while 7.5 percent buys books only for gifts or in order to read a highly touted best seller. Over all, that means that only half the reading-age population reads and buys books - a statistic, the study says, that calls ''attention to the industry's unfinished agenda and vast remaining opportunities.''

163-> What's Doing In Washington
If anything can distract Washington from its preoccupation with front-runners, public opinion polls and primaries this year, it is the arrival of spring. For with spring the capital once again becomes a gracious Southern city, with garden tours, lunchtime strolls and outdoor festivals. Private homes, gardens and embassies are opened for public tours to benefit charities and churches. Even the White House welcomes visitors to its gardens one April weekend. And for a few days in early April, hundreds of thousands of pale pink cherry blossoms splash delicate color about this city of marble, granite and stone. The best place to see them is at the Potomac River Tidal Basin by the Jefferson Memorial. The projected blooming date is April 7. The National Cherry Blossom Festival, from next Sunday until April 10, is a celebration of the more than 6,000 cherry trees given to the city by Japan in 1912 and 1965. It begins with the lighting of a 300-year-old Japanese lantern near the Jefferson Memorial and continues with concerts, amateur sporting events, a children's treasure hunt at Constitution Gardens on April 6, a black-tie Cherry Blossom Ball and the crowning of a Cherry Blossom Queen and a black-tie ball on April 8. The Cherry Blossom Festival Parade will be held along Constitution Avenue by the Mall from 12:30 to 3 P.M. on April 9. To buy tickets for the ball, to be held at the Hyatt Regency Hotel, call 301-229-1820; for grandstand parade tickets call 202-293-0480. Ball tickets are $65; parade tickets $9.75. A Georgetown Garden Tour (April 16 from 10:30 A.M. to 5 P.M.), will take visitors from the vast grounds of the Dumbarton Oaks estate to hidden nooks of flowers. For information and tickets call 202-333-4953. Tickets are $8.50 until April 6 and $10 after that. A Georgetown House Tour is April 23 and 24, from noon to 5 P.M., with tea and sandwiches served from 2 P.M. to 6 P.M. at St. John's Georgetown Parish Church, the tour's sponsor. Tickets are $12 a day.; call 202-338-1796. All the houses are within walking distance of each other. Embassies, which contain some of the capital's most exquisite interiors, will be on view May 14 in the 42d annual embassy tour. The participants will be the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, Mauritania, Pakistan, Portugal, Yugoslavia, the Commission of the European Community and Britain, which will open its gardens only. The tour costs $25; the embassies will be open from noon to 5 P.M. For information and tickets call 703-938-5749. Children under 10 are not admitted and the taking of photographs is prohibited inside the buildings. The White House West Lawn and Rose Garden will be included in this year's White House Spring Garden Tour from 2 to 5 P.M. on April 16 and 17. No reservations or tickets are required; simply get in line. Tours The White House, the Capitol and the Supreme Court all offer free public tours. Tickets for guided White House tours can be obtained through the offices of your Congressional delegation; for the standard public tours, from 10 A.M. to noon Tuesday through Saturday, gather at the visitors gate on the east side. There can be waits of several hours at this time of year, but anyone who arrives before noon is guaranteed admission. Tours of the Capitol run seven days a week from 9 A.M. to 3:45 P.M., starting in the Rotunda. For a quided tour that takes in the Senate and House chambers, contact your Congressional offices. All sessions of the Supreme Court (April 18 to 20 and 25 to 27) are open to the public. Lectures on the court's workings are held from 9:30 A.M. to 3:30 P.M. on weekdays when the justices are not in session. The monuments are some of the most captivating sights in the city -from the stark, 555-foot tall Washington Monument, to the grand Lincoln Memorial, both on the Mall, to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, at the western edge of Constitution Gardens. The National Archives (Seventh Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W.; 202-523-3000) contain the nation's most cherished documents, including the Constitution and Declaration of Independence. The fanfare over the Bicentennial of the Constitution is over and the long lines to view the documents have shrunk. Two exhibits marking the Constitution's birthday remain: ''The American Experiment: Living with the Constitution'' runs until Sept. 30, and ''The American Experiment: Creating the Constitution'' until February 1989. Open seven days a week; 10 A.M. to 5:30 P.M. until April 1; 10 A.M. to 9 P.M. from April 2 to Labor Day. Two new museums have joined the ranks of the Smithsonian Institution, a repository of treasures as diverse as a stuffed Fenkovi African bush elephant and Archie Bunker's living-room chair. They are the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery (1050 Independence Avenue, S.W.; 202-357-4880), which houses Asian and Near Eastern art, and the National Museum of African Art (950 Independence Avenue, S.W.; 202-357-4600). All Smithsonian museums are free and open seven days a week. Night Life The capital is becoming an increasingly vibrant cultural center and a good place to have fun. Georgetown is still fashionable, but it tends to draw mostly college-age crowds these days. Dupont Circle and downtown along 19th Street is lined with restaurants, bars and clubs. Kramer Books & Afterwards Cafe (1517 Connecticut Avenue, N.W., 202-387-1462), a bookstore and cafe, is a pleasant place for lingering into the night over coffee or cocktails. Open 24 hours Fridays and Saturdays, from 7:30 A.M. until 1 A.M. the rest of the week. Local bands play Friday and Saturday nights. John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts is a vibrant cultural center with five theaters, including the American Film Institute theater. Five special performances of ''Nixon in China,'' a new opera based on President Richard M. Nixon's visit to China in 1972, will be given March 26, 28, 30, April 1 and April 3. Tickets range from $22.50 to $50. For information on other performances call 202-254-3600; for tickets call 202-857-0900. Before the show take the elevator to the roof and look out at the sweep of the capital and the Potomac River. The Arena Stage (Sixth Street and Main Avenue, S.W., 202-554-9066), widely regarded as one of the finest regional theater companies in the country, is presenting ''Checkmates,'' as part of ''Stage Four,'' a series of new works by American playwrights, through April 3. ''Cocoanuts,'' a Marx Brothers comedy, runs April 15 to June 5. Chekhov's ''The Cherry Orchard'' opens May 6. Tickets range from $10 to $24.75; Saturday matinees from $14.75 to $18.75. Ford's Theater (511 10th Street, N.W.; 202-347-4833) has been restored to the way it looked the night President Lincoln was shot there. ''Elmer Gantry,'' a musical based on the novel by Sinclair Lewis, is being performed until May 8. Tours of the theater are given in the day. Tucked behind 1073 Wisconsin Avenue, N.W., in Georgetown is Blues Alley (202-337-4141), a small jazz club. Cover charges range from $10 to $25; reservations are required. Children The National Zoo (3001 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.; 202-673-4821) and the planes and spaceships at the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museum on the Mall are constant favorites. Ling-Ling and Shing-Shing, two pandas given to the United States by China more than a decade ago, are the main draw at the zoo, which is free. Grounds are open daily from 8 A.M. to 6 P.M.; animal houses are open from 9 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. The Capitol Children's Museum on Capitol Hill (800 Third Street, N.E.; 202-543-8600) is a quintessential hands-on museum, where youngsters can build a machine, ''shop'' at a grocery store and even ''drive'' a bus. Open 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. daily. Admission is $4. The Washington Dolls' House and Toy Museum on the outskirts of the city (5236 44th Street, N.W.; 202-244-0024) is filled with elaborate miniature houses, shops, schools and churches, Victorian dolls and other antique toys and games. Closed Monday. Admission: $2, $1 for children under 14. At the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (14th and C Streets, S.W.; tour information 202-447-1391) visitors can watch currency being printed. Open weekdays 9 A.M. to 2 P.M. The tour takes 20 minutes; no reservations are required. Restaurants Restaurants seem almost as prevalent as bureaucrats. There is elegant dining, exotic feasting and everything in between. Jean-Louis at Watergate (2650 Virginia Avenue, N.W.; 202-298-4488) has a chef, Jean-Louis Palladin, who came here in 1979 from a two-star Michelin restaurant in France. Four-course fixed-price dinners are $70, five-course dinners $85 and a pretheater dinner of three courses is $35. Reservations required. Restaurant Nora (2132 Florida Avenue, N.W.; 202-462-5143) specializes in organically raised meat and poultry and home-made pasta. Dinner for two with wine is about $70. Credit cards are not accepted, but personal checks are. In the heart of Georgtown, Au Pied de Cochon (1335 Wisconsin Avenue, N.W.; 202-333-5440) is reminiscent of a Parisian bistro, with brass railings, a dark wooden bar and 24-hour service. The specialties include roast duck, coq au vin and boeuf Burgundy. Dinner for two with wine is about $30. Hotels The beaux arts Willard Inter-Continental (1401 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.; 202-628-9100 or 800-327-0200), was restored and reopened a year and a half ago. It is near shops, theaters, Government buildings and the White House. Double rooms range from $210 to $285 a night. One of the most stunning views in Washington can be admired from the Hay Adams Hotel (16th and H Streets, N.W., 202-638-2260 or 800-424-5054). A room for two people overlooking the White House and the monuments is $280 a night. Less select chambers are as low as $195 a night; suites run from $395 to $1,300. For less expensive accommodations, the Howard Johnson's Motor Lodge (2601 Virginia Avenue, N.W.; 202-965-2700 or 800-654-2000), near the Kennedy Center and across the street from the Watergate complex, has double rooms for $82 a night. Lodging in the Maryland and Virginia suburbs is cheaper and almost as convenient since many of the hotels outside the District of Columbia borders are near stations for the Metro, Washington's subway line. Metro tickets range from 80 cents to $2.40, depending on the length of the journey. The Ramada Inn in Bethesda (8400 Wisconsin Avenue; 301-654-1000 or 800-331-5252), two blocks from the Medical Center Metro stop, charges $49 a night for double rooms on weekends, between $78 and and $98 on weeknights.

164-> U.S. Opposes Agency Funds
The Reagan Administration said today that it would oppose new financing for the Inter-American Development Bank until the bank agreed to changes in its lending procedures. The American position, detailed in a brief statement by Allen Wallis, the Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, as he arrived here for the bank's annual meeting, dashed hopes that the two-year-old dispute between the United States and the Latin-debtor nations would be quickly resolved. But in recent statements, top United States officials have appeared to hold out an olive branch, saying that they favored giving the bank's President-elect, Enrique Iglesias, the Uruguayan Finance Minister, an opportunity to discuss the issues with the Latin countries and then to arrange new talks. Increased Third-World Concern The meeting, to be attended by economic leaders from Latin America, Asia, the United States and Europe, comes when Washington is increasingly preoccupied with economic and political issues in Latin America. The bank has been a major source of economic assistance for Latin American countries for more than 25 years. The Latin countries had hoped that an agreement for a $23 billion refunding of the bank could be completed soon, allowing it to take a greater role in helping to develop the region. The countries had agreed that the bank should use some of the money for economic reform, rather than spend all of it to develop roads, sewers and dams. But the United States has sought procedures to give Washington more say over the loans, including to which countries the loans would go and under what conditions. Market-Oriented Emphasis The Reagan Administration wants to see the debtor countries take more steps to make their economies more market-oriented. The meeting of the bank's 44-member countries brings together more than 2,000 officials from governments, commercial banks, investment firms and other international financial institutions. The formal meetings begin on Monday and end on Wednesday. At a meeting on Saturday, Michael E. Curtin, the bank's No. 2 officer, said he was prepared to resign to make room for James W. Conrow, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of the United States Treasury who was expected to be nominated by Mr. Iglesias in early April. Mr. Curtin is also a Treasury official. Historically, the United States chooses the executive vice president, while the president is chosen by the Latin countries.

165-> Water Leak at Atom Plant
About 8,400 gallons of slightly radioactive water leaked into the Hudson River from the Indian Point 2 nuclear power plant, the plant's operator said today. The water was discovered missing from a 345,000-gallon storage tank outside the containment structure, said a spokeswoman for Con Edison, Bea Meltzer. The problem was discovered this morning at the plant, 25 miles north of New York City, but officials were unsure how long the water had been leaking. A spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Carl Abraham, said the leak posed no health hazard.

166-> N.H.L. PLAYOFFS; Bruins Even Series With Canadiens
Rejean Lemelin, the Boston goaltender who started tonight after complaining about being benched for the first game of the series, made 27 saves to lead the Bruins to a 4-3 victory over the Montreal Canadiens. The four-of-seven-game series in the Adams Division final is tied at 1-1. The Canadiens, who outshot the Bruins, 30-14, also lost Stephane Richer, the team's top goal scorer, for the remainder of the playoffs. The right wing suffered a broken right thumb in the first period when he was slashed by Michael Thelven, a Boston defenseman, as he was breaking in on the Boston goal. Richer suffered a reinjury to the thumb that caused him to miss five of the last seven regular-season games. The thumb has also bothered Richer during the playoffs. Richer, who had 50 regular-season goals, scored seven goals in seven playoff games. 'Head-Hunting' Charged ''The Bruins played the style they're known to play - head-hunting and cheap shots,'' said a visibly upset Jean Perron, the Montreal coach. The source of Perron's anger was the play on which Richer was hurt. Thelven denied that he had deliberately slashed Richer. ''I was only trying to lift his stick,'' Thelven said. The Bruins, who won at the Forum for the first time since Dec. 13, 1986, return home for the next two games on Friday and Sunday night. Boston's Bob Sweeney and Ray Bourque broke a scoreless tie in the second period, and Moe Lemay's slapshot from just inside the Montreal blue line at 1 minute 32 seconds of the third period gave the Bruins a 3-0 lead. Mike McPhee scored for Montreal when he converted a rebound at 9:01. Boston's Cam Neely scored 44 seconds later to make the score 4-1. But John Kordic wristed a shot past Lemelin at 12:56 to narrow the margin to 4-2. Then Larry Robinson of Montreal created a frantic finish by nudging a rebound into the net with 1:53 to play. Ryan Walter of Montreal, on a partial breakaway, hit the goal post with a slap shot with 35 seconds to play. Richer joined an injured list that included Bob Gainey, left wing, Shayne Corson, center, and Mats Naslund, left wing.

167-> Hewlett Net Rises by 25%
Buoyed by strong sales of its new products, the Hewlett-Packard Company reported today that earnings were up 25 percent in the quarter ended April 30. Net income was $202 million, or 82 cents a share, compared with $162 million, or 63 cents a share, in the comparable period a year earlier. Revenues rose 24 percent, to $2.50 billion, from $2.02 billion in the second fiscal quarter of 1987. Although earnings and revenues were in line with analysts' expectations, the company's stock plunged $5.375, to $57, because profit margins were considered disappointing and the United States orders, which rose 11 percent in the quarter, were below expectations. International orders climbed 29 percent, to $1.35 billion. The company said nine new computers in its Spectrum series introduced in April came too late in the quarter to have significant impact on orders. Separately, the Wiltron Company, based in Morgan Hill, Calif., filed suit against Hewlett-Packard today, charging violations of antitrust laws, unfair marketing practices and contract interference. Wiltron, which makes microwave test equipment used in the telecommunications and defense industries, charged that Hewlett-Packard maintains a monopoly in the $110 million market for vector network analyzers and has engaged in illegal business practices to maintain it.

169-> BUSH LASHES BACK ON ISSUE OF ETHICS
Frustrated by the Democrats' efforts to tar him with the ethical problems of the Reagan Administration, Vice President Bush tried to make the issue boomerang on them today. Mr. Bush, who had come here to address a group at a retirement village, called for an independent prosecutor to investigate House Speaker Jim Wright for possible conflicts of interest. Last week, Common Cause, a public interest watchdog group, called on the House Ethics Committee to examine the financial arrangements involving the publication of a book by Mr. Wright and reports that the Speaker had tried to get special treatment for Texas bankers. In a financial disclosure report today, Mr. Wright said he had received no profit in 1987. ''We're going to go after the Congress hard,'' Mr. Bush said, raising the point in an interview here with local reporters who had asked about Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d, the subject of an inquiry by an special Federal prosecutor, officially designated an independent counsel. Issue on Speaker Raised ''Talk about ethics,'' Mr. Bush continued. ''You talk about Ed Meese. How about talking about what Common Cause raised about the Speaker the other day? Are they going to look into it? Are they going to go for an independent counsel so the nation will have this full investigation? Why don't people call out for that? I will right now. I think they ought to.'' Two weeks ago, two of Mr. Bush's advisers publicly described Mr. Meese as ''a liability'' to the campaign, since it is hard for the Vice President to stress his campaign theme of high ethical standards while the Attorney General * *glis still in office. But today, rather than trying to distance himself from the Administration, the Vice President went on the attack against the Democrats and Congress. ''There are 12 members up there who, to one degree or another, have had difficulty in the past few years and I don't remember an independent counsel for one of them,'' he said. ''Where's the level playing field?'' Earlier in the day, at the commencement ceremony at the Untied Stqtes Military Academy, Mr. Bush took an indirect swipe at his Democratic rivals for the Presidency on the issue of national security. He attacked ''the liberal elite'' who ''do not understand that reducing our defense will erode our security.'' Hopes to Hurt Dukakis One of the key Presidential campaign issues that his advisers hope will hurt Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts is the Democrat's distaste for some nuclear weapons systems and his lack of experience in foreign policy. ''This is no time for the ivory tower; this is not time for innocents abroad,'' he told his audience at West Point, N.Y. As rain poured down on the cadets and their families, Mr. Bush used implicit language because Pentagon regulations forbid the use of military facilities for political activity. The Vice President did not mention the word Democrats or name his Democratic opponents, Mr. Dukakis and the Rev. Jesse Jackson. But his targets were clear. ''The liberal elite do not understand,'' he said. ''I do not think they mean to do harm. I think they simply don't understand that reducing our defense will erode our security. Maybe they don't understand that simply pulling back on our global responsibilities, without thinking it through and preparing the ground, will make the world more dangeous.'' ''I'm sure they would claim it isn't so and they're all in favor of a strong defense,'' he continued. ''But what are we to think, when they say they're for a strong defense but they oppose every new weapons system that would preserve our strength? Against a space shield, against the MX, against the 600-ship Navy, against Midgetman, B-1, Stealth, against any increase whatsoever in the defense of the United States.'' ''Why don't we also look at standards for Congress?'' he asked. ''Why does Congress exempt itself from ethical standards?'' Bush Urged to Get Tough Mr. Bush, who has been lagging behind Mr. Dukakis in recent polls, has been urged by advisers to get tougher on the Democrats in general and the Massachusetts Governor in particular. Mr. Bush's remarks today on Mr. Wright and on ''the liberal elite'' were part of an effort to get the Vice President off the defensive on such issues as Mr. Meese's tenure and to find ways of tarnishing Mr. Dukakis's public image, which the polls show to be highly favorable. Asked by journalists about his reported attempts to distance himself from the Administration's dealings with Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the Panamanian leader, the Vice President said that ''these reports that I've had differences with the Administration'' were ''accurate.'' He stressed in several interviews during the day that he dislike characterizing it as distancing from the Administration.

170-> Reaching for the Stars In Luxury Fur Design
WHITE mink cascades down to the floor. A chinchilla coat in pure white is fit for a bride. A fox jacket dyed green, blue or wine slips over a sheared mink coat dyed exactly the same shade for a double helping of fur. A soft cloud of Russian lynx draws appreciative oh's and ah's from sophisticated retailers as they try to guess how much the long coat would cost. (The answer: $300,000) These are some of the high spots of the second round of fall fashion openings in the fur market. The openings last week included the first fur collection in a decade by Arnold Scaasi, the New York designer of made-to-order clothes; a tour de force by James Galanos, who makes expensive ready-to-wear, and the epitome of high-fashion shapes by Karl Lagerfeld for Revillon. To round out the picture, there were two European collections designed by Elena Benarroch of Madrid for her shop at 31 East 64th Street and by Andre and Lisa Bisang, a husband-and-wife team from Zurich, for the Tepper Collection on Seventh Avenue, plus a special collection made by Jerry Sorbaya to be sold exclusively in the 22 Neiman-Marcus stores. Together, the showings provided a powerhouse of fashion news, involving new colors and shapes as well as innovations in technology. Among them: improvements in the skin-on-skin method of working furs, especially mink, to produce a flat effect in which pelts are joined together like tiles, and the shearing of mink and muskrat. The resulting surface is smooth and velvetlike, not fluffy. No neophyte in the fur field, Mr. Lagerfeld catapulted Fendi, the Rome-based fashion house, into a world-class company during the last 20 years. Then he added his expertise to Revillon. His second collection for the Paris-based company, shown at the Plaza hotel, was breathtaking. Because he refuses to be intimidated by the grandeur - or the expense - of fur, Mr. Lagerfeld is free to create new silhouettes as inventive as the coat with a smoothly fitted bodice of mole atop a fluffy skirt of Mongolian lamb. It is a re-creation in fur of the pouf or bubble skirt in evening dresses. This is the kind of coat that would appeal to a woman searching for excitement in fur design and not looking for a basic mink coat. His major accomplishment is keying many of his furs to the long, slender skirts he has been endorsing as an alternative to short skirts. Long cutaway fur jackets that closely follow the lines of the body and leather jackets lined or trimmed with Persian lamb are beautifully proportioned with below-calf skirts. Asymmetric capes, scalloped hemlines and Mongolian lamb coats divided into black and white halves are arresting. The fur buttons Arnold Scaasi uses throughout his collection for Maximilian are an indication of his couture touch. A hot-pink satin coat reversing to mink is a typical Scaasi extravaganza. His evening furs are spectacular, including a double-ruffle shawl in black or white broadtail, and floor-length white mink coats. His major contributions to the daytime fur scene are the high-waisted mink coats with, of course, mink buttons on the top. It was an impressive debut. James Galanos is as at home with expensive furs as he is with expensive fabrics. His collection for Yarmuth Dion includes horizontally worked chinchilla, fisher reversing to embossed leather and broadtail lined with sable as well as the well-received Russian lynx coat. There is a look of quality about all the styles. Jerry Sorbara's lively fur collection includes bubble-shaped coats, fur suits and beaver stenciled with leopard markings. There are mink coats colored royal blue, hunter green and yellow, among others. The white chinchilla coat with puffed sleeves was shown with a bridal veil. Elena Benarroch showed mink coats worked the skin-on-skin way with matching fox jackets that slipped over them in colors like beige, wine and green. Sleeveless broadtail vests over nutria coats stenciled in a calligraphy pattern illustrated the designer's double dosages of furs. Persian lamb dyed in a tweedy pattern was one of the contributions of the Bisangs, the Swiss designers. They also showed fur-lined cashmere coats for men and women. A green alpaca men's style lined with sheared nutria was the best of this series.

172-> Mitteleuropa Revisited
To the Editor: As a former Central European, I was impressed by Henry Kamm's article ''Hearts and Minds Still Yearn for the Glories of Old Mitteleuropa, Wherever It Is'' [ July 17 ] . His conclusion that being Central European is an idea more than a geographical coincidence is certainly true, but I would go further. Central Europeanism is a culture that was brought about by Maria Theresa, who introduced school reform in the Hapsburg Empire. During her reign it was decreed that all schools in the empire would have the same curriculum, which would be taught at the same sequence. Consequently, everybody who finished 12 years of schooling possessed the same intellectual armor and an identical world view, in short, the same culture. This gave an enormous feeling of community to these individuals. And what a superb, well-rounded education they got! VERA FREEMAN New York, N.Y.

173-> Corporate Logos Spruce Themselves Up
To the Editor: I wonder how critics of changing corporate logotypes (''Company Logos, Signifying Nothing,'' editorial July 20) would react if they were to change places with the corporation or brand they wish to protect from change. How would they like to be 90 years old, dressed in the same clothes they've worn for all those years, competing with some bright new guy in town for the attentions of the modern-day customers? Don't they deserve a new suit after 90 years? And how about a new hat? They'd want to look as if they belonged in the 1990's, without losing the loyalty of their old customers or the associations with the qualities that make them what they are. This is the challenge we identity specialists face in wrestling with the personas of companies and products. A company whose literal symbol no longer represents what it is or does should focus on its name. A new visual representation of this most valuable asset will serve a company better than creating another abstract symbol. DAVID R. BUTLER, JOHN LISTER New York, July 21, 1988

174-> Waterston Brings Real Life to Life
WITH his appearances in the title role of ''Gore Vidal's Lincoln'' tonight and tomorrow night on NBC-TV and his current performance as an arms negotiator - a character loosely based on the American career diplomat Paul H. Nitze - in the play ''A Walk in the Woods'' on Broadway, Sam Waterston is adding two more characters to his ever-growing gallery of nonfictional heroes. The actor's eventful career spans more than 25 years of classical and contemporary roles, on screen, stage and television, starting with summer stock at the Clinton Playhouse, where he was seen in plays by Beckett, O'Neill and Kaufman and Hart, after he graduated from Yale University in 1962. For all his proven range, Mr. Waterston's most acclaimed recent performances have been emulations of life. Among his portrayals of actual figures were his roles in ''Oppenheimer,'' a seven-part BBC series seen here in 1982, in which he played J. Robert Oppenheimer, the so-called father of the atom bomb, and as the journalist Sydney Schanberg in the 1984 film ''The Killing Fields.'' Mr. Waterston has also made a specialty of playing characters embroiled in controversial, contemporary issues: a prosecuting attorney in the 1987 television drama ''Terrorist on Trial: the United States vs. Salim Ajami,'' and an architect involved in the morality of urban development in the play ''Benefactors,'' seen on Broadway in 1985. Mention the reality connection of such characters to Mr. Waterston, who has been living in Litchfield County full-time for more than 10 years, and he replies that all the people he plays have been real, be they Hamlet or Torvald Helmer in ''A Doll's House'' - both in 1985. Indeed, many of Mr. Waterston's classical performances, especially his romantic and comic Benedick in the New York Shakespeare Festival production of ''Much Ado About Nothing'' in 1972, have been noted for their individuality and accessibility. Actually, Mr. Waterston, who was born in Cambridge, Mass., in 1940, began acting when he was 7, in school productions directed by his father, a former schoolmaster who dabbled in amateur theatrics in Groton, Mass. His parents, now retired, live in Rhode Island. Mr. Waterston is married to Lynn Woodruff, a former model. They have four children. Even though he did not attend the Yale Drama School - French and history were his majors - Mr. Waterston joined the university's dramatic society straight away and kept on acting. ''I didn't get the romantic leads, so I played the bent, wizened characters,'' he recalled. During his junior year, which was spent at the University of Paris, he took classes at the American Actors Workshop under the tutelage of an expatriate American director, John Barry - and his calling was confirmed. After graduation, Mr. Waterston went to New York and landed that first Broadway part, as the replacement for Austin Pendleton in the role of the overprotected, astigmatic, perpetual child in the macabre comedy by Arthur Kopit, ''Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mama's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Sad.'' A slew of Off Broadway and Broadway credits followed. ''But Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival was the cornerstone of my acting career,'' he said. ''I never went on the regional theater track. Instead, my connection to the festival was right there and I didn't have to go out of town.'' The connection began in 1963 when Mr. Waterston played the shepherd Silvius in ''As You Like It.'' And although in the New York Times review of a flop 1970 Off Broadway play in which Mr. Waterston had the role of a guru he was pronounced by Mel Gussow as ''one of the busiest and also one of the best actors in New York,'' the precariousness of a theater career led him to return to New Haven to investigate getting a degree in architecture - until Joseph Papp called upon him once more. His Shakespearean roles include Prince Hal in ''Henry IV,'' Cloten in ''Cymbeline'' and Prospero in ''The Tempest.'' In 1972, he was Laertes to Stacy Keach's Hamlet; in 1975, John Lithgow played Laertes to Mr. Waterston's Hamlet. By far his most successful foray into Shakespeare was Benedick in the ''Much Ado'' production that moved to Broadway and was televised. As for the commitment to political or current events that seems to rule his choice of roles, Mr. Waterston, who once remarked that acting was a ''gigantic social service in itself,'' said simply, ''I'm lucky to work enough and get the things I wish for; it's serendipity.'' Witness ''A Walk in the Woods.'' ''The idea of a two-character play about arms control, set in a hillside in Geneva, would have been unthinkable, but here it is,'' he said. The play, by Lee Blessing, has its roots in Connecticut, where it was first seen as a staged reading at the 1986 National Playwrights Conference of the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center and had its premier full production just a year ago at the Yale Repertory Theater, which has co-produced the Broadway version with Lucille Lortel and American Playhouse Theater Productions. It co-stars Robert Prosky as the Soviet delegate, Andrey Botvinnik -modeled upon the real-life Yuli A. Kvitsinsky. The Soviet and the American, here called John Honeyman, go on four walks - one each season -and establish human contact, even though they are temperamentally as well as ideologically at odds. About the play and the idealistic, passionate character he portrays, Mr. Waterston said: ''The road to theater hell is paved with high-minded plays that aren't brought off, but this one touches on the emotional part of a serious theme. My attitude toward my character is colored by playing him; his anger is my anger. I accept his point of view: 'Idealism is a necessity; it is no longer a choice,' he says. He proves that you don't have to be a cynic to be intelligent; the other character is also smart -and he thinks he's a cynic - and both men like each other.'' About playing Lincoln, Mr. Waterston who is 6 feet 1 inch tall, added: ''It's high time a man of my size and shape - and with a nose of this dimension - got a shot at it.''

175-> It Takes Two For a Rivalry
To the Sports Editor: After witnessing Steffi Graf's superb performance throughout the Wimbledon championships, it should be obvious that women's tennis has reached a new plateau. All credit must be given to Graf and her coaches for the hard work that has produced such success and rapid development. However, as a longtime fan and admirer of Martina Navratilova, I refuse to sit by idly while the press and large segments of an unappreciative public attempt to discredit her through petty personal attacks or by downplaying her historic achievements. What is the source of this hostility? Is it part of our peculiar American pastime of tearing down our greatest champions? Does it stem from a misplaced resentment by a small fraction of Chris Evert fans? Surely, they must realize that it takes two to create and sustain the greatest of rivalries. Or does the animosity stem from a basic misperception of Navratilova herself? She is not a 7-foot-4, two-headed monster incapable of thought or feeling. Rather, she is an individualist, an artist and a perfectionist who has raised the women's game to new heights. It is nothing short of ironic, then, that she is now beginning to be sorely tested by those who have studied and emulated both her style of play and her training methods. STEPHEN MCKAY Chatham, N.J.

To the Editor: MacDonald Harris, in his review of ''Subject to Change'' by Lois Gould (July 10), writes: ''This is an erudite book; its author knows about Henry IV of France and his mistresses. . . .'' Perhaps. But the story Lois Gould plays with is that of Henry II of the house of Valois, husband of Catherine de' Medici and long-term sweetheart of Diane de Poitiers. Henry IV, first Bourbon king of France, had a queen named Margaret and is remembered more for his politics than his love life. JOANNE SELTZER Schenectady, N.Y.

177-> Battery Park City
To the Editor: In your article on June 19 headed ''Battery Park City: A New Phase Begins'' it was stated that Governor Cuomo ''was uneasy that the State of New York was building market-rate housing and top-of-the-line commercial buildings.'' The Governor and Meyer S. Frucher, president of the Battery Park City Authority, have good grounds to be uneasy about the social logic of the Lower Manhattan complex. As one who participated to some degree in the shaping of the policies and programs of Battery Park City since 1970, I am part and parcel of the problems, disappointments and, at times, successes of the project. When originally conceived, the development was to be one-third luxury, one-third middle-income and one-third low-income housing. It subsequently was changed to 50 percent luxury, 40 percent moderate income and 10 percent low income. During the financial crisis, it was again changed to the current concept of building the entire development of 14,000 units at market rate with no middle-, moderate- or low-income units, except for two buildings that would set aside 20 percent of their units for moderate-income tenants. Effectively, that means no poor, few elderly and fewer children. Some urban observers say that there is no law that says poor or moderate income people must live on the waterfront or in choice areas of the city. That being true, why did the government of the 1970's agree that the original one-third, one-third, one-third was a good idea? The concept came about primarily because the government created, paid for and built the land, and all the peoples' taxes were involved. In looking about the city we also felt that the best neighborhoods (including the West Side upon which Battery Park City is physically modeled) had a mix of social and economic classes. Urban planners in this city and in many other cities elsewhere in the country frown on ghettos of the very poor and the very rich, especially when government action or taxes are used to enhance or promote the project. What generally works best for us as a city - because we are so diverse - is the economic and social integration which will help knit the fabric of the city together. Of course, there is no guarantee that merely because we wish for social and economic integration to work, that it will. But, if we look at the urban-renewal area of the Upper West Side, the Village, SoHo, NoHo, TriBeca, Sunnyside Gardens and to some degree Roosevelt Island as it is currently built, and other areas, I am convinced that it works and does so in a very important way for the city. Making 30 acres of park on the 92-acre landfill is not only commendable, it is brilliant and deserves high praise. But the parks, unfortunately, do not address the lack of social logic and the lack of soul of Battery Park City.

A design error will force workers to take down and rebuild the center section of a partly completed $16 million bridge near downtown Minneapolis. The mistake will cost up to $200,000, take three to four weeks to correct and force an overnight shutting of Interstate highway ramps. Al Pint of the Minnesota Department of Transportation said the state's design consultant inadvertently included a rise in camber in a 30-foot section of the bridge, which is more than a half-mile long.

181-> U.S. May Back Private Venture For Space Base
A senior White House policy group has agreed in principle that the Government should back a private plan for construction of a small, inexpensive space station that would fly into orbit years ahead of NASA's multibillion-dollar space outpost, Federal officials said yesterday. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which views the proposal as a serious threat to its space station plans, denied that an agreement had been reached. A spokesman for the head of the senior policy group refused to comment. But a Federal official familiar with the meeting said, ''We've been running the space program with one hand, the private sector, tied behind our back. Now that's going to change.'' Use in 1991 Is Foreseen The reported action came in the form of a proposed recommendation to President Reagan that the Goverment use Federal funds to lease part of the small space station, which could be orbiting the Earth as soon as 1991, whereas the NASA station would be ready by 1997 at the earliest. Private companies could also use it for a variety of industrial purposes. The commercial venture, headed by Space Industries Inc. of Houston, would advance the Administration's goal of promoting the nation's fledgling space industry in the face of increasing international competition. A Federal move to support the small proposed station would guarantee a major customer, greatly increasing the chances of the the plan's realization. Experts in and outside Government said such a leasing arrangement, if acted upon by the Administration and viewed favorably by Congress, might mark the end of the beleaguered NASA space station and would undoubtedly be a turning point in the history of the nation's space program, with commercial initiatives playing an increasing role. Government participation is considered crucial. Industry has expressed great interest in having facilities for experiments and manufacturing best performed in the weightlessness of space. But few companies have been willing to invest in an exclusively private project that might never be given the necessary priority for launching by the space shuttle. The proposal has been vigorously fought by NASA, which fears that the private facility would undermine political and financial support for its more costly and ambitious station goal. Final Decision Denied Shirley M. Green, head of public affairs for NASA, yesterday denied that a final decision that would result in a recommendation to the President had been reached by the senior group, the White House Economic Policy Council. The NASA Administrator, James C. Fletcher, is a member of the council, which is headed by Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d. A spokesman for Mr. Baker declined comment. The proposal for a small station has already won some support from Congress, which before Christmas directed NASA to spend $25 million to explore leasing the facility. In addition, the Commerce Department has vigorously promoted the leasing idea within the White House. The proposed small space station is designated the Industrial Space Facility. Costing up to $700 million, its components could be launched as early as 1991 by one or two flights of the space shuttle and would be relatively easy to deploy. The facility, powered by a 200-foot-long array of solar panels connected to a cylindrical module up to 46 feet long, would be visited periodically by astronauts from the space shuttle. The astronauts, working in its interior, would get their air, food and water from the attached shuttle. The facility itself would have no life-support system. In essence, it would be an automated, orbiting laboratory and factory that got occasional maintenance by visiting astronauts. Use as Science Laboratory Limited though it may be, the facility might be used for many of the tasks of the big station, especially as additional modules are added. In its most rudimentary form it would be a science laboratory to investigate new materials, grow crystals, make drugs, and tinker with new kinds of electronic circuits. In contrast, NASA's station would be the nation's first permanently manned outpost in space, with accommodations for a crew of eight. It would be a hotel, factory, observatory, research center, service station, and launching pad for missions to other planets. When first proposed in 1984, the NASA station was to cost $8 billion and be orbiting by 1992. The space agency now estimates that a scaled-down version measuring 445 feet long would cost $14.6 billion, although other experts put the bill at about $26 billion. These cost estimates do not include the 20 or so shuttle flights needed to boost it into space. At best, the scaled-down NASA station would be completed by 1997, although new delays are likely since Congress recently cut the station's proposed budget for this fiscal year by more than 40 percent, to $425 million. Details to Be Worked Out Federal officials said yesterday that although a decision to back the small station had been reached at a meeting of the Economic Policy Council on Thursday, critical details, such as what fraction of it would be leased by the Government, remained to be worked out. ''There is a commitment,'' said one official. ''The numbers are to be negotiated.'' Aviation Week & Space Technology, a trade magazine, also reports in its forthcoming issue that a firm decision has been reached by the White House council to go ahead with the small-station leasing idea. Dr. Peter E. Glaser, vice president of Arthur D. Little Inc., a Cambridge, Mass., a consulting concern that works on aerospace issues, remarked: ''Clearly, a Government lease is key to getting industry interested in this kind of thing. And the facility is good at what it does. On the other hand, if it's a success, Congress may ask whether it should influence our plans for the NASA station. To me, the small facility is not enough to demonstrate U.S. commitment to leadership in space.'' Some Congressmen, disappointed with the space agency's recovery from the Challenger disaster and eager to cut the Federal Government's budget deficit, have already said they would scrap the big station in favor of the small one. Complementary Role Seen But the industrial promoters of the small facility say it complements rather than replaces the NASA vision. ''It's not as exotic or versatile,'' said Dr. Joseph P. Allen, executive vice president of Space Industries Inc., who is a former astronaut. ''We're basically a mobile home with no plumbing. But we do have electricity and people can go in from time to time to do all kinds of experiments.'' The small proposed facility is the major project of Space Industries Inc., whose president is Dr. Maxime A. Faget, formerly a top NASA designer for the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and space shuttle programs. So far the company has signed up no industrial customers for the facility, although it says a stampede would start if the Government leased some capacity. NASA might use it as a test bed for its larger station, and the Defense Department might use it for experiments to develop circuits and sensors for military satellites, among other uses. Commerce Department officials see the small facility as a way to spur the nation's private space industry and meet rising international competition from Russia as well as Europe and Japan. ''The United States is third or fourth and slipping fast in the pursuit of advanced space materials research,'' said Gregg R. Fawkes, director of the department's Office of Commercial Space Programs. He noted that the Europeans plan to loft Eureca, a small, ''man-tended'' space station in 1991, that is similar in many respects to the Industrial Space Facility. While praising the private station, Mr. Fawkes refused comment on the outcome of the White House meeting. In recent days, the space agency has vigorously fought the leasing idea in the White House and Congress. On Wednesday, NASA's Administrator, Mr. Fletcher, wrote the House Appropriations Committee to say the space agency's proposed leasing of the small station had ''serious policy, legal, schedule and budgetary difficulties,'' adding that NASA ''does not now have identified needs that would justify a major commitment.''

182-> DINING OUT; WHERE TO RING IN YEAR OF DRAGON
PACK up winter worries. The season's woes melt away for one brief week in February. Lovers are celebrating today with flowers and candy; shoppers are reving up for Presidents' Day sales; travelers are heading to New Orleans for Mardi Gras, and serious eaters are in training for Chinese New Year feasts. Long Islanders need not fight the frenzy of Chinatown to welcome the Year of the Dragon. What better way to do so than at a local Asian restaurant? There aren't many better on Long Island than Homer's Oriental in Cedarhurst. This two-and-a-half-year-old South Shore beauty predates Homer Lee's Syosset restaurant of the same name. They are similar in concept and menu: one-third Japanese fare, two-thirds Chinese with a smattering of Thai dishes. This formula makes for exciting Oriental eating. Homer's Japanese chef in Cedarhurst has, however, told the restaurant's management, ''Never on Monday.'' He's off, and no Japanese food is served then. Homer's Oriental in Cedarhurst is the most attractive of Mr. Lee's eight restaurants. The multitiered dining room is dramatized by a soaring 50-foot ceiling punctuated with skylights. An abstract floor-to-ceiling mural dominates. The mode is modern: a towering classic column crowned with flowers, Art Deco light fixtures, pale wood banisters and a dazzling display of trees and flowers. The food is as exciting as the look. Tokyo, Bangkok and Peking all contribute winning dishes. The only soup not worth ordering is the rather bland asparagus with hair moss vegetable. The house special soup, full of seafood and mushrooms, was more popular. It shares top soup honors with the minced beef with vegetables. Hot and sour soup lovers will note similarities. Minced beef adds a few extra vegetables and eliminates the vinegar. A Japanese import, beef negimaki, led the parade of favorite appetizers. Thinly sliced steak was rolled around scallions, broiled and glossed with a tantalizing sauce. Some Chinese standards received exceptional treatment. Barbecued ribs were especially lean. Fried shrimp puffs (shrimp toast) and spring rolls were crackly crisp creations. The dipping sauces that accompanied the fried and steamed dumplings were way above par, but the tasty morsels themselves were leaden. A far lighter dumpling was the one designated on the menu as daily special (dim sum). Two beef entrees netted mixed reviews. Beef with basil impressed with a tastebud-awakening sauce, but the meat was chewy. Orange flavor beef also was nicely seasoned but needed a crisper crust. Salmon teriyaki, glazed with a slightly sweet brown sauce and artistically presented with baby corn, bean sprouts and broccoli in attendance, topped both. Chinese eggplant with garlic sauce was a vegetarian virtuoso. Long lavender eggplant (which my greengrocer calls Japanese eggplant) was lovingly sauteed with other vegetables in a garlic-detonated sauce. Another eggplant dish, deep-fried eggplant, though, was soggy and ordinary. One of the least expensive dishes, pan-fried noodles ($6.95), was wonderful. Enormous amounts of chicken studded the flavor-packed pasta. Also savored and enjoyed were tender lamb with scallions, appropriately hot chicken with garlic, featherlike tempura, seductively crispy barbecued whole flouder and one of the best versions of bird's nest around. The taro root nest was in crunchy counterpoint to the smooth oyster sauce enfolding the melange of scallops, shrimp, crab, chicken and vegetables. Desserts are better than you might expect. The house dessert features assorted flavors of ice cream scoops surrounded by fruit: all canned one evening; fresh pineapple, melon and orange slices added to it another. Honey bananas get the royal treatment at Homer's Oriental. The lacy-crisp batter-coated fruit is rolled in sizzling caramel and then plunged into ice water at the table. The brittle caramel and melt-in-the-mouth banana are heaven. The staff kept water glasses and noodle bowls filled and provided efficient yet unrushed service. The only discordant note was a loudspeaker on weekends intoning: ''Johnson, party of four; Smith, party of two.'' But whether your party is two or 22, Homer's Oriental is a sumptuous garden of delights in which to toast the Chinese New Year. HOMER'S ORIENTAL Very Good 126 Spruce Street, Cedarhurst. 374-6111.

186-> Compromise Sought on Trade Bill
With President Reagan reiterating that he will veto the sweeping trade legislation that Congress has produced, Administration officials have suggested the Democrats return to a compromise bill they walked away from two weeks ago. Democratic Congressional leaders are weighing several options, including trying to round up additional votes in the Senate to override the veto. The Senate approved the bill, 63 to 36, three votes short of the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto. The House, which passed the bill overwhelmingly last week, is expected to override the veto. The compromise plan called for the Democrats to drop the trade bill's provision requiring companies' to provide 60 days' notice of plant closings and layoffs, which the President has pointed to as the reason for his veto. The compromise fell through when House Speaker Jim Wright objected to dropping the plant-closing provisions, and when Democratic Presidential candidates took up the issue. The Democrats must now consider whether to pursue what they regard as a strong political issue - the Adminisration's opposition to the plant-closing measure - or whether they want to produce a trade bill the President will sign. Most Democratic leaders said they had not yet addressed whether to accept the earlier compromise. But the Senate Finance Committee chairman, Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas, one of those who worked hardest on the legislation, said he would support new legislation that dropped the notification requirement. Wilson Morris, an aide to Mr. Wright, commented: ''We are not discussing any deals. Our purpose is now either to get the President to sign it, or to see if we can't get the veto overridden.'' The Senate majority leader, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, added: ''This bill isn't dead yet. The ball is in the White House's court.'' The Democrats hope to add more Republican converts to the 11 who voted for the trade bill. Alaska's two Republican Senators, Ted Stevens and Frank H. Murkowski, have indicated they would join the Democrats if the bill is stripped of provisions capping Alaska's oil exports, which the two legislators say are unconstitutional. Although Democratic Congressional leaders and the Democratic front-runner, Michael S. Dukakis, urged the President not to veto the bill, Administration officials said there was little question that he would. Marlin Fitzwater, White House spokesman, stressed that the President's veto message ''will specify that we would like to see plant closings eliminated from future consideration of the bill.'' ''We would hope to be able to work with the leadership and come up with a bill as rapidly as possible that everyone could support and pass,'' he added. The United States trade representative, Clayton K. Yeutter, said on NBC's ''Today'' program: ''We need a trade bill this year. If some corrections are made and a bill comes back I am quite confident the President will sign it.'' Efforts to revive the legislation stem from the broad core of bipartisan support that it had engendered before the plant-closing issue introduced an election-year political twist. The bill would overhaul the rules under which the country defends itself against unfair trading practices by other nations and provide greater assurances of protection to industries deluged by imports.

188-> ABROAD AT HOME; Time of Challenge
In the convention season of American politics we are preoccupied with tactics. Elections have to be won. But something deeper touches our consciousness this summer. We are beginning to understand that new realities in the world challenge some of our most familiar ways of thinking, our premises. A time of fundamental change will confront the next President, whoever that is. One example is in world politics. For the last 40 years the basic fact of international life has been the conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union. Tension has waxed and waned, but the struggle for advantage in military power and political influence has never stopped. Now the Soviet Union is in an uproar of change. No one thinks that Mikhail Gorbachev is about to transform his country into a Western democracy, but even the most skeptical of American Kremlinologists agree that something real is happening. For the first time in 60 years differing voices are being heard in the U.S.S.R. The relationship between the two superpowers has already been affected. Who would have believed, a few years ago, that the Soviet Chief of Staff would spend a week in the United States, consult at the Pentagon and be welcomed at the White House by Ronald Reagan? Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev has just made that visit. It ended with an agreement to form a joint military working group that will seek ways of preventing dangerous incidents. The Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs, Adm. William Crowe, is to return the visit next year, and U.S. and Soviet military commanders in Europe will meet. Such occasions do not signify affection. They do signify a new perception of common interests - in reducing the mutual fears and distortions that endanger both countries and that feed their arms race. The idea of common interests is growing in the broader diplomatic field, too. If there is a chance now to end the terrible war in Angola and bring Namibia to independence -and there seems to be - it is because the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. are both pushing for a settlement. We think about the possibility of such collaboration in addressing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Even the beginnings of change in the superpower relationship pose great questions for American policy. How do we seize the chance to reduce our armories, and the burden of military costs, while maintaining our security and our allies' confidence? How can we most effectively encourage the political process begun in the Soviet Union by Mr. Gorbachev? There may be large domestic consequences, too. The Massachusetts economic miracle in which Governor Dukakis rightly takes such pride was based in part on high-technology defense work. If that declines, how can we encourage innovative civilian production? America's economic future may depend on the answer. A second example of new realities, even more profound, is the stress in the world's environment - or, more exactly, our awareness of that stress. Day after day, this summer, we have had warnings of danger to the natural order that supports life. Miles of beaches near New York have been closed because of waves of sewage and hospital debris in the water. Forests in New England and Canada have shown appalling signs of damage by acid rain. ''The environment is trying to say something,'' a scientist remarked after a massive fish kill in the ocean off New Jersey. Each incident tells us that nature can no longer handle the consequences of unthinking human behavior. Beyond the individual instances of pollution there is the broad scientific agreement, in recent months, that the burning of fossil fuels is creating a ''greenhouse effect'' on Earth. Temperatures are going to climb to the point where there will be devastating damage unless we switch to other sources of energy. The challenge in all this is to collective action. Individually, we are selfish. The Edison Electric Institute, a trade organization, says with ineffable blindness: ''Current scientific evidence shows there is no acid rain crisis.'' In other words, it is a political challenge. Over these last years we have luxuriated in the belief that private action can solve all problems if only government gets out of the way. But it will require government, of the highest order, to deal with realities of these dimensions.

189-> Diner's Journal
Sunday-Morning Ritual A breakfast of scrambled eggs and smoked salmon - not side by side, but all mixed up, and with some onions tossed in for good measure - is a Sunday-morning ritual for many people on the Upper West Side, and it has been popularized by the wonderfully homespun restaurant and delicatessen Barney Greengrass at Amsterdam Avenue and 86th Street. Customers line up at 8:45 A.M. for the breakfast special of Nova Scotia with eggs ($9). A few blocks away, at Docks Oyster Bar and Seafood Grill (Broadway at 89th Street, 724-5588), an equally enticing version with lox is served at Sunday brunch for $8.75. Docks, a sparkling tile-and-wood seafood house, is partly owned by Arthur Cutler, who has Murray's Sturgeon Shop next door, one of the best smoked-fish sources in town. Docks serves brunch from 10:30 A.M. to 3 P.M. Reservations are accepted for parties of three or more. Polo Chef Dismissed The Polo restaurant in the Westbury Hotel is going through major changes in the kitchen and menu. Last week, the French-born chef, Patrice Boely, was dismissed by the hotel's general manger, Stefan Simkovics. ''We would like to have a more American-style menu,'' Mr. Simkovics said, adding that he is looking for an American chef to revamp the menu.

190-> INVESTING; Why Digital Has Lost Half Its Value
MANY stocks have come down to earth since the market peaked on Aug. 25 of last year, but few have made a thud as loud as the Digital Equipment Corporation. Digital's stock has fallen all the way back to 1986. Recently, Digital common traded at $92 a share on the New York Stock Exchange, or $107.50 a share lower than its 1987 high. And although the stock recouped slightly last week, some analysts believe the worst is not over for Digital. ''The wonder is all of these people who have held it all the way down,'' said Justin Mamis, chief technical analyst for Cowen & Company. Not many people are blaming Digital, a premier growth company many analysts still recommend. Some analysts have trimmed their 1989 earnings estimates. But why has an average 10 percent trim in projections led to a 50 percent plunge in the stock's price? ''That's a million-dollar question,'' said Carol E. Muratore, who follows Digital for Morgan Stanley & Company and has recommended the stock all year. Actually, it's a multibillion-dollar question. Since their peak 1987 price of $199.50, Digital's 127.8 million common shares have lost almost $14 billion in market value. The answer is that Digital has experienced the downside of being a big institutional favorite. It has been regarded as a proxy for the market and the economy at a time when institutional investors have strong doubts about both. A comparison with Digital's main rival, International Business Machines, shows that I.B.M. is five times larger than Digital in annual revenues (more than $54 billion for I.B.M. compared with more than $9 billion for Digital) and in profits (more than $5 billion for I.B.M. against more than $1 billion for Digital). But because Digital's main customers are Fortune 500 companies, many experts consider it a better stock market and economic barometer than I.B.M. In good times, institutions own about half of I.B.M.'s 591.6 million common shares outstanding, but about 75 percent of Digital's shares. When the stock market is surging, both stocks typically run way ahead of the pack. But when the market turns bad, and both stocks are dumped, Digital falls more sharply. I.B.M.'s stock is off about 40 percent from its peak last year and would presumably be down even more if hundreds of thousands of smaller owners were not loyally hanging on. They at least have I.B.M.'s $4.40-a-share payout to comfort them; Digital pays no dividend. ''We're talking about a stock that did not rally well after the crash,'' Mr. Mamis said. ''It's the only major name that's below its crash lows. That is what happens when you have an over-owned stock. It's an institutional darling that has gone sour, with a vengeance.'' As a technical analyst, Mr. Mamis is more concerned about Digital's stock action than such fundamental gauges of performance as sales, profits and cash flow. But he argued that with the fundamental analysts scaling back their optimism about Digital, there was even less reason to own the stock. He does not believe that now is the time to start accumulating it. ''I've got a target of $80 to $85,'' Mr. Mamis said. Miss Muratore of Morgan Stanley said the company was a good buy now, even though ''Digital is something of a lightning rod for concerns about the stock market, for concerns about the economy.'' She estimates Digital will earn $11 a share in fiscal 1989, which ends next June. In the fiscal year just ended, Digital earned $9.90, which means that the stock is selling at less than 10 times its earnings for its latest 12 months. While few analysts expect the stock to sell again at the price-earnings ratio of 23 it hit at one point last year, a more normal multiple of, say, 13, would put the stock at around $140, if Miss Muratore's earnings forecast proved correct. Miss Muratore said Digital's strength was in selling computer networks to increasingly decentralized American corporations. ''I.B.M.'s approach has been centralized computer systems,'' she said, while Digital, through its vaunted VAX computers and its software, helps companies connect all sorts of personal computers for many applications. WHILE I.B.M. is the mainframe king, Digital's networks permit corporations to use even their I.B.M. computers better, Miss Muratore said. ''Digital has moved out of the minicomputer ghetto,'' she added. ''Digital's networks basically make PC's more useful.'' Just last Tuesday, Digital announced a new hardware-and-software line that allows VAX's to connect and share files with I.B.M. machines. Miss Muratore is not concerned by inroads made by the Japanese. She said that, while Japan had a large economy and strong computer companies as well as technology, the American market, where Digital was solidly entrenched, was so huge that even the Japanese would have a hard time ever dominating it. But while Digital may prosper, its shareholders may not. In a bear market like the one Wall Street is experiencing now, stocks like Digital will probably lag. And many analysts and investors fear what will happen to technology stocks in a recession. Digital, with its clientele of large corporations, could be particularly vulnerable. The dangers in owning Digital are easy to see. As recently as March, many analysts were praising the stock. A Dillon, Read analyst said, ''We still think Digital is a high-quality growth company and we recommend the stock.'' A Salomon Brothers analyst said: ''We now believe that the time has arrived to be an aggressive buyer.'' And a First Boston analyst called Digital ''a buy right now.'' At the time, Digital was selling at $120.50 a share.

193-> CRITICS CHOICES; Broadcast TV
Televising an Olympic Games is only slighlty less complicated than staging one. ABC, which televised both the Winter and Summer Games in 1984, has moved 17 tractor trailers of equipment to Calgary and plans 90 or so hours of programming, beginning last Saturday through Feb. 28. Because of Calgary's Mountain Time zone location, most of ABC's coverage will be live. The bulk of that coverage will come in the form of 10 or 11 hours of programming on each of the five weekend days following the opening ceremonies. The general weekday schedule calls for three hours of coverage, beginning at 8 P.M. Eastern time and an additional 30 minutes at 11:30 P.M. The specific broadcast schedule remains flexible in order to cover events of most interest to American viewers, skiing, hockey and figure skating, for example. And for the first time, speed skating will be held indoors - and at prime time in the Northeast. The network plans a few technological firsts in its coverage, one of which is the ''point of view'' project, using miniature cameras to try to give viewers a feel for what it is like to be a competitor. They will be carried by forerunners, who test the course in skiing and other events. Another breakthrough is in sound. Some events will use three times as many microphones as before to provide viewers with the continuous sound of the event. The small army of broadcasters will be led by Jim McKay, the principal anchor who is working his 10th Olympics for ABC. Others are Frank Gifford, Al Michaels, Keith Jackson, Bob Beattie, Dick Button, Donna de Varona, Mike Eruzione, Peggy Fleming and Eric Heiden. A schedule of events will be published on the daily Television page.

196-> Books of The Times; The Images and Beliefs That Underlie Fear of Nuclear Power
Nuclear Fear A History of Images By Spencer R. Weart 535 pages. Harvard University Press. $29.50. The nuclear fears that have become so familiar, perhaps pervasive, since World War II were already stirring more than 40 years before Hiroshima. In 1903, a sensation-mongering French writer, Gustave Le Bon, foresaw the possibility of a radioactive device that could blow up the world at the touch of a button. In the same year, the British chemist Frederick Soddy, addressing the Royal Corps of Engineers, became the first scientist, according to Spencer R. Weart in his book ''Nuclear Fear,'' ''to explicitly add atomic energy to the roster of possible weapons.'' Soddy, at least, knew what he was talking about. In collaboration with Ernest Rutherford, he had already played a major role in solving the puzzle of radioactivity; and in his excitement at discovering that it was a sign of fundamental changes in matter, he had fallen back on the language of alchemy, and spoken of ''transmutation.'' He had also been moved to prophesy a second Eden fueled by atomic energy, a future as different from the past as the dragonfly was from its larva. This kind of visionary language is a good example of a more general phenomenon. Decades before the discovery of nuclear fission, Mr. Weart tells us, most of the mythic themes associated with atomic energy were already in the air: transmutation itself, fiery destruction, a radiant utopia, transforming rays, monsters, a Faustian mastermind, a planet laid waste. The imagery, it follows, ''did not come from experience with real bombs and power plants. It came from somewhere else.'' It came, in fact, from the world of traditional legends and folk beliefs, and beyond that from the recesses of the human mind: it was an expression of perennial anxieties and aspirations. ''Nuclear Fear'' is a study of such imagery, and of the images that have been added to the stock since nuclear power became a reality. No one before Mr. Weart, who is director of the Center for the History of Physics at the American Institute of Physics, has attempted to look at the history of atomic energy in this way, at least not systematically; and he makes a persuasive case for his approach. It is on images, he contends, rather than facts or detailed arguments, that a great many of our notions about nuclear energy are based - and who can disagree with him? The facts are there, even so, and some of them are inescapable. But if Hiroshima was an obvious turning point, it didn't mark as absolute a break with the past as you might have supposed. (Mr. Weart is primarily concerned with public opinion in America, as he is throughout the book.) At first Hiroshima simply brought existing images of the atom, both good and bad, into greater prominence, and invested them with greater significance. Then came fears about security, about the hydrogen bomb, about fallout and contamination, until by the early 1960's nuclear hopes (the hopes previously fostered by the Eisenhower Administration's ''Atoms for Peace'' crusade, for instance) were outweighed by nuclear dread. The protest movements that sprang up at the time soon started losing their impetus, however, and since then there has been an ebb and flow of active public concern. Such are the main outlines of the story, which Mr. Weart traces through all its major phases, down to the present. But it is in the details (almost inevitably, in a study of images) that the chief interest of ''Nuclear Fear'' lies. Books from Philip Wylie's ''Tomorrow!'' to Walter Miller's ''Canticle for Liebowitz,'' movies from ''Godzilla'' to ''Hiroshima Mon Amour,'' personalities from Brien McMahon, the ''Atomic Senator,'' to Herman Kahn (since personalities, as we all know, have images, too) - these are only some of the stopping points in a survey that also takes in topics as various, and relevant, as Bikini and Chernobyl, the insignia of the Strategic Air Command and the symbolism of the mushroom cloud, James Rosenquist's painting ''F-111'' and Dick Tracy's atomic two-way wrist radio. Along the way, Mr. Weart makes a number of acute points; but what, finally, does it all prove? In his preface, he somewhat forestalls criticism by announcing that ''the main premise of this book is also its main conclusion: that the images we cherish have a greater role in history than has commonly been thought.'' Well, yes. But it seems a rather lame lesson to extract from a work that deals with such momentous issues. There is a limit, too, to what you can usefully say if you push politics and policies so firmly into the background. Why did protests against nuclear weapons fade in the 1960's and surface again at the end of the 1970's, for instance? Why was so little heard about the subject, relatively speaking, during the Vietnam War? While Mr. Weart doesn't altogether ignore hard political considerations, the reasons he advances are mainly psychological: habituation, strategies of denial and so forth. But political attitudes and reactions seem to me to have been much more significant. Mr. Weart tends to be at his most instructive when he discusses the uses of political symbolism - David Lilienthal's point that critics of nuclear reactors often treat them as ''a surrogate for bombs,'' for example; the advantages enjoyed by the protester who brandishes a stark, simple image over the Government official who deploys arguments and statistics. (How fussy such things can seem, in the face of a potential Armageddon!) ''Nuclear Fear'' certainly deserves to be read: it is never less than intelligent and absorbing. But it still leaves you feeling that although imagery is an important aspect of history, it is only an aspect, and that, except over short distances, or for limited purposes, it doesn't particularly repay being studied in isolation.

197-> Dance: City Ballet in Balanchine's 'Bugaku'
GEORGE BALANCHINE'S ''Bugaku'' is very peculiar. It often looks cliche-ridden, even corny. But the cliches turn into surprises, and even the corniest scene has a serious point. ''Bugaku'' was as fascinating as ever when the New York City Ballet danced it Thursday night at the New York State Theater. With a score by Toshiro Mayuzumi and an austere decor by David Hays, ''Bugaku'' appears to be a tribute to Japan. So, in a sense, it is. But, after a solemn opening theme, the music grows so lush that it could be used in a romantic Hollywood movie, and when some women enter, they wear petaled tutus designed by Karinska. ''Bugaku'' soon becomes a marriage ceremony in which the bride is insipidly demure and the groom is a determinedly forceful warrior. If this were all, one could dismiss ''Bugaku'' as a collection of stereotypes deriving from Western notions of the supposed quaintness of Japanese culture. However, Balanchine shatters the stereotypes. Alone at last, bride and groom dance a highly erotic pas de deux that is also a battle of wills. No longer demure, the bride is someone with whom the groom must contend. And both bride and groom enjoy displaying their strength of will. But when their attendants return, the again move with ritualistic formality. ''Bugaku'' contrasts public and private behavior to suggest that the things people do when they are alone may not be related to the code of manners that tradition requires them to follow when they are with other people. Balanchine has made the ballet quaint so that he can ultimately make it startling. A cast headed by Heather Watts and Jock Soto did manage to startle. Nevertheless, Ms. Watts and Mr. Soto were not ideally suited to their roles. The ballet is most effective if the bride initially appears to be almost cloyingly sweet so that her later assertiveness will come as a shock. Ms. Watts, in contrast, was confident at the outset. Indeed, she performed her rituals in an aloof, almost snooty manner. Mr. Soto, though strong, was almost too polite at the start. Yet there was an effective moment when the two dancers bent low as if to whisper secrets. They could have been tempting each other with hints of the passion that was to follow. The program, conducted by Robert Irving, also included repeat performances of Jerome Robbins's ''Ives, Songs'' and Balanchine's ''Symphony in C.'' The American debut of guest dancers from Moscow's Bolshoi Ballet in ''Symphony in C,'' which was originally announced for last Thursday, was postponed to this Thursday.

204-> A Gainsborough Landscape
IF John Constable's is the most familiar of all British artists' home territories, Thomas Gainsborough's is among the least. The comparison would not have been such a pointed one had not these territories, which share a river, overlapped. The two great painters were born 20 miles and 50 years apart in the Stour Valley, but due to Constable's naturalistic (he called it ''scientific'') treatment of its gentle scenery, he has seized it all, popularly speaking. Constable country is now as much a tourist destination as Bath and Stratford-on-Avon. While the Gainsborough country can never be so easily accessible, it is there to be seen. The young John Constable, who was 12 when Gainsborough died, walked every inch of it and revered it. And, as it is not entirely extravagant to ask, ''Would there have been a John Constable, landscapist, had there not been a god called Gainsborough only a walking distance upstream?'' one might say that the Stour Valley's role in the development of English painting can only be understood if one starts at Sudbury. This is where Gainsborough was born in 1727 and where he dominated my childhood in somewhat the same way as he dominated Constable's, and indeed that of any would-be creative spirit. The artist's forcefulness and inescapability had much to do with the statue erected to him just before the World War I, a life-size bronze, palette and brush in hand, and his gaze on his birthplace. To me as a boy, this monument seemed to draw up all the town's little preoccupations and somehow put them through a noble process of transfiguration. I had nearly forgotten the power that Gainsborough's statue had over me until, just recently, I read a biography of the Latin scholar Helen Waddell and learned that a huge carved Buddha in the street of the Chinese town where her father worked as a Presbyterian missionary filled her as a small girl with a strength and radiance that remained with her most of her life. William Golding, the novelist, brought up under the spire of Salisbury Cathedral, was permanently influenced by this immense symbol. Similarly, Gainsborough, rearing above the market stalls, backed by the tall church, which the wool merchants built in the 15th century and which itself was the epitome of local grandeur to my child's eyes, his plinth with its swag of violins and flutes lit at dusk by the naphtha lamps of the banana sellers, lifted me out of a market town's humdrum into the magical realm of art. But the key to why so many people came to see Constable country and scarcely any to see the Gainsborough country did not arrive until a member of the catchment board asked me to help him organize a book he had written about the Stour River. I was about to become a writer and he was a descendant of the Cavalier poet Edmund Waller, thus intriguing me. Colonel Waller's ''The Suffolk Stour'' revealed what John Constable was really painting in his six footers, as he called them, was the river that ran through his family's farm and drove its mills and was an industrialized waterway. His many pictures of the valley were intended to be of an immediately recognizable and desirable place for human existence - albeit that during the time that they were being painted the starving agricultural workers were rioting. Constable wasn't being hypocritical, he was providing beautiful statements of what we now call man's place in the environment. EVERYTHING in these native scenes, from the work to the plants and the weather, is spiritually true and scientifically accurate. The countless visitors who come to the East Bergholt every year are almost shocked to see so exactly what Constable saw, and to breathe his air. What would these same sightseers find if they drove, preferably on the river-hugging lanes, upstream to Gainsborough country? In terms of art-related topography, little that could be discovered without the aid of books, which would have made Gainsborough, who hated reading, laugh. Yet it was rural Suffolk, even during the half of his life spent out of it, which inspired his ravishing landscapes, so beloved in their day - which poor Constable's never were when they first appeared -and which seem to be purposely designed for us not to enter or walk in. Except for a few magnificent instances such as ''Cornard Wood'' or the surroundings of ''Mr. and Mrs. Robert Andrews,'' or a few views along the Orwell River near Ipswich, Gainsborough country cannot be pinpointed on the map. Its geography was shaped on a table-top from bits of cork, broccoli, twigs and mirror and then subjected to a transfiguration. The rustic scene, which so repeatedly emerges, contains so many similar elements that we can only conclude that it represented a human condition of immense significance to the artist. It is of a secluded peasant world where life is rough and ragged, yet mysteriously blissful. There are the usual village tasks, yet an indifference to them seems to prevail. Is it the classic idyll? No - there is never a Virgilian quote in sight. The actual farming is terribly muddled and a far cry from that on Robert Andrews's estate. These landscapes are Gainsborough's escape from where portaiture had taken him, these and music and drink and women. But, having got to Sudbury, and before setting foot in his birthplace, drive through the town and up Ballingdon Hill in neighboring Bulmer to a house on the right called Auberies. It has stone cats on the gateposts, which we, as children, were told changed posts at midnight, although we were never allowed to stay up to watch it happen. This was the home of Robert and Frances Andrews, who were married in All Saints' Church in 1748 when he was 22 and she 16. Their portrait - now one of the treasures of the National Gallery in London - painted by Robert's school friend Tom Gainsborough during the harvest, was most likely a wedding present. The couple look across the Stour Valley on a panorama of fields, woods, medieval towers, meadows and river twists, which, after two and a half centuries, has changed hardly at all. Auberies, in its park, is private, but if you stare back toward Sudbury you will see the landscape of the picture. All that this view includes, and it stretches bluely to the Cornards, is Gainsborough country. Farther reaches of it are in and about Ipswich, a county town crammed with associative surprises ranging from Chaucer to Orwell. AND so from the setting of what many believe to be the finest English domestic portrait to Gainsborough's House in Gainsborough Street, Sudbury, which is, curiously, considering the country's many literary shrines, the only artist's birthplace open to the public. Like countless houses in ancient town centers, it is a timber and plaster building made elegant in the 18th century by the addition of a brick facade. Gainsborough's father built that improvement in 1723, and there could hardly have been designed a more perfect backdrop, as it were, for such a son. Not that its history is one of the purely residential -far from it. The elder Gainsborough ran his various trades from it, most interestingly his shroud-weaving business. In a forlorn hope to revive the once prosperous wool trade, a Charles II law required everybody to be buried in a woolen shroud. This law did little for the industry or for Gainsborough's father, who went bankrupt. I have found myself less thoughtful about this than of that lad sketching below the room where the lengths of warm cloth for Sudbury's corpses were run off the looms. The Gainsboroughs were an extraordinary lot, father an Independent, mother an Anglican, two sons inventors, and the whole atmosphere of the home a mixture of entrepreneurial effort and the impractical, genius and the kind of eccentricity the English admire. John (Scheming Jack) Gainsborough, the artist's brother, invented a cuckoo that sang all year round, a cradle that was self-rocking, a waterwheel that turned in still water and wings that failed to let him fly when he took off from the roof of the summer house. Their mother painted flowers, and their uncle -her brother, the local curate and schoolmaster, the Rev. Humphrey Burroughs - was the member of the family to whom posterity is most in debt, for it was chiefly due to this percipient man that Tom, aged 13, was sent off to London to learn to be an artist. The robustness of the house during the Gainsboroughs's occupancy had vanished by the time of my first awareness of it as a boy. For it had become, after much else, a refined small hotel whose bedrooms had been given the titles of Gainsborough's paintings rather than numbers. Guests were told, ''We have put you in Mrs. Siddons's'' or ''in the Blue Boy.'' The fortunes of this old house were dramatically and courageously changed in 1958 when a handful of local people managed to buy it and, by degrees, turn it into one of the country's most evocative and fascinating provincial art centers. In the 30 years that have passed since then, Gainsborough's House and its activities might be said to have introduced the great artist to most of today's Suffolk inhabitants for the first time. Until these roomsful of drawings and paintings appeared in their midst, Sudburians paid their homage to something and somebody they knew almost nothing about by having a Gainsborough cinema, street, road and various commercial enterprises, although, even now, the sense of association, of being in immortalized scenes, remains thin when compared with Cezanne's mountain, Monet's garden or Constable's mill. The interior, as with so many ancient English town houses that have combined workplace with home, reveals architectural developments ranging from the late Middle Ages to the present, but with the Georgian elegance of Gainsborough's youth predominating. The rooms contain the largest single collection of his work in Britain, his cittern and guitar (the artist's passion for musical instruments could on occasion exceed that for music itself), the cabinet in which he kept his paints and many pictures and objects connected with his family. Although the house has become an expertly arranged museum and art gallery, the atmosphere is intimate, domestic and evocative. Exhibitions of the work of modern artists, as well as of old masters, are mounted annually, and the Old Coach House next door is a lively workshop where lithography, etching, silk screen and relief printing are taught. Gainsborough has been, in popular terms, an artist in abeyance. No one would have thought that by creating an art center in his birthplace that he would have been drawn so far forward in such a brief time and made so recognizable. But this is what has happened. There will never be any general admittance to his landscapes, for these are private views. The range of Georgian faces is a different matter. Gainsborough is the Mozart of portraiture. An entire society - squires, bankers, royalty, beggars, priests, actors, children, the aged, aristocrats, farmers, musicians, the clever, the beautiful and the wild -surged through his painting rooms in Sudbury, Ipswich, Bath and London and were given all the glitter and profundity that life demands. It is only fitting that the first portrait that he painted, a small boy in his finery, should now hang where he himself grew up. Having been to Bulmer with its grand view of Sudbury and its hills and having seen the Gainsborough house, the visitor should walk down the street from the house to the river. On the left, up School Lane, is the school. It stands on the site of the one in which the artist was taught by his Uncle Humphrey. Opposite, on the right, the road leads to St. Gregory's Church, where Gainsborough's grandparents are buried. Straight ahead lies the Stour and its common lands, the swimming, games-playing, idling, courting meadows for Sudbury's youth for many centuries, and probably the initial path to Gainsborough's personal countryside. The disused track of the Cambridge train runs across it like a barricade. Distantly to the north is the tower of Borley Church below whose altar lies Humphrey Burroughs. The descent past the houses of the rich medieval wool merchants to the Stour, the tow path to the Croft, the lanes to the Market Hill and confident Tom high above it, has been my Gainsborough country since I was not much bigger than whoever he is in the pretty waistcoat in the picture. This walk and another on the high ground at Great Cornard, an adventurous spot in my boyhood, full of pits and gulls where the teen-age Gainsborough painted his first landscape in which, through the oaks, distantly, rises the spire of the church in which his parents were married. It is strange to think that had he widened his view to the left it would have included Constable's grandfather's farm. Not quite so odd, perhaps, that this early landscape, ''Cornard Wood,'' now also in the National Gallery, used to belong to Constable's Uncle David. Or that Gainsborough's brother and Constable's father attended river navigation meetings together, seeing that their country was shaped by a single stream. Pictures at four exhibitions To commemorate the bicentenary of Thomas Gainsborough's death, on Aug. 2, 1788, exhibitions of his work are taking place this summer in Bath, London and Sudbury. ''Gainsborough in Bath.'' In Bath, where Gainsborough lived from 1759 to 1774, the Holburne Museum and Crafts Study Center is exhibiting more than 30 works showing the artist's stylistic development during his years there and his emergence as a painter of international repute. The exhibition, the first devoted to this period, focuses on portraits of the artist's patrons and friends at the spa, some of which have never been on public display. Also in the show is Gainsborough's ''Harvest Wagon,'' painted in 1767 and considered one of the more important landscapes painted while the artist was in Bath. On Aug. 4, at 7:30 P.M., the museum is sponsoring a lecture on Gainsborough's Bath period by Dr. John Hayes, the director of the National Portrait Gallery in London. Admission to the lecture is about $5. Holbourne Museum and Crafts Study Center, Great Pultney Street, Bath. Until Aug. 14; Monday to Saturday, 11 A.M. to 5 P.M., Sunday 2:30 to 6 P.M. Admission: about $1.75. ''The Earl and Countess Howe by Gainsborough'' and ''A Nest of Nightingales.'' Gainsborough masterpieces are at the center of exhibitions at two London galleries. The portrait ''Mary, Countess Howe'' at the Iveagh Bequest, Kenwood, is the focus of an exhibition that explores this work of the artist's early years in Bath. Other works by Gainsborough and paintings by Van Dyck, Reynolds and Thomas Hudson are also in the exhibition. At the Dunwich Picture Gallery in London, an example of Gainsborough's later portraiture, ''The Linley Sisters,'' will be shown with other painters' portraits of the Linleys, a popular musical family of the time. The Iveagh Bequest, Kenwood, Hampstead Lane, London. Daily from Aug. 3 to Oct. 30. Hours: 10 A.M. to 7 P.M. in August and September, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. in October. Admission: about $2.50. Dulwich Picture Gallery, College Road, London. Sept. 21 to Dec. 30; Tuesday to Saturday, 10 A.M. to 1 P.M. and 2 to 5 P.M., Sunday, 2 to 5 P.M. Admission: about $2.50. ''Gainsborough's Family.'' Gainsborough's House, the artist's birthplace in Sudbury, is now showing Gainsborough portraits of members of his family. Among the 15 paintings shown are portraits of the painter's father, his eldest brother, John (Scheming Jack) Gainsborough, an unsuccesful inventor; his nephew and only student, Gainsborough Dupont, and his wife and daughters. Also on display are 13 Gainsborough paintings in the house's permanent collection. Gainsborough's House, Gainsborough Street, Sudbury, Suffolk. Until Sept. 18; Tuesday to Saturday, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M., Sunday 2 to 5 P.M. Closed Monday. Admission: about $1.75. The house is raising money to establish an endowment. Tax-deductible contributions may be sent to Hamish R. Sandison, president, British American Arts Association (U.S.A.), 1200 New Hampshire Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036. - DAVID S. HAWKINS

208-> Steel Imports Increase
Steel imports rose in January from the previous month and were sharply higher than in January 1987, the American Iron and Steel Institute said Thursday. The increase came almost entirely from developing nations not covered by the Reagan Administration's voluntary import quotas, the institute said. The January imports were 1.81 million tons, up 7 percent from 1.69 million tons in December and up 24 percent from 1.46 million tons in January 1987.

209-> Trevi Fountain in Rome Is Due for Refurbishing
The Trevi Fountain, one of Rome's most famous landmarks, is to receive a waterproof basin as part of an $830,000 restoration scheduled to begin next spring. The superintendent of the city's antiquities, Maria Luisi Cardilli, said most of the work would be on the marble statues that form the backdrop to the fountain. She said the basin, which is made of porous travertine stone, had developed leaks. Work on the baroque 18th-century fountain, into which tourists throw thousands of coins daily. is expected to last one year.

210-> China to Offer Food Subsidies to Urban Residents
China's urban residents will be given cash food subsidies to supplement stagnant wages and offset increasing food prices, the official New China News Agency reported today. The subsidies will amount to about 10 percent of a worker's monthly wage and are to replace in part the current system of price controls. The price of food, the most critical element in the average family budget, has risen dramatically in major Chinese cities over the first three months of the year already and city dwellers are becoming more vociferous in their complaints. ''Living costs have gone up sharply,'' the agency said, ''and actual personal incomes have dropped considerably.'' Both television and newspapers have reported extensively on inflation, and interviews with shoppers have become a staple item on the front pages. Last week, the state statistical bureau announced that fresh vegetables, a major part of the Chinese diet, jumped 47.8 percent in the first quarter of 1988. In general, food prices in large and medium cities climbed 13.4 percent over the same period. Sugar at 27 Cents a Pound For the first time in the nearly four decades of Communist rule, steadily increasing prices have become a principal feature in Chinese life. Until recently, prices in China remained virtually unchanged, a phenomenon that has been largely taken for granted by most Chinese. Now, however, the country's ambitious program of reshaping the economy has unsettled many of popular assumptions about daily life. China's attempts to disentangle itself from a pricing system derived from traditional notions of a Communist economy, for example, have touched off inflation for a wide range of consumer goods, especially food products. Sugar, for example, now costs urban residents about 27 cents a pound, 50 percent more than a year ago. Because farmers are being spurred to increase production largely by higher prices paid for their crops rather than political exhortation or compulsory quotas, these costs are being passed on to consumers for the first time. Earlier this year, to prevent hoarding and shortages, many of China's largest cities instituted a rationing system for pork, the main meat consumed by Chinese. According to the agency, the price of frozen pork jumped 50 percent, to about 50 cents a pound. Shanghai Subsidy of $2.70 Earlier this month, Deputy Prime Minister Yao Yilin said the Government would try to keep inflation below 10 percent. Last year, according to the Government, prices rose at an annual rate of 7.3 percent, although privately Chinese economists estimated the rate at closer to 15 percent. In announcing the new policy, the press agency said Changsha and Hangzhou were already providing subsidies for pork, vegetables, sugar and eggs. Beginning May 1, Shanghai will give residents a subsidy of 10 yuan a person, a sum equivalent to $2.70. The average urban worker, according to the State Statistical Bureau, now earns a bit more than 90 yuan per month, or about $24.50, the vast percentage of which goes toward purchasing food. Housing costs in China are generally minimal, usually less than $1 a month. Food subsidies will be paid to Beijing residents within the next month or two, according to the press agency. The price of rice is already subsidized for urban consumers. In the past, food prices have been kept down by price controls that were supported by subsidies to state-owned stores. ''Such direct subsidies to urban consumers have replaced the former indirect subsidies to state food shops which were designed to make them maintain their low retail prices in the city,'' the Chinese press agency said. Under the new policy, individual enterprises will be responsible for providing the cash subsidies to their workers, while local governments will be required to come up with the money for government employees, school and university teachers, hospital staffs and performing arts groups. Controlled prices have led to shortages of a variety of goods here in Beijing, including color television sets, matches, soap, towels, enamelware and cotten underclothes.

211-> A Hong Kong Satellite Looks Ahead to 1997
TEN years ago Shatin was a quiet patch of farmland in Hong Kong's New Territories, with water buffalo pulling plows through geometric acres of rice paddies and fishermen's cottages along the Shing Mun River. It was an evocation of rural China, even though it was only 10 miles north of the teeming city of Kowloon, separated from Hong Kong's busiest district by the steep Lion Rock Hills. Today it is the most energetic of Hong Kong's so-called new towns, a city of more than 300,000 people that is expected to grow to 500,000 within a decade. There are forests of 40-story high-rises with highways, viaducts and overpasses crisscrossing about them, a new 17-story hotel, shopping plazas and malls, dozens of restaurants, even a race track. What had been virtually vacant countryside has become an urban showcase amply demonstrating the British crown colony's singular energy and its ability to expand and grow swiftly. Shatin is a place of parks, urban plazas, cinemas and branches of Japanese department stores, a weekend getaway for the people of Kowloon - 10 minutes away by train -and a growing tourist destination. Perhaps more significant, however, is that Shatin provides what is possibly a view of the Hong Kong of the future, because it sits in the New Territories, the 350 square miles of land between Hong Kong proper and the border of China that are the subject of immediate concern in negotiations on ending the lease on the colony held by Britain. The lease expires in June 1997. The New Territories are on a 99-year lease that was signed in Peking in 1898. Hong Kong Island and Kowloon were leased in perpetuity, but in fact the lease terms have come to include the entire colony. Many Hong Kong residents believe that in the years leading to the end of the lease, and immediately thereafter, Hong Kong's future expansion lies in these New Territories. But there is more to Shatin than cement and polished granite and shopping malls like the New Town Plaza, where the waters of a computerized fountain dip and soar to symphonic music and recall the dancing waters many of us remember from Radio City Music Hall's earlier days. It has developed as a city but has managed to preserve some of the atmosphere of old China. Just beyond the Lion Rock Tunnel, which now cuts through the hills around Shatin, across a small valley from a mountain the people of Shatin call Amah Rock - they say it resembles a nursemaid carrying a child on her back - lies Tsang Tai Uk, a preserved walled village. Here 200 people live the rural life of China, much as the inhabitants did when the village was built 140 years ago. Tsang Tai Uk is a compound enclosed by long parallel rows of two-story masonry houses. Each building contains an elaborate ancestral hall of red- and gold-gilded woods that is used for worship as well as an entry into the enclave, which is dotted with small gardens and chicken coops. Tsang Tai Uk translates literally as Mr. Tsang's Big House and to this day virtually all the villagers are named Tsang. The earliest settlements in the area date to the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), when it was reported that a village called Tai Wai had been founded four centuries earlier. People in Shatin say that the rice from Tai Wai's fields was so fine that it was sent to the Imperial Court in Beijing. Shatin houses the Che Kung Temple, named for a general of the Sung Dynasty (960-1279). The temple, which is close to Shatin's main railroad station, is of stucco-covered stone, dark and exceedingly quiet. There are several carved Buddhas, but the feature that distinguishes the temple is the forest of circular incense hoops hanging from its ceiling. Che Kung is a favorite place for weekend visits by the Chinese of Kowloon, who come to burn the incense hoops, to pray to their ancestors and to celebrate the coming of the Lunar New Year and other traditional holidays. Close by is the Four-Face Budda, a statue with four faces carved in wood in Thailand. The shrine is always bedecked with flowers set before it by prayerful Buddhists. ALSO near the station - 431 steps up from it - is the Temple of Ten Thousand Buddhas, where, if you care to count them, 12,800 small Buddhas of carved wood and sculptured clay, some painted bright scarlet, are set into its walls. The hillside temple is marked by a bright red nine-story pagoda. By climbing 69 more steps the visitor finds the Temple of Man Fat, dedicated to the monk Yuet Kai, who founded it. His preserved body, covered with gold, sits with closed eyes inside. Though it has developed far more quickly than others, Shatin is typical of the new settlements that have sprung up throughout the New Territories, towns that have grown simply because Kowloon and Hong Kong Island, the core of the colony, cannot hold an ever-expanding population that is well above five million. In such New Territories towns as Fo Tan, Tai Po and Fanling, apartment buildings, owned and operated by the Hong Kong Government, continue to be built, along with markets and shopping centers. Shatin also has a luxurious racecourse, owned and operated by the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club, where the diversion is flat racing on a grass track. Some tour operators, particularly those in Australia, are booking groups into Shatin's new Hotel Riverside Plaza, where there are swimming pools, a health center, several restaurants and a discotheque. Guests who ride the hotel's shuttle bus to Kowloon's Tsim Sha Tsui shopping area walk through malls and boutiques selling everything from silks to the latest electronic gadgetry. In one of Shatin's mall developments, Shatin Inter-City, visitors strolling among the shops that are lively imitations of those in Kowloon find several restaurants, one of which, named for the complex, serves such Cantonese dishes as guinea hen and deer. THEY may also discover the Palm Beach Sauna and a huge swimming pool that form part of the huge recreational center built for the residents of Shatin Inter-City. Nearby is Shatin New Town Plaza, next to a budding park called Shatin Central Park. The cynosure of New Town Plaza is its fountain. Each afternoon, just before 12:45, hundreds of people, many elderly and children among them, pull up folding chairs and encircle the fountain, which sits in a multistory atrium in the middle of a shopping mall. At 12:45 the music begins, occasionally Western symphonic, though more often classical Chinese, and the waters begin to dance. People run out of the many bakeries and dim sum parlors, out of the Yaohan department store, out of the boutiques, to watch the free half-hour water show. New Town Plaza also houses many new restaurants, most of them Cantonese and catering to families, with dim sum, roast duck and all manner of stir-fried dishes. One, the North Park, becomes a nightclub after dark. A Malaysian restaurant offers beef and chicken satays in hot peanut sauces and hot curried rice noodles; a Korean barbecue has grilled beef and lamb and that spicy cabbage salad called kimchee. The most recent manifestation of Shatin's explosive growth is the Hotel Riverside Plaza, not yet two years old. On its 17 floors are 830 rooms and suites, some facing the Shing Mun River, others the hills and temples of the town. The hotel is built around a four-story atrium that contains a 60-foot-long pool with a sunken bar. Among several restaurants in the Riverside Plaza is the Botania, where the menu selections range from Cantonese fried rice to duck pate with green peppercorns, from oxtail soup to open-faced Scandinavian sandwiches of salmon and cheeses. The Regal Seafood Restaurant offers a variety of hot pots, there is a Japanese restaurant and coffee shops like the Boulevard, serving pizza and hamburgers as well as roast pork and Chinese vegetables. It is a place from which to contemplate Shatin. One evening my wife and I took the train from Kowloon to Shatin, walked to the Riverside Plaza, had dinner in the Botania and a late drink near the pool deck. I recall looking out at the hills, many of them now covered with lights, and wondering about 1997. GUIDE FOR AN EXCURSION TO AN EXPANDING NEW TOWN Getting There By car, Shatin is about a half-hour's drive from Kowloon. The distance is less than 10 miles but the trip takes so long because traffic through the Lion Rock Tunnel is generally heavy. It is more convenient and less arduous to take the train. There are several daily trains between Kowloon Station and Shatin. A one-way ticket is about 50 cents. Buses also go to Shatin, from Causeway Bay on Hong Kong Island. The No. 170 leaves from the front of the Daimaru department store, and the fare is 50 cents. From Kowloon the No. 70 runs from the Jordan Road Terminal; fare: 45 cents. There are no charges at the temples in and around Shatin, although an offering box is placed at entrances and near altars. Bus Tour For a look at Shatin that is combined with a visit to other parts of Hong Kong's developing New Territories, visitors can take a Hong Kong Tourist Association bus tour entitled ''The Land Between.'' It departs every weekday from the pier opposite City Hall on Hong Kong Island; in front of the Holiday Inn Golden Mile Hotel on Nathan Road, Kowloon, and the Holiday Inn Harbor View Hotel, East Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon. The six-hour trip, which includes lunch, costs $23 or $18 for children. The Hong Kong Tourist Association (5-244191) can supply further details. General information is also available from the association's office at 548 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10036; 212-869-5008. Meals and Hotel Meals in the restaurants scattered about the Shatin Inter-City complex and New Town Plaza generally run about $10 to $15 a person. Eating such exotica as bird's nest, shark fins or fine pigeon dishes could add $5 to $10 to the bill. A meal in the Botania in the Hotel Riverside Plaza will be about $20 a person. Room rates at the hotel range from $70 for a standard room to $200 for a deluxe suite. All rooms have color TV and minibars. F. F.

212-> New Shakespearean Era For Connecticut Theater
For more than 25 years, the American Shakespeare Theater flourished here, bringing stars like Katharine Hepburn and James Earl Jones, nurturing the dreams of young, as yet unknown actors and transforming the lives of some of the residents of this Fairfield County town. ''Oh, I was just so excited when I heard the theater was coming to town - Shakespeare!'' recalled Edythe Simons, serving up homemade corn muffins in her kitchen Wednesday afternoon on blue plates engraved with scenes from the Bard's hometown, Stratford-on-Avon. The theater, however, suffered from poor financial management and went bankrupt in 1982; there hasn't been a full summer Shakespeare season here since. But now Ms. Simons and others are rejoicing over the news that the theater, which was taken over by the state four years ago, will reopen in some capacity next summer. The academy, which trained actors in Shakespearean drama, will also eventually reopen, under the auspices of the Yale Drama School. It won't be the theater Ms. Simons remembers, one directed by philanthropists with more of a love for Shakespeare than a flair for business management. It has a new board of directors headed by an International Business Machines vice president. It will be affiliated with the University of Connecticut. The search is on for a new artistic director. The state will finance a $7.2 million renovation of the faded gray teakwood building - similar in its octagonal shape to the original Globe Theater - set on 11.4 grassy acres beside the Housatonic River, where theatergoers once had picnic dinners. The most striking changes of all are the theater's new name - the American Heritage Theater - and direction. The repertory will be expanded to include music and dance and the works of Connecticut's own playwright, Eugene O'Neill, as well as those of William Shakespeare. ''You can't live on Shakespeare alone,'' said one member of the board of directors, Joseph M. Stavola, who is director of Stratford's Department of Community and Economic Development. ''It has to be diversified.'' Actor-Resident Relations Mr. Stavola estimated that the Shakespeare Theater brought an $1.5 million in annual tourist revenues to this bedroom community of 50,000. And while the Shakespeare Theater as it once was may be gone forever, Stratford still has Shakespeare Pizza, Shakespeare Auto, the Shakespeare Travel Center and the Shakespeare Arms. Still, the town never fully embraced the theater that was founded by the philanthropist Lawrence Langner, inspired by his visit to Stratford-on-Avon. ''I'll never forget the resentment that actors were coming to town,'' recalled Ms. Simons, 79, who lives with a cat named Julius in a house filled with the works of Shakespeare, and who befriended Will Geer, Nancy Marchand, Morris Carnovsky and many of the other actors at the theater in her role as its accommodations director. ''They were running around in shorts and sneakers in staid, conservative Stratford,'' she continued. ''Severn Darden would zoom around town on his bicycle, with his cape on. Morris Carnovsky walked around barefooted on the main street.'' As accommodations director, Ms. Simons often placed actors in the homes of local residents for the summer. ''I had to assure them they were normal,'' she said. 'Bumpkins and Hicks' Mr. Stavola has his own memory of the relationship between the theater and the townspeople. ''The people who came to start the theater were from New York,'' he said. ''They thought the people of the town were a bunch of country bumpkins and hicks. I don't think a ticket was ever sold in the town of Stratford.'' Ms. Simons's godson, Michael Koskoff, was 13, growing up in a town with one movie theater and a beach, when Shakespeare came to town. He signed on as a ticket taker and became a devoted groupie. ''I still know every line of Julius Caesar,'' he said. ''I saw it 15 or 20 times. Raymond Massey was Brutus. Jack Palance was Cassius.'' One of Mr. Koskoff's most vivid remembrances of childhood is being ordered out of the theater by Katharine Hepburn before a performance of Twelfth Night. ''She said: 'Get that boy out of here! He's going to sabotage the show!' '' he recalled, taking a walk Wednesday on the theater grounds with Ms. Simons. ''I left - on command.'' At age 19, Mr. Koskoff enrolled in the Shakespeare Academy. ''We had to audition to get in,'' he said. ''And after that they did nothing but discourage you.'' He did not become an actor. Instead, following in his father's footsteps, he became a prominent trial attorney. He is 46. ''I still think about becoming an actor on certain days,'' he said.

214-> 4 Former and Suspended Officers Are Accused in 2d Stun Gun Trial
Two former New York City police officers and two suspended officers went on trial last week in the latest case stemming from accusations that suspects were tortured with an electronic stun gun at a Queens station house. The accusations, in 1985, led to a Police Department shake-up in which five top commanders were all forced to retire. Five former or suspended officers were charged with assault and other crimes against several prisoners who were accused of selling small amounts of marijuana or committing other minor crimes. The current trial, in which jury selection is to continue tomorrow in State Supreme Court in Queens, is the second of four scheduled trials. The first, in 1986, ended with the convictions of a former sergeant and a former officer on assault and coercion charges for their use of the stun gun - a hand-held, battery-powered device that can deliver a jolt of up to 40,000 volts -against a teen-age drug suspect. The two convicted men, former Sgt. Richard Pike and former Officer Jeffrey Gilbert, are serving two-to-six-year prison sentences. Mr. Pike and Mr. Gilbert are also among the four defendants in the current trial. In this trial, Mr. Pike is accused of having used the stun gun on another drug suspect, Everton Evelyn, a 34-year-old car-service driver. Mr. Gilbert and the two other defendants, Lieut. Steven Cheswick and Officer Loren MacCary, are accused of having beaten or aided in the beating of Mr. Evelyn with fists and a stick. Suspended Without Pay Lieutenant Cheswick and Officer MacCary have been suspended without pay since their 1985 indictments. Lieutenant Cheswick was the integrity control officer for the 106th Precinct station house in Ozone Park, where the accused officers worked. His assignment was to insure that police officers did not engage in wrongdoing. Lieutenant Cheswick is not accused of abetting the reported use of the stun gun on Mr. Evelyn, which prosecutors say took place at the station house. Rather, he is accused of having abetted the beating of Mr. Evelyn, during the suspect's arrest at his home in South Ozone Park, by blocking the view of Mr. Evelyn's wife as her husband was being hit with a stick by Mr. Pike. All four defendants have pleaded not guilty. People familiar with the case, however, said during negotiations between prosecutors and defense lawyers last week to end the case without a trial, Mr. Pike, 43, and Mr. Gilbert, 36, had indicated they were willing to plead guilty to at least one of the charges against them, in return for sentences that would run concurrently with the ones they are already serving, meaning they would get no additional prison time. Refusing a Deal But the deal fell through, people close to the case said, when the office of the Queens District Attorney, John J. Santucci, insisted that, as part of the deal, Mr. MacCary plead guilty to a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in prison. He reportedly refused, insisting on his innocence. Mr. MacCary, 37, is accused of hitting Mr. Evelyn at the station house and of ''acting in concert'' in the reported beating of him at his home. Under the reported deal, charges against Mr. Cheswick, 47, would have been dismissed. Conviction on the most serious charge against the four defendants, second-degree assault, is punishable by up to seven years in prison.

215-> Paraguay Cancels a Civic Meeting With Pope
As Pope John Paul II continued a tour of South America today, the Paraguayan Government canceled a planned meeting between the Pope and civic leaders next week. The papal entourage learned today that the Paraguayan leader, Gen. Alfredo Stroessner, had canceled the meeting between John Paul and the Builders of Society, a group sponsored by the Roman Catholic Church that includes many intellectuals and politicians who have often opposed General Stroessner's policies. The meeting was scheduled to take place Tuesday, during the Pope's three-day visit to Paraguay. Asked about the Paraguayan announcement, the Vatican spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, said here, ''I have nothing to say for now.'' He indicated that the Vatican might issue a response later in the Pope's trip. From Paraguay, Reuters reported that Msgr. Jorge Livieres Banks, secretary general of the Paraguayan Bishops Conference, said, ''We will go ahead with the programming of this meeting because we see no reason to suspend it, and that is what we will tell the papal representative.'' No government had previously canceled a papal event after the schedule for a visit had been agreed upon with local bishops and the Vatican. A statement published today by the pro-Government Asuncion newspaper Patria said the meeting was ''suspended'' for security reasons and to prevent the papal visit from being ''exploited.'' In Bolivia today, at an emotional meeting with with impoverished peasants and miners, the Pope delivered a sharp attack on free market capitalism, blaming it for the nation's economic ruin. The success of capitalism in some countries, he said, does not excuse the fact that a system driven by the profit motive allows men's lives to be ruined by the laws of the market. The Pope chose to issue one of his strongest critiques of capitalism's failings in Oruro, a once-booming tin-mining center that is now as desolate as the high mountain plains that surround it. He spoke after hearing sad, angry men describe lives of hardship. 'Cries of the Children' In a voice that broke with sorrow, Victor Lopez Arias, a mine union leader, said, ''Today you have not been able to hear the calling of our sirens because our tunnels are empty, and in our mining camps you can only hear the cries of the children because they cannot put a piece of bread in their mouths.'' As many as 30,000 Bolivian miners are out of work as a result of the Government austerity program introduced in 1985 to deal with falling tin prices, skyrocketing inflation and a loss of credit with international banks. Addressing the crowd of about 100,000 miners, peasants and workers gathered on a dusty field outside Oruro, the Pope said: ''Certainly, one cannot deny the good results achieved by the joint efforts of private and public initiative in those countries where a regime of liberty rules. Those achievements, nonetheless, cannot serve as a pretext to get around the defects of an economic system whose principal motive is profit, where man is subordinated to capital, converting him into a piece in an immense productive machine, leaving his work reduced to simple merchandise at the mercy of the comings and goings of the law of supply and demand.'' Later today in Cochabamba, the Pope touched on two other subjects of controversy in Bolivia. Addressing a youth rally, he warned against forms of seduction ranging from alcohol abuse to ''the temptation of easy enrichment by way of drug trafficking.'' It was the first time he has publicly mentioned the drug issue since arriving in Bolivia, a nation that is one of the world's top producers of cocaine. Speaking to a gathering of priests, John Paul repeatedly stressed the need for a greater number of native priests. Foreign-born priests make up more than 75 percent of the clergy in Bolivia. The Pope did not mention protests directed at him by priests in La Paz demanding the appointment of more Bolivian-born bishops.

218-> SPORTS WORLD SPECIALS; Hockey in Harlem
He may have cut quite a figure in his 40-goal days with the Rangers, and there may be some neighborhoods where his name is a household word, but as Pat Hickey found out a while back, Harlem isn't one of them. When Hickey, sporting his Ranger blues, introduced himself to a group of neighborhood youngsters, their reaction amounted to ''Who's this dude, anyway?'' When Hickey told them he was going to teach them to play hockey, the response was on the order of ''What's hockey?'' ''They didn't recognize me as a hockey player and they didn't know anything about the sport,'' he said the other day after spending six quixotic weeks trying to teach hockey to 50 puzzled youngsters between the ages of 9 and 12. In Harlem, he soon learned, hockey is definitely an alien sport. The program, which was organized by Dave Wilk, a Seagrams budget manager, was designed to teach Harlem youngsters an alternate sport. Hockey, it seems, is about as alternate as a sport gets in Harlem. ''There aren't any kids from Harlem playing in the National Hockey League,'' Wilk explained. ''There are no Spanish kids and practically no black guys in the league. It's a white sport and there are no Dr. J's bringing hockey to Harlem.'' Using equipment and ice time donated by several corporations, Wilk and the 34-year-old Hickey, who has been a Case Research vice president since ending his career with the St. Louis Blues in 1985, started the youngsters on the film strip ''Peter Puck,'' which has taught a generation of Canadian pros the rudiments of the game. The youngsters liked Peter Puck but didn't seem at all impressed that Hickey had learned the game from the same series. Hickey, seeking a connection with basketball, stressed that hockey, too, has one-on-ones and two-on-ones. ''The only difference is that you have to do it on ice,'' he said. The youngsters, discovering another difference, were baffled by the skates with their 20 pairs of eyelets. ''They tried to lace their skates the way they lace their basketball sneakers and it didn't work,'' Hickey said. Just when it appeared that the teaching effort might be in vain, Hickey led the class onto the ice at the Lasker rink in Central Park and the youngsters got a glimpse of the smooth-skating style Ranger fans had cheered. Suddenly a star was reborn. When the youngsters were asked what they had learned from Hickey, the consensus answer was, ''I want to play in the N.H.L.'' ''I want to make it. I really want to be a hockey star.'' Just like Dr. H.

219-> Temple Pounds Georgetown; Richmond Gains
There was a sharp edge to the game, a discomfort factor that made it feel as if the fans were sitting on tacks or a siren was screaming in the background the whole time. It was attributable to Georgetown's disconcerting, high-energy style, the tenacious defense played by both teams and the booming voices that the Hoyas' coach, John Thompson, and his Temple counterpart, John Chaney, exercise with regularity. So after all the high-scoring, run-and-shoot basketball games that have been played thus far in the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament, Temple, the No. 1 team in the country, beat Georgetown the old-fashioned way today, being selective on offense, playing defense as if guarding the crown jewels. It wasn't pretty, but defensive games rarely are. And it did not help that the poor-shooting Georgetown team was even more inept than usual, making only 30 percent of its field-goal attempts. Things got so bad that at one point during the second half Thompson walked his team through a play while the game was in progress. More than once, he critiqued his players in public. ''Against a team as great as Temple,'' he said, ''you can stretch the rubber band only so far.'' Today, Georgetown snapped it as the Owls coasted to a 74-53 victory, advancing past the second round for the first time in five years. They advanced to the East Regional semifinals, where they will play Richmond (26-6) on Thursday night at the Meadowlands in East Rutherford, N.J. A Trip Back Home For Dick Tarrant, the Richmond coach who playfully likes to call his home state ''Joisey,'' it will be the trip of his coaching lifetime. His Spiders, the champions of the lightly regarded Colonial Athletic Association, defeated Georgia Tech in the second game, 59-55, showing the kind of discipline at both ends of the court that will remind Temple of itself when the Owls watch the tapes. ''Maybe we're a distant cousin of Temple,'' Tarrant said. ''We peck away, gut it out, like Temple on a lesser scale.'' The Owls, now 31-1, may not have looked like a dominating team against Georgetown, but few teams look good against the Hoyas. What should be remembered is that even in this so-so season - by Thompson's standards - Georgetown was 20-10 and had not been beaten by more than 7 points until today. The Hoyas stayed in most games on the strength of their defense, which forces numerous turnovers. Temple did not unravel like some teams did against the Hoyas. The Owls had 16 turnovers, their highest total of the season, but their defense prevented Georgetown from turning those into fast-break layups. Some Shaky Moments There were some shaky moments in the first half, though, when Temple appeared on the verge of losing its composure. Mark Macon, the freshman sensation, made only 2 of his 7 shots, and appeared to be rushing them. Chaney drew a technical foul with 4 minutes 54 seconds to play in the half, protesting what he thought were lane violations committed by the Hoyas on his team's free-throw opportunities. During a television timeout that lasted 1 minute 45 seconds, Chaney stood at courtside, staring at the referee, John Clougherty. He did not so much as bat an eye as his assistants talked to the team. ''It was my one-eyed Jack stare,'' he said later. ''I learned it from my mother. I expect a letter of apology, an anonymous phone call, something from that official.'' Chaney's stare might have been more of a distraction to his team than a rallying point. With 1:55 left in the half, Mike Vreeswyk, the junior forward, committed a foul and was also charged with a technical. At halftime, Temple's lead was only 30-26. ''Maybe we were a little nervous,'' said Ramon Rivas, the Owls' 6-foot-10-inch, 260-pound immovable man at center. ''Georgetown has a reputation and we didn't want this to be our last game.'' ''I wanted to beat John, believe me I did,'' Thompson said, ''but I think this is his run at it. He's got a great team, a beautiful team to watch.'' Temple does not have a lot of depth but it does not need it if it can control the pace of a game. Rivas sealed off the middle, almost singlehandedly, making it difficult for the Hoyas, especially Ron Highsmith, the center, to rebound aggressively. ''The only body Ronnie saw as wide as that all year was mine,'' Thompson said. Inside and Outside While Rivas and Tim Perry, the forward, were strong-arming inside, Vreeswyk and a rejuvenated Macon were doing the damage from the perimeter. Georgetown had 16 more fouls than Temple, which put the Owls on the free-throw line much of the last seven minutes of the game. Macon, whose two jumpers helped open a 42-32 lead with 12:44 to play, converted 10 free throws as he finished with 21 points. Afterward, Chaney disputed the notion that there is a great deal of pressure on his team. ''This is an exciting time,'' he said. ''We're successful, now we want to be lucky. Every time you jump over a fence, there's another fence. In athletics, that's the way it should be.'' Richmond 59 Georgia Tech 55 Tarrant called the victory a matter of winning the battle of tempo. The Spiders were able to slow Georgia Tech (22-10) to a walk. They also outplayed Tech's more heralded front line, gaining a 44-37 edge in rebounds. Peter Woolfolk, the burly 6-5, 230-pound forward, scored 27 points, almost half Richmond's total. ''It's more of an inspiration playing against guys who are from the elite conferences and were high school all-Americas,'' he said. ''This is a great opportunity for us and we're not going to back off against anybody.''

221-> SOUTHEAST REGIONAL; Villanova Turns to a Veteran
Mark Plansky, the only holdover from Villanova's 1985 national championship team, sank two free throws with 4 seconds to play today as Villanova defeated Illinois, 66-63, in a second-round game of the Southeast Regional. Plansky's free throws and Rodney Taylor's steal of the inbound pass completed a comeback from a 14-point second-half deficit. Villanova advanced to the regional semifinals on Thursday at Birmingham, Ala., and will play Kentucky, which beat Maryland, 90-81, today. The Wildcats (23-12) took advantage of Illinois' inability to hit free throws in the final 1 minute 41 seconds to complete the comeback. Plansky, who scored 10 of Villanova's final 18 points, hit his second consecutive 3-pointer to pull Villanova to 60-56 with 1:41 to play. Illinois then missed four of five free throws while Kenny Wilson and Pat Enright hit 3-pointers to put the Wildcats ahead for the first time in the second half, 62-61, with 30 seconds remaining. Ken Battle of Illinois (23-10) hit a short field goal and was fouled with 14 seconds left. But he missed the free throw, setting up Plansky's heroics. The senior forward faked a shot from the left side and drew a foul with 4 seconds left. Plansky hit both shots for a 64-63 lead. Taylor stole the inbound pass and was fouled, setting up his two free throws with one second left for the final margin. Plansky said he went to the foul line thinking about his brief appearance in the 1985 title victory over Georgetown, when he missed a free throw before sitting down again. ''I said, 'No way I'm going to start and end my career the same way,' '' Plansky said. ''I was really confident.'' Kentucky 90 Maryland 81 Rex Chapman snapped out of an early shooting slump with 20 second-half points, leading Kentucky past Maryland. Chapman was 1 of 6 from the field and 1 of 6 from the foul line in the first half. But he scored 10 points in an 18-10 run at the start of the second half to put Kentucky (27-5) in control, and hit 8 of 12 from the floor after the intermission to finish with 23 points. Maryland (18-13) had a chance to take a late lead after a 3-point shot by Keith Gatlin tied the score with 3 minutes 6 seconds to play. But a basket by Winston Bennett and a turnaround jumper in the lane by Chapman built a 4-point cushion that held. Ed Davender sank six consecutive free throws in the final minute to clinch the victory and finish with 23 points. Bennett added 17, Eric Manuel had 13 and Rob Lock scored 10. Kentucky took a 9-point lead midway through the first half. With its playmaker, Rudy Archer, benched with three fouls, Maryland turned to Brian Williams's inside strength in the final eight and a half minutesto cut the Kentucky lead to 42-41 at the half. The 6-10 freshman center scored 6 consecutive points, including a pair of dunks, to highlight the comeback. Williams, who scored 14 of his 20 points in the first half, put Maryland ahead with a dunk to start the second half. But Lock and Chapman teamed on the 18-8 spurt that put the Wildcats ahead, 60-51, with 13 minutes to play. Lock had four of the points and Chapman 10, including a pair of 3-pointers. Maryland whittled the lead to 2 points with 6:48 to play, but Chapman hit a 4-point play - a 3-point shot and a free throw - and a short jumper in the lane to blunt the Terrapins. Gatlin finished with 18 points for Maryland and Archer had 14. Davender tried to console Chapman after his poor shooting in the first half. ''He said, 'Forget about it, that's history,' '' Chapman said. ''And that's what I did.'' His second basket after the half was a 3-pointer that got him going.

222-> Soviet Nationalities Seeking More Autonomy; Islamic Revival a Fact
To the Editor: Your Feb. 12 front-page article on Islam in Central Asia paints a contradictory and often misleading picture. The Soviet officials who say that real faith no longer exists in Central Asia and that education and city life have eroded traditional beliefs are clearly mendacious survivals of a pre-glasnost past. At a recent seminar for journalists of Central Asia informing them about the situation of Islam in the region as it should be portrayed in Mikhail S. Gorbachev's age of openness, authorities on Islam from Central Asia and Moscow said that as much as 98 percent of the indigenous population in some areas of Central Asia were believers. They indicated, moreover, that Islam was almost as vital a force in the cities as in the countryside and that the ''new type of believer was a literate person, well versed in religious dogma'' and consequently a distinct challenge for the party's antireligious agitators. As to your statement that Central Asian youth seem to prefer video parlors and discotheques over the mosque, I refer you to the proceedings of the recent Komsomol plenum in Tadzhikistan, reported last Dec. 18 in Kommunist Tadzhikistana. In these proceedings, M. S. Asimov, president of Tadzhikistan's Academy of Sciences, stated that as a result of the resurgence of Islam in the republic ''we are faced with a struggle for the younger generation,'' a struggle for the hearts and minds of youth. If Islam's hold on the Tadzhik populace were as tenuous as indicated by the officials you quote, it would be difficult to understand how it could constitute fertile soil for subversive Islamic ideas propagated in Tadzhikistan by inimical foreign ideological centers (likely affiliated with the Afghan mujahadeen and Iran) as indicated by Tadzhikistan's K.G.B. chief and quoted by you. Finally, if no real religious faith exists among Central Asia's Moslems, how can one explain the existence in the area of militant Islam? You consistently refer to the Islamic resurgence in the Soviet Union as a future possibility. The preaching of a holy war against Soviet power, plus agitation for an Islamic state and against the war in Afghanistan, however, reveal that it is a present reality. As M. S. Asimov of the Tadzhik Academy of Sciences said in the speech reported last Dec. 18, ''the revival of Islam'' - in Central Asia -''today is a fact that cannot be denied.'' ALLEN HETMANEK Bethesda, Md., Feb. 17, 1988 The writer, who retired as a Library of Congress Soviet specialist, writes on Soviet Moslem nationalities.

223-> Military Judge to Inquire Into Bribery Allegations
The United States Court of Military Appeals today appointed one of its judges as a special master to investigate allegations of bribery against a lower military court in the case of a Navy surgeon, Comdr. Donal M. Billig. An anonymous informer charged in telephone calls to the Defense Department that bribery might have influenced the Navy-Marine Corps Court of Military Review in its decision to overturn a homicide conviction of Commander Billig. The Inspector General's office of the Defense Department had attempted to investigate the allegations but was rebuffed by the court that was the target of the allegations, pending resolution of questions on who had the authority to investigate. The Court of Military Appeals, the highest military court, issued an order appointing an associate judge, Walter T. Cox 3d, both to conduct an investigation of the allegations if he finds ''good cause'' to do so and to decide what matters in the case the Inspector General's office could pursue. Conviction Overturned Dr. Billig was convicted in 1986 of involuntary manslaughter and negligent homicide in the deaths of three patients. At the trial, there were charges that he performed heart surgery beyond his technical competence and when his sight was failing. Three months ago, the Navy-Marine Corps Court of Military Review overturned that conviction and said Dr. Billig had been the victim of a ''smear campaign'' by Navy prosecutors. Allegations that the review court was influenced by bribery were made in repeated telephone calls to the Inspector General's office by a person whose identity is unknown but who is believed by Defense Department lawyers to be a civilian employee of the department with significant knowledge of the case. The top military court said expressed concern today ''that we not react too quickly and too broadly to the allegations of judicial misconduct without a factual basis for so acting: Heretofore, we have been furnished no information or evidence which gives us a clue as to how or where to begin an investigation or what or whom to investigate.'' Consequently, the court said, the special master should at first ''function in the capacity of protecting the court, its members, and the staff from unlawful intrusion into the deliberative processes.'' The order today from the top military court required that any interviews with the accused court by the inspector general on this issue be approved by the special master. The order left the Inspector General free to intervie people not serving with the court.

224-> Tax-Exempt in New York: $4.3 Billion
Property-tax exemptions totaling $4.3 billion were granted to more than a million New Yorkers in 1986, according to a state report issued this week. In two volumes of statistics, the Board of Equalization and Assessment said that 31 percent of all the real property value in the state was free from taxes under 180 different kinds of exemptions. Exemptions, the board said, do not reduce tax levies by county, cities, villages or school boards but shift the burden to the remaining taxpayers. The report covered 1986, but the board said the exemptions, mostly mandated by state law, remained in effect. 'Tax Shift' ''Right now, New York is raising $15 billion in property taxes from 4.7 million parcels of land, which comes out to be $3,200 on the average,'' said David Gaskell, executive director of the board. ''If we didn't have exemptions, individual parcel owners would be paying several hundred dollars a year less.'' He said the board was not criticizing tax exemptions but pointing out that ''tax exemptions mean a tax shift that is not inconsequential.'' Most of New York's exemptions are intended to help the public directly, such as personal subsidies for the aged or for veterans, or indirectly through government and private charitable organizations. The other exemptions are intended to promote businesses. ''While there are relatively few types of economic benefit exemptions, they generally apply to high-value property and thus can have enormous impact on the tax base,'' the report stated. Rise in Total Value Among the other exemptions are properties owned by school districts, government, cemeteries, religious organizations, volunteer fire companies, hospitals, nonprofit organizations, public authorities, foreign governments and in some places sports arenas, waterworks, fallout shelters, public housing and opera houses. The board put the total value of real property in the state at $532 billion, up from $455 billion in 1985. In 1986, it said, the property value of the exemptions rose to a record high of $165.2 billion on 1,086,732 parcels, about 31 percent of the total value. The report showed that 926,000 privately owned parcels of property, mostly households, with a value of $32 billion, were partially tax exempt. But completely tax exempt were 94,000 publicly owned properties with a value of $103 billion and 51,000 privately owned properties with a value of $27 billion.

225-> Soviet Rehabilitates 20 Executed by Stalin
More than 20 people executed by Stalin have been posthumously reconfirmed as Communist Party members with unblemished records, the Tass news agency said today. Analysts said the decision marked the final stage of political rehabilitation for the group, all of whose court convictions were overturned in the 1950's under Stalin's successor, Khrushchev. The decision was taken at a meeting last month of the Communist Party Control Committee responsible for disciplinary matters. Tass said the group included the former planning chief, Nikolai Voznesensky, and a Central Committee secretary, Aleksandr Kuznetsov, both of whom were named by Stalin as possible successors before being implicated in the 1950 ''Leningrad Affair.'' The case involved more than 200 officials, many from Leningrad, accused by Stalin of attempting to set up a separate Communist Party. All were shot.

226-> Review/Art; A Look at Pei's Pyramid in the Louvre Courtyard
Parisians love novelty, and right now they are happy to climb a scaffold in penetrating cold and damp. Once at the top, they have a grandstand view of the pyramid that I. M. Pei was asked by President Francois Mitterrand to design for the three-sided western courtyard of the Louvre. The pyramid will function as the chief and central entrance to a great museum that has for too long subjected its numberless visitors to lengthy and confusing explorations that have not always led them in the end to what they wanted to see. It will also serve as the nerve center of a new subterranean Louvre, in which will be grouped a huge array of auxiliary services, ranging from conservation to security and from the provision of very good food to the pleasures of a comprehensive bookstore. Ever since it first got to be talked about, that pyramid has been almost everyone's most unfavorite architectural project. It was at best a mistake - so almost everyone said - and at worst a hatpin thrust through the very heart of Paris. This visitor has just had the run of it, inside and out. He can say without equivocation that as a structure the pyramid is anything but an eyesore. Traditionally, a pyramid presses down upon the earth with an air of fatality and finality. This one has, by contrast, an aerial delicacy. The glass is thin, the struts and supports look like the ankles of a gazelle, and the action of the light on and through the slanting panes of clear glass is never the same for two seconds together. Like a giant spider's web against the Parisian sky, this is a pyramid that stands free, transparent and seemingly almost weightless. It is a source of light, not of darkness, and when we step down below it we feel none of the gloom, the sense of diminished possibilities, that is common to both subway rider and speleologist. We go down, but we sense that at the end of this year we shall be borne up to a point of our own choosing in a great museum that will have been relieved of the auxiliary services and functions that now encumber almost every one of its rivals, worldwide. Whether we opt for the Renaissance, for Greek and Roman antiquities, for the great tradition of French painting or for sculpture and the decorative arts, we shall get to them, swiftly and without effort. Nor is it true that our stay below ground will be such as to dampen the spirits. With ceilings up to 80 feet in height and a total area of more than half a million square feet, that underground space will include all the elements in modern museology that are elsewhere a scene of multilingual confusion - the ticketing area, the shopping mall, the money changers, the post office, the restaurants, the information center, the auditorium and conference center and much else besides. Upstairs, what we most want to see - the art -will have no competition. Hardly any of those who protested had seen it, needless to say, but they carried on as if they were seasoned museum designers, accredited protectors of the national heritage and authorities on the notion, the nature and the nearly 5,000-year history of the pyramid. Until very recently, almost no one had been inside the Pei pyramid except Mr. Mitterrand himself, who wanted to walk through it while he was a president in office, as distinct from a presidential candidate or, as it may be, a former president. As the new ceremonial entrance to the Louvre, the pyramid will not be open for business until near the end of this year. Much work remains to be done below ground. At ground level, the landscaping is a long way short of completion. It would be quite wrong to prejudge the pyramid in terms of its efficacy. But it is not too soon to judge its effect upon the three-sided courtyard. That courtyard is not, as many people suppose, a masterpiece of French Renaissance architecture. It is a 19th-century pastiche, and it looks it. But it faces out through the Tuileries gardens and all the way up the gentle slope of the Champs-Elysees to the Arc de Triomphe and beyond. No position could be more privileged, and the Pei pyramid has been widely assumed to be a desecration of the courtyard. This critic has always held the minority view that the courtyard in question is anything but a masterpiece and could do with some help, from no matter how unexpected a quarter. And the curious thing is that it looks better from inside the Pei pyramid than from anywhere else. Those slanting panes of glass cut the pomposity and make light of the pretentiousness that have always made this - in external terms - the least impressive part of the great palace. This is, in fact, the least expected aspect of the new situation - that when the heavily ornamented courtyard gets up off its haunches and plays hide and seek with us, we look upon it with a new affection.

227-> Split Widens On Lilco Takeover
AS it enters what could be a decisive week, the Long Island Power Authority is badly divided, an agency split between four directors who want to move to assume control of the Long Island Lighting Company as soon as possible and others who hope to delay any takeover attempt. The split became clear and extremely public last week as Vincent Tese, the president of the State Urban Development Corporation and Governor Cuomo's chief representative to the state's talks with Lilco, took a strong stand against an immediate public takeover. At the same time, however, four other directors, nicknamed the Fearsome Foursome for their eagerness to move ahead and try to take over Lilco, wrote an ''appeal for action'' to Governor Cuomo. In their letter, the four directors, Irving Like, Leon Campo, Nora Bredes and Stephen Liss, said: ''We have carefully considered the alternatives and believe that the LIPA's best course is to proceed immediately with a decision to take over Lilco at the offering price recommended by our consultants.'' In the middle, officials said, is Richard M. Kessel, the director of the State Consumer Protection Board, who owes much of his political base on Long Island to his long opposition to Lilco. Mr. Kessel, acknowledging that he is under intense pressure, declined last week to say which way he was leaning. ''I don't think it would be appropriate for me to comment on what my position is vis-a-vis a takeover,'' he said. ''But I certainly share the concerns of anyone who doesn't want to see a bailout of Lilco, whether through a negotiated settlement or a takeover.'' But even if Mr. Kessel decides to vote for a takeover, financial analysts have suggested that a divided Power Authority would not be successful in attempting to raise the enormous amount, $9 billion by some estimates, necessary to win control of the utility. One possibility being discussed last week as the board prepared for a vote, possibly as early as Tuesday, was that Mr. Kessel would be freed by Governor Cuomo to vote his conscience, thus giving the board the necessary five votes to move ahead. But with Mr. Tese, the former State Director of Banking, and John Adam Kanas, the president of the North Fork Bank & Trust Company, voting against a takeover, any move against the company is not likely to suceed, financial analysts said. Left standing in the resulting debris would be a weakened Lilco, one that publicly stated that continued uncertainty over its future is one of the the worst things that could happen to it. From his comments last week, that apparently is the strategy Mr. Tese embraces. ''There are a lot of things you can get by waiting,'' Mr. Tese said. ''Sometimes the best strategy in the world, when things are going against your opponent, is to sit back and wait.'' Mr. Tese made his comments among indications that negotiations between the state and Lilco had all but stopped. ''We're still talking,'' Mr. Tese said, ''but it is going to take a long time. ''I'm not sure it is our best interest to consummate a deal right now on a negotiated settlement,'' he said, ''just like I'm not sure it is in our best interest to take them over right now.'' In their letter to Governor Cuomo, however, the four trustees who support a takeover said they share ''the sentiments of those LIPA board members who find repugnant any offer to pay Lilco's shareholders the market price, or more, for their stock.'' But they listed a number of reasons why, they said, the board ''must move without further delay to take over Lilco.'' Included in those reasons are, they said, significant future savings for electric customers on Long Island. Also, they argued that a public takeover of Lilco would be the only way to guarantee the permanent abandonment of the $5 billion Shoreham plant. ''So long as Lilco retains its corporate existence, there is a risk it may seek, or be compelled by the Federal or state government, to reactivate Shoreham, or undertake a nuclear power project elsewhere on Long Island,'' according to a statement sent to Governor Cuomo with the letter. Mr. Tese said he recognized that delaying a takeover could give Lilco the chance to license Shoreham, which was completed in 1983 but has yet to receive a commercial operating license because of the unwillingness of the state and Lilco to participate in an evacuation plan for the plant. ''In a way this is a chess game,'' Mr. Tese said. ''You have to weigh the probabilities and the possibilities and the costs associated with those probabilities and possibilities.'' ''When you look at the costs, they are enormous,'' he said. ''The bottom line is that you are paying $9 billion for assets that are worth $3 or $4 billion.'' ''Nobody, to a man, nobody wants Shoreham to open,'' Mr. Tese said. ''But some people would like to get even with Lilco. Other people are worried about closing Shoreham, but at the same time not impairing the ratepayers into the future.''

231-> Funds of Pastor Charged in Rape Are Studied
A Harlem minister charged Sunday with raping two teen-age members of his Pentecostal church has been the target of an investigation into his finances and style of living, law-enforcement officials said yesterday. Major elements of the investigation, conducted by the Manhattan District Attorney for the last two months, are allegations that the minister, the Rev. Thomas Streitferdt, maintained a $1.4 million waterfront estate in Old Field, L.I., and property in St. Croix and Mexico financed by contributions illegally coerced from his 700-member congregation, said the officials, who declined to be identified. The church, the True Church of God, is at Third Avenue and 127th Street. It is not affiliated with any established Pentecostal denomination. Marvin Jay Berkeley, a lawyer for the minister, said the rape charges against him were not true. 'Deeply Religious' ''He is an honorable, deeply religious man who tries his best to try to help people,'' Mr. Berkeley said. He declined to comment on Mr. Streitferdt's finances, and he said the minister was unavailable for an interview. According to the law-enforcement officials, Mr. Streitferdt's finances have been under investigation for more than two months, well before his arrest Sunday on charges of rape and sodomy. They said the investigation had shown that Mr. Streitferdt listed his 1987 income at only several thousand dollars. However, they said his income did not include the contributions and various payments that church members were required to make. The officials said Mr. Streitferdt maintained the church-owned Long Island estate for his family, including his wife, a son who is an assistant pastor, and a daughter. According to the officials, the family has the exclusive use of three church-owned Mercedes-Benz automobiles. The officials said the 700 adult members of the church were required to contribute 10 percent of their annual income, a portion that increased to 30 percent every third year, as a condition for remaining in the church. Growth in Membership According to the officials, such contributions, called tithes, are not illegal, so long as they are given voluntarily. The officials declined to specify the illegal coercion of which they accused him. The 59-year-old minister, who is white, also controls the finances of many members, most of whom are black, by keeping their savings at a bank he set up through his church, the officials said. Mr. Streitferdt became pastor of the church in 1964 when it had 200 adult members. Having grown to 700, it includes a school with classes from kindergarten to the 11th grade. The church building, a modern brick and stucco structure near the Triborough Bridge, was dedicated in June 1975, according to a cornerstone. The glass doors, which reveal a modern interior decorated with red carpeting and stonework, were locked yesterday afternoon and posted with no-trespassing signs. A church employee who came out of a side door said that Mr. Streitferdt, whose name is emblazoned on the north side of church in 2 1/2-foot letters, was not in the building and that no church officials would comment on his case. But the employee said the minister would conduct services as usual on Sunday at 9:30 A.M. The services will be open to the public, the employee said. Not Regulated by State The law-enforcement officials said church members with children in the school were required to pay $600 a year in tuition for each child. The school is not regulated by the state because it does not go through the 12th grade and does not offer a diploma. Anyone not buried under church auspices at Rose Hill Cemetery in Linden, N.J., at an additional fee, were told they ''would not go to heaven,'' the officials said. The rape and sodomy charges were expected to be presented to a grand jury tomorrow by the Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau. However, law-enforcement officials said the grand jury action would be delayed to give investigators more time to look into Mr. Streitferdt's finances. At his arraignment Monday in Criminal Court in Manhattan, Mr. Streitferdt was released on $25,000 bail. According to the criminal complaint filed by the two girls, whom the police refused to identify, one was sexually attacked by Mr. Streitferdt in December 1986 and the other in January 1987. There was no explanation why the girls, 14 and 16 years old, had waited more than a year to file a criminal complaint.

232-> NBC Wins In Ratings For Season
NBC won the ratings competition for the third straight season by a bigger margin than ever, and it is already looking to next season, when a writers' strike could keep its rivals in reruns while it covers the Olympics. NBC topped off the season by winning the final week, even though the 60th annual Academy Awards on ABC was the week's highest rated show, according to figures by the A. C. Nielsen Company. For the last week of the season, NBC had an average rating of 13.9, followed closely by ABC with a 13.5 rating and followed by CBS in third place with 11.8. The rating is a percentage of the nation's 88.6 million homes with television. If the six-week-old writers' strike is not settled soon, network executives warn, there won't be scripts for most of the new season's shows. The strike apparently poses the least problem for NBC, which successfully bid $300 million to cover the traditionally high-rated Olympics this summer. That may turn out to be a better investment than NBC imagined. Nielsen ratings for the 1987-88 season showed the average audience for the three networks down 9 percent from last year. CBS, which finished third for the season for the first time in the network's history, has estimated that the lower people-meter figures will cost the networks a combined $50 million in advertising revenues. NBC's average prime-time rating for the season was 16.0. ABC, which had been third in the ratings for three years, eked out second place with a 13.7 rating, thanks largely to the network's coverage of the World Series, the Super Bowl and the Winter Olympics. CBS was third for the first time with a 13.5 rating. These were the Nielson ratings for the top regularly scheduled prime-time television shows for the 1987-88 season: Millions of Program Net.

233-> NATO Talks Shift to Brussels As Danes Call Vote on A-Arms
The Danish Government said today that NATO nuclear planning talks scheduled for next week would be switched from Denmark to Brussels because Denmark has called an early election over the question of allowing nuclear weapons in its ports. The Danish Foreign Ministry said in a statement that NATO had decided to move the meeting. The Danish election was called after the minority Government was defeated in Parliament last week on an opposition resolution demanding that visiting warships be reminded not to carry nuclear weapons into Danish ports.

237-> What's Fresh, Crisp and Grilled?
WHEN it comes to grilling, vegetables often get shortchanged. All the attention goes to those juicy, sizzling steaks that send mouthwatering aromas into the soft summer air. If vegetables do make an appearance on the grill, they are usually stabbed through the heart with skewers, and included only to give color to a brochette. But there is no reason to confine vegetables to the kitchen stove. Grilled vegetables have a special taste, with a slight crunch and an edge of blackness that makes them earthier than their steamed or baked counterparts. Flavors become concentrated and vitamins are preserved because there is no cooking water to absorb them. There are hazards in grilling - plenty of them. Tiny okra, for example, fall through the grates. Squash placed on a fire that is too hot turn black in less than a minute, leaving guests with charred yet raw food. Timing is the most important part of cooking over a fire, and the way to control timing is to make sure the fire is not too hot. In ''Cooking With Fire and Smoke'' (Simon & Schuster, 1986), Phillip Stephen Schulz explains how to test a grill's temperature: First, place your palm over the coals at grid level. If you can hold your fingers steady for two seconds, the coals are hot enough to sear. If you can keep your hand there for three or four seconds, the coals are medium-hot: perfect for grilling. If you can keep your palm in place for five seconds, the coals are medium, and can be used for cooking that requires the grill to be covered. Since they cook quickly, most vegetables need not be covered, although they can be, and most should be grilled over coals that are medium-hot or cooler. Before cooking is begun, the flame should die down and bits of gray ash should appear on top of the charcoal. That usually takes about a half an hour. The suggested cooking times given in recipes should not be followed slavishly, because they will vary with the amount of coal, the kind of wood used and the quantity of food being cooked. Vegetables are properly cooked when they are slightly blackened outside and soft inside. They can be cooked on any kind of grill. However, several chefs known for their grilled food dislike gas grills, which have become more popular in the last few years. ''We are completely against gas grills,'' said Johanne Killeen, a partner in Al Forno and Lucky's, restaurants in Providence, R.I., that specialize in grilling. ''The taste of the food is very interesting when you first bite into it. But then the flavor becomes very tedious and boring.'' She uses hardwood charcoal made mostly from red oak and maple. Woods like hickory, she said, produce an aroma too strong for vegetables. Ms. Killeen also advised against using lighter fluid, saying that its taste can be detected in food. Grills should be very clean, she said, especially when cooking with vegetables. ''They receive flavors so easily,'' Ms. Killeen said. ''You don't want to taste what you grilled last week.'' Charcoal can be started with kindling and paper, an electric fire-starter or a chimney-type starter, which is a metal canister that holds the charcoal and paper. To imprint a cross-hatch pattern on vegetables, cook them in two stages on each side: first in one position, and then turned 45 or 90 degrees. To take advantage of the rich flavors of summer produce, preparation should be minimal. Most vegetables need not be marinated; merely brush them with oil before putting them on the fire. ''It's very simple and straightforward,'' said Jeff Kent, the sous-chef at Arizona 206 in New York, which has a popular dish that includes various grilled vegetables, served with goat cheese. Vegetables that are especially tasty when grilled include zucchini, summer squash, eggplant and peppers of all kinds. ''What people think of as Mediterranean vegetables work best,'' said Faye Levy, author of ''Fresh From France: Vegetable Creations,'' published last year by E. P. Dutton. ''Water doesn't agree with them. Dry heat just seems to make them taste better.'' Although Mrs. Levy said it was possible to grill vegetables like green beans, cauliflower and broccoli, she did not recommend it. ''They would just dry and shrivel up,'' she said. Restaurant chefs who do use those vegetables parboil them first. Cindy Pawlcyn, executive chef of Mustards Grill in Yountville, Calif., also parboils leeks, scallions and potatoes before grilling them. Her restaurant has a wood-burning oven, a wood-burning grill and a six-acre garden to supply the freshest produce. Tender vegetables like endive and radicchio can also be put on the grill. As for corn, there are different schools of thought. Some cooks pull out the silk from the cobs, soak the unshucked corn in cold water, and then bury the ears in coals that are red-hot but not flaming, cooking them for about 20 minutes. In ''Beinhorn's Mesquite Cookery'' (Texas Monthly Press, 1986), Courtenay Beinhorn suggests serving corn on the cob as some vendors do in Mexico: rubbed with lime, salt and hot peppers. Other chefs put corn directly on the grill without any preparation. Ms. Killeen, the Providence restaurateur, said the silk was easier to remove after cooking, which takes about 10 minutes on a covered fire. Some foods are transformed by grilling. Red bell peppers become sweet and smoky when cooked directly over flaming coals and whisked into a paper bag, which is then closed for 5 or 10 minutes. They emerge nearly cool and easily stripped of the charred outer layer. Garlic becomes subtle in taste and soft in texture, while okra, which can get gluey in water, taste crispy and crunchy. Foods like tomatoes, which insist on falling into the coals, can be cooked in a wire basket made for the purpose. Or use skewers. A. Cort Sinnes and Jay Harlow, authors of ''The Grilling Book'' (Harris Publishing, 1985), suggest finding metal skewers that are not perfectly round, so that the food will not rotate. Bamboo skewers can be used, but they should be soaked in water first. Those New York City terrace grillers who fear they are breaking the law when they light up a fire can relax: grilling outdoors is legal in all boroughs. The Fire Department suggests, however, that great care be taken in disposing of embers. When it comes to barbecuing, cooking times can only be approximate. How long you stand in front of a grill will depend on how hot the fire is when you start. Mustards' Yams (Adapted from Mustards Grill) Preparation time: 30 minutes Grilling time: 4 minutes The yams: 2 pounds yams, unpeeled Salt to taste 1/4 cup olive oil 3 tablespoons tamari 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger 2 tablespoons minced scallion The vinaigrette: 1/4 cup rice wine vinegar 3/4 cup olive oil 2 scallions, minced 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro 1/2 teaspoon grated fresh ginger 1 tablespoon tamari. 1.Cover yams with salted water and boil until tender, so that a fork will penetrate easily. Run them under cold water immediately. 2.Cut yams in half-inch slices lengthwise. 3.Mix together oil, tamari, ginger and scallion and pour over potatoes. 4.Mix together the ingredients for the vinaigrette and reserve. 5.Put yams on the grill for a minute, then turn them 90 degrees and cook for another minute to burn a cross-hatch pattern into them. Turn over and repeat process. 6.Remove to a platter and drizzle vinaigrette over all. Yield: 6 servings.

238-> Metro Matters; Campaign '88 Tired Souls And New Blood
Outside Edward R. Murrow High School in Brooklyn, the only hint that an election was taking place Tuesday was the man with the hat. He politely stopped passers-by to give out palm cards promoting the candidacy of Senator Albert Gore Jr. Inside the school, in the Midwood section, Max Sultan was complaining because his polling place had been shifted to the Murrow gymnasium from his apartment house a few blocks away. Mr. Sultan, who will be 81 years old in July, managed to get there. But he was worried about his elderly neighbors. ''The only way I can be strong is through turnout,'' he said. ''Why should a politician do anything for me if he looks and sees 18 people voted out of 800?'' Mr. Sultan retired years ago from a job in the record room of State Supreme Court. But, as leader of the Onondaga Regular Democratic Club, he has labored tirelessly on behalf of neighbors and local candidates despite a dwindling constituency in a borough of changes. ''People say to me, 'Mac, they didn't take the garbage away,' 'Mac, the street light isn't burning,' '' said Mr. Sultan, whose tie clasp trumpets his nickname in case anybody forgets. ''They wanted mailboxes. I got them one at 19th Street, on Ocean Avenue, on 18th Street. Nobody in the state of New York has three mailboxes. How do I do it? Because I bring in the most votes.'' Once Mr. Sultan's club had 300 members; today, there are about one-tenth that many. ''They come; they play cards; they call each other names,'' he said. ''They're all in their 60's and 70's. What else can they do?'' They can vote. ''They come because Max says so,'' his fellow election inspector, his wife, Ida, said. ''They don't even know who the person is, or what their qualifications are. If Max recommends them, then they're the right one.'' Yet today, Mr. Sultan said, ''people have their own minds - they'll ask me, but now maybe 8 out of 10 will believe me.'' Like many party regulars, he is more concerned with who represents his district in the City Council or State Legislature than with the White House. However, he apparently was leaning to Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, primarily because Representative Charles E. Schumer, Mr. Sultan's Congressman, was co-chairman of the Dukakis campaign. ''This is not a Jackson neighborhood, so why should I put myself on the line for either one of the others?'' Mr. Sultan said. Imagine if he had. In Mr. Sultan's election district, the 5th, which is in the 45th Assembly District, the vote was 378 for Mr. Dukakis, 96 for Mr. Gore and 13 for the Rev. Jesse Jackson. But Mr. Sultan was disappointed. The turnout, 67 percent, was well above the citywide average but below even his diminished expectations. He was tired, too. ''I'll tell you the truth,'' he said. ''Not a soul came in to offer me a glass of soda. Nothing. We got home and I said to Ida: 'I think I'm hanging up my gloves. I can't do it any more.' '' In another Brooklyn neighborhood Tuesday, Ron Ashford was just beginning. He was juggling phones in the Crown Heights office of Representative Major R. Owens, where he was coordinating Mr. Jackson's campaign. Mr. Ashford, who works for a nonprofit development association and is half Mr. Sultan's age, got his first taste of politics demonstrating against apartheid. Now, he hopes to become a Democratic district leader. ''I used to be out protesting on the streets, but that only goes so far,'' he said. Outside, enthusiastic Jackson supporters were thrusting fliers at passengers streaming from the subway. Sound trucks were exhorting people to vote. ''You've seen a coming together of black officials who don't normally work together, of blacks and Hispanics, of Caribbean blacks and American blacks,'' Mr. Ashford said. The turnout in the 12th District also was well above the citywide average. The vote was 57,477 for Mr. Jackson, 4,988 for Mr. Dukakis and 1,248 for Mr. Gore. For many, Tuesday was a dress rehearsal for the main event: a campaign against Mayor Koch. Mr. Ashford hopes for the same unity on behalf of a black citywide candidate in 1989, perhaps on a ticket headed by a white candidate such as Charles J. Hynes, the special state prosecutor, who is respected by blacks and can appeal both to Catholics and to Jews embarrassed by Mr. Koch's unrestrained rhetoric aimed at Mr. Jackson. ''It's going to take a real effort to bring people back into politics,'' Mr. Ashford said. ''There are people with expertise that's not being used. And what's the mechanism for them to get involved? Our local organization.'' Fifty years ago, Mr. Sultan might have said the very same thing.

239-> I.B.M. Raises U.S. Prices For Computers and Service
In another attempt to increase its profitability, the International Business Machines Corporation said yesterday that it was raising prices by 5 percent on computers and software sold in the United States. Charges on service agreements will be raised 3 percent. The prices of the many models introduced since April already reflect the increases announced yesterday, the company said. Those models include the new high-end mainframe computers announced earlier in the week, a series of new Personal System/2 personal computers and a new midrange computer, the Application System/ 400. Since the beginning of the year I.B.M. has been engaged in a broad restructuring aimed at cutting costs and revamping its line of products. The moves come as the company seeks to regain its momentum and reassert its dominance in the computer industry. Analysts said that, unlike other American computer companies, I.B.M. had not increased its prices because of the recent sharp price increases for dynamic random access memory chips. Many of the big American computer makers have recently announced price increases linked to the rising price of those memory chips. ''I.B.M. is insulated because of its internal supply,'' said John W. Wilson, an industry analyst at Dataquest, a market research firm in San Jose, Calif. ''They would be the least affected of all U.S. companies.'' Several analysts suggested that the pricing move might represent a deeper change in business philosophy, moving the company back to an earlier strategy of stressing marketing concerns more than price competition. A broad price increase like the one announced yesterday is rare in the computer industry. ''I believe this represents a change of operating philosophy at I.B.M.,'' said Marc Schulman, an analyst at Salomon Brothers. ''Up until about 10 years ago I.B.M. was a marketing-driven company'' that stressed the quality of its products and not the price. In recent years, he said, the company attempted to compete on a price basis. The company excluded its European subsidaries from the price increases, but said I.B.M. Canada and several subsidiaries in the Asia-Pacific Group also raised prices yesterday. No decisions have yet been made on whether to raise prices in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. Exempted from the increases will be older models of I.B.M.'s largest 3090 mainframe computer, as well as application software for the I.B.M. Personal Computer, the PS/2 and IBM PC/RT systems. Only one model of the original PS/2 line will be affected. The base price of the Model 30, a low-end desktop computer, will rise from $1,695 to $1,775. The other original PS/2 models have been replaced by new models introduced in the spring. 'Leaner and Stronger' Analysts said the price increases reflected the pressure to produce more favorable results that has been placed on the United States marketing division in recent years. ''It's going to lead to a leaner and stronger company,'' said Clare Fleig, director of research at the International Technology Group, a consulting firm in Los Altos, Calif. ''It's part of a pattern of cost-cutting and selling their subsidiaries. They're looking for additional ways to raise revenue. They've been flat for the last three years.'' In January the company announced a far-reaching reorganization that decentralized its top management, and in June it set a $600 million restructuring that consists of a series of manufacturing and administrative shifts and plant closings. Wall Street reacted favorably to yesterday's announcement. I.B.M.'s stock rose $2.625, to $123.75, on the New York Stock Exchange.

240-> Persistent 'Squeaky Wheel' Finally Heard by City Hall
Since their first plea three years ago, representatives of Restaurant Row say they have written perhaps a dozen letters to Mayor Koch and other city officials, repeating a litany of complaints about drug dealers, prostitutes, mendicants, miscreants and illegally parked cars. Each time, the letter writers say, they got a prompt but perfunctory response and a promise that their problems would be referred to the police. And, invariably, they say, the precinct commander called, was courteous, briefly assigned more officers to the area and then later acknowledged having to divert them to handle problems elsewhere. ''There was often an immediate response for one or two weeks, with the addition of more officers,'' said the Rev. Dale D. Hansen, pastor of St. Luke's Lutheran Church and president of the Restaurant Row Association. ''But it was never sustained. It was never adequate from the top echelon.'' The police and city officials get similar demands from virtually every neighborhood, and they say they cannot be everywhere at once. They note the area around Times Square and Restaurant Row is already by far the most heavily policed in the city, in part because it is home to a huge, shifting and widely diverse population. The Story of Countless Areas The history of West 46th Street's struggle against crime, a struggle that finally prompted it to enlist the Guardian Angels, is a story mirrored in countless neighborhoods around New York City. But this stretch of bars and bistros is a magnet for tourists, theatergoers and midtown executives, and its cries have produced an atypical hubbub. Yesterday, Mayor Koch said he would meet with Pastor Hansen and restaurant owners next week to discuss possible solutions. He avoided making any promises and carefully refused to praise or criticize the Guardian Angels, saying only that he favored any groups that ''want to act as the eyes and ears of the cops, not replace the cops.'' Mr. Koch said he did not recall getting any letters on the subject, but noted that he gets hundreds of letters a day. He acknowledged that his office often sends out responses over his signature referring problems to particular agencies, and did not dispute that it had done so in this case. Asked if he believed the restaurant owners had recruited the Angels to publicize their plight, the Mayor said: ''Sure, but so what. The squeaky wheel, you remember that principle. Well, it's just like the squeaky wheel.'' Letter Sent to Koch in '85 In fact, this wheel has been squeaking for some time, A sheaf of correspondence between Pastor Hansen and city officials shows that the police have long been aware of the problem. On June 19, 1985, Pastor Hansen, on St. Luke's stationery, wrote the Mayor that, ''for the past decade,'' tenants in a single-room occupancy hotel at the southwest corner of 46th Street and Eighth Avenue ''have held the neighborhood hostage, attracting and harboring an assortment of transvestite prostitutes, 'regular' prostitutes, junkies, muggers and thieves. Other tenants live in mortal dread for their lives.'' Several months later, on Jan. 21, 1986, Pastor Hansen wrote Mr. Koch again, noting that ''periodically, a crackdown occurs and things quiet down for a week or two, only to return to normal as soon as the pressure is off.'' ''Considering the tourist traffic to the restaurants and theatres of the area, these conditions give the worst possible impression of our city,'' Pastor Hansen wrote. 'We Need Your Guidance' On March 4, 1987, Pastor Hansen wrote the Midtown North Precinct commander, Deputy Inspector Edward F. Fitzgerald, a note that began, '' 'Tis me again,'' and three weeks later added: ''The circus goes on.'' Last Oct. 13, the professional stagehands' union, whose headquarters is on the block, wrote Mr. Koch: ''We need your guidance and your resources before Restaurant Row becomes 'Cannery Row.' '' Pastor Hansen denied that the block had turned to the Angels to seek publicity, or to put pressure on the city. ''We were suffocating in danger,'' he said. But he noted that the police had added more officers last week after they were told the Angels were coming. The spokeswoman for the Police Department, Deputy Commissioner Alice T. McGillion, said she could not confirm Pastor Hansen's account of briefly increased police patrols in response to past complaints because Inspector Fitzgerald was on that in the first four months of this year, officers made as many arrests in the area, 600, as in all of last year. Angel in Critical Condition A senior police official, who asked not to be identified, said the precinct commander should probably have simply assigned more officers to the block weeks or months ago to head off the complaints and the resulting publicity. ''It's complicated being a commander in an area like that,'' the official said. ''You have to know how to handle these things.'' Meantime yesterday, Illya Lichtenberg, a 16-year-old member of the Guardian Angels who was stabbed in an altercation on the street Saturday night, was in critical but stable condition at St. Vincent's Hospital. Two Angels arrested in a separate incident Sunday night were released on their own recognizance after pleading not guilty to charges of menacing and harrassing a neighborhood man. That man, John Johnson, was also charged with menacing and was also released.

250-> Pentagon Must Clean Up Its Procurement Act
To the Editor: In the eyes of some, defense programs are synonymous with eternal life. ''The Dumb Pursuit of a Smart Weapon'' (editorial, March 28) proves the so-called Aquila program an exception. As the member of Congress who requested the General Accounting Office investigation that helped lead to the demise of the Aquila remotely piloted vehicle, I am very familiar with the problems from development to production. The Aquila represents a good idea that went bad because of problems in the Department of Defense procurement process. After 10 years and $2 billion, the Aquila is gone, but the systemic problems remain. What must be changed in defense procurement to prevent a repeat? * The military services should be required to coordinate their efforts to develop products of common use like the remotely piloted vehicle. This concept has been incorporated in the 1988 defense appropriations bill for development of a more cost-effective and functional remotely piloted vehicle. Extending the joint development concept to other weapons programs will reduce the amount of money needed to produce them and alleviate the potential for wasteful duplication. * The Department of Defense should fully implement recommendations on defense reform by the Packard Commission in its 1986 report to the President. A key recommendation was the creation of a civilian Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, with authority to set overall policy for weapons procurement, research and development. Like other members of Congress, I believed we were on the road to major changes in the procurement process. But such developments as the resignation of Under Secretary Richard P. Godwin have altered my view on the commitment of the Pentagon to real defense procurement reform. The department must make an honest and concerted effort to insure that the Under Secretary for Acquisition is given the chance to fulfill his Congressionally intended mandate as a procurement czar, setting policy for weapons procurement. I believe the end result will be a better and more efficient procurement system. * The office of director of testing and evaluation, created by Congress at my urging in 1983 to insure that weapon systems were ready for production, must be given greater support. This independent office is intended to be the principal adviser to the Secretary of Defense on operational testing and evaluation and to report to Congress on the adequacy of the operational testing done and whether weapon systems are effective and suitable for combat. * The final change that should be made in procurement is for the Defense Department to reduce the number of acquisition personnel. This was a principal recommendation of the Packard Commission, to simplify the acquisition system by consolidating policy and oversight, reducing reporting chains, eliminating duplicated functions and excessive regulations. In this period of massive deficits and reduced Government resources, I believe that American taxpayers deserve a full return on their tax dollars. We cannot afford to waste a single dollar, let alone millions, on weapon systems that do not work. The policies that I have outlined provide a framework for procurement change. Now is the time for the Defense Department to get on with the job. WILLIAM V. ROTH JR. U. S. Senator from Delaware Washington, April 1, 1988

251-> L.I. Authority Backs Accord On Shoreham
The Long Island Power Authority today gave its approval to the accord between New York State and the Long Island Lighting Company to close the utility's Shoreham nuclear power plant. In doing so, the power authority, a state agency formed to consider a public takeover of Lilco, also voted to drop all of its attempts to buy the utility, including withdrawing its offers, which had gone as high as $7.85 billion. But the power authority's approval, on a 6-to-0 vote, with two trustees absent and one abstaining, came amid a growing sense of unease on Long Island. The opposition, expressed by Citizens to Replace Lilco, a powerful grassroots organization on the Island, and several business executives, is largely due to the cost of the settlement, which will have Lilco's customers paying for most of the utility's remaining outstanding Shoreham debt. Rate Increases Guaranteed The agreement guarantees Lilco three years of annual 5 percent rate increases and other financial measures in return for the utility abandoning the Shoreham plant. In addition, concern is being voiced on the board of the New York Power Authority, a state agency that would both decommission Shoreham and build an additional five power plants on Long Island. The concern on the power authority, state officials said, could mean more questions about the agreement being raised in the State Legislature. The agreement between Lilco and the state, which was announced on May 26, ends decades of uncertainty over Shoreham. Lilco, which completed the $5.3 billion nuclear plant in 1983, has been unable to win a commercial operating license for it from the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission because of the refusal by the state and Suffolk County to cooperate in emergency planning for the plant. The Long Island Power Authority accepted some of the concerns by agreeing to a report from its consultants who said that under a settlement, Lilco's customers will pay about $417 million more over 15 years than they would have if the authority had succeeded in taking over the utility. But various trustees, before approving the accord, said that by guaranteeing the abandonment of Shoreham, the settlement had values that could not be quantified. 'Reasonably Competitive' ''I consider this to be a reasonably competitive alternative to a takeover,'' said Leon J. Campo, a longtime Shoreham opponent and power authority trustee who was selected today to serve as the authority's representative on the Lilco board. Earlier this week, the power authority announced that it had won a seat on Lilco's board through a proxy fight. But the Long Island authority, in an often heated six-hour meeting this afternoon, considered and overruled many of the objections being raised across the Island. ''We have accomplished what we set out to accomplish - which is the closing of Shoreham,'' said William L. Mack, the authority's chairman. ''And we have done it in a way that is both fair and reasonable to all parties.'' Other Authorizations Although the power authority's endorsement had long been expected, it now clears a path for the additional authorizations of the accord that must be won. For example, the Legislature, which is being asked to approve the New York Power Authority's role in building additional plants on Long Island, did not want to be the first to approve the accord, legislative officials have said. Some New York Power Authority trustees may also ask the Legislature to turn down the agreement. Rolland E. Kidder, a trustee from Jamestown, said in a telephone interview on Monday that ''I can't sit by any longer and watch this thing run pell-mell toward an end that I think could ultimately damage the New York Power Authority.'' His primary concern, he said, is that the power authority would be asked, under the agreement, to decommission the Shoreham plant after it is sold to the Long Island Power Authority for $1 by Lilco. 'A Lot of Money' ''I don't think that is a reasonable energy option,'' Mr. Kidder said. ''If we were to buy the plant for a dollar and operate it, we could save the ratepayers on Long Island a lot of money.'' While the New York Power Authority's two other trustees - James L. Larocca of Long Island and George L. Ingalls of Binghamton - refused to answer any questions about the accord, the authority's chairman, Richard M. Flynn, who also has a vote on the board, expressed confidence that he would prevail. ''The question of decommissioning Shoreham has already been made by the people of Long Island, the legislators of Long Island, the Governor and the company involved,'' he said. ''If the decision has already been made, the question for a trustee becomes who really is the best qualified organization in New York State to do it. ''The authority has top-flight nuclear expertise,'' Mr. Flynn said. ''We operate the sister plant to Shoreham and there is therefore no one better in New York to do the decommissioning.''

254-> New Playground Accessible To Children in Wheelchairs
Youngsters in wheelchairs will soon be able to play side by side with other children when a specially designed playground at Holmes Elementary School opens to the public. The playground was dedicated on the last day of classes at Holmes, which offers programs for physically disabled children in Oak Park and neighboring suburbs west of Chicago. About 40 eager children, many in wheelchairs, made a beeline for the Playground for All Children and climbed on the equipment after the ribbon-cutting June 10, ''I'm excited to play in it because it looks fun and interesting,'' said David Hyde, a sixth grader with muscular dystrophy. ''Before, I would just sit around and watch. There was nothing else to do.'' ''It was pure joy'' for the children, said Myra LaRoque, president of the local Parent-Teachers Organization. ''They were able to stand on it, walk on it, feel that it was real,'' The playground, which is 75 by 140 feet, features an extensive ramp system leading to a large platform with access to four slides and a large sandbox. The ramp is designed to help youngsters develop upper-body strength. The sandbox is raised to lap height so children can wheel up and put their hands in or even slide into it. The swings have mesh hammock seats that can be slipped under a child in a wheelchair. The playground also has an herb garden, where blind children may develop their senses of touch and smell, and boxes where students may cultivate plants. About 10 percent of the approximately 500 students at Holmes use wheelchairs, Mrs. LaRoque said. ''These children are 100 percent integrated in the classroom, but notable differences appear when they go outside to play,'' she said. About half the $100,000 cost came from Federal community development money. The rest came from the local park and school districts and the parents' fund-raising efforts. The playground is expected to be open to the public by the end of June, Mrs. LaRoque said. Workers are still putting finishing touches on the equipment.

255-> Thomas H. A. Lewis; Film Producer Was 86
Thomas H. A. Lewis, a film and broadcasting producer and writer who founded the Armed Forces Radio Service during World War II, died Friday at his home in Ojai, Calif. He was 86 years old. Mr. Lewis was a writer, producer and executive at Young & Rubicam before the war. His contacts there with the entertainment industry helped him establish the global radio network for servicemen and to get Hollywood and Broadway celebrities on the air. After the war, in which he served as an Army colonel, he helped organize a company called Lewislor to produce ''The Loretta Young Show'' on television. He was married to the actress for 30 years before their divorce in 1970. Mr. Lewis, who graduated from Union College in Schenectady, N.Y., was a director and part owner of the Beverly Hills Hotel and the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills, Calif. He is survived y two sons, Christopher, of Tulsa, Okla., and Peter, of Santa Barbara; a daughter, Judy, of Los Angeles, and a sister, Ruth, of North Troy, N.Y.

256-> Perot's Postal Service Pact Is Suspended by the G.S.A.
H. Ross Perot's $500,000 consulting contract with the Postal Service was suspended yesterday by the General Services Administration because his company had refused to supply documents to the G.S.A.'s Board of Contract Appeals. Mr. Perot and the Postal Service are challenging the G.S.A.'s jurisdiction in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Jim Van Loozen, a spokesman for the Postal Service, said last night: ''It has been our position from the very beginning that the G.S.A. does not have jurisdiction in this matter. It is our position that the Postal Reorganization Act clearly gives us authority to contract for ourselves.'' The contract had been challenged by Electronic Data Services, a subsidiary of the General Motors Corporation that was founded and formerly owned by Mr. Perot, and by the Planning Research Corporation, which complained to the G.S.A. that they were not offered an opportunity to bid on the Postal Service contract. Raids to Be Initiated Angered by the challenge from E.D.S., Mr. Perot said last night that he would initiate raids on the E.D.S. staff and compete for ''as many commercial data processing contracts as possible'' that are now held by E.D.S. ''Even Mike Tyson gets tired of people hitting him,'' Mr. Perot said. ''I'm tired of people hitting me.'' Roger Still, an E.D.S. at the company's headquarters in Dallas, said E.D.S. viewed the Perot contract as ''anti-competitive'' and believed the G.S.A. had jurisdiction to make that determination. E.D.S. representatives in Washington have apparently lobbied legislators and Government officials to challenge the awarding of the contract to Perot Systems. The contract calls for a study of postal operations, to be followed by computer systems work carrying a fee based on the savings produced for the Postal Service. Three Years of Rivalry The sparring over the contract stems from a three-year-old rivalry between Mr. Perot and G.M. In December 1986, Mr. Perot resigned as a G.M. director and G.M. paid him $700 million for his equity stake in E.D.S. Under the terms of the buyout, Mr. Perot agreed not to compete in any way against E.D.S. for 18 months. When that period expire June 1, , he immediately announced formation of a not-for-profit company and the contract with the Postal Service. Although Mr. Perot apparently adhered to the provisions of the buyout agreement with G.M., an E.D.S. spokesman expressed disappointment that Mr. Perot had hired several top managers and executives to start Perot Systems. Mr. Perot said he intends to compete with E.D.S. for commercial data contracts but will bid for them on a not-for-profit basis until December 1989, when he is permitted unrestricted competition with E.D.S., under terms of the buyout agreement.

258-> Nureyev in 'Orpheus' As City Ballet Guest
Rudolf Nureyev is to dance the title role in George Balanchine's ''Orpheus'' in two guest appearances this month with the New York City Ballet, the company has announced. Mr. Nureyev's last performance with the company was in 1979 in Balanchine's ''Bourgeois Gentilhomme,'' a production created for the New York City Opera and presented on a double bill with the opera ''Dido and Aeneas.'' The two performances, tomorrow evening and the June 26 matinee, were arranged at the invitation of Peter Martins, the company's co-ballet master in chief. Mr. Nureyev was already scheduled to come to New with the Paris Opera Ballet, of which he is the artistic director. The French troupe opens at the Metropolitan Opera House next Tuesday. ''Orpheus'' was created in 1948 to a commissioned score by Stravinsky.

259-> Prague Journal; The Czechs' Fate: A Cornucopia of Useless Goods
Somewhere out in Czechoslovakia, amid towns and factories, are warehouses. And, Prime Minister Lubomir Strougal says, they are clogged with billions of dollars of goods nobody wants to buy. No one had heard of the warehouses before Mr. Strougal, a cautious man not given to hyperbole, first mentioned them in May, when he warned that the nation's factories poured out goods whose low quality or obsolesence meant they could only be stored as ''uselessly dead production.'' ''Over the last two years, these have grown by 35 billion crowns,'' or about $3.5 billion, he told Parliament, ''which is more than the total growth of national income over the last two years.'' That was strong stuff for Czechoslovaks used to being told how their country, for its relative economic vigor, is a kind of Japan of the East bloc, for it meant that economic growth was, in effect, negative. Off on Vacations Not that material need is evident here as it is in, say, Warsaw or Bucharest. Along Prague's main shopping street is an exclusive boutique called the House of Elegance. Its awnings, like its prices, are gilded. The store is very busy. As July heat settled over Prague, many Czechoslovaks, generally in stylish summerwear, are packing their locally built Skoda automobiles for vacation bungalows in the country that many can afford. But for the men around Mr. Strougal the challenge is to reverse a situation in which, as he told Parliament, the ''economic mechanism has essentially run out of its capacity for direction and motivation.'' The choice of words betrayed the heart of the debate, which is perhaps more about the spirit of the land than its material welfare, and how to get Czechoslovakia moving again. ''There is a whole complex of measures,'' said Jaromir Sedlak, the Prime Minister's chief adviser, ''but one basic philosophical change, that we must move individuals through motivation.'' The main task, he said, would be to clear dead brush, by finding new jobs for roughly one-third of Government bureaucrats, and fan entrepreneurial spirit by enabling state-run enterprises to reward or punish workers financially, depending on their financial results. If all of that rings vaguely capitalistic, the former philosophy professor is one of the relatively few officials who will talk openly with foreigners about possible contradictions in expecting a party that brooks no political rivals to inspire a national rebirth of competitive spirit. ''We have always emphasized that, without political change, there can be no effective economic change,'' Mr. Sedlak said. ''We are now discussing what specific forms that will take.'' And what of political groups independent of the Communist Party? ''For the moment that is unrealistic in our real system,'' he said. ''The key question will be how to bring more democracy into the internal life of the party.'' The Three Camps Mr. Strougal has said Czechoslovakia now divides into three camps: those who refuse change, and those who favor it, one group at a leisurely pace, another immediately. And while Mr. Strougal is usually numbered among the impatient, the Communist Party leader, Milos Jakes, is said to favor the leisurely gait. If the Czechoslovak economy needs acceleration, Mr. Jakes believes, then the Communist Party must insure its place in the driver's seat. Partly, that has to do with history. In 1968, Mr. Strougal was the Deputy Prime Minister who signed the formal declaration protesting the Warsaw Pact invasion and demanding withdrawal of the troops. Mr. Jakes, by contrast, was the leader who purged some 400,000 party members who were considered undependable. Thus for some there was a ring of opportunism to remarks Mr. Jakes made last month equating the party's goals today with those of the brief burst of freedoms in 1968 that later became known as the Prague Spring. For most party leaders the central question remains how to avoid a repetition of what occurred 20 years ago. ''We didn't need the help of tanks back then,'' said Jiri Kohout, a senior editor at the party newspaper, Rude Pravo, ''but the Soviet leadership knew no other way. And we needed help, for the party here was terribly weak.'' ''There were new hopes then, new fortunes, but only in words and opinions,'' Mr. Kohout said. ''The chief distinction between perestroika and 1968 is that perestroika has a large compass pointing the way of development.'' 'You Are Responsible' For ideological purists like Mr. Kohout, the compass remains the party. And that view, they feel, was confirmed by the recent Soviet party conference in Moscow. But critical spirits here are not convinced that the experiment in renewal by fiat can succeed, if only for the presence of many of the same leaders who were responsible for crushing the brief flowering of 1968. ''The first queston is always, what are you still doing here?'' said Jiri Dienstbier, a disbarred journalist who spent three years in prison for his opposition views, putting a rhetorical question to Mr. Jakes. ''Because you are responsible for this catastrophe, and how can you now tell us to do what for 20 years you said was anti-socialist?'' For critics like Mr. Dienstbier, the issues are made more complex by the long democratic tradition in Czechoslovakia that is not shared by the Soviet Union. ''Look, for the Russians it's fantastic,'' he said, referring to the Moscow conference. ''For us, when they propose something that was normal hundreds of years ago, they are simply restoring what was destroyed in 1948,'' when the Communists snuffed out democracy. ''Gorbachev has to teach the Soviets democracy,'' he said. ''One hundred years ago every Czech village had two or three political parties.''

261-> Metro Matters; 16 Months in Jail And the Story Of a Father's Lie
Now, for the first time, Saleh Rohany's two young daughters will learn the truth about why their father suddenly left home in 1986. He has told them repeatedly ever since that he left their Queens apartment to return to Afghanistan to fight the Russians. His daughters, then 8 and 10 years old, believed him. After all, the Russians had killed their grandmother -Mr. Rohany's mother - and their 3 1/2-year-old sister during the invasion that drove the family into Pakistan. In fact, however, Mr. Rohany was never farther away than upstate New York. He was in prison, serving a 2Y- to 7-year term, for a crime he insisted he had not committed. Last November, after 16 months, a state appeals court reversed his conviction. Friends and customers of Mr. Rohany's first clothing and jewelry store on Broadway in Astoria assumed, however, that his guilt had been affirmed, but that he had gotten early parole. Now he wants them to know what really happened, even if it means his daughters will finally find out the truth, too. ''This was my first lie all my life,'' he said. Mr. Rohany, who is 43 years old, was a provincial agricultural official before seeking refuge here. In a city of immigrants, he was prosecuted, in part, because he was unfamiliar with his adopted country's legal system or language. He was, his lawyer says, the victim of a skeptical insurance company that understood the system better than he did and, perhaps, of the Queens District Attorney's failure to exercise sufficient discretion. After working for an importer, Mr. Rohany opened his own store. On Oct. 1, 1984, he rented a second store on a busier block of Hillside Avenue in Jamaica. Two months later, he arrived to find that the new store had burned down. More than 7,000 items, worth an estimated $75,000, were destroyed. ''I talk to insurance broker,'' Mr. Rohany said. ''He says, 'Rohany, don't worry.' '' But he worried when the insurance company wouldn't pay. He later told the police in desperation, ''God is my insurance'' - which prosecutors later construed as a ploy to imply that he had no other insurance. On April 30, 1985, he was arrested for arson, reckless endangerment, insurance fraud, falsifying business records and attempted grand larceny. ''I am thinking, why arrest me? I have lost my business,'' Mr. Rohany said. ''We reviewed the facts, presented them to a grand jury, they brought an indictment, and the judge found sufficient evidence to proceed,'' said Gary S. Fidel, an assistant prosecutor who handled the case on appeal. For two months, Mr. Rohany couldn't make bail but pleaded with his wife, as he did again during his imprisonment, not to go on welfare. For a brief period, she had no choice. ''This is a shame for me,'' he said. At the trial, prosecution witnesses doubted that the large inventory that Mr. Rohany claimed was there could leave so little residue after a fire. The prosecutor said Mr. Rohany ''came over from a foreign country'' and got greedy. He was convicted. The judge dismissed the arson and reckless endangerment charges for insufficient evidence, but upheld the other charges. Mr. Rohany's probation report described him, in part, as ''a basically law-abiding person, concerned for his family, who may have been 'in over his head' when it came to running a business. He appears to have been very shaken up by his arrest and the subsequent legal proceedings, and it is very likely that they will serve as deterrents from any further legal involvement.'' He was imprisoned; both sides appealed the split decision. Irma B. Ascher, senior supervising attorney of the Legal Aid Society's Criminal Appeals Bureau, argued his case before the Appellate Division last Nov. 19. Within two weeks, the court ruled that prosecutors ''never directly connected the defendant with the fire itself or with the means to start it.'' The court added, ''Nor were they able to establish a cause of the fire.'' Mr. Rohany was released, his faith in the system restored by a committed lawyer. ''This is the best country,'' he said. ''This is the best justice. I don't want to blame the District Attorney, because this is his job. Everybody makes a mistake. I just don't want to think about this one.'' However, he is still suing the insurance company and the state. Once the Russians leave Afghanistan, he hopes to return to help his countrymen. Meanwhile, he said, ''I want to tell my daughters about justice.'' He hopes they'll understand. His cramped store on Broadway bears only one hint of his encounter with the American justice system. Mr. Rohany has prominently posted a ''No Smoking'' sign. This time, he has no fire insurance. ''I'm afraid to,'' he said.

262-> HARNESS RACING; Hambletonian To Armbro Goal
Armbro Goal captured the 63d edition of the Hambletonian, the middle leg of trotting's triple crown, in straight heats this afternoon in a festive atmosphere at the Meadowlands race track. Driven by John Campbell, Armbro Goal, the son of Speedy Crown, set the tempo from the outset for both heats and was never seriously threatened, winning the first heat in 1:54 3/5 and the second in 1:55 1/5. His victory in the first heat was by three lengths over Rule the Wind and he paid $3.20 for $2 to win. In the second heat, he won by 4 1/4 lengths over Firm Tribute and paid $2.60. The victory in the second heat was the seventh in nine starts this season for Armbro Goal as Campbell the first driver to win the Hambletonian in consecutive years since the late Bill Haughton did it in 1976 and 1977. Armbro Goal also made Jan Johnson, his Swedish trainer, a winner in the Hambletonian for the first time after entering 24 horses over the years. Second Victory ''It's exciting to be in the Hambletonian,'' Campbell said, ''and winning it is even more exciting. It's the icing on the cake to win two.'' Campbell won the 1987 Hambletonian behind Mack Lobell, last year's top horse in harness racing, setting the Hambletonian record of 1:53 3/5. Mack Lobell was sold to interests in Sweden after winning that country's elite race last May. Campbell refused to compare Mack Lobell with Armbro Goal, whose sale to a Swedish group, headed by Tomas Bertmark, was confirmed this week by James Plate, one of the former owners. Plate said the price was $2.5 million. Armbro Goal's victory in the Hambletonian was worth $578,400 and increased his earnings to $1,010,494. Firm Tribute, trained and driven by Mark O'Mara, collected the $289,200 second prize of the $1,156,800 Hambletonian for finishing third in the first heat and second in the second. Rule the Wind, with Rich Silverman driving, collected the third prize of $138,816 after finishing second in the first heat and seventh in the second. Bolla, driven by William O'Donnell, finished fourth in the first heat and third in the second and collected the fourth prize of $92,544. Had the same colt not won both heats, a third heat would have been required, matching the winners of the first two. Day for Favorites From the Hambletonian result to Campbell, who won six races this afternoon, it was a day for favorites. The Pick-6, which involves the winners from the third through the eighth race, was selected by 421 bettorsin the crowd of 34,212 and paid only $139.40, the lowest payoff in the history of the track. There will be no triple crown winner this year because Southern Newton, the winner of the first leg, the Yonkers Trot, was not nominated for the Hambletonian. The third leg of the triple crown is the Kentucky Futurity, which will be staged Oct. 7 at Red Mile track in Lexington. Armbro Goal left from the rail in both heats. He set the tempo in the first with the fastest first quarter in the history of the race at 0:27 2/5 and in the second heat by covering the first half in 0:55 2/5, the fastest for the first half mile. Banners and pennants adorned the race track inside and out, with strolling musicians and clowns entertaining the crowd, which started to assemble 90 minutes before the program got under way at noon. The hot and humid afternoon was no deterrent for setting a world record in the first race. Intruder Almahurst, who paid $76.40 for $2 to win, set a mark for an aged gelding with a time of 1:52 1/5, breaking the record of 1:52 4/5 shared by Lustras Big Guy and Sinday, both of whom did it in 1986. The Hambletonian Oaks, the filly counterpart to the Hambletonian, which was staged Friday night, was captured by Nat's Catch in straight heats. Driven by Berndt Lindstedt, Nat's Catch won the $395,300 final in 1:56 3/5.

263-> IDEAS & TRENDS; Life Patents: Doubts Are Registering
THE House Judiciary Committee struck a compromise between farmers and the biotechnology industry last week when it decided that, in most instances, new forms of animals can be treated like mechanical inventions and patented. In deciding that farmers should be exempted from paying royalties on the offspring of the patented livestock they buy, and in specifically stating that humans should not be patented, the committee sent a strong signal that cultural, moral and ethical considerations are important factors in drawing up legislation to regulate new biological technologies. The legislation now moves to the House and Senate, and a vote could come in September. ''There is broad apprehension in the farm community, in the religious community and in other communities about developments in biotechnology,'' said Representative Robert W. Kastenmeier, a Wisconsin Democrat and chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee that considers patent law. ''In some cases it is fear over what kinds of organisms will be produced. In other cases it is suspicion about who really benefits. There is a coalition out there that is making its presence felt in Congress.'' The committee's decision stems from a policy established in April 1987 by the United States Patent and Trademark Office to grant patents to inventors of ''nonnaturally occurring nonhuman multicellular living organisms, including animals.'' In April 1988, the patent office determined that a mouse genetically engineered for use in cancer research was a ''composition of matter'' and a ''product of human ingenuity,'' and issued the world's first animal patent to two researchers at Harvard Medical School. Both decisions brought protests from a coalition of religious leaders, animal rights groups, farm groups and environmentalists such as Jeremy Rifkin, president of the Foundation on Economic Trends, a Washington-based public policy group. ''Patenting higher forms of life will essentially allow multinational corporations to literally own and control entire animal gene pools, from apes to insects,'' said Mr. Rifkin. ''It will reduce all animals to matter for manipulation. And it enables companies to define the genetic blueprints of all living things as their own property. It is a profound change in how we regard animals.'' From Plants to Animals Biotechnology industry executives and officials of the Patent Office, however, believe patenting animals, such as pigs that grow faster and leaner, is not a leap into new territory. In 1930 Congress passed the Plant Patent Act, enabling breeders of trees, roses and other plants that reproduce through cuttings to protect their developments. In 1970, Congress extended protection to new varieties of wheat, corn and other crops that reproduce through seeds. And in 1980, by a 5-to-4 vote, the Supreme Court ruled that microorganisms transformed through artificial manipulation of their genetic codes could also be patented. ''Patenting animals is a logical extension of previous policies,'' said Donald J. Quigg, Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Commissioner of Patents. The conflict over patenting animals and other developments in biotechnology, however, is far from resolved. Many farmers, who worry that animal patents might enable large companies to control livestock agriculture, supported a bill introduced by Representative Charlie Rose, Democrat of North Carolina, that would have prevented the patent office from issuing animal patents for two years. Last week, the Judiciary Committee defeated Mr. Rose's legislation. Farmers also support the legislation that exempts them from having to pay royalties on the offspring of patented livestock. Royalty payments, they argue, would be an expensive departure from usual practices in which farmers pay breeders for adult animals or for stud services, and then are free to produce and sell offspring without additional fees. Biotechnology industry executives and many molecular biologists believe such concerns are misplaced. Genetic engineering, they say, will help farmers raise productivity, and big and small farmers will benefit equally. And they argue that biotechnology companies are entitled to royalties from inventions that in many cases cost millions of dollars to develop. The battle over animal patenting now moves to the Federal court in San Francisco where several animal welfare organizations and a Wisconsin farm group brought suit last month against the patent office, contending that patenting animals is illegal. The patent office has not responded to the suit. ''Congress never intended that animals should be viewed as compositions of matter under the patent law,'' said Steven M. Wise, an attorney from Boston and president of the Animal Legal Defense Fund, an animal welfare group. ''Animals are sentient, have consciousness, and are far above mere compositions of matter.''

264-> HORSE RACING; Personal Ensign Wins Her 10th in Row
The last filly to win her first 10 starts was Ruffian, and the last to win the Whitney Handicap was Lady's Secret. Now there is a filly who has done both of those things, and today she earned a place in history alongside those two. Personal Ensign won her 10th start without a defeat today in the 61st running of the Whitney Handicap at Saratoga Race Track, leaving the millionaires Gulch and King's Swan behind her in a three-horse Whitney that brought the fans to their feet and left them cheering her in the winner's circle. The only other filly to win the Whitney since 1948 was Lady's Secret, whose victory was instrumental in her being named the Horse of the Year for 1986. Personal Ensign, last for the first five furlongs today over a sloppy track that was favoring front-runners, accelerated boldly under Randy Romero to hook Gulch turning for home, then gradually drew away through the stretch to win by 1 1/2 lengths. Gulch, a 4-year-old colt who carried 124 pounds and conceded 7 pounds to the filly, held on well to be second, 17 lengths ahead of King's Swan, a popular 8-year-old gelding who clearly disliked the footing. The filly paid $3.60 for $2 as the favorite in her first effort against male horses. A Phipps Horse Personal Ensign, a 4-year-old daughter of Private Account and the Hoist the Flag mare Grecian Banner, was bred by her owner, Ogden Phipps. She is trained by Claude (Shug) McGaughey, as is her 5-year-old brother, Personal Flag, who won the Suburban Handicap at Belmont last month. Personal Ensign, who won both her starts as a 2-year-old and all four of her starts last year, this season has won four straight handicap stakes: the Shuvee, Hempstead, Molly Pitcher and Whitney. ''I can now say she is the best horse I ever rode,'' said Romero, who has been on her every time she has raced. ''She ran a great race.'' D. Wayne Lukas, who sent out Lady's Secret to win the Whitney two years ago and settled for second place with Gulch today, was not entirely satisfied with the result. ''I think it came down to the weight difference,'' he said. ''It came down to the seven pounds, and with the mud, it's more.'' Dick Dutrow, King's Swan's trainer, was more admiring of the winner. ''I take my hat off to the filly,'' he said. ''She's incredible.'' Gulch, whose only career victory at more than a mile was over a sloppy track last year, went to the front as expected today and set moderate fractions of 0:23 3/5, 0:47 2/5 and 1:11 3/5 under Jose Santos. King's Swan, ridden by Angel Cordero Jr., was trying to keep up but floundering. Romero, never more than four lengths off the lead, was waiting to pounce. Personal Ensign moved to within a length after six furlongs, then moved up outside Gulch around the turn. She got a head in front after a mile in 1:35 3/5, then pulled away as she ran the final furlong in 0:12 1/5. The question now is whether Personal Ensign will ever run against male horses again. McGaughey feels he has proved his point, and said her next two starts would be against fillies, in the Ruffian Handicap at Belmont Sept. 25 and the Beldame Stakes Oct. 16. McGaughey would then have to decide which Breeders' Cup race Oct. 5 should close out her campaign - the $1 million Distaff against fillies or the $3 million Classic against male horses. The next time Lukas tries her, it may be with Winning Colors, the 3-year-old filly he sent out to win this year's Kentucky Derby. NO TOTAL WASHOUT The day was far from a total washout for Lukas and Cordero. Each won three other races on the card, including a joint effort with High Brite, who beat Abject by 1 3/4 lengths as the 2-5 favorite in the A Phenomenon Stakes. High Brite ran six furlongs in 1:10 1/5 to win his fourth straight stakes race. . . . Gulch, who was second in last year's Whitney to Java Gold, is being syndicated for stallion duty and will be retired to Lane's End Farm in Lexington, Ky. at the end of this season.

265-> HOME VIDEO/NEW RELEASES; A 1939 Weepie
THE OLD MAID Starring (left to right in photo) Miriam Hopkins, George Brent and Bette Davis. 1939. MGM/UA Home Video. 96 minutes. $24.95. The trouble begins about the time that ''crazy and impulsive'' (if you can believe it) George Brent returns from somewhere to find that Miriam Hopkins, his betrothed, is about to marry the richest fellow in town. But Miriam's cousin, Bette Davis, makes herself available for an hour, and when next we meet her, Mr. Brent has fallen at Vicksburg and Miss Davis is bringing up the product of their night of love. ''I will not give up my own baby,'' she tells Miss Hopkins, who thereupon gets in the way of Miss Davis's chance to marry the next richest fellow in town. How and why Miss Davis turns into an old maid takes up most of ''The Old Maid,'' a 1939 weepie that is a must for any fan of the genre. Under the direction of Edmund Goulding, who allows no emotion to go unsqueezed, and doused in Max Steiner's borrowings from 19th-century tunes, this period piece of unrequited love, maternal love and sacrificial love gives Miss Davis a chance to age into an ''old and hideous and dried up'' creature, as her own daughter (who does not, of course, know that they are related) describes her. The last scene between Miss Hopkins and Miss Davis is guaranteed to bring out every lavender-scented handkerchief in the house.

266-> More Science Teaching
To the Editor: You give prominence to a discussion of the choice of ''great books'' for a proper college education (Week in Review, May 29). This argument in the humanities is not unimportant, but suggests the old BurmaShave ad that asked whether you preferred the product in a tube or in a jar. A possibly more important question is the relative emphasis that colleges should place on science. Many, perhaps most, of this country's elite liberal arts institutions require only two half-courses in science and mathematics combined, and often offer a special half-course for nonscientists; in some instances, psychology is counted as a biological science. At Harvard, these requirements constitute 6 percent of the total curriculum. Is this an adequate science requirement for the modern world? F. H.

268-> Rufus C. Harris, 91, Educator in the South
Rufus C. Harris, former president of Mercer and Tulane universities, died Thursday. He was 91 years old. Dr. Harris was president of Tulane, in New Orleans, from 1937 to 1960. In 1943, as chairman of a special committee of the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, he helped restore accreditation to the University of Georgia and nine other state-operated colleges. The schools were suspended by the association in 1941 after Gov. Eugene Talmadge had dismissed educators and regents for favoring educational opportunities for blacks. The committee restored the Georgia schools to good standing after Mr. Talmadge's successor, Ellis Arnall, appointed new regents and pledged to end political interference. After leaving Tulane, Dr. Harris led the Baptist-affiliated Mercer, which has campuses in Macon and Atlanta, for 20 years until 1980. That year the position of chancellor was created for him, which he held until his death. Dr. Harris persuaded Mercer's trustees to integrate the student body in 1963 and to begin accepting Federal grants in 1969. His wife of 63 years, Mary Louise Walker Harris, died in 1981. Survivors include three sons, J. H. Walker Harris of Columbus and Rufus C. Harris Jr. and Louie K. Harris, both of New Orleans; nine grandchildren, and 10 great-grandchildren.

As Vice President Bush and Governor Dukakis curtail campaigning and prepare for their nationally televised 90-minute debate Sunday in Winston-Salem, N.C., both sides are looking toward that all-important post-debate spin. That is, sending high-profile surrogates into the press room to feed reporters and tell them that their candidate was, well, nothing short of Lincolnesque. The Democrats are sending a plane Sunday to Winston-Salem loaded with such heavyweight spinners as Governor Cuomo and Senator Edward M. Kennedy. ''We don't need an Army like they have,'' said Mark Goodin, a Bush spokesman, indicating that the Vice President's campaign was content with such spinners as Mr. Baker, Robert Teeter, Mr. Bush's pollster, and Lee Atwater, his campaign chairman. ''We've got a well-run platoon.''

273-> Senate Approves Joining Copyright Convention
After more than 100 years, the Senate approved American participation in the Bern copyright treaty today in an action that will help Americans protect their copyrighted material abroad. The Senate action was largely a formality since both the Senate and the House of Representatives recently passed legislation to bring United States laws into conformity with the Bern treaty. According to Ralph Oman, the Register of Copyrights, the act of joining the copyright convention will convey some benefits, such as extending protection to American copyright holders in countries that do not have separate treaties with the United States so that stolen or pirated copies of the works of Americans can no longer be reproduced there with impunity. Procedural Requirements Cut Also, copyright holders in those countries, which include Egypt, Turkey, Thailand, South Africa and the former French colonies in Africa, will receive copyright protection in the United States. The increased copyright protections will apply to books, movies and such business products as computer programs and data bases. The treaty convention also formally removes many of the procedural requirements for obtaining copyrights. For example, a copyright will be regarded as occuring at the moment of creation, so it need not be registered at the Library of Congress. Such protection has been provided for several years, but joining the Bern treaty formally codifies it. ''Copyright will occur when the author lifts the pen from the paper,'' said Lewis Flacks, a policy planning adviser to Mr. Oman. In addition, people will not have to deposit copies of their work with the Library of Congress, a requirement that helped the library become the world's greatest repository of such material. But Mr. Oman expects people to continue to make such deposits, if only out of pride. The Final 2 Steps Perhaps the change that will become most quickly apparent to consumers will be that copyrighted itrems will no longer have to display the copyright symbol - c. The Bern treaty, Mr. Oman said, moves away from the formality traditionally favored by United States officials. Two requirements remain before the United States becomes the 77th nation to join the Bern convention of 1886: The enabling legislation that Congress passed must be signed into law by President Reagan, and a copy of the approved treaty must be sent to the World Intellectual Property Organization in Geneva, again by the President. He is expected to take both steps shortly. While authors and computer-program writers will benefit from today's action, the writers and directors of films lost their fight to have the United States law include a ''moral rights'' provision that would protect their work against changes they do not authorize. ''This Congressional act is a travesty,'' said Glenn Gumpel, executive director of the Directors Guild of America.''The United States Congress, in the face of powerful money interests, has flown directly in the face of the requirement of the Bern treaty. This treaty requires each member nation to have, in its domestic law, a moral rights concept which gives to an artist the right to credit and the right to object to any use of his or her works which is 'prejudicial to his honor or reputation.' '' Members of Congress and movie producers and exhibitors who did not want a ''moral rights'' provision said movie writers and directors were protected by existing laws covering unfair competition, defamation and privacy rights. That position is disputed by the Directors Guild.

275-> Prime Minister of Iran Retracts a Resignation
Iran's Prime Minister has withdrawn his resignation under orders from Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, official Iranian news outlets said today. The Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, said the Prime Minister, Mir Hussein Moussavi, told Ayatollah Khomeini in a letter Tuesday he would retract his resignation ''out of concern for Islam and the revolution and the interests of the country.'' Mr. Moussavi later led a meeting of his 21-member Cabinet and said the Ayatollah's ''instruction'' was a ''divine gift,'' the Teheran radio reported. But he was quoted as citing ''difficulties in the decision-making process in the executive'' that he hoped the Ayatollah's action would eliminate. He did not elaborate, but the remark appeared to be criticism of President Hojatolislam Ali Khamenei, one of his political rivals. Mr. Moussavi said he was resigning because as many as eight of his ministers, more than a third of his Cabinet, would fail to win a vote of confidence in Iran's 270-seat Parliament. On Tuesday, hours before the Parliament was to vote on the Cabinet, Ayatollah Khomeini's office said Mr. Moussavi's resignation was rejected.

276-> Playing Fast and Loose on the Poverty Line
To the Editor: In his letter arguing that America is ''better off'' now than when Ronald Reagan took office (April 22), Thomas Griscom, a Presidential aide, displays a strange sense of values - and a strange sense of mathematics. First, he reports that the percentage of Americans living below the poverty line in 1986 ''stood at 13.6 percent, only .6 percentage points above the 1980 level.'' Then he says that the number of Americans in poverty rose by ''just'' 1.7 percent from 1980 to 1986, while the total U.S. population rose by 5 percent. But intuition or some simple calculations will tell you that if the poverty rate increased, then the number of people in poverty had to have risen at a faster rate than the population did. More to the point, why does Mr. Griscom cite the smallness of the increase in the poor population as an achievement of the Reagan Administration, instead of admitting its failure to reduce poverty? His array of glittering indicators for the economy as a whole - which have benefited the wealthy more than anyone - sets off this deficiency even more starkly. And the contrast is starker yet to anyone who has witnessed the simultaneous proliferation, during the Reagan era, of homeless and of stretch limousines in New York City. Any numbers for that?

278-> IF BILLY BUDD HAD BEEN A RAT
A CHOCOLATE SOLDIER By Cyrus Colter. 278 pp. New York: Thunder's Mouth Press. Cloth, $19.95. Paper, $9.95. Meshach Barry, the aging black clergyman who narrates Cyrus Colter's fifth book of fiction, warns the reader to expect ''page after page rife with ellipses, plus a pastiche or potpourri of ever-escalating incidents, piled one on top of another, all now and then punctuated, I hate to tell you, by my sad, guilt-ridden rhetorical outbursts on far, far too many pages of this mangled score, ending finally in the inevitable elisions and erasures betokening my total rout. A holy mishmash.'' Faced with this self-mocking magniloquence, how do we judge the meaning of the events of this book? Ostensibly the book is Barry's confession of his life's iniquities, counterpoised against the long-ago glories of a martyred friend and rival, Cager Lee. He first shows us young Cager looking like a prophet. In the blazing sunlight with his arm uplifted, Cager harangues Barry about the need to end racism. They are standing at a Jim Crow bus stop in the 1940's in Valhalla, Tenn., where they go to Gladstone College. At this very moment of articulating his dreams, Cager comes eye to eye with a ''pink-jowled, patrician old woman'' whose life he is destined to change - and to end. Hinted at from the first page, this promised death scene lures us toward an apotheosis of eloquence near the book's perplexing end. Is Cager idealism's martyr, or is his life just a terrible waste? Scenes from his youth, as he witnesses brutality and faces his own fears and inadequacies, are so vivid we might indeed see naive Cager as a kind of rural Billy Budd, possessing a bewildered purity, fated for martyrdom. But the skewed narrative makes us wonder what to think. Barry's oratorical homage is discredited by the admitted facts of his own life as an unfaithful friend, incestuous father, convicted embezzler and sometime mental patient. Barry even undercuts the climactic scene by telling it while he is sitting on a toilet. Indeed, the real climax may be in the reader's recognizing that the voices who mythologize the lives of the oppressed are voices we must be wary of.

279-> Migrant Farm Workers' Unexpected Worry: New Alien Law
Migrant farm workers, still America's most afflicted class of laborers despite slowly improving working conditions, are now grappling with problems from an unexpected source: the 1986 immigration law. Provisions of the law were supposed to free seasonal agricultural workers, most of whom are aliens, from the fear of deportation and provide fruit and vegetable farmers with a reliable pool of legal workers. But both farmers and farm workers say they are worried. Itinerant laborers from Florida to New England fear that growers plan to replace them with imported foreign pickers, an option possible under the immigration law if there is an imminent shortage of farm workers to harvest perishable crops. Poverty in Common The unfolding controversy involves workers who share little except poverty and back-breaking work. Data on itinerant farm labor have historically been elusive because of their mobility and the desire of both farmers and hired seasonal hands to keep their relationship off the books. Major growers of fruit and fresh vegetables say they expect the new law to greatly shrink the numbers of available workers. They expect migrants and other farm help who gain legal status to seek less arduous unskilled jobs in the construction, hotel and food industries, once they are freed of the fear of deportation. Those aliens who do not qualify for legal status may not be employable in farm work if the Federal authorities, as promised, crack down on farmers who use them after a grace period expires Dec. 1. In Florida, farmers expect a labor shortage as early as next winter in the state's $2 billion citrus industry. Growers have contingency agreements between Mexico and the West Indies nations to open the way to import thousands of temporary workers if the move is approved by the United States Department of Labor. Fewer Hands and More Oranges The citrus industry this year is reporting its largest harvest since 1980-81. Unless a big freeze cripples the industry, crop sizes are expected to increase dramatically over the new few years. ''We have fewer hands to pick more oranges, and the shortages of labor can only worsen,'' said Ernie Neff, a spokesman for Florida Citrus Mutual, an industry group. Florida growers have created a network with farmers in 11 Eastern Seaboard and Midwestern states to help expedite the use of foreign pickers and share their travel costs. Advocates for migrants and locally based field workers suspect the growers are using the new immigration law as a smoke screen to keep from paying better wages and benefits as competition for labor heats up. Weak Bargaining Position Seen Foreign farm workers, these advocates argue, would be in no position to demand higher pay and improved working conditions. Since nearly all of the imported labor would be young men, they argue, growers would not feel pressure to provide adequate housing, schools and medical care. In fact, farmers do not have to pay Social Security and unemployment compensation for foreign workers. ''They don't want to compete with other sectors of the American economy for a work force,'' charged Rob Williams, director of Florida Rural Legal Services, a state antipoverty agency. Karen Woodall, executive director of Florida Impact, which lobbies on behalf of migrant workers, promised a fight against use of foreign workers. ''If the states allow the farmers to bring in thousands of workers, the public will have to pick up the welfare tab for the workers who are left unemployed and homeless,'' she said. Not Greed but Survival The farmers say they do not welcome the prospect of importing labor but, if they are forced to do so, the motive will not be greed but simple survival. The tightest pinch is expected in Florida and other Eastern states where unemployment is low and where, in recent years, there has been greater dependence on migrant labor. The faces of the migrant workers have changed in the last decade as more Americans, principally Southern blacks, have dropped out of the army of pickers who follow the sun. Spanish-speaking workers of Mexican heritage now dominate the ranks of migrants who travel from Florida, their winter base, to farms in the north, according to agriculture observers. There are perhaps 150,000 or more itinerant field hands in Florida, but only an estimated 20,000 head north at this time of the year, not to return until the fall, according to Dr. Leo Popolopus, professor of food and resource economics at the University of Florida. ''We think the Haitians and Central American workers will be the first to flee farm work once they have legal status and a green card that enables them to find better paying jobs,'' Dr. Popolopus said. ''Farm work is more of a tradition with the Mexicans, but they may be tempted to flip hamburgers for $5 an hour if they get the chance.'' The use of foreign farm workers, made possible under a provision of the immigration law called section H2a, requires special permission from the Department of Labor, which can be granted only when the department finds that a critical shortage of available workers exists. 'Secret Agenda' Is Disputed Farm industry leaders say that the tightening of the labor market is unmistakable and that suggestions that the growers are devising ''a secret agenda'' to build profits at the expense of the domestic farmworker are wrong. ''Barring an economic downturn, it's a safe bet to say we will have labor shortages as early as next winter, and many farmers will have to turn to imported foreign workers,'' said George Sorn, executive director of the Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association. Mr. Sorn said his association has organized a subsidiary to help meet the need for H2a workers in 11 Northeastern states. He said he recently negotiated a contract with Mexico to allow United States farmers to tap that labor pool, if necessary. In addition, he said, some 25,000 workers on the Caribbean islands of Jamaica, St. Lucia, Dominica, Barbados, St. Vincent and Grenada would be available. Imported farm workers were used abundantly until the practice was largely halted by an outcry that their presence contributed to the poverty of the American farm worker. The largest number of pickers were brought in under the bracero program, which from 1951 to 1963 imported as many as 450,000 Mexican men a year to work in 28 states. Far fewer from the West Indies were used to harvest vegetables, fruit and sugar cane, chiefly in Florida, under a program called H2, which the Federal Government phased out by 1971. From Tobacco to Apples The new immigration act extended this program, now called H2a, to be used in the event of farm labor shortages. In the past year, additional H2a workers were brought in to pick tobacco in Virginia and apples in Massachusetts. Workers from Mexico, the West Indies and elsewhere in the hemisphere continued to work on American farms, but without legal sanction. They took a larger role in migrant labor streams in the Eastern Seaboard, often taking the place of poor blacks who were able to give up the migrant life as new social programs eased their plight, say agriculture authorities. In a recent survey by the Florida Institute of Government, major Florida growers said the new immigration law was already encouraging those who qualified for protection to leave farm work for better jobs. ''They are moving into service industry jobs which pay the same wages without all the hard work,'' said Wayne Clark, a senior fellow with the research organization. Organized labor has failed to penetrate Florida agriculture, in part because so many of the workers have been illegal aliens and because of cultural divisions among them. There are only 600 members of the California-based United Farm Workers in Florida agriculture, and organizing has been almost non-existent in this decade. Migrant workers receive help from religious and community groups that try to relieve some of the squalor that is an inseparable condition of their lives. These groups have also been active in helping workers apply for amnesty if they can prove they have lived in the United States continuously since before Jan. 1, 1982, or are eligible under the seasonal agricultural worker (S.A.W.) program. The latter gives legal status to those employed 90 days in seasonal farm work in the 12-month period ending May 1, 1986. Immigration officials had counted some 480,000 S.A.W. applications by May 4, and believe another 60,000 still-unprocessed applications may have come in by that day. The officials believe many came from people who mistakenly believed they faced the same deadline as those seeking amnesty, instead of the Nov. 30 for the S.A.W. program. California, with half the total number, had the most S.A.W. applications. Florida was second, with some 75,000, and Texas third with 30,000. Up to now, the migrants have had few options in their lives. Fearing deportation back to homelands where jobs were few and conditions even meaner, they accepted a marginal existence to put bread on the table. Whether a green card will be a passport to a new world of choices will become clearer over the next few years. At the moment they are packing their cars and pickup trucks, readying for the ritual of following the sun northward into the ripening vineyards and farmlands of America. For some of them, at least, it may be the last summer to ''go up the road.''

281-> Vietnam Leans on Yankee Ingenuity
Want to find an American product endorsed with enthusiasm in Asia? Come to Vietnam. All over the country the Vietnamese are making do with decades-old equipment manufactured in the United States, and they never pass up the opportunity to tell a visiting American how durable and well designed these products have proved to be. Senator Larry Pressler, a South Dakota Republican, was given an impromptu demonstration when he recently visited a farming village in the Mekong Delta, near the town of My Tho. As a young Army officer in the mid-1960's, Senator Pressler had been involved in a United States aid project that provided small American water pumps for irrigation. Old and Reliable Pham Van Sau, a 40-year-old farmer, was using one of those pumps, a small model made by the Kohler Company of Kohler, Wis. Twenty years ago it was worth less than $50. Mr. Sau said he had bought his, second-hand, eight years ago for about $60 in gold. It still works fine - although the fuel system is now a soda bottle and plastic tube, and the frame supporting the motor and water pipe is a locally crafted Rube Goldberg contraption. So valuable were these small Kohler pumps, Vietnamese say, that the Vietcong stole them to power boats. When the war ended with the defeat of Saigon, most of the pumps went north, where they became part of not just village life but also the Vietnamese vocabulary. Cole (pronounced KO-lay) is now a generic word for pump. When Senator Pressler asked Mr. Sau what his pump was worth now, the farmer misinterpreted the question and answered quickly, ''It's not for sale.'' On agricultural land all over south and central Vietnam, vintage John Deere and Massey-Ferguson tractors are in use. Dodge and International Harvester trucks are the backbone of commercial hauling. New Status Symbols Old De Soto buses are so highly regarded, one driver said, that ''some people paint that name on the vehicles even when they aren't De Sotos.'' Vietnamese are often surprised and incredulous when told that American products have trouble competing with their Japanese counterparts. In the remote central highlands settlement of Nam Ban - known popularly as New Hanoi because northerners have been moved there to colonize virgin land - a couple of Ford Club Wagons are the only transportation capable of handling the unpaved roads. Vietnamese cannot buy spare parts or new American goods because of a United States embargo and a lack of hard currency. At Nam Ban, the Ford vans are held together by improvisation. But their body work has not deteriorated, and their motors have been reliable. ''Tell the Ford Motor Company,'' a local Communist Party official said, ''that if they want one of these for their museum, we will give them one. And they can give us a newer model in return.''

282-> A Modernist Looks to Geometry
''My work is not spontaneous,'' Dorothea Rockburne said. ''I learned to work from studying, and I am inspired by other people's work.'' Ms. Rockburne was born in Verdun, Quebec. She went to art school in Canada, then attended Black Mountain College, the celebrated experimental arts institution in North Carolina, where her daughter, Christine, was born. She arrived in New York in the mid-1950's, living first on East 89th Street, then moving to SoHo. In the mid-60's, she danced with the experimentalist Judson Dance Theater, where she worked with Robert Rauschenberg and Robert Morris. Dance, she says, enabled her to identify herself with - in some sense to inhabit - the squares and rectangles of her paintings. In the late 60's, she was a close friend of Sol LeWitt, who, like her, was involved with mathematics and perspective, and Mel Bochner, who was also making art out of the most ephemeral materials. Other friends were Robert Smithson, Eva Hesse and Brian O'Doherty. They are a distinguished and fearless group. Many of her ''Egyptian Paintings,'' from 1979 to 1981, are white; they were exhibited on white walls. Canvases fold and unfold like drapery and flowers - almost like origami. The paintings are at the same time in profile, like hieroglyphic processions, and frontal, like Pharaonic statuary. They are pure and concentrated, sensual and austere. Her New York gallery show last month was called ''Pascal and Other Concerns.'' The paintings included the richest golds and the warmest oranges and blues. The arrangements tended to be both compact and ascending. There was a play between square and triangular canvases, painted squares and triangles, closed and open surfaces, solid and translucent color. The work is declarative and sure: Ms. Rockburne titles her paintings near the beginning of the pictorial process. It is also a journey, along edges, across surfaces, into shapes, through art. M. B.

286-> New York Republican Party Is on the Move, Not in the Doldrums
To the Editor: ''New York Republicans,'' you write (news story, June 22), ''are in the grip of a malaise that has brought the party to its lowest point since the Democrats held absolute sway over state politics in the 1930's.'' I will not reiterate the new programs, manuals and other efforts that have begun in recent years, but I do think we should look at the record. In a state where Republicans are outenrolled by more than 1 million votes, voters elect more Republicans than any other party. On a village, town and county level, it is the Republican Party that has been successful at the polls. To concede the Senate race to Daniel Patrick Moynihan before the voters have their say is like proclaiming Tom Dewey the winner before the election. If the Democrats have ''better organized and better financed'' candidates like Mark Green and John Dyson, all I can say is give us more Republicans like Alfonse M. D'Amato and the ''little-known Nassau County lawyer,'' Robert McMillan. Mr. McMillan has done more in six weeks of this campaign than some candidates do in a year. Calling our party conservative is trying to label a rose a dandelion. As you state, enrollment has not changed appreciably since 1974. So if party philosophy changed, it hasn't affected enrollment. Meanwhile, New York State has voted for a Republican President, who was also labeled too conservative, in 1980 and 1984, and elected and re-elected a Republican senator and comptroller. Our financial troubles began the day we lost the governor's election in 1974. It was not a long, drawn-out process. The ''patrician old money'' did not slowly disapper. Thanks to an energetic finance committee, money problems are largely behind us. If we are a party in the doldrums, why has participation in our annual dinners been increasing every year since 1986; why do we have more contributors than at any other time in our history, and why are we more active in helping county organizations than in the past? You are absolutely correct to cite the decline in influence of political parties - not Republican or Democrat, and not just in New York. Last January I called for election law reform to restore the importance of our political parties. The system discourages any relationship between candidates and their parties. In a primary, we are prohibited from supporting our endorsed candidate. The nominating process discourages county committee input. If the political parties are going to take the blame, they should have the responsibility and tools to do the job. At various times from 1958 to 1974, the Republican Party in New York State controlled virtually every office. We haven't won every contest since 1974, but today our political strength is less dependent on one individual. We have a party that is doing more than ever from grass-roots training to candidate recruitment and campaign assistance. We are a party on the move - not in the doldrums. ANTHONY J. COLAVITA Chairman, New York Republican State Committee Albany, July 3, 1988

287-> Scorsese's 'Last Temptation' Creates Furor at Venice Festival
It was never intended, of course, to become the Martin Scorsese Film Festival, but that essentially is what Venice has been for the last 10 days. Rarely has one director so thoroughly commanded the attention of the cinematic competition here, which has been held on and off since 1932 and certainly has seen its share of controversy over the years. Almost every day has produced a new tempest, continuing up to the last minute tonight with the festival screening of Mr. Scorsese's much-discussed, much-damned vision of Jesus's torment in his adaptation of the Nikos Kazantzakis novel ''The Last Temptation of Christ.'' First, a Milanese lawyer asked the Venetian courts to ban the film as blasphemous, and festival organizers held their breath until magistrates let the suit die the other day through a legal technicality. Roman Catholic leaders entered the fray with a chorus of condemnation that reached a peak today, when the Italian Bishops' Conference labeled the movie ''unacceptable and morally offensive.'' But instead of encouraging protests, the bishops called upon Catholics to turn their backs on Mr. Scorsese. ''The film is not worth seeing,'' they said. ''It deserves only the silence reserved for the mediocre.'' Police on Alert The bishops' recommendation notwithstanding, some Catholic organizations and conservative political groups organized demonstrations for tonight in Venice's piazzas and on the nearby Lido, where the festival is held. Alert to possible trouble, the Venice police were out in force. But for all the fuss, not much really happened, except that a big-name movie was put on display. As Mr. Scorsese's attackers and defenders both agreed, ''The Last Temptation'' amounted to little more than a noisy sideshow to the festival's main business. Closing day is Friday, and a winner is to be picked from among the 22 films eligible for the first prize, the Golden Lion. It cannot be the Scorsese movie, which was not entered in the formal competition. There was an unfamiliar touch of Hollywood in all this for a festival that is dedicated to serious, sometimes ponderous, artistic cinema. It was almost as though the sponsors had decided that anything written about Venice was fine as long as the name was spelled right. ''Altogether, it's been good; it's given us a push,'' said Guglielmo Biraghi, the festival's director, when asked about the consequences of the Scorsese uproar. For a while, Mr. Biraghi said, he was concerned that he might have reaped too much of a good thing. ''It looked like it was going to be a one-man festival,'' he said. ''But several films look like they will get through the Scorsese war.'' So does Mr. Scorsese, for that matter. He held forth confidently today at a clamorous news conference, defending his movie, as he did before its United States opening, as ''an act of faith'' and as an attempt to portray Christ as ''fully divine, fully human in one entity.'' Far from being blasphemous, he said, ''We take Him seriously and we take His message seriously, which is loving.'' Scorn for Zeffirelli Film That remark triggered a burst of spontaneous applause from many reporters at the conference - a distinct contrast to the derision that the same people had heaped two days ago on the Italian director Franco Zeffirelli when he introduced his own new film, ''The Young Toscanini.'' It was a difficult festival for Mr. Zeffirelli, whose interpretation of the musician Arturo Toscanini was greeted here with hoots, boos and whistles. Italian critics dismissed the movie as banal and historically flawed, and they were especially rough on the movie's best-known star, Elizabeth Taylor. Several critics described her as looking ''almost embalmed'' in her performance as a 19th-century Russian opera singer. Many here, including Mr. Biraghi, argued that Mr. Zeffirelli had ''kind of asked for it'' because he seemed to go out of his way to pick a public fight with Mr. Scorsese. Only a few weeks ago, he said he would withdraw his Toscanini film rather than have it appear alongside a movie that he characterized as ''truly horrible and completely deranged.'' He later changed his mind. Complicating matters were newspaper reports quoting Mr. Zeffirelli as calling ''The Last Temptation'' a product of ''that Jewish cultural scum of Los Angeles.'' The director insisted later that he had never said any such thing, but the incident took its toll nonetheless. On Wednesday he left Venice, saying he would never come back. ''You see nothing but jerks at the festival,'' he said in a parting shot. Another Film on Jesus Ironically, the Scorsese film was not the only movie about Jesus to be shown here. An Italian director, Paolo Benvenuti, entered ''The Kiss of Judas,'' which shows Judas as a man who loved Jesus but felt predestined to betray Him. The Benvenuti film was not attacked by the Catholic Church. But another movie was: ''Une Affaire de Femmes,'' an account by Claude Chabrol of abortion and rough justice during the Nazi occupation of France. In it, the star, Isabelle Huppert, recites a venomous Hail Mary that the Vatican Radio condemned early this week as sacrilegious. Also overshadowed by the Scorsese pyrotechnics was the appearance of several movies that impressed Italian critics and seemed likely contenders for the top prize. In addition to the Chabrol film, they included ''The Legend of the Holy Drinkers,'' a tale of an alcoholic outcast directed by Ermanno Olmi, and John Schlesinger's ''Mme. Sousatzka,'' which stars Shirley MacLaine as a failed pianist. Also well received was ''Landscape in the Mist,'' a story of two youngsters searching for their father that was made by the Greek director Theo Angelopoulos, and ''Camp de Thiaroye,'' a look at African infantrymen during World War II, directed by Ousmane Sembene, a Senegalese movie maker.

288-> Why Israel Is Flying Soviet Emigres Directly
To the Editor: The Israeli Government's decision on direct flights by Soviet Jews to Israel is misunderstood in your front-page story of July 4 and A. M. Rosenthal's July 12 column. The National Conference on Soviet Jewry and other major American Jewish organizations favoring freedom of choice for Soviet Jews support that decision. But the determination of where Soviet Jews go should be made by them in the Soviet Union. This is freedom of choice. The Israeli visa should not be traduced. Soviet Jews wishing to be reunited with their families in the West should apply to the appropriate Western consulate on receipt of an invitation; those accepting invitations and visas to Israel would go via Bucharest. The Soviet Union has been moving toward such a two-track system. Since January, more than 300 Soviet Jews have received permission to emigrate directly to the United States - more than three times the number permitted to do so in 1987. The Soviet Government has stated it is not concerned with the destination of emigrating Soviet Jews. Some have suggested that Soviet Jews emigrating to Israel via Bucharest should retain refugee status after arriving in Israel. This proposal undermines the meaning of Israeli citizenship, to which every Soviet Jew is entitled; constitutes an offense to Israel's nationhood, and is opposed by the organized American Jewish community.

289-> Promoting C.D.'s With Politics
Trying to harness the excitement over Presidential politics, several savings associations are offering bonuses to depositors who pick the winner of the election. They are offering ''Presidential C.D.'s,'' certificates of deposit that let customers tie their investment to a Presidential candidate and earn additional interest if they are right. This is not the first example of linking a C.D.'s yield to sporting events, Washington or otherwise. C.D.'s have been tied to the Super Bowl, for instance. But this development could give politicians and commentators some indication of what voters who save are thinking. At the Regency Savings Bank in Naperville, Ill., a suburb of Chicago, customers can gain an extra half-point in interest on a one-year C.D., above the currently offered rate of 7.5 percent, if they pick the winning Presidential candidate. Losers continue to earn the market rate. Because investors pay nothing for the chance to win, Regency's lawyers said their product does not technically qualify as gambling. When the product was introduced in mid-August, customers favored the Democratic candidate, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis. But Vice President Bush has overtaken him and leads, 2 to 1. At others savings institutions, the interest rate that can be earned rises as the margin of victory grows wider. The Merchants Bank of Boston, whose headquarters are in sight of Mr. Dukakis's State House, offers customers a Presidential C.D. for as little as $250, compared with a $2,000 minimum at Regency. Two days after the election Merchants will add one-hundredth of a percentage point to customers' C.D. rate for each percentage point of the popular vote the party of their choice receives. Thus, if Mr. Dukakis were to win 60 percent of the vote and Mr. Bush 40 percent, the rate on a four-year C.D. would rise from 8.25 percent, to 8.85 percent for investments tied to the Democrats, while the rate tied to the Republicans would be 8.65 percent. As might be considered appropriate for a Washington institution, Perpetual Savings Bank's Presidential C.D. is more of a political bellwether than a speculative vehicle. Perpetual will ask customers' preferences but will give a higher interest rate to all its Presidential C.D. customers.

291-> TV Notes/Eleanor Blau
No Adverbs Need Apply Contrary to a persistent myth, a novelist's mind does not automatically turn to mush from writing for television, or at least so Frederic Raphael says. Mr. Raphael, whose acclaimed BBC series ''The Glittering Prizes'' was seen here on public television in 1978, was talking from his home in southwest France about ''Oxbridge Blues,'' seven dramas he adapted from stories of his, which will be broadcast on Channel 13 on six consecutive Mondays, starting this Monday at 10 P.M. ''Oxbridge Blues,'' whose casts include Ben Kingsley, Ian Charleson and Susan Sarandon, appeared on the Arts & Entertainment cable network two years ago, but this will mark its public television debut. The author, who has written 14 novels and numerous screenplays, including ''Darling'' (1965), for which he won an Oscar, has described ''Oxbridge Blues'' as ''mostly kind of chamber pieces - modest dramas about love and sex and honor and marriage.'' Writing for the small screen should hone one's skill for dialogue, he said, ''to the point where you would not write, for instance, 'she said angrily' and 'he retorted furiously,' '' or even '' 'she said, slamming the door,' because it would be obvious that she had gone. In general, adverbs describing the way someone speaks show the speech is not properly written.'' He added, ''A lot of so-called novels convey too much information in dialogue and leave nothing to the reader's imagination.'' A New Tinker Team Grant Tinker, who brought NBC to its glory years in his five-year run as chairman of the network, and who left when it was bought by General Electric in 1986, is re-assembling some of his supporting cast in his new life as an independent producer. One of the first people he hired after creating GTG Entertainment was Steve Friedman, a Tinker accolite and former ''Today'' show producer. Mr. Friedman left the network to head GTG East, which will produce news-based programs for Mr. Tinker. And today it will be announced that M. S. (Bud) Rukeyser Jr., an NBC executive who had been an intimate member of the Tinker circle at NBC, will join him upon leaving the network tomorrow. He will be a GTG general executive, based in New York, with wide-ranging responsibilities that could include reading and writing scripts. He will also serve, as previously planned, as a consultant to NBC. ''I'm sure there's not anybody who ever worked for Grant who doesn't wish that he could do it again,'' Mr. Rukeyser said. ''It's the best of all worlds, short of having a Rockefeller as a parent. This is as good as it gets.'' 'Shalom Sesame' How do you talk to a Hebrew-speaking porcupine? ''Carefully,'' joked Itzhak Perlman, the violinist, who will chat with the creature - the Israeli equivalent of Big Bird on ''Sesame Street'' - on Channel 13 tonight at 9. Mr. Perlman and the actress Bonnie Franklin will meet Sesame counterparts including an Israeli grouch, Moishe Oofnick. The occasion will be ''Shalom Sesame,'' the first of five programs intended to introduce American youngsters and their elders to the Hebrew alphabet, counting, everyday words and other aspects of Israeli culture. Actually, it's an English-language adaptation of ''Rechov Sumsum,'' which is the Israeli version of ''Sesame Street,'' the award-winning show for pre-schoolers. After tonight's opener, the series will re-start on Monday and continue through Friday at 8 A.M., repeating at 5 P.M. ''Sesame Street'' is now seen in some 75 countries, in a dozen languages - either the American show produced by the Children's Television Workshop or shows it co-produces with various countries. There are no plans so far for adaptations of other Sesame counterparts, but a spokeswoman for the workshop said that was a ''distinct possibility.''

293-> More Businesses and Schools Join To Attack Illiteracy in Workplace
The nation's shortage of literate workers has spawned some unconventional partnerships between business and education. Southeast Community College in Lincoln, Neb., for example, offers courses in the fundamentals of reading and writing, teaching adults who are functionally illiterate, including some who are literate in a language other than English. The courses are taught not on a leafy campus but at factories that make water beds, electric circuit breakers and machinery. The students are workers at those plants. In each case, Southeast provides the instructors and materials, with financing from the Federal Government's Adult Basic Education program. The companies provide classroom space and usually pay workers for time spent in class. Arrangements like these have slowly been bubbling up around the country as businesses find prospective employees cannot read or write well enough to function effectively in the workplace. Colleges are pitching in either because they are trying to meet the needs of their communities or are looking for new pools of students. Arrangements Still Rare But David Harman, a professor of education at Teachers College of Columbia University, and the author of two books on illiteracy, suggests the number of such arrangements is still minuscule, perhaps 200 at most. ''Businesses want to hire people with an education and they want the educational system to do the work,'' he said. Last year, after hearing business leaders discuss the problems they have with functionally illiterate workers, Southeast officials started a program at the Square D Company, which makes ciruit breakers. The class enrolled 26 employees, many of them immigrants, who could not read or write beyond the the fourth- or fifth-grade level. ''Some of the people made as much as a two-grade-level increase within two months,'' said Curt Sederburg, coordinator of academic studies at Southeast. Southeast has also operated a basic English program for Asian refugees at Land and Sky Manufacturing Inc., a water bed maker. ''If you ask someone to pick up a hammer and they come back with a broom, it's frustrating,'' said James E. Wood, the company's vice president. He has found that workers who go through the classes are more loyal and advance more readily to higher-paying positions. Technology Creates Need Mr. Sederburg says that the college, operated by 15 Nebraska counties, runs the programs because it sees its mission as providing avenues to meaningful jobs or for improvement of skills. ''Technology has changed so rapidly that it requires people to upgrade their education in order to fulfill the requirements,'' he said. By holding classes at the factories, the college allows the workers to avoid a second commute. Workers intimidated by the elite aura of a college campus may more readily take classes at the factory, Mr. Sederburg said. The City University of New York, with prodding from the city's business leaders and money from the State Municipal Assistance Corporation, runs literacy programs for 7,000 students at 13 of its colleges. It also has contracts with 54 companies, hotels, hospitals and business groups for courses in such basic skills as blueprint reading, computer basics, even a city geography course for taxi drivers. Companies that run their own basic skills program include Polaroid Corporation, which has a program for 250 workers, and Onan Corporation in Fridley, Minn., with one for 50 people. Planters Peanuts in Charlotte, N.C., operates a basic skills program taught by local school teachers. Stouffer Foods in Gaffney, S.C., offers a high school equivalency program taught by a teacher paid by the local school district. Mr. Harman thinks the numbers of partnerships between business and education will grow because companies ''simply will not be able to wait around for schools to do a better job.''

294-> Owners to Act On Giamatti as Commissioner
Major-league baseball club owners stood ready to name A. Bartlett Giamatti commissioner-designate today at their quarterly meetings in Montreal. A source familiar with the owners' thinking said last night that, barring a last-minute change of plans, Giamatti would be named to succeed Peter Ueberroth despite some opposition to him in the American League. Giamatti, the National League president, would be given the title commissioner-designate, the source said, and work with Ueberroth during Ueberroth's final year in office. His five-year term expires in October 1989. Ueberroth met late last night with the executive council, which is made up of four owners from each league and the league presidents. The source said Ueberroth wanted to determine how the owners felt about acting now. The source also said it was believed that the Chicago White Sox, the California Angels and perhaps the Boston Red Sox did not favor naming the former president of Yale now. Another source indicated last week that no action would be taken until after the World Series. That thinking, however, apparently changed when the owners gathered in Montreal yesterday. A few clubs could not block Giamatti's election. He needs three-fourths of the votes, which means six could be opposed and he could still be named.

296-> Reagan Asks Increase for Education in '89 Budget
President Reagan proposes increases for the Education Department, the air traffic control system and the Federal crackdown on drug trafficking and white-collar crime as part of his $1.1 trillion budget for 1989, according to confidential budget documents. The proposed increase for the Education Department in the fiscal year 1989, which begins Oct. 1, represents a turnabout for the Reagan Administration, whose efforts to cut Federal spending on education have repeatedly been rebuffed by Congress. For 1989 it is proposing spending of $20.3 billion, up from the $18.4 billion education budget this year, according to budget documents obtained by The Associated Press. An Effort to Minimize Conflict The proposal includes spending $300 million additional to teach poor children, and it proposes a tax break for families who use United States savings bonds for college tuition. In fact, the budget appeared to be drafted in an effort to minimize confrontations with Congress, although many spending levels are dictated by a two-year budget accord between the White House and Congress. However, in a slap at a key part of that accord, a confidential summary prepared for Mr. Reagan by the budget director, James C. Miller 3d, says mandated military outlays of $294 billion, up from $285.4 million this year, will ''necessarily place the nation's security at greater risk.'' The military spending is lower than original Pentagon plans had advocated for fiscal 1989. Detailed descriptions of the new budget, submitted to Federal agency heads this week for review, call for a $340 million increase in outlays for the toxic waste cleanup program, the nation's largest public works project. The legislation governing the program specifies what annual spending should be as well as a schedule for cleanup that necessitates higher spending. Cuts Sought for Agriculture The Office of Management and Budget summary prepared for Mr. Reagan urges him to endorse an increase in funds large enough to ''prevent any delay in starting projects ready for cleanup.'' Mr. Reagan approved the budget draft on Wednesday. He is to submit his budget to Congress in mid-February. The draft budget proposes an Agriculture Department budget of $51.5 billion, down from $56.5 billion in 1988 outlays, with sharp cuts in rural housing programs. For the Energy Department, the Administration proposes spending $3.66 billion, up from $2.47 billion in 1988. Included is a $230 million installment toward the eight-year $5.3 billion project to build the world's most powerful atom smasher. For the Transportation Department, spending of $26.66 billion is proposed, up from $26.2 billion. The draft budget calls for increasing funds to modernize the air traffic control system and proposes eliminating subsidies for mass transit. Sale of Amtrak Urged The Administration is proposing spending $5.54 billion for the Justice Department, up from this year's $5.36 billion. The department budget includes an incrase of $73 million for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, part of it to go to drug enforcement and the investigation of white-collar crime. The Administration is also renewing recommendations previously shunned by Congress to sell the Amtrak rail passenger service, terminate the direct loan program of the Small Business Administration, abolish the Interstate Commerce Commission and reduce or eliminate mass transit grants and low-income housing subsidies. The new budget calls for a record $1.104 trillion in spending in 1989 against projected receipts of $968 billion, yielding a deficit of $136 billion, as specified by the budget-balancing law. Private forecasters have projected a deficit far above that.

300-> Antiques Preview; WINTER'S GLITTER
NO GATHERING OF ANTIQUES is more eagerly anticipated in New York than the Winter Antiques Show, which opens with a series of preview parties on Friday and runs through Jan. 31 at the Seventh Regiment Armory, at Park Avenue and 67th Street. Now in its 34th year, it is one of the city's smartest social charities (proceeds benefit the East Side House Settlement in the South Bronx) as well as a showcase for many of this country's top dealers. Just how this season's show will fare, given the state of the economy, is debatable. ''Business is still good,'' says Herve Aaron, who runs the New York branch of Didier Aaron and in recent years has expanded a basically French line to include Russian and English items. ''So far, the market has only been affected in medium-price-range objects. That's where things are selling slowly and prices are falling. As for top-quality antiques, they're going through the roof.'' And top quality is what dealers at this show profess to exhibit. Indeed, this has never been a place to find bargains. But it does appear that this season dealers will avoid risks; booths will emphasize that which plays to popular tastes. ''Things with eye appeal, that's what's important,'' says Stuart P. Feld, who heads Hirschl & Adler Galleries, specializing in American and European art and American decorative arts. Cora Ginsburg, whose Madison Avenue gallery is known for its antique textiles and needlework pictures, stashes away her chosen items for months to tantalize customers. Bernard Baruch Steinitz, the Parisian antique dealer known for his collection of 17th- and 18th-century French furniture, will be the only new exhibitor this year in the limited-space show. His prize: ''A complete room of Empire furniture that has never been publicly seen before. It was made for Marie Louise, the second wife of Napoleon.'' Mr. Steinitz, who recently opened a New York gallery, also resists the idea that the antiques market is in for leaner times. ''Sure, some people may be waiting for better days,'' he says. But a true collector never sits out a sale.

301-> ONCE AGAIN, PAYTON ADJUSTS
Two days from the possible end of his 13th and final season with the Chicago Bears - or three weeks from the completion he would prefer, in Super Bowl XXII -the football career of Walter Payton has room for one last fantasy. ''There's three seconds left in the game,'' Payton said. ''We're on the 20-yard line. We're down by one 20-yard line. We're down by one touchdown. I run the ball for a touchdown and we end up winning the game. And when I run into the end zone and throw the ball down, I just fly off.'' He meant upward. Payton's fantasy comes complete with its own sound effects. ''Whooooosh,'' he said. The Chicago Bears have retired No. 34. Payton has already given his formal, public goodbyes. The fans before the last regular-season home game at Soldier Field. But now comes the cruel business that can define the success or failure of a season and can push an individual's past achievements to the rear. As the Bears begin their attempt to regain a National Football League championship with a playoff game against Washington on Sunday, circumstances have returned Payton to a role he filled long before the Super Bowl was a realistic hope. Another N.F.L. Mark The numbers next to his name have established new standards. Payton's total rushing yardage of 16,726 is 4,414 greater than that of Jim Brown of the Cleveland Browns, whose record was broken three seasons ago. Payton set an N.F.L. record this season for career rushing touchdowns, 110, and came within one of Brown's record of 126 receiving touchdowns. But the numbers represent the past. Payton's increased importance to the Bears comes at the climax of a season in which the player with the most rushing yardage in N.F.L. history became the second-leading rusher on his team. ''There were times it was frustrating,'' Payton said, ''and there were times it was jubilant. Over the years, I've had to adjust and adapt to change. To say the least, it has been a very educational and enlightening year for me. I'm glad it happened.'' Neal Anderson, the Bears' second-year running back from the University of Florida, gained 586 yards this season to Payton's 533. It was the first time in Payton's 13 professional seasons that he did not lead the Bears in rushing. But the new combination was upset when Anderson strained ligaments in his left knee during the loss to Seattle on Dec. 20. The Bears hope Anderson will return in time for the Super Bowl, but for now, Payton is left to help them take the two necessary steps. The continued chill next to Lake Michigan - although the expected temperatures in the 20's might seem balmy at the end of such a bitter-cold week - will make a successful running game important. The return of Jim McMahon, the Bears' quarterback who has missed the last three games with a hamstring injury, will be aided greatly if the Bear rushers can control the game. An end to Payton's career was something to pay attention to at the end of the regular season. Earlier this week, as the Bears worked indoors at the University of Notre Dame practice facility, Payton was asked if he had thought about the fact that this game could be his last. ''Not at all,'' he said. ''You can't think about that, because if you do, you've already lost. If my last game happens, I'll think about it. But I don't think this will be my last game. I don't see any reason why it should be my last game.'' A Game to Forget Washington offers one good reason. A year ago, the Redskins ended any Bear hopes of a meeting with the Giants in the National Conference championship game and a second consecutive Super Bowl. Against Doug Flutie, who was replacing the injured McMahon, the Redskins intercepted two passes and recovered two fumbles - one by Payton - and won, 27-13, at Soldier Field. Payton's rushing total of 38 yards, on 14 carries, was the second lowest of his career in a playoff game. His lowest yardage in a playoff game - the 32 he gained in the N.F.C. championship victory over the Rams in 1985 - was overshadowed by an overwhelming display of a powerful defense. Later that month, Payton did not score a touchdown in the Super Bowl victory over New England; William Perry did. Two years later, Perry has lost his spots both as a starting defensive tackle and as a curiosity. Payton still has his chance. ''I think everybody likes to be challenged, for their skills and their talents to be pushed to the limit,'' Payton said. ''It brings out the best in you. I'm not different than anybody else. I like the competition. I also like to win.''

304-> An Aids Nightmare
LATE ON AN UNUSUALLY WARM June 1 afternoon last year in East Baltimore, Jewel Foster Lyles, 25 years old, was walking down East Federal Street, which was littered with empty liquor bottles and food wrappers. Mrs. Lyles, a dark, statuesque woman with a broad forehead and a vibrant smile, was two weeks past term with her second child. Her cheerful demeanor belied a difficult life. She had dropped out of school when she was 16 and had had a daughter the next year by Jerra Lyles. She had married Lyles five years later, but the marriage didn't last. Now, pregnant with a child from a new boyfriend, she lived with her parents on East Oliver Street, one block from East Federal. She was on maternity leave from a job as a housekeeper at Johns Hopkins Hospital. As she walked down the street, she saw Andre Williams and Lamont Jones fighting. Williams and Jones were standing at the corner in front of a boarded-up brownstone, arguing heatedly over a girlfriend. Jewel Lyles knew both men well. Her brother had dated Williams's sister, and she had gone to summer barbecues at Williams's house. She crossed East Federal Street and walked toward them. As she neared, Jones began hitting Williams with a metal table leg. Williams ran into his home and got the first weapon he saw - his father's compound hunting bow. The pulley-driven bow, used for hunting deer, was as powerful as a shotgun. As Williams came out of the house brandishing the bow, in which he had inserted a 30-inch razor-tipped arrow, Jones was walking down the street past Mrs. Lyles. Williams yelled ''Watch out'' at her, and she threw herself face first against a chain-link fence. But because of her pregnant belly she jutted out over the thin strip of sidewalk. Williams let fly the arrow, which struck Mrs. Lyles in the abdomen, penetrating from one side to the other. She clung to the fence, desperately trying to remain standing. IF THE FIRST PHASE OF THE AIDS EPIDEMIC took place in gay neighborhoods, the second phase, spread primarily through drug needles, is taking place in the poorer black and Hispanic neighborhoods. And - despite assurances from medical experts that the risk of transmission without injection or sexual contact is minute - the epidemic is creating fear not only among the people who live there but among the health workers, policemen and firefighters who daily treat the victims of drugs and violence. John D. Britcher and Gary R. Brewer had just begun their 5 P.M. night shift. Britcher, 25 years old, is a bear of a man, but he has a baby face and a gentle disposition. He is the fourth generation in a family of Baltimore firemen. Since 1981, he has been a paramedic - part of the Fire Department's Emergency Medical Services. Britcher has a reputation for liking the action. He also likes to help people - he even spends his time off on his hometown's volunteer fire department. Brewer, 41, has been a fireman since he returned from Vietnam in 1969. He is thin, with a pock-marked face framed by aviator-style glasses. He is jovial, but nervous. He doesn't like ambulance duty - ''I didn't sign on to do this,'' he says - but because of the shortage of paramedics, he, like other firefighters in Baltimore, must ride with a paramedic twice a month. Britcher and Brewer were on their way to another call when they were directed to East Federal Street. ''Woman shot with bow and arrow,'' they heard over the radio. Just as they turned the corner onto East Federal, Jewel Lyles fell to the ground. ''It was like a deer that had got shot,'' Britcher recalled. A large crowd had gathered around her. Four firemen arrived at the same time in a fire engine, and while they got the stretcher ready, Britcher and Brewer, their bare hands and sleeves soaked with blood pouring out of Mrs. Lyles' belly, removed the tip and back of the arrow sticking out of her side and tried to bandage the wound. ''I feel like I am back in 'Nam again,'' Brewer told one of the firemen. Britcher and Brewer and the fireman lifted Mrs. Lyles, who was still breathing, onto the stretcher and into the orange and white ambulance. One of the firemen took the wheel, and Britcher and Brewer rode in the back with Mrs. Lyles. ON THE WAY TO THE HOSPITAL, she continued to regurgitate blood. By the time they arrived at Johns Hopkins Emergency, blood covered the ambulance floor and was running out from under the doors onto the ambulance pad. Britcher and Brewer were dripping with it. The two men wheeled Mrs. Lyles down the hall to Critical Care Area 4, where she was readied for emergency surgery. Dr. Timothy G. Buchman, the director of adult trauma services, took over. Buchman, 32, a short, stocky man with a large round face and wire-rimmed glasses, looks a little like Radar O'Reilly in the television series ''M*A*S*H.'' A graduate of the University of Chicago, he came to Johns Hopkins in 1980 as an intern. Like Britcher, Buchman has not acquired the hardened sensibility of someone who must deal constantly with violent death. As the doctors and nurses prepared to operate, Buchman felt the tension rise in the room. ''You normally deal day in and day out with people suffering from drugs and violence, but a pregnant woman didn't fit the character of the violence we'd seen,'' he recalled. ''You also had the arrow still sticking through her. It is always a little disconcerting when the instrument of violence is still there.'' Jewel Lyles was breathing, but had no blood pressure. Buchman decided to try to save both the baby and the mother. While one surgeon clamped the aorta to direct the flow of blood to the mother's heart and brain, Buchman and an obstetrical resident performed a Caesarean to deliver the baby. Mrs. Lyles died on the operating table, but her baby boy was delivered alive and, after being resuscitated, was sent upstairs to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Buchman was splattered on his bare arms with the mother's and her baby's blood. At the Neonatal Unit, one of the nurses recalled that Mrs. Lyles had been coming in for prenatal care and got out her chart. She discovered that Mrs. Lyles had tested HIV positive - she was a carrier of the AIDS virus. The nurse called down to another nurse in the emergency room, who inadvertently blurted out the news to a policeman who was standing there. The word spread quickly. When Buchman heard, he started to worry that he might have gotten the AIDS virus. Meanwhile, Britcher and Brewer washed up without changing their bloodstained clothes and hosed the blood off the floor of their ambulance. They stood around the emergency room talking until Mrs. Lyles's baby was sent to the Neonatal Unit. Then, summoned by another emergency, they left in their ambulance. When the policeman who had been in the emergency room got back to his station, he called Lieut. Frank E. Weller, who has been a shift supervisor of emergency personnel on Baltimore's East Side for the last eight years. Weller drove to the scene of an accident where Britcher and Brewer were. Weller repeated the rumor and asked the men if they had any open cuts or sores. Weller said he was going to find out from the hospital whether the rumor was true. Angry that the hospital hadn't told the two men about Mrs. Lyles's condition, Weller, a wiry man with a thin mustache, went to Johns Hopkins to demand the truth. The nursing director refused either to confirm or deny the rumor. When Fire Department officials later tried to find out from Johns Hopkins whether Mrs. Lyles was an AIDS virus carrier, the hospital would not tell them. The information was confidential, hospital officials said. Without open cuts, through which Jewel Lyles's infected blood could directly enter their own bloodstreams, Britcher and Brewer were not in any apparent danger. But they had never been given any training about AIDS. Britcher's initial impulse was to shrug off the risk, but Brewer was extremely nervous. He spent the next day trying to find out whether Mrs. Lyles had been infected with the AIDS virus. In desperation, he called the Johns Hopkins Blood Bank. ''We are aware of the situation,'' a woman responded cryptically. ''Why don't you call your doctor?'' Several firemen contacted Jeff DeLisle, the president of the Baltimore Firefighters Local 734, for help. DeLisle called a reporter on a local television station to investigate. The reporter called the state medical examiner's office, which confirmed that Mrs. Lyles had been HIV positive. At that point, DeLisle recalls, ''all kinds of panic set in.'' On May 19, the Centers for Disease Control had announced the first three cases of health workers who had been infected with the AIDS virus from brief exposure to large amounts of blood, the first known transmission of the virus to health workers without prolonged exposure to bodily fluids or internal injection. Jewel Lyles was killed on June 1, the same day the Third International Conference on AIDS opened in Washington. Baltimore newspapers and television stations featured stories about the spread of the disease to health workers and about the raging debate in Washington over mandatory testing. Three days later, Dr. Hacib Aoun declared that he was suing Johns Hopkins Hospital. While a resident there, Aoun said, he had been infected with the AIDS virus when a glass capillary tube holding a patient's blood broke in his hand. AOUN'S SUIT - SINCE SETTLED out of court - was announced the same day the medical examiner confirmed reports that Jewel Lyles had carried the AIDS virus. Both stories made the front page of the Baltimore papers. Brewer and Britcher were besieged by press inquiries and by a few crank calls. One reporter called Britcher's wife at her business and told her that her husband's partner had tested positive for AIDS and was suing the city. A woman who said that she was an AIDS victim called Brewer's home and, told that he was not there, began commiserating with Brewer's 13-year-old daughter about her father's having acquired the AIDS virus. Brewer was afraid he was going to infect his wife and two children. He wouldn't sleep with his wife. ''I got very mental about it because I didn't know anything about it,'' Brewer said. He went to the Fire Department Infirmary to see Dr. Edward O. Hunt. Hunt and his assistant, Lieut. Arthur T. Gordon, did little to reassure Brewer. ''There's nothing we can do about it,'' Brewer says Gordon told him. ''If you get it, you get it.'' Brewer wanted to be placed off duty because of the anxiety he was feeling, but Hunt and Gordon turned him down. ''He wasn't injured,'' Gordon later explained. Gordon believed that there was nothing he or Hunt could have said to reassure Brewer. ''He wanted to be told that there was no danger at all,'' Gordon said. When Brewer asked about getting his blood tested, Gordon advised him to go to the Red Cross. Brewer went to his own doctor, who recommended a psychologist to him. With letters from his doctor and the psychologist and with intervention by the union, he finally convinced Hunt to let him go off duty. Bitter over the way the Fire Department had treated him, he resolved to quit at the end of the summer. Meanwhile, he made preparations with his own doctor to be tested for the AIDS virus at his own expense. Britcher initially tried not to let the incident get to him, but the press attention and the importance that local papers and television stations attached to the story unnerved him. On Sunday morning, six days after the incident, he woke up to find his wife of one year crying. Like Brewer, he had stopped having sex with his wife. Britcher was placed off duty because of family problems. He took a week off and then went on vacation. He found himself continually looking at his hands and rubbing them, as if to get off the last traces of Mrs. Lyles's blood. A month later, he arranged with the department to get an AIDS-virus test at Mercy Hospital in downtown Baltimore. The test failed to reassure Britcher. The fire department had given him a slip with ''Test for AIDS'' written in capital letters. When he showed it to the receptionist at the hospital, Britcher says, she gave him a furtive look and pushed the slip back to him with the tip of her pencil eraser. Britcher was called into a large room with cots arranged in rows, where other people were donating blood. In his case, however, a nurse brought in a long aluminum canister with a bright orange sticker that said ''Hazardous Materials.'' He would have to wait several weeks, the nurse said, before he would hear the results of the test. DR. BUCHMAN, WHO had operated on Mrs. Lyles, was familiar with the causes of AIDS, but he was still afraid. In May, four doctors had published a study of Johns Hopkins emergency-ward patients in The Journal of the American Medical Association. The study, by Drs. James L. Baker, Gabor D. Kelen, Keith T. Sivertson and Thomas C. Quinn, found that 3 percent of the critical emergency patients over 14 who came to Johns Hopkins were infected with the AIDS virus. Worse, 16 percent of the critical trauma patients between 25 and 34 - those patients that Buchman was most likely to operate on - carried the AIDS virus. Buchman figured that if he hadn't gotten the virus from Jewel Lyles, he was still running a significant risk of getting it somewhere down the line. Buchman wrote to hospital and university administrators at Hopkins, asking what would happen if he were to test positive for AIDS infection. Would the hospital acknowledge that it was work-related? If he became ill, would the hospital permit him to practice and pay his salary? Should he die, what would the hospital do for his family? The reply was that infection with the AIDS virus would not be singled out as a unique risk and that the financial safeguards would therefore not be altered. Buchman, who believed that the risk of AIDS was unique - ''unlike other risks, it is 100 percent fatal'' - met with his financial adviser to find out exactly what would happen if he got sick and died from AIDS. Afterward, he increased his life insurance by a factor of six. Buchman and Sivertson, one of the authors of the study and the director of emergency medicine at Johns Hopkins, tightened procedures in the emergency room. Caps, gowns, masks, gloves, protective shoe-coverings and goggles were made available to every doctor and nurse. Special seminars on AIDS and hepatitis B were held and attendance at the sessions was taken. SIVERTSON, WHO WAS also on the Medical Advisory Board of the Fire Department, believes that, with proper precautions, the risk of firefighters and paramedics catching the AIDS virus on the job is ''somewhere in between winning the Maryland state lottery and having the door of a 747 come off and fall down and hit you.'' Several months before the Lyles incident, Sivertson had recommended that the Fire Department issue AIDS protocols and information,but it had not. Now, in a meeting after Mrs. Lyles's death, Sivertson, with Jeff DeLisle's support, again urged Hunt and Fire Chief Peter J. O'Connor to issue protocols. Hunt took the position that the data on AIDS was changing so fast that it was impossible to issue useful information. (Asked about his view of AIDS, Hunt later told this reporter, ''What do I know about AIDS?'') After this meeting, however, Hunt relented and supervised drawing up a booklet on AIDS and a set of protocols that were issued in August. The department also held a class on AIDS and issued gloves and protective gowns to the paramedics and the firemen who were assisting them. The Fire Department and the union united to pressure Johns Hopkins to begin notifying emergency workers when they were exposed to a patient with the AIDS virus. The paramedics and firefighters saw it simply as their right to know. ''We're dealing with people providing services to the public,'' DeLisle says. ''It stands to reason, if we are put at risk we have a right to know.'' Fire Department officials also saw notification as important to morale. As it was, emergency personnel were prey to constant rumors. Shortly after Jewel Lyles's death, a firefighter gave mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to a man trapped in a burning building. Afterward, there were rumors that the man had AIDS. To calm the firefighters, the department got the medical examiner to confirm that the man, who had died, had not been infected with the AIDS virus. Another Baltimore hospital, Union Memorial, had paramedics sign a sheet when they came in, and if a patient turned out to be HIV positive, the hospital later notified them. But Johns Hopkins, Baltimore's largest and most prestigious hospital, insisted that doing so would violate patients' confidentiality. The Fire Department, with the support of the union and the police, proposed adding AIDS to the list of six infectious diseases that, by Maryland law, require notification by hospitals of emergency health workers who are exposed. Johns Hopkins referred the issue to the Governor's Advisory Council on AIDS, where it ran into heavy opposition from the council's chairman, Edward N. Brandt Jr., and from Johns Hopkins's own representatives. The Hopkins representatives insisted that they did not want to be financially responsible for notifying firefighters and paramedics when they had dealt with AIDS victims. They proposed having the State Health Department do it. Brandt, the chancellor of the University of Maryland at Baltimore, and Dr. Andrew A. Sorensen, an associate dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health and the vice chairman of the council, asked for an estimate of how much it would cost for the Health Department to notify paramedics and firemen if they were exposed. The estimate was $5.1 million a year, which included not only notification costs, but extensive counseling and testing as well. Presented with this figure, the council on Oct. 13 formally rejected the firefighters' proposal to add AIDS to the list of communicable diseases. Dr. John G. Bartlett, the director of the AIDS Care Program at Johns Hopkins and a member of the council, explained: ''If you are talking about cost-effectiveness, there is no way to justify it. The state can't afford it. The whole AIDS budget is $2 million. They are not going to pay $5 million just to find first responders.'' In an interview later, Sorensen said he felt the information the firemen and paramedics would receive could be misused. ''It can encourage victim-blaming,'' he said. ''If a person contracts AIDS through sex or drug use, it's convenient to blame the woman with the arrow. You blame the dead person and bring big lawsuits. A large proportion of the people who have AIDS are lower-class blacks. This provides opportunities for racism.'' Sorensen, Bartlett and other opponents of notification insist they would like to see some system worked out. Sorensen says that he would be willing to work with fire officials to back a federally financed program of education and treatment of which a notification was a part. ''I went on the freedom rides in 1961, and I wanted to know the political credentials of anyone on the bus,'' he says. ''I don't do that anymore. I am willing to tolerate a wide group of people to lobby with.'' THE FEAR OF AIDS that was rampant among firefighters and paramedics in the weeks after Jewel Lyles's death has abated now. The department has made some changes, but overall the situation appears to be almost the same as it was before Britcher and Brewer were exposed to Mrs. Lyles's blood. The Fire Department has provided emergency personnel with gloves, but many of them are too small for an average man's hands; and there is some evidence that paramedics and firefighters don't use them, even when they are faced with an accident in which they risk contact with another person's blood. Frank Weller thinks that the firefighters and paramedics won't really become upset about AIDS until ''a couple of people are infected by AIDS, people we know as the average Joe.'' Six months of tests on Brewer and Britcher for the AIDS virus have proved negative. But they have not gotten over the incident. Britcher plans to have himself tested every six months. At the end of the summer, Brewer decided not to quit. Baltimore's new Mayor has supported a proposal that would make firefighters eligible for pensions after only 20 years, which would mean Brewer would have less than two years left. But he is still reluctant to go out on ambulance calls, and he still worries that he might infect his wife. ''Ever since June 1, my life has been changed,'' he says. Fire Department officials now say that Brewer overreacted to the incident. Jeff DeLisle, the union official, agrees but draws a different conclusion: ''Brewer is a high-strung individual. But that's just the point. The department can't lump everyone into a particular personality. There are a lot of people who would react the way Gary Brewer did. If the department had counseling and education, they might have kept him from panicking.'' Tim Buchman and the other doctors who provide emergency services at Johns Hopkins are still worried about getting the AIDS virus. (According to the Centers for Disease Control, 12 health-care workers are now known to have acquired the AIDS virus from on-the-job exposure.) ''Most of us have had a big discussion with our family about what kind of work we do, and the risks,'' Buchman says. ''The issue is not whether we're going to treat people who are HIV positive. The issue is the unknown risk and the increment in that unknown risk if things are getting sprayed around in an uncontrolled situation. Transmission of the virus has already happened at Hopkins, and it could as easily happen during a trauma resuscitation tomorrow.'' Buchman is getting tested regularly for the AIDS virus, but has it done at a state agency rather than at Johns Hopkins. ''It is extremely difficult to guarantee 100 percent confidentiality of a medical record in any hospital,'' he says. On Dec. 16, Andre Williams went on trial for killing Jewel Lyles and her baby, who died the day after she did. Williams, 20, had been a friend of both Lyles and Lamont Jones, the man with whom he quarreled. By law, the state had to show only that Williams had intended to kill Jones. The defense argued that Williams had not really intended to fire the arrow at all; that it had gone off by mistake, when he was loosening his grip. Both Williams's and Mrs. Lyles's families were at the trial. They talked to each other in the hallway, bound together by past friendship and by the tragedy that had occurred. In deference to Mrs. Lyles's family and to her surviving daughter, who had been taunted at school, the judge ruled to keep the fact that Jewel Lyles carried the AIDS virus out of the trial, on the ground that it had no bearing on the case. But it nonetheless hovered in the background. When the tip of the arrow was introduced as evidence, it was brought in sealed in a plastic bag, even though the AIDS virus itself dies almost instantly when it leaves a person's body. The state's attorney put on two pairs of rubber gloves before picking up the bag. Later he explained, referring to the virus on the arrow, ''I didn't known if the damn thing was dead yet.'' A week later, after the jury had deliberated almost 24 hours, the foreman announced the verdict: Williams was guilty of two counts of manslaughter and a deadly weapons charge. Williams, angry, was led away in handcuffs, while his mother, clutching a Bible, sobbed.

305-> 200,000 in Mexican Capital Protest Vote Count
Responding to an opposition summons to ''defend the popular will,'' more than 200,000 people marched on the National Palace here today to support their charge of widespread vote fraud in last week's presidential election. The demonstration was called by Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the presidential candidate of the leftist National Democratic Front in the July 6 vote. It was a show of strength in what Mr. Cardenas has promised will be a permanent challenge to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary, or PRI, and its 60-year-old dominance of Mexican politics. In official election results announced Wednesday night, Mr. Cardenas won 31.1 percent of the vote, second to Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who was credited with 50.4 percent. But Mr. Cardenas has repeatedly said that a widespread vote fraud effort engineered by the Government and the PRI deprived him of several million votes and first place in the balloting. ''The Government and the president of the republic offered clean elections and respect for the will of the people,'' Mr. Cardenas said this afternoon in a speech to the multitude cheering and chanting his name. ''But since July 6, the people are being trampled, the law is being violated, and now we are in the final phase of the consummation of an enormous electoral fraud.'' That argument found strong support among Mr. Cardenas's partisans here. As they marched from the Monument to the Revolution, one of whose four pillars honors Mr. Cardenas's father Lazaro, a former President of Mexico who helped found the PRI, they chanted slogans such as ''Salinas Lies, Cardenas is President!'' and ''The People Spoke, Cardenas Won!'' At the downtown plaza where Mr. Cardenas and leaders from five left-wing parties spoke, an effigy of Mr. Salinas was hooted and jeered as it was paraded through the crowd. On banners being waved aloft, Mr. Salinas was attacked for ''economic policies that have brought hunger and misery to the people'' and as ''the candidate of usurpation.'' ''I don't know anyone in my neighborhood who voted for the PRI, so it seems impossible to me that they could have won if nobody likes them,'' said Esperanza Aranda, a 48 year-old shopowner who brought several of her children to the march. ''They are trying to impose Salinas on us by force.'' The demonstrators appeared to come from all sectors of Mexican society, and the variety of their backgrounds was itself an indication of how deeply Mr. Cardenas's nationalistic and egalitarian message has penetrated. Bearded students from the national university, peasants clutching straw hats, factory workers, and even a few prosperous-appearing young people clad in jogging suits and headbands marched together. No Violence Reported Security was heavy for the demonstration, with clusters of policemen at nearly every street corner of the downtown area and helicopters flying above the route of the march. The demonstrators had their own marshals to maintain order, and no incidents of violence were reported. In his speech, Mr. Cardenas called on his followers to ''exercise moral and political pressure'' on President Miguel de la Madrid and the ruling party. But he made it clear that while protests ''should grow and intensify,'' he intends to stay within the letter of the law. Some of his more ardent supporters from the countryside, however, indicated they favor more extreme measures if the Government does not respond to Mr. Cardenas's demands. They spoke ominously of taking up arms or seizing government buildings to press their claims, invoking the names of national heros such as Jose Maria Morelos and Emiliano Zapata. ''We are willing to die for Cuauhtemoc, if necessary,'' said Rosa Lopez Andrade, a peasant woman from Mr. Cardenas's home state of Michoacan who had come to the rally by bus with more than 100 other people from her farm cooperative. ''We are already suffering so much. We must defend ourselves and Mexico.''

308-> NEIGHBORS FIGHT PIERPOINTE PROJECT IN YONKERS
WHILE residents of the east side of Yonkers protest a Federal Court order to build 200 low-income housing units on the mainly white side of town, residents of the west side are fighting a condominium development proposed for their neighborhood because they say it would displace low-income minority families. The Yonkers Community Development Agency is accepting public comments on the proposal to build Pierpointe, a development of 1,950 condominiums in six 38-story towers, on a site that runs along the city's waterfront west of the railroad station. One-bedroom apartments would sell for about $125,000 and two-bedroom units for $160,000 - prices that the developers say make the housing affordable rather than a luxury development. One section of the development that was rezoned earlier, Scrimshaw House, is already being built in an old powerhouse on the site. It will have 138 apartments, and 60 percent of them have already been sold. The site - 24 acres running 2,250 feet along the Hudson River - is part of the neighborhood that was the focus of the city's lengthy Federal desegregation suit. After years of legal battles, Yonkers agreed last month to comply with the court's order to integrate housing by building scatter-site, low-income units in white neighborhoods. The Pierpointe site is in the southwest section of the city, where one-fifth of the city's population lives. According to the environmental-impact statement filed by the developers, one-half of the neighborhood's population is living below the poverty level. It said one-third of the residents are black and one-fifth are Hispanic; citywide, one-tenth of the population is black and one-twelfth is Hispanic. In the desegregation suit, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People successfully argued that the concentration of minorities and the poor resulted from the city's policies of segregation in the building of subsidized housing. At a recent hearing on Pierpointe, Herman Keith, a county legislator and a former president of the Yonkers chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., said that allowing Pierpointe to be built would ''resegregate the west side as we move to integrate the east side.'' He said the influx of 4,000 new residents would be mostly white and would change the area's racial balance from 52 percent minority to 52 percent white. This change, he suggested, could mean that the area would lose its minority representation on the County Board of Legislators and the Yonkers City Council. Mr. Keith represents the area on the Board. Mr. Keith said he favored a smaller project for this site and one in which 20 percent of the housing would be built for low- and moderate-income families. Bertran F. Wallace, president of the Yonkers N.A.A.C.P., noted that the Federal Court order said the city should continue to improve low-income housing throughout Yonkers. Mr. Wallace said the order to build on the east side was not a substitute for improvements being made to other housing. Critics of the Pierpointe proposal complain that the condominium project will create homeless families through gentrification of the neighborhood, as property is improved and rents rise beyond the ability of poorer tenants to pay. They suggest that property improvements, which will result in rising costs, will come about as new residents demand upgrading of the neighborhood. These issues were aired at a public hearing last month on the environmental-impact study, which needs approval by the city before the project can be built. By coincidence, the hearing took place the same night that the Yonkers City Council met and voted, in front of an angry crowd, to abide by the court's desegregation order. As the Pierpointe meeting began, Mayor Nicholas C. Wasicsko and City Manager Neil De Luca apologized for leaving to attend ''another meeting across town.'' They turned the proceedings over to Dean Grandin, director of development for Yonkers. ''It's ironic that we're here when people on the east side are putting up a fight for their homes,'' said Paul Robinson, president of the Yonkers Interfaith Education and Leadership Development, a nonprofit organization interested in improving the community. He was referring to eastsiders' opposition to the placement of low-income housing in their neighborhoods. ''If they lose, they will still have their homes,'' but if west side people are displaced, he said, ''they will have nothing.'' Pierpointe would not physically displace any families, for it would be built on land that is now empty. In the environmental study, however, the developers stated that more than 400 families, 25 rooming houses and 17 businesses would probably be forced out by increased rents after the apartments are built as the result of the neighborhood improving. An unrelated but unusual concern was raised by officials of Refined Sugars Inc., which has a refinery 50 feet away from the boundary of the proposed development. Saying that the plant produces ''noise, smells, insects and traffic,'' Dr. Andrew Parker, planning consultant for Refined Sugars, argued that apartments were incompatible with heavy industry and that building apartments next to the plant was ''asking for trouble.'' He said the new residents would undoubtedly demand restrictions on the plant and that these could drive it out of business. Another consultant for Refined Sugars, Ronald Miller, said the new apartment towers would create air currents that would draw down a plume of smoke from the factory smokestack and that this would lead to complaints. He said much of the plant noise was ''impulsive,'' coming unexpectedly from cranes and rail equipment. The survey did not take account of this noise, he said. Other objections to Pierpointe were raised by environmentalists who said it would destroy views of the river and remove the public's access to the river. On the other hand, John Gilligan of the Yonkers Chamber of Commerce said that the development would bring in $5.3 million a year in taxes, create additional housing for the city, provide 628 construction jobs and about 500 permanent jobs. It would also ''end the blight of the waterfront,'' he said. Several union representatives also praised the project for bringing in new jobs and for giving a ''shot in the arm'' to the city's economy. The apartments would be built on urban-renewal land. The Yonkers Waterfront Association was designated by the city as developer several years ago and eight acres in the middle of the 20-acre site were sold to the Waterfront concern, whose president was the developer, Melvin Weintraub, for $1 million. The development project lagged, however, when the Waterfront concern was unable to find financing. Since then, two new partners have joined: Norwood Campbell and Alex Shapiro, developers of about 3,500 apartments elsewhere, including renovation of the 350-unit Vernon Woods from a low-income complex to a medium-priced condominium in Mount Vernon. Mr. Campbell said the company had been able to raise financing even though ''Yonkers is not perceived as the best place to lend your money.'' He said the project had to be large because it involved building a bridge over the railroad tracks and a public walkway along the river, as well as improving three streets passing under the railroad tracks. Those costs must be spread over a large number of units, he said. The project was one of four temporarily stopped during a two-month freeze order by Judge Leonard B. Sand of Federal District Court in Manhattan, who would not allow it to proceed until the City Council agreed to carry out his desegregation order. The environmental study had been scheduled to be kept open for comments only until Thursday, but after complaints about the deadline at the hearing, the Community Development Agency agreed to accept comments until Feb. 26. After that, the developer will have to obtain a rezoning order to build the project. Mr. Campbell said that the developers hoped to start work this year and that they would build the six towers over a five-year period.

309-> Oust the P.L.O.'s Mission at the U.N.
Should the mission of the Palestine Liberation Organization to the United Nations remain on American soil? That is for the American people to decide, and Congress has decided that it should not. But the real question is: Should the P.L.O. be in the United Nations in the first place? Last week, the U.N. approved two resolutions challenging the closing of the P.L.O. mission. But if the U.N. is supposed to stand for anything, it is for the nonviolent resolution of conflict. All member states, the U.N. Charter says, ''shall settle their international disputes by peaceful means.'' Further: ''All members shall refrain from the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.'' Peaceful resolution of conflict. Respect for the integrity of member states. These are the pillars on which the United Nations was built, the Twin Commandments of the U.N. Charter. Although some member states have been willing to violate these principles, none have had the temerity to deny their validity. After all, murderers may protest their innocence but they seldom say there should not be laws against murder. Though the United Nations Charter may be impotent, it is not invalid. Now what about the P.L.O.? It, too, has a charter. Article 19 of the ''Palestine National Covenant'' states the P.L.O.'s overall objective: ''The establishment of the State of Israel is null and void, regardless of the passage of time.'' In other words, the P.L.O. charter calls for the elimination of Israel, plain and simple. What the P.L.O. takes issue with is not Israel's size but its existence. The P.L.O.'s solution to the Arab-Israeli problem is the dissolution of Israel, the destruction of a member state of the United Nations. Article 9 presents the means to the end: ''Armed struggle is the only way to liberate Palestine.'' Not even ''a way'' or ''one of the ways'' but the only way. That is, the P.L.O. is constitutionally incapable of (and constitutionally prohibited from) the nonviolent resolution of conflict. The P.L.O. charter makes it clear that to liberate Palestine means to obliterate Israel, but what does it mean by ''armed struggle''? The P.L.O.'s actions over the last 25 years have defined that term: the kidnapping and murder of civilians, the bombing of aircraft in midair, the massacre of athletes, tourists, passengers, pilgrims. Murder unlimited in time, place or choice of victims. There is a name for this: terrorism. Indeed, the P.L.O. has armed, trained and launched terrorist killers from more than 20 countries. More than any other force, the P.L.O. has been responsible for the spread of this scourge. But perhaps the P.L.O.'s most pernicious legacy is not its murder of civilians but its assault on the principle that civilians should not be murdered. The brazen espousal of terror and national annihilation in the P.L.O. charter is what distinguishes the P.L.O. even from such terrorist states as Syria. Syria engages in terrorism and seeks the destruction of Israel but now is ashamed to say so, or attempt to justify it, openly. On the question of ousting the P.L.O. mission, the members of the United Nations had a choice to make. They could either abide by the U.N. Charter or by the P.L.O. charter. They could choose one or the other but not both. The United Nations opted for the P.L.O. And in embracing an organization whose avowed principles are diametrically opposed to its own, the U.N. not only undermined itself but also helped legitimize the illegitimate. In his 1928 work ''The Treason of the Intellectuals,'' Julian Bender excoriated modern elites, not only for allowing the wrongdoers to do wrong but for arguing that wrong is right. ''It may be,'' he wrote, ''that thanks to the elites, humanity did evil for 2,000 years but honored good. This contradiction formed the rift whereby civilization slipped into the world.'' No longer, he said. ''Our age is the age of the intellectual organization of political hatred.'' In the rush to keep the P.L.O. mission in the United Nations, in the spurious and irrelevant arguments heatedly put forward by some journalists and diplomats, we see the full dimensions of the moral collapse that Mr. Bender analyzed. Not only is evil done, but those who do it and proclaim it are honored.

312-> Review/Television; Peanuts Become Pilgrims
''This is America, Charlie Brown!'' plops down the Peanuts characters on the gangplank of the Mayflower. We never know how they came to be among the Pilgrims, but that storybook conceit is nothing next to the program's most unusual feature. ''The Voyage of the Mayflower,'' the first episode in this eight-part series, is an animated history lesson for very young children, but a lesson with a surprisingly somber and realistic layer beneath its candy coating. ''The Voyage of the Mayflower'' will be shown tonight at 8 on CBS. The girls - Lucy, Sally, Peppermint Patty and Marcie - wear Pilgrim dresses and caps. Charlie Brown wears his comfortable old shirt; his concession to history is to go barefoot. Imposing familiar touches on the strangeness of the past seems to be the program's design for drawing children into the Pilgrims' story. We're told the Mayflower sails from England, but even Miles Standish has an easygoing American accent. Yet the uneasy tale that Charlie Brown narrates in a voiceover is about the hardships of the Atlantic crossing and the brutal first winter in New England. Seasickness, storms, overcrowded cabins, even the smells on the ship are effectively visualized. When Lucy bossily yells, ''Come on, Charlie Brown, shape up!,'' it's one of the perfunctory scenes putting the characters through their paces. After the Mayflower lands near what is now Provincetown, Mass., the story races through familiar steps in early American history. Snoopy puts on a Pilgrim hat and explores the new land. The ship moves to Plymouth, where nearly half the company dies of disease and the harsh winter. The Indian Squanto finally arrives to help, and teaches the Peanuts characters to plant the corn they will eat at the first Thanksgiving. There is some especially odd and weak language in the show, written by Peanuts' creator, Charles M. Schulz, and Lee Mendelson and produced by Bill Melendez, who co-directed with Everett Brown and Sam Jaimes. Charlie Brown's speeches might have been lifted from old-fashioned history books, the kind that make children nod off at their desks. The Mayflower passengers were determined because of their ''belief in God, desire for freedom from religious persecution, and their dreams of creating a new world for future generations,'' says poor Charlie Brown, who sounds like he's memorizing answers for a test. Those abstractions work against the purpose of making history fresh and accessible. Despite its unpretty look at the Pilgrims' suffering, ''The Voyage of the Mayflower'' is never too harsh for young children. The next three episodes, to be shown on subsequent Fridays at the same time, were not available for review, but definitely sound more upbeat. The Peanuts characters help frame the Constitution, jump ahead to join the Wright Brothers, and are launched by NASA into outer space. Four other episodes, whose subjects have not been announced, will be shown later in the season. The seriousness of this episode may be a lucky aberration. It is not the most sophisticated children's program around, but it is a giant step away from the parentless fantasyland of Peanuts, where the shrewdest inhabitant is, after all, a beagle.

Because of an an editing error, an article yesterday about questions surrounding Vice President Bush's knowledge of the Iran-contra affair misstated the record on what is known about the involvement of Donald P. Gregg, an aide to Mr. Bush. Mr, Gregg was aware of a plan to resupply the contras; there is no evidence that he knew it was financed in part from proceeds of arms sales to Iran.

314-> Clemency Declined by Britain or Six Convicted Irishmen
The Government today refused clemency for six Irishmen convicted in a 1974 terrorist bombing after a British court dismissed their appeals. Home Secretary Douglas Hurd refused to exercise the royal prerogative of mercy, which empowers the Government to free convicts despite court rulings. The Justice Minister of Ireland, Gerry Collins, and several Dublin newspapers had urged Mr. Hurd to apply the prerogative. The six are serving life sentences for the bombings of two taverns in Birmingham, England, on Nov. 21, 1974, that killed 21 people and wounded 162.

315-> Books of The Times; Dark Adventure
NIGHT SOLDIERS. By Alan Furst. 437 pages. Houghton Mifflin. $19.95. Twentieth-century history is the inspiration for Alan Furst's intelligent and ambitious new adventure novel. It charges along from the rise of Fascism in Bulgaria, where 19-year-old Khristo Stoianev sees his brother killed by a gang of strutting thugs; to Moscow in purge time, where Khristo is trained in intelligence by the N.K.V.D.; to Spain during the Civil War, where he is ordered to murder his anti-Franco comrades because they are anarchists, not Communists; to France, on the run from his former Soviet handlers, where he is caught up in the German invasion, and back to Eastern Europe, in the service of Western spymasters, as World War II draws to an end. Khristo is a blackboard for contemporary horrors and heroism. Though he is very much the man of action, he is less actor than acted upon. Though he finds himself tossed by the storms of politics - Fascist versus Communist, Communist versus Communist, Communist versus the West - his own politics have less to do with ideology than with personal loyalties. ''I just want to live my life, to be left alone,'' he says. Fortunately for the novel, he never gets that opportunity. In Moscow, he joins with four other N.K.V.D. recruits, representing most of the countries of Eastern Europe, in swearing mutual fidelity, an oath that becomes important in their troubles to come. Their fates, Mr. Furst wants us to know, are indicative of the fates of their homelands. Although there are many references to the famous, from Stalin to La Pasionaria, this is not one of those novels in which history's big players are brought on stage and knocked about. We meet people who affect the destinies of others while their own destinies remain beyond their control. The characters tend to be personifications of their nations, and the book serves as something of a tour guide, especially to towns up and down the Danube. Now and then we seem to be getting excerpts from a Baedeker: ''They moved past . . . Svistov, where the Bulgarian poet and patriot Aleko Konstantinov had been stabbed to death, where his pierced heart was exhibited in a small museum.'' Often, however, Mr. Furst comes up with details of places and events that are odd enough to seem authentic. Some of the terrible craziness of the war in Spain, for example, breaks through in the account by a Spanish Loyalist of a clash in Madrid between Franco's Moorish troops and a Polish brigade supporting the Republic. The Moors, having captured the College of Medicine, ''built fires in the hallways and roasted the laboratory animals on their bayonets and ate them. Now they'll all get rare diseases. The Poles chased them out by putting hand grenades on the elevators and sending them up to the floor they were holding.'' Episode by episode, ''Night Soldiers'' is absorbing, yet the episodic quality prevents the novel from building tension from one account of Khristo's scrapes and escapes to another. Colorful characters keep coming on and being knocked off a little too fast for us to get to know them. Hardly are we introduced to the great romance of Khristo's life, Aleksandra, a sexy woman who may be French or Russian or something else, than she disappears. Granted, the blasting of lives and relationships by the horrors of our century is part of the truth of the book. Even so, the appearance of an American woman who hooks up with Khristo in Spain seems intended for the movie version. The book springs alive in the scenes of Khristo's training by the N.K.V.D. and his employment of the skills of subversion across Europe. His exploits with the Maquis make first-rate spy stuff. Khristo, an accomplished saboteur, teaches the French underground such useful things as the fact ''that a single cube of sugar in a gas tank would caramelize on the pistons and freeze the engine solid. If you didn't have a sugar cube, a potato wedged in the tailpipe of a vehicle would choke the exhaust system, blow a hole in the muffler, and could cause carbon monoxide to leak into the driver's compartment.'' Who can resist such lore? Yet Khristo's derring-do doesn't blow too big a hole in credibiiity; he is always constrained by circumstances and is not often triumphant. Mr. Furst keeps his very best until last, when, with the war ending, Khristo makes his way up the Danube into the lands now coming under Soviet control, to rescue one of his old buddies. Scenes of a devastated Europe are vividly rendered: ''The building stood three stories high, scorch patterns flared out on the plaster walls above and below the broken windows, and when the rains came in early March, oil that had leached into the center loading yard over the years returned to the surface and the smell of it, singed and rancid, hung in the wet air.'' Mr. Furst plainly knows his Orwell. Though Khristo remains in shadow, his simple decency is highlighted. His politics consist of opposition to the brutes, be they Fascist or Communist. ''Night Soldiers'' is so thoughtful a tale or series of tales that you find yourself asking more than the novel finally delivers. But that may be greedy. The history is deftly incorporated; the viewpoint civilized; the characters and the settings picturesque; the adventures exciting; the writing pungent. And the book may even direct the attention of some readers to the condition of Central and Eastern Europe today.

317-> Jackson's Parting Shot for New York
Before he boarded a train this afternoon for the City of Brotherly Love, the Rev. Jesse Jackson offered a few comments about New York, a city of ''division and diversion.'' The second-place finisher in the New York Democratic Presidential primary seemed subdued, even a little bitter. He scolded Mayor Koch for remarks that ''hurt a lot of people and incited a lot of fear.'' He faulted Governor Cuomo indirectly for not having done more to stop the Mayor. And he censured the Democratic Party and the press for not raising a challenge to ''the use of religious and racial tests'' that Mr. Jackson said had ''ruptured'' the fragile relationship between the races in New York City. Mr. Jackson spoke at a news conference at the Sheraton Centre hotel in Manhattan before leaving to open his Pennsylvania campaign at a nursing home in Philadelphia. Speaking of the Mayor, he said: ''Other leaders who by their silence concurred with him, and the press by their permissive will did not challenge him, must now bear the burden of the legacy of Mr. Koch in this campaign.'' ''No one from the level of the party, state or national, challenged that behavior while it was going on,'' he said. ''There were no calls to cease.'' 'Obligation to Speak Out' Asked if Governor Cuomo should have spoken out more against Mayor Koch, Mr. Jackson replied: ''It's really after the fact now. But all who stood to lose by division and diversion had an obligation to speak out.'' He said the Mayor had diverted attention from the ''issues that really matter to New Yorkers,'' corruption in goverment, crumbling bridges, the homeless and ''exploitative'' welfare hotels. ''The Mayor took the headlines,'' Mr. Jackson said. ''I took the city. He pushed hysteria. I pushed history. Our team won.'' Mr. Jackson did not criticize Senator Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, whom the Mayor endorsed and who also engaged in some tart attacks in New York against the Chicago civil rights leader. Although there has recently been tension between the two candidates because of Mr. Gore's criticism of Mr. Jackson's managerial experience and his policies on the Middle East, the Senator visited Mr. Jackson in his hotel room early Wednesday, after their election night parties. They talked for an hour. Talking With His Rivals Clearly, Mr. Jackson does not want Mr. Gore to follow in Senator Paul Simon's footsteps and suspend his campaign, which would mean that the Tennessean retains control of the rich cache of delegates he won March 8. Gerald Austin, Mr. Jackson's campaign manager, said he thought that Mr. Gore had been ''embarrassed'' by the behavior of his patron, Mayor Koch. Mr. Jackson also telephoned Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts on Wednesday morning and congratulated him on a ''splendid'' campaign. ''We decided we would have a meeting sometime soon to talk about the rest of the campaign,'' Mr. Jackson said, adding that both men wanted to maintain a genteel tone. ''We have interests that converge and interests that conflict.'' Asked about the fact that his percentage of the white vote was smaller in New York than in Wisconsin, Mr. Jackson said: ''Look at the percentage of my opponents' black vote and Hispanic vote.'' ''It's true of Governor Dukakis as well,'' he said. ''He has to expand his base beyond his white base.'' ''I need his support base to win,'' Mr. Jackson said. ''He needs my support base to win. Together we can win.'' 'Changing the Face of America' Although the tenor of Mr. Jackson's campaign has changed. as he conceded the front-runner spot he had claimed for himself to Mr. Dukakis, the clergyman said he was not ready to concede defeat. Offering a trademark rhyme, he said: ''Now it seems there are three: Bush, Dukakis and me.'' Talking about his ''historical challenge,'' Mr. Jackson offered this assessment: ''We're changing the party, setting the pace of the debate, and we are changing the face of America in many ways, creating hope for people all around the world.'' He said that the new coalition that he energized in New York ''will remain together as a viable force.'' Asked if he would return to New York to campaign against Mr. Koch when the Mayor runs for re-election next year, Mr. Jackson offered one of his few smiles of the morning. ''As President,'' he said, ''I will have to measure my response to the mayoral campaign.''

318-> Patterns
Barneys at Wall St. Barneys is bringing the mountain to mammon. The 65-year-old store will open its first branch shop near Wall Street late this summer. The store will occupy 10,000 square feet in the World Financial Center at 200 Liberty Street, and is aimed at the better part of the men's business. Plans call for ''a clubby feeling, lots of woodwork, views of the Hudson on two sides,'' said Robert L. Pressman, the executive vice president of finance and operations for the store. ''We looked at the downtown market and determined there was only a small selection of nondiscount men's stores in the Wall Street area,'' he continued. ''We felt we could put together the best of our men's custom and ready-to-wear and put it right down there where the men work.'' Barneys has expanded its store at Seventh Avenue and 17th Street many times over the years, most recently opening a 70,000-square-foot women's store-within-the-store in 1986. The original Barneys, a budget store, had 500 square feet of selling space. Also opening in late summer in the financial district, on Broadway near Trinity Place, is Alan Flusser. Twenty to 30 percent of the designer's customers at his East 52d Street shop are financial executives. ''Beside Brooks Brothers, there's no real quality clothing in the financial district,'' said Mr. Flusser, who designed the actor Michael Douglas's suits for the film ''Wall Street.'' An Intimate Success Women may not be buying sportswear, but they're buying what goes underneath. ''Intimate apparel is helping to carry the stores through this rough period,'' said Mickey Levenson, chairman of the Intimate Apparel Council, a trade group. Victoria's Secret, a chain of intimate apparel shops, is the fastest-growing division of the Limited Inc., according to Alfred Dietzel, a vice president of financial and public relations. From five stores in San Francisco in 1981, Victoria's Secret has grown to 260 stores nationally, and the chain is expected to have a total of 340 by Christmas. Even its catalogue, long a fashion ''in'' joke with its peekaboo eroticism, was recently given visual respectability by Arthur Elgort, a top fashion photographer. ''We approach intimate apparel on a fashion level,'' said Howard Gross, the president of Victoria's Secret. ''Nothing in our shops is necessary. Everything is an indulgence.'' Carole Hochman designs three lines of intimate apparel, including one for Christian Dior, whose fall/ holiday collection was shown in New York last week. Her husband, Neal Hochman, the chairman of Carole Hochman Designs, said: ''In 1980 our total volume was $18 million. Last year it was $66 million, and it is expected to reach nearly $80 million in 1988.'' Marshall Blonsky, an adjunct professor of communication at New York University who has written on the semiotics of fashion, has views about why women are spending money on lingerie now. ''The Reagan era has seen a rollback of political feminism and an excessive feminizing of women,'' he said. ''They're saying, 'Underneath this chalk-striped suit, I'm a woman.' '' In an age of AIDS and more circumspect sexuality, he said, ''you're led to believe that women are fantasizing a lot.'' From Here to . . . The sweet smell of success emanated from the main floor of Saks Fifth Avenue yesterday. Calvin Klein, making his first public appearance since undergoing treatment for alcohol and prescription drug abuse, was on hand to introduce his new perfume, Eternity. Mr. Klein looked fit in a khaki poplin suit, and his numbers looked terrific. When the sales registers were totaled, Eternity had the largest initial sales, in dollars, of any fragrance presented in the store's history, according to Margaret Hayes, the senior vice president and general merchandise manager at Saks. More than 200 bottles of the fragrance, ranging from $35 to $185, were bought. ''Eternity has already had the greatest pre-sell launch in Saks history,'' said Ms. Hayes, referring to the two weeks it was available on the counter without advertising, when it sold about 1,800 bottles. For now Eternity is available only at Saks in Manhattan and Southampton, L.I.

321-> Comstock Offers $1 Billion in Shares
Comstock Partners, a management investment company run by a former chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch, Stanley D. Salvigsen, offered more than $1 billion worth of stock yesterday in a new closed-end fund, Comstock Partners Strategy Fund. Merrill Lynch Capital Markets acted as lead manager for the 110-million-share offering. Each share was priced at $10. The amount of shares sold far exceeded the 10 million shares Comstock initially said it intended to issue in March. Mr. Salvigsen said that 65 percent of the new fund's assets must be invested in debt securities. ''We can go up to 35 percent in equities if we want to,'' he said. ''The purpose of the fund is to maximize total return. There is a very broad range of things we can do.'' The new fund is allowed to invest in foreign bonds and stocks. Once the offering is completed, Comstock will have tripled the $600 million it currently has under management.

322-> PROSPECTS; Venture Capital
When Congress eliminated the favorable treatment of capital gains in 1986, many thought it would hurt venture capital companies' ability to raise money. The Oct. 19 stock market collapse also caused alarm. But venture capital funds have more money than ever. What is the outlook for this industry? CHET BORGIDA Director of capital markets group, Grant Thornton. During 1987 an enormous amount of money was raised that has not yet been invested. And many institutions that normally would be investing in over-the-counter stocks are investing in venture capital funds. But the trend is away from high-technology companies and from the high-tech regional centers - Silicon Valley and Route 128. The trend is away from all but the highest quality seed financing and toward leveraged buyouts and mergers and acquisitions. There are also more deals now made on the street - the initial public offering market is gone since the stock market collapse - and companies now must go to second and third round private funding. With the I.P.O. market gone, venture capital companies will be holding on to their investments longer. DENIS A. BOVIN Managing director, Salomon Brothers. Venture capital is exceptionally vibrant. The scarcest resource is not capital, but talented venture capital professionals who can guide companies as they grow. The quantity and quality of the deal flow is also exceptional. This means that venture capital companies are becoming more selective. The Oct. 19 crash affected the exit strategies for venture capital. Traditionally, a good company is sold at an initial public offering. But it is only in the last month that the I.P.O. market has returned. Because of the crash, venture capital companies have not been able to liquefy their holdings. This has substantially brought down the valuations of new companies. There has been a trend to look beyond private companies to young companies that are already public. TED H. MCCOURTNEY General Partner, Venrock Associates. The loss of favorable capital gains is a hindrance to the financing of new companies. Most new companies are financed by individuals at the earliest stage. Loss of capital gains has made entrepreneurs less motivated to take the risk of forming a new business. There is evidence that venture capital is moving away from high tech but Silicon Valley is still strong. The I.P.O. market is just now beginning to come back for high-quality companies. But venture investments take a long-term horizon. It is not so important when a company goes public. But what is important is the value of the company when it does go public. DAN BLANCHARD Partner, Investments Orange Nassau Inc. Venture capital companies are not leaving high tech, but they are more open to looking at non-technology companies. Specialty retailing, broadcasting, newspapers, cable television, and rental businesses are attracting venture capital because they offer favorable rates of return. Smaller markets - $50 million to $100 million - with only a few competitors are attractive for new companies. These markets are too small for big companies to enter the way I.B.M. entered and then dominated the personal computer market. There are more entrepreneurs out there. It has to do with demographics. The prime ages for an entrepreneur are the 30's and 40's. These are the baby boomers who were raised in very secure surroundings and now are willing to take risks and start new companies.

323-> Latvians Said to Demonstrate To Mark Deportations of 40's
Thousands of people demonstrated in Soviet Latvia today to mark the anniversary of mass deportations from the Baltic republic under Stalin, the Soviet press agency Tass reported. Tass said the demonstrators marched through the republic's capital, Riga, and laid flowers in honor of the deportees. Tass said more than 31,000 people were removed to distant parts of the Soviet Union after undergoing ''severe trials'' in 1941 and 1949. Western estimates of the number of Latvians deported under Soviet rule from the time that Stalin took power in the Baltic states until about 1950 range as high as 320,000. An estimate of 210,000 deportations in three waves, from 1940 to 1941, from 1945 to 1946 and in 1949, has been characterized as conservative by several experts in Eastern European history. Estonians and Lithuanians were also deported, including large numbers sent east in 1949 for resisting collectivization. 'Grim Times of Stalinism' The demonstrators included ''many aged people, those who had endured the grim times of Stalinism,'' Tass said. Tass said the Latvian Government had approved a proposal to set up a monument to the deportees. ''This decision adopted by the party and state leadership of the republic was approved by participants in a manifestation of many thousands held in Riga today,'' the press agency said. It quoted the mayor of Riga, Alfred Rubiks, as saying the anniversary of the deportations in 1941 was being marked officially for the first time. #10,000 Protesters The move appeared aimed at pre-empting large-scale unofficial demonstrations. Dissidents and exile groups in the West said on Monday that they expected about 10,000 people to take part in protests, but that they were unaware of any official ceremonies. Soviet power was established simultaneously in the Baltic nations of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia in July 1940. Mass deportations to Siberia followed. The United States Government has never formally recognized the incorporation of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania into the Soviet Union. Past Rallies Blocked In the past, the authorities in Latvia have prevented demonstrations. Similar action has been taken in Lithuania and Estonia, where repressive measures were also carried out under Stalin. Tass reported that there were meetings in Estonian towns today marking the deportations. The agency did not say how many people took part.

324-> Fire in Egypt Kills 47 Pilgrims
A fire caused by sparks from a food stall killed 47 Christian pilgrims who had camped outside a monastery on Tuesday to pay homage to the Virgin Mary, a security officer said today. Hundreds of tents lay in smoldering heaps at the monastery about 35 miles north of Asyut, a province capital 240 miles south of Cairo. Witnesses said that monks quickly closed the front door of Al Muharraq Monastery after the fire broke out, and that some of the dead had been trampled as panicking pilgrims trying to get out the door turned back toward a gate in the fence around the campground. About 5,000 pilgrims were at the monastery for the Feast of the Consecration of the Church of the Virgin. The feast, held every June 21 to 28, commemorates the farthest south that the Holy Family is believed to have traveled in its flight to save the infant Jesus from King Herod's order that newborn boys be slain. The monastery is built on the cave in Mount Qosqam where, according to Coptic Christian belief, Joseph, Mary and Jesus were sheltered. Neither the church nor the monastery, a 10-acre compound with 70 to 80 monks in residence, was damaged in the tent-city fire. A security officer for Asyut said 26 children, 15 men and 6 women died from burns or smoke inhalation, or had been trampled. Fifteen others were hurt. According to the officer, the blaze began when sparks from the food stall set fire to nearby tents. This, in turn, set off three dozen butane lamps. The officer said that the stand's two owners, both Copts, were arrested, but that the fire was clearly an accident. A survivor said firefighting equipment arrived from nearby villages only ''a full hour after the fire started.'' He said there was no water at the tent city to fight the blaze. Al Muharraq Monastery is in Al Qusiyah, near a well-traveled route and the Nile River. It was formerly called the Virgin Mary Monastery.

325-> JOHN J. DUNCAN, 69; TENNESSEAN SEVED 24 YEARS IN CONGRESS
Representative John J. Duncan, who served 24 years in the House of Representatives and was the ranking Republican on the Ways and Means Committee, died Tuesday after a long battle with cancer. He was 69 years old. Mr. Duncan died at St. Mary's Medical Center five days after being admitted for chemotherapy, according to a hospital spokeswoman, Mary Sharp. Mr. Duncan, who consistently won re-election by large margins in Tennessee's Second Congressional District, had planned to run again. But on May 27 he announced that he would not seek another term because of poor health. Son Runs for Seat His 40-year-old son, John Jr., stepped down as a judge in Knox County Criminal Court to run for his father's Congressional seat in the Republican primary in August. Mr. Duncan received a law degree in 1948. From then until 1956 he was an assistant state attorney general. In 1959, he was elected Mayor of Knoxville, serving until he was elected to Congress in 1964. He became the ranking Republican on the Ways and Means Committee after his re-election in 1984, and he was one of two Republicans on the Joint Taxation Committee. Survivors include his wife, Lois, and four children.

326-> False Economy to Cut School Dental Program
To the Editor: In an effort to cut expenses, New York City is contemplating a move that could endanger the dental health of thousands of schoolchildren. Since about 1915, each public school student has been required to have an annual dental checkup and to submit a written completion note to his or her school. The city wants to end this. Although many children today do not suffer from the rampant dental decay that was common in the past, a large number of the almost one million students in New York City's public schools are still at risk. For example, many of these children are immigrants from countries without fluoridated water, or are from socioeconomic backgrounds where preventive health care is not considered important. The city-mandated examinations are the only reason some of these children see a dentist at all. Besides looking for decay, these examinations can enable a dentist to diagnose developmental disorders or oral disease early, thereby preventing serious trouble later in life. This program also teaches children the importance of both dental health and preventive care. We urge New York City not to end this important, time-tested program. Rather, it should look to strengthen the program so as to reach more than the 300,000 students who now participate. ALAN N. QUEEN, D.D.S. Jamaica, Queens, May 30, 1988 The writer is editor of the Bulletin of the Queens County Dental Society.

John W. Yengo Sr., a former controversial Municipal Court judge in Jersey City, died of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, a rare allergic reaction, Saturday at St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, N.J. He was 72 years old and lived in Jersey City. Mr. Yengo, a 1948 graduate of John Marshall Law School, was in private law practice in Jersey City and twice ran unsuccessfully for mayor. He was appointed to the Municipal Court in 1974 and was often called Maximum John because of the severity of his sentences. He was suspended four years later and eventually ousted by the New Jersey Supreme Court as ''totally unsuited'' because of discourtesy to defendants and their lawyers and ''manifold abuses of the judicial process.'' He is survived by three daughters, Donna Marie Cardamone of Neshanic, N.J., Laura Ann, of Manhattan, Suzy, of Jersey City, and a son, John, of Jersey City.

The Credithrift Financial Corporation, the consumer loan subsidiary of the American General Corporation, is offering $200 million in debt securities through a two-part financing. Underwriters, led by Salomon Brothers Inc., are offering $100 million in 8 5/8 percent subordinated notes due in 1990 at a price of par, to yield about 51-hundredths of a percentage point more than the average of the two-year and three-year Treasury notes. An equal issue of 9 percent senior subordinated notes due in 1992, also priced at par, will yield 61-hundredths of a percentage point more than four-year Treasury notes.

330-> Currents; Sampling British Design At London Show House
SHOW HOUSE fever seems to be spreading abroad. From next Thursday to June 19, Chelsea Old Town Hall on King's Road in London will be the site of the British Interior Design Exhibition, a 21-designer event. ''The idea was to create an environment where the public could come and see beautiful rooms and find an interior decorator,'' said Fleur Rossdale, the managing director of Interior Design House Ltd., which organized the exhibit. ''This kind of event gives the public a chance to see the work of well-known and not-so-well-known decorators, without feeling inhibited or having to make commitments.'' Ms. Rossdale selected the decorators, including such established designers as David Hicks as well as younger members of the English decorating establishment, like Joanna Trading and Rory Ramsden. Unlike most American show houses, the exhibit requires decorators to pay to be included. Ms. Rossdale's company builds the rooms according to their specifications. ''We've planned it so that each room leads to another, very much like in a real house,'' she said. Princess Margaret is expected to attend a gala reception next Wednesday; the proceeds will benefit the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. Ms. Rossdale will also contribute a percentage of ticket profits to the charity. For information, call 938-4759 in London.

331-> SPORTS NEWS BRIEFS; New Offer Made To Hambletonian
The New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority has offered to raise the purse for the Hambletonian by $200,000 in an attempt to keep the prestigious event at the Meadowlands. The sports authority is in a bidding war with Illinois to see who will be the host to the race after 1990. Besides increasing the purse to $1.2 million, the authority offered to establish a $1 million bonus, stage a Hambletonian ball and continue to be the host for a two-week series of stakes races around the time the Hambletonian will be run. The Hambletonian was held at DuQuoin race track in Illinois until 1981, when the race was moved to New Jersey. The Meadowlands has a contract to hold the race until 1990.

333-> N.H.L.; Islanders, Hrudey Check Nordiques, 2-0
Denis Potvin and Brent Sutter scored goals today and Kelly Hrudey got his third shutout of the season as the Islanders beat the Quebec Nordiques, 2-0. It was the Islanders' second shutout in three games as Hrudey made 28 saves. Billy Smith shut out St. Louis, 2-0, last week. Potvin opened the scoring today with his 15th goal of the season at 17 minutes 59 seconds of the first period. Sutter scored at 7:03 of the second period. The Islanders, in third place in the Patrick Division, used effective forechecking and good penalty killing to control the tempo at both ends of the ice. Both teams played without key players. The Islanders' Tomas Jonsson and Pat LaFontaine were out with a concussion and sore knee respectively. The Nordiques were without Normand Rochefort, a defenseman, and Anton Stastny, a forward, who are bothered by knee injuries. The Nordiques again struggled on the power play, failing to score on any of their five manpower advantages. New York scored against Mario Brunetta with a two-man advantage in the opening period. ''The way we played today shouldn't be the exception but the norm for us,'' Hrudey said. ''If we get out of our system and try to play a wide-open game, we'll get blown out of the rink.'' On Saturday, the Islanders lost, 8-3, to Pittsburgh. ''I think we're headed in the right direction because, despite the 8-3 loss, we're starting to get the goals-against average down,'' Hrudey added. ''I hope it's something you're going to see more often: not only me getting the winning goal but the team getting a shutout,'' Potvin said. CAPITALS 7, CANUCKS 2 LANDOVER, Md. (AP) - Dave Christian scored twice and Mike Gartner and Mike Ridley each added a goal and two assists as Washington defeated Vancouver. The victory, Washington's fifth straight, moved the Capitals into first in the Patrick Division by a point over the Flyers, who lost to New Jersey today. Gartner extended his scoring streak to 11 games at 7:20 of the first period by scoring on the power play. Kelly Miller made it 2-0 before the end of the first period. Jim Sandlak closed the gap to 2-1 with his first of two goals at 11:58 of the second period. But Washington took a 4-1 lead less than four minutes later when Christian and Yvon Corriveau scored 11 seconds apart.

334-> Tax-Exempt Sales Action
A House Ways and Means subcommittee voted today to allow museums and other nonprofit organizations to continue to earn tax-free income from mail-order sales of education-related items and moderately priced mementos, one subcommittee member said. The subcommittee, which is drafting proposals to tax more types of income-producing activities carried on by nonprofit organizations, had considered imposing tight constraints on tax-exempt mail-order sales. One subcommittee member who attended the closed-door session said the panel decided to restrict the tax exemption for the sale of mementos to items valued at $50 or less. The panel also voted to allow college-owned bookstores to continue to earn tax-free income from the sale of computers. But the subcommittee would limit the number of computers that could be sold tax-exempt each year. Computer dealers have complained that college bookstores have an unfair advantage because of their tax-exempt status.

335-> CREDIT MARKETS; Notes and Bonds Continue Retreat
Prices of Treasury bonds and notes moved lower again yesterday in light, nervous trading. No signficant developments caused the selloff, which was as much as three-fourths of a point, or $7.50 for each $1,000 face value of securities, on some issues. Rather, the price drop merely underscored a deep sense of pessimism among market participants. ''The psychology is universally negative,'' said Roger A. Froelich, president of Technical Dimensions, a fixed-income advisory service in Mount Kisco, N.Y. ''The market is focusing on an expanding economy, a potential reawakening of inflation and the prospect of a further tightening move by the Federal Reserve. In that framework, there is no emerging positive story out there to drive it higher.'' Aside from those worries, the price drop was also fed by investors who had bought notes and bonds at last week's Treasury auctions. ''Anyone who bought at the auctions is now under water,'' said Albert A. Gross, chief economist at Refco Inc. ''With prices now having broken under the levels of the auction week, we are now seeing liquidation by some of the participants who had bought in, and now have decided to cut their losses.'' In late trading, the Treasury's bellwether 9 1/8 percent 30-year bond due in 2018, auctioned last week, was offered at 98 9/32, down three-fourths of a point on the day, to a yield of 9.29 percent. The yield is the highest on the closely watched issue since late last year. Meanwhile, the new 10-year 9 percent notes were offered at 98 26/32, down 14/32 on the day, to yield 9.18 percent. Three-Year Note Auction And the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent three-year notes auctioned on May 10 dipped by an eighth of a point, to a late offering price of 99 5/8, to yield 8.26 percent. As bonds and notes were falling, the Treasury bill market was helped by a sharp drop in stock prices. Treasury bills are often used as a safe haven for funds fleeing investments in other markets. Three-month Treasury bills were offered late yesterday at 6.18 percent, down 11 basis points, or hundreths of a point, on the day. Six-month bill rates dropped by 2 basis points, to 6.52 percent. Interest rates on one-year bills were basically unchanged at 6.88 percent. ''The only thing that is holding in the bond market right now is the stock market,'' said James R. Capra, senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities. Prices began moving lower early in the session, shortly after nervous traders were further rattled when the Federal Reserve drained reserves from the banking system. On Tuesday, the Fed's policy-making body, the Open Market Committee, met in Washington. Under some circumstances, such a move might indicate that the Fed was taking steps to tighten credit conditions. But the overnight Federal funds rate, the rate most directly controlled by the central bank, did not rise after the draining operation, and traded in a range of 6 1/2 percent to 6 3/4 percent for most of the day. ''The market tends to be sensitive to any overt Fed action the day after a meeting of the Open Market Committee,'' Mr. Capra said. Pessimism About the Dollar Pessimistic comments about the dollar by Martin S. Feldstein, head of the National Bureau of Economic Research and one of Vice President Bush's closest economic advisers, added to the gloom later in the day. Reiterating a position he has articulated several times in the recent past, Mr. Feldstein told a business conference in New York that further declines in the dollar would be necessary in order to bring the merchandise trade account into balance. In his remarks, Mr. Feldstein said that while the trade deficit could decline to about $140 billion this year from $159 billion in 1987, he did not expect the shortfall to fall below $90 billion over the next several years if the dollar remained at current levels. At the same conference, Toyoo Gyohten, Japan's deputy minister of finance for international affairs, said that Japan had proposed that the United States issue yen-denominated Treasury bonds as a way to help stabilize the international monetary system. Such proposals have been floated by private and governmental sources in Japan and elsewhere on several occasions over the last few years. But to date Mr. Gyohten appears to be the most senior representative of any industrial nation to be publicly associated with such a proposal. Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d and other high-level officials were in Paris attending meetings of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and could not be reached for comment. With Secretary Baker out of the country, Treasury spokesmen in Washington were not prepared to comment on the proposal. However, in the past the Reagan Administration has been adamantly opposed to the notion of issuing Treasury bonds denominated in foreign currencies. The poor performance in the government bond market spilled over into the secondary markets for corporate and tax-exempt municipal securities again yesterday. Traders said that losses as large as a point were recorded on some corporate issues. Losses were even bigger on tax-exempt municipal bonds, which until recently had outperformed Treasury securities. Prices on a number of issues were down by as much as 1 1/4 points, traders said. With interest rates rising, activity in the new issues market was quiet yesterday. Among the few issues priced was a $100 million offering of 9.30 percent 7-year secured notes from the Private Export Funding Corporation, a consortium of American multinational companies heavily engaged in exports. The notes, which mature on June 1, 1995, are noncallable for life. They were priced at par. The 9.30 percent coupon is 37 basis points over the rate on Treasury securities of comparable maturity. The Bankers Trust Company acted as lead manager for the underwriting, which is rated AAA by both Moody's Investor's Service and the Standard & Poors Corporation. Because the deal is backed by the Federal Government, Bankers Trust was not prohibited by the Glass Steagall Act from underwriting the offering.

337-> Review/Pop; Trio Recalls Big Band Era
The Swing Now Trio, three versatile musicians who have been kindling memories of the Swing Era, including the big bands and the jitterbugs, every Wednesday night for more than a year at the North River Bar in Tribeca (145 Hudson Street), brought their music but not their dancers uptown to the garment district Thursday evening to play at Terranova, a restaurant at 18 West 38th Street. Despite the limitations of its size, the trio occasionally manages to project the spirit of the Swing Era big bands by using various combinations of the seven instruments they play -piano and string bass (John DeCesare), guitar (Tony DiGregorio) and tenor and bass saxophone, flute and rums (Bryant DuPre). But inevitably it is more representative of the small groups that once swung on 52d Street. Mr. DuPre has a swaggering tone on tenor saxophone that enables him to live up to one's expectations of Coleman Hawkins's tune ''Stuffy'' or Ike Quebec's ''Scufflin' ''. Mr. DiGregorio's guitar is the vitalizing core of the group, holding it together while the two others shift from one instrument to another. His guitar is the basic swinging stimulus of the trio and its prime solo voice, at one moment racing headlong through several choruses of ''Sweet Sue'' and then transposing the Casa Loma Orchestra's big-band arrangement of its theme, ''Smoke Rings,'' into an effectively dreamy guitar solo.

338-> CONSUMER RATES; Yields Rise In Week
Yields on certificates of deposit, bank money market accounts and money market mutual funds rose for the week ended yesterday, lifted by fears of inflation and last week's half-point increase in the banks' prime lending rate. The Bank Rate Monitor's national index reported that the average yield for six-month C.D.'s was up 3 basis points, to 6.95 percent, while the index of bank money market accounts, which compete with the money market mutual funds, rose 2 basis points, to 5.70 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. A growing number of economists believe interest rates are headed higher. They note that unemployment is low and continuing to fall, that industrial production is up and continuing to rise, and that both domestic and export demand is robust. 2 Bill Rates Off at Auction At the Treasury's weekly bill auction on Monday, which often influences what banks and savings institutions pay their money market and C.D. customers, the average discount rate for three-month bills fell 3 basis points, to 6.28 percent, while the rate for six-month bills was off by 1 basis point, to 6.50 percent. Certificates of deposit with one-year and two-and-a-half year maturities were up 5 basis points, to 7.28 percent and 7.70 percent, respectively. The five-year C.D. rose 6 basis points, to 8.18 percent. Elsewhere in the funds market, Donoghue's Money Fund Report said the seven-day taxable, compounded average yield for a money-market mutual fund rose 14 basis points, to 6.47 percent for the week. The 30-day compounded average yield was up 5 basis points, to 6.36 percent. The average maturity of securities held in managers' portfolios went down a day, to 39 days. Assets of taxable money market funds rose $1 billion, to $257 billion, mostly a result of a $988.5 million gain in institutional assets. The assets of tax-free money market funds fell $61.5 million, to $65.4 billion.

341-> Olympic Profile; Gymnast's Lesson Needs No Translation
Dmitri Belozertchev sat not far from the hotel pool, trying to take advantage of the warm morning sun before he and his Soviet teammates would leave for a two-hour workout. He was still tired from the long journey - Moscow to Washington to Chicago to Phoenix, for a dual meet against American gymnasts in April - and his acclimation to the time zone and weather conditions made his words come slowly for the interpreter to digest. Then, out of the corner of his eye, he saw a figure moving toward him with deliberate strides. Belozertchev recognized him instantly, and as Tim Daggett drew closer, Belozertchev's face seemed to snap to attention, filled with interest. The same was true for Daggett as he approached Belozertchev. By now, they were more than familiar faces to each other after years of competition at the highest levels of gymnastics. Seven months ago when Daggett snapped two bones in his left leg and severed an artery while completing a vault, the two became bonded by the sudden prospect of athletic mortality. Daggett nearly lost the leg. Now recovering, he hopes to compete this summer in the Olympic trials. In 1985, Belozertchev nearly lost his left leg in an automobile accident, but he recovered to win a second world championship title in 1987, at the same meet in which Daggett was injured. Smiles and Gestures ''So how's it going?'' Belozertchev's gestures seemed to say. Wordlessly, he pointed toward Daggett's leg. ''O.K., O.K.,'' Daggett said, raising a thumb. ''It's coming along.'' Because Belozertchev knows only a few words of English and Daggett even fewer of Russian, the two were left to smile, nod and gesture toward each other before Daggett moved to another spot beside the pool. Belozertchev watched intently as Daggett walked away, no doubt remembering his own trauma one rainy night not so long ago. Belozertchev was driving home from practice, and a car stopped suddenly just ahead of him. He jammed on his brakes, but fearing he might crash into the back of the car, he swerved to avoid a collision, only to crash into a light post. He shattered his leg in 40 places. A National Hero This was no trivial matter in the Soviet Union. Belozertchev was a national hero, the world all-round champion in 1983 at the age of 16. He was the youngest man ever to hold such a title and a sure gold-medal winner in the 1984 Olympics, had the Soviet Union not boycotted. Rumors circulated that he had been drinking the night of the accident. This was not true, he said, explaining that he had become engaged to his sweetheart, Svetlana, the day before and had celebrated. ''According to Soviet rules, I had to have my blood tested,'' he said. ''When they did, they found alcohol was still in my system.'' The damage to his leg was so extensive and blood loss so great that doctors initially feared they might have to amputate. As the critical period passed and it became clear the leg would heal without further complications, Belozertchev started exercising his upper body, strengthening his arms, chest and stomach muscles. Thus began a remarkable recovery that brought him back to the national team by 1986, to another world all-round title last fall in Rotterdam and to the role of favorite to win one or more gold medals later this year at the Olympic Summer Games in Seoul, South Korea. ''I am a lucky man,'' Belozertchev said. ''A very lucky man.'' Much Emotional Support Once it became clear his leg would heal, there was never a doubt in his mind he would compete again; there was only a question about the level of competition. At the same time, he said, his comeback would not have been possible without the emotional support of Svetlana, who became his wife a year after the accident, his teammates on the national team and the Soviet coaches. But especially Svetlana, now a teacher of physical culture. ''She was with me all the time in the hospital,'' he said. ''For one year.'' In Phoenix, the Soviet men and women dominated the competition, winning both all-round titles and 9 of 10 individual disciplines. Belozertchev, who was second to Yuri Korolov in the all-round and first on parallel bars, predicted comparable success by his team in the Olympics and a gold medal for himself in the all-round. ''Everybody is looking forward to the Olympics,'' he said. ''In 1984, of course, we were all disappointed when we did not go. Each sportsman was prepared for the Olympics. To win in the Olympics is the greatest accomplishment.'' If Belozertchev's latest world title signified that he is the best gymnast on the planet, he is considerably more than that to Daggett, whose left leg now bears a striking resemblance to Belozertchev's, with a crevice at one point and a knob of extra bone at another. Daggett was a member of the United States team that won a gold medal in the 1984 Games, a master of the pommel horse and a well-decorated member of the national team since 1981. Through last summer, he was a virtual lock to join Scott Johnson as the only returning Olympians on the 1988 team. A Big Step Back After the accident, doctors feared complications could cost Daggett his leg. But just like Belozertchev, Daggett survived a critical period and turned to upper-body work before he left the hospital. Now mobile with a removable knee-to-ankle cast, he is daring himself to come all the way back and make the Olympic team. Performing in Phoenix on the pommel horse in compulsories, he tied for fourth among 20 competitors, a big step. And so Belozertchev has become something of a beacon of hope for Daggett, a personification of success against improbable odds. ''I'm not seeking encouragement from Dmitri,'' Daggett said. ''But he knows what I'm going through. We have known each other for years. We're friends. He told me I'll be O.K. I appreciated that.'' Belozertchev was asked what he thought of Daggett's chances. He grew quiet for an instant, perhaps thinking again of his own experience. ''His is a very, very rare injury in gymnastics,'' he said. ''He has a strong character. Maybe he will be ready. He must work very hard to overcome all the pain. It will be very hard, but he will overcome it.'' Who would know better?

343-> Norway on Alert for Oil From Rig
The Norwegian Government declared a pollution alert along its coastline today after an oil rig exploded and caught fire off the coast of Scotland, on the other side of the North Sea. Norwegian officials said oil leaking from the British rig had formed a patch that was moving east toward Norway on the surface of the sea. The officials said about 20 boats equipped to scoop oil slicks from the surface were standing by. The boats belong to various oil companies operating in the Norwegian offshore oil and gas fields. Debate Over Rig Safety The British rig disaster on Wednesday night also set off a debate in the Norwegian press and in political circles over crew safety on offshore oil and gas drilling rigs. The rig that caught fire, like most Norwegian rigs, was an integrated structure, which processes both oil and natural gas and provides living quarters for a crew of between 250 and 300 people. Although such rigs have been criticized as dangerous, they are efficient. Norway is currently building several giant new integrated rigs for operations in the huge North Sea Troll gas field that it plans to bring into production in the mid-1990's. Farouk al-Kasim, a Norwegian oil official in Norways's oil capital of Stavanger, pointed out that the British rig was comparatively old, having been put into service in 1976. As a result, he said, it might not have had all the safety features now built into more modern Norwegian integrated rigs, including fireproof barriers around the crew's living quarters. Norway operates 27 offshore rigs in its North Sea oil and gas fields, of which 14 are integrated and carry crews of up to 300 members.

344-> Members of Prominent Law Firm Tell of Ending Their Wedtech Ties
Lawyers from a prominent New York law firm, testifying in the Wedtech racketeering trial, said yesterday that they ended their representation of Wedtech in December 1986 after realizing that they had been repeatedly misled by the company's executives about its rapidly expanding legal difficulties. The testimony, by members of the firm of Squadron Ellenoff, directly contradicted that of major Government witnesses in the 17-week trial. Those witnesses have said the firm had helped map out a strategy that, prosecutors charge, allowed Wedtech to defraud the Small Business Administration by appearing to be a minority-controlled company. Lawyers involved in the trial said the jury's view of the credibility of the two conflicting accounts would be crucial in determining the guilt or innocence of John Mariotta, a founder of Wedtech. Mr. Mariotta, Representative Mario Biaggi and five others are on trial in Federal District Court in Manhattan on charges of turning Wedtech into a multimillion-dollar racketeering enterprise. Preferential Contracts Mr. Mariotta, whose parents were born in Puerto Rico, is charged with having participated in the scheme to allow the Wedtech Corporation to appear to be minority-controlled so that it could continue to qualify for preferential contracts with the S.B.A. Under the scheme, Mr. Mariotta was to have purchased a large block of shares from his fellow principals sometime after the company went public in 1983, prosecutors said. Later, they contend, Mr. Mariotta was to have deliberately defaulted on his purchase of the shares so that ownership would revert to his business partners. Howard M. Squadron, senior partner in Squadron Ellenoff, testified yesterday that contrary to the statements of the former Wedtech executives who have testified for the Government, he had only a ''very vague'' knowledge of the details of Wedtech's stock purchase deal involving Mr. Mariotta. Defense Case Is Brief Mr. Squadron, whose firm is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with its representation of Wedtech, said he had no knowledge of any plan to have Mr. Mariotta deliberately default on his purchase of Wedtech shares. The testimony by Mr. Squadron and another member of his firm in the trial came after James M. LaRossa, Mr. Biaggi's lawyer, completed the defense case after hearing only eight minutes of testimony by a lone defense witness, a Congressional staff member. Mr. Biaggi did not testify in his defense following a ruling by Judge Constance Baker Motley that if he were to testify, the prosecution could discuss the details of his conviction last year of accepting illegal gratuities from Meade H. Esposito, the former Brooklyn Democratic leader. Judge Motley also said she would allow discussion of other controversies in Mr. Biaggi's past if he were to take the stand. Called as Defense Witnesses Mr. Squadron and another partner in Squadron Ellenoff, Ira Lee Sorkin, were called as defense witnesses for Mr. Mariotta, the last of the seven defendants to present his case in the trial. Their testimony was sought by Mr. Mariotta's lawyer, Jeffrey Glekel, to contradict statements by former Wedtech executives who testified for the Government after reaching cooperation agreements that allowed them to plead guilty to lesser charges. A lawyer in the trial, commenting on the defense strategy to make the testimony of lawyers from Squadron Ellenoff a cornerstone of the defense case, said, ''It's going to come down to whether the jury believes the Wedtech executives or whether they believe the Squadron Ellenoff people - both can't be telling the truth.''

345-> Review/Music; Greek Chorale Presents Premieres and Tradition
George Tsontakis led his Metropolitan Greek Chorale in three recent works on Greek themes, and a good deal of traditional Greek music - sacred and secular, unadorned and lavishly arranged - on Sunday evening at Merkin Concert Hall. The contemporary scores were the program's focal points; yet the traditional selections provided a welcome context. The program began with two unaccompanied Byzantine hymns - ancient settings, with droning bass lines and modal, otherworldly harmonizations. From these it was a short leap to the premiere of Mr. Tsontakis's Three Byzantine Hymns with Brass Quintet (1988), in which the choral settings retain an authentic flavor to a great degree, while the brass quintet's dissonant, colorful bursts function alternately as a support (the trombones, for instance, take up the drone with far greater power than the choir's basses can muster) and as a kind of updated, illuminating commentary. Mr. Tsontakis's Five Choral Sketches on ''Is Aghios'' (1984), is also based on a sacred text, approached with a free hand. The settings range from somber to sweet and serene to rhythmically pointed and harmonically dense, and they are tied together by four virtuosic clarinet cadenzas, played with coloristic brilliance by David Krakauer. The program's other premiere, Marc-Antonio Consoli's ''Greek Lyrics'' (1988) is a setting of three brief poems, each separated by a lavish interlude for string quartet. Mr. Consoli paints in vivid harmonic colors, and demands thick choral and string textures, but the results have a visceral directness. Against the chorus, which sings in Greek, the composer has set a dramatic soprano line, in Italian, and Diana Nikkolos sang that part commandingly. Mr. Tsontakis ended the concert with arrangements of nine popular Greek songs, all richly harmonized and full of charm. In their evident zeal, the choristers let their ensemble discipline slip in some of these, and the polish they brought to other works gave way to less unified attacks and uneven balances. In these and the Consoli, Andrew Violette accompanied the chorus with great flair. The other assisting ensembles were the New Amsterdam Brass and the Esaki String Quartet.

349-> MEESE SAYS HE MET STANDARD OF ETHICAL CONDUCT HE SET FOR HIMSELF
Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d insisted today that he had worked diligently to avoid the apperance of impropriety in his tenure at the Justice Department and asserted again that an independent prosecutor's report on his conduct was a ''vindication.'' In a meeting with reporters from several newspapers and news services, Mr. Meese also said that he would seek reimbursement from the Government for hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees incurred in the 14-month investigation by the prosecutor, James C. McKay. On Tuesday, Mr. Meese announced his plans to resign later this summer. The announcement came on the same day that Mr. McKay presented his still-secret final report to a special panel of appellate judges that oversees the work of independent prosecutors. Mr. Meese repeated today what he said on Tuesday, namely that Mr. McKay's decision not to seek criminal charges was a vindication of his conduct. Meese's View Disputed ''When he decided to file a report rather than file an indictment, he has completed his task, and that is vindication,'' Mr. Meese said of the prosecutor. ''He has fulfilled his duty in a way that indicates that the allegations that were made are false.'' Lawyers with knowledge of Mr. McKay's investigation have taken issue with Mr. Meese's comments, saying the independent prosecutor's final report would detail several instances in which the Attorney General's conduct, while not subject to prosecution, may have violated Federal ethics rules. Similar questions about Mr. Meese's conflicts of interest were raised in his bruising fight in 1984 and 1985 to win Senate confirmation as Attorney General. At the time, Mr. Meese vowed to avoid any situation that could even unreasonably be viewed as creating a conflict of interest. Asked if he had met that standard in his three years at the Justice Department, Mr. Meese said today, ''I think I've adhered to that standard throughout.'' He added, ''I think that on the basis of everything I knew at the time, that I've upheld that standard throughout the time that I've been in office.'' Under Federal law, the subject of an independent prosecutor's investigation who is not indicted can be reimbursed by the Government for legal fees, and Mr. Meese said today he intended to take advantage of that provision. ''I will be seeking reimbursement at the proper time,'' he said. He Hasn't Looked at Bill Mr. Meese's legal bills for the investigation are said to total hundreds of thousands of dollars. Asked how much he owed his lawyers, Mr. Meese replied, ''I really don't know.'' ''It scares me to look at it, so I haven't looked at it,'' he said. After an earlier independent prosecutor's investigation of Mr. Meese, the Government awarded his lawyers $472.000 incurred in his defense. The investigation focused on whether Mr. Meese helped obtain Federal jobs for people who provided him with financial assistance. In a written statement, Mr. McKay said today that he had provided copies of his report to lawyers for Mr. Meese and to Solicitor General Charles Fried. Mr. Fried, the department's fourth-ranking official, serves as the department's chief liaision to the independent prosecutor's office because Harold G. Christensen, the acting Deputy Attorney General, and Francis A. Keating, the acting Associate Attorney General, have not yet been confirmed by the Senate, In his statement, Mr. McKay said that people, companies or institutions named in the report would have until next Thursday to submit a rebuttal or other comments for inclusion in the final report. The report and the rebuttals are expected to be made public in the next several weeks. Mr. McKay said that people who believed they were named in the report and wished to respond should notify the independent prosecutor's office; they will then be provided with the excerpts of the report that relate to them.

350-> Patents; 'Smart Card' Keeps Track Of Betting
The Gtech Corporation, the nation's largest supplier of computer systems for state-run lotteries, has developed a computerized ''smart card'' for gamblers to use to keep track of their bets. The card would store a player's favorite numbers on a computer chip and, in its most advanced form, would work like a debit card. Players would pay cash to a lottery outlet and that amount would be logged into the card's memory. Each bet would then be subtracted from the total. Gtech received patent 4,764,666.

351-> FASHION; RED IS RIGHT NOW
THEY MAY BE SWEET strawberry blondes or deep coppery redheads, blondes streaked with bits of rose or brunettes spun with auburn, but red is the captivating hair color of the moment. A year ago, blond was the color of choice. This summer, those who were born red are flaunting it, and those who were not are giving nature a nudge. Red may even be pushing other shades to the back of the beauty salon. Cornelia Guest, the socialite attempting to turn actress, is riding the crest of the trend. In New York, Ms. Guest's tresses were colored California blond. A move to Los Angeles, naturally, called for a new look. ''The light here washed me out,'' she says. ''Her hair looked dead,'' says her colorist, Bruce Wayne of the Umberto Salon in Beverly Hills. After several sessions at the salon, where Ms. Guest got two shades of red, one of gold and a few flashes of panic, she emerged with a head the color of pink Cristal Champagne. The current reds are not blazing carrot or screaming cranberry, but natural tones, often woven with soothing golden shades. These colors make the hair look healthy and shiny. ''They bring out the warmth of the skin,'' says Daniel Galvin, the colorist at La Coupe Salon in New York City. These shades are also less likely to clash with red clothing or makeup, not that that would matter to many redheads. ''I love wearing red,'' says Georgette Mosbacher, the cosmetics executive who swept into society like a red-hot fire. ''It's supposed to be taboo.'' Says Patty Mitropoulos, a fashion editor at Elle magazine, ''If redheads aren't supposed to wear red clothes, then that's exactly what I do.'' It's no accident that most redheads have long, brilliant masses of hair. This alone makes them hard to miss. So does their sparseness in a world of ordinary brunettes and blondes. No matter how fashionable they are now, redheads will never be commonplace.

352-> For Lebanon, Slow Return To Business
The Lebanese economy is showing signs of recovery despite an increase in factional fighting over the presidential election scheduled this summer. Since the beginning of the year, the Lebanese pound has regained nearly 35 percent of its value. A boom of sorts is reflected in the emergence of new stores and boutiques on both sides of the line dividing Beirut's Moslem and Christian halves, along with a noticeable increase in real estate activity. The economy is still inhibited by the civil war. Merchants have been complaining bitterly about the perpetuation of the Green Line dividing Beirut's Moslem and Christian halves. The separation inhibits the flow of goods. While indiscriminate bombardment of civilian sectors is now rare, the presence of militiamen is a constant reminder that violence could recur. Gun Battles Flare With a population armed to the teeth, gun battles can flare up for the slightest reasons. Two weeks ago, a three-day battle with mortars and rockets broke out in northern Lebanon between Christians and Moslems after a goat belonging to a Shiite clan wandered into a Christian area. In southern Lebanon, violent friction is a daily affair. If it is not between Palestinian guerrillas and Shiites, it is between pro-Iranian fundamentalist fighters and Christian militiamen supported by Israel. Social problems are compounded by the plight of thousands of people uprooted from their homes and villages in 13 years of fighting. Nearly 35 percent of Lebanon's 4 million people are refugees in their own country. In the Moslem part of the capital, business activity began to pick up in February 1987, after several thousand Syrian troops moved in and established a measure of security by ending a reign of terror by private militias. Private Seaports The picture is not all rosy. More than half of the treasury's income from customs duties is still plundered by the militias, which operate their own private seaports. About 35 percent of the work force is unemployed. Most Lebanese look toward the election, in the hope that Parliament will choose a leader to build a strong central government and take the nation back to the prosperity prevailing before national strife erupted in 1975. ''The civil war is over,'' Dany Chamoun, a 53-year-old presidential hopeful, has said. He promised that if elected he would get all the factions to sign a pact renouncing violence. He is the younger son of Camille Chamoun, whose Government in the 1950's witnessed the emergence of Lebanon as the Middle East's banking center. Real estate ventures are prospering, and beach hotels have sprouted along the entire Lebanese coastline from the ancient port of Tyre in the south to Tripoli in the north. A main reason for the appreciation in the value of the national currency is a buildup of foreign exchange reserves by the central bank, known officially as the Bank of Lebanon. These reserves have risen to $1.1 billion, compared with $250 million last December. Today, one United States dollar is worth 350 Lebanese pounds, as compared with 600 in November. Foreign exchange began to accumulate in the central bank's vaults after the Government earlier this year canceled a fuel subsidy that had been a drain on the treasury. There has also been a determined move to check the rise in inflation, which stood at 400 percent in February. Three months ago, Acting Prime Minister Selim al-Hoss, an economist and former banker, ignored workers' demands for a salary increase of more than 300 percent. He decreed a 65 percent raise instead. One industry that has not recovered is tourism. Foreigners have stayed clear of Lebanon because of fighting and the fear of kidnapping. What Lebanon has lost in tourist income it has made up in foreign aid. Assistance from Western, Arab and East bloc countries totals about $50 million a month. Iran has its own aid program, estimated at $60 million a month more, geared primarily to Lebanon's one million Shiites. An invisible income that also helps sustain the national economy comes from the hashish and opium trade, which has thrived in the lawless civil war years.

353-> For $60, a License to Kill
The National Rifle Association promotes itself as an organization of wholesome sportsmen and gun collectors. A recent article in Newsday shows that its adherents also include another type: the inner-city gun runner. The newspaper profiled David Taylor, a Bronx man with a long record of misdemeanors. He was indicted for murder at the age of 16. Even so, he was granted a Federal gun dealer's license. That allowed him to order more than 500 guns from Ohio and ship them to his Bronx apartment. He sold the guns, at big markups, to New York City drug dealers. The license not only permitted the interstate shipments, it also exempted Mr. Taylor from having to show compliance with local gun laws before purchasing guns. How could a man with his record obtain such a license? Because Congress has been unwilling, given the N.R.A.'s vigorous lobbying, to tighten license requirements. To become one of the nation's more than 230,000 licensed dealers, there's no need to open a shop or even hang out a shingle. Just send in a two-page form and $60. Federal officials may not refuse a license unless they can prove the applicant is under 21 or has a history of mental illness, drug abuse or has been convicted of a felony. Mr. Taylor had been charged with many felonies, but plea bargaining reduced his convictions to misdemeanors. Now he's finally a felon, having recently pleaded guilty to weapons sales charges. But his conviction hardly ends the problem for New York, where 20 percent of illegal guns are shipped to Federal licensees, or for other cities. The N.R.A. argues forcefully that stricter gun laws - like the sensible measure now before the House to impose a waiting period between purchase and delivery of a handgun - intolerably inconvenience sportsmen and collectors. No one appreciates that argument more than David Taylor. On his license application he wrote: ''I'm a sportman and collector. I'm also a member of the N.R.A.''

354-> Fresh Air Fund Attracts Young Professionals
What attracts young professionals to work for the Fresh Air Fund? Glimmers of hope outlasting deprivation, as descibed in Prof. Robert Coles's ''Children in Crisis,'' helped convince Howard Johnson 3d, a 29-year-old investment banker and grandson of the franchise founder, to join the fund. A New York charity, the Fresh Air Fund provides summer-camp vactions for inner-city children. ''An encouraging thing I learned in college is that despite harsh environments, there is so much hope and potential in children,'' said Mr. Johnson, who studied under Professor Coles at Harvard. ''I think the Fresh Air Fund really draws out those qualities.'' To Julie Halston, 33, a library manager, the fund is simply ''a program that works.'' Attracting More Young People ''Many of us grew up in the suburbs and now work in the city,'' Ms. Halston said. ''We really understand the pressure an urban setting can put on you and the need it creates to occasionally get out.'' Mr. Johnson and Ms. Halston belong to the Fresh Air Fund's junior council, a group of 30 volunteers formed three years ago to involve more young people in the charity. Though it helps in some administrative tasks, the council primarily helps to raise money. ''This has been a way to attract more young people and broaden our base of support,'' said Jenny Morgenthau, executive director of the Fresh Air Fund. Like Mr. Johnson, Janno Lieber, 26, grew up in Manhattan and said he feels compelled to contribute to New York City's social good, particularly when altruism boils down to sending kids to camp, which ''seems like such a basic thing.'' A Halloween Ball ''The fund really appeals to something that everyone can understand,'' Mr. Lieber said. ''It's easy to remember what it was like to be a kid and to want to extend those experiences to kids today.'' ''I remember going away for the summer and seeing children playing in hydrants,'' he said, ''and thinking I was very fortunate by comparison.'' The junior council's fund raising event, a Halloween Ball, raised $44,000 last year. Members expect to raise as much money from this year's ball, which will be held at the Puck Building in SoHo on October 28. More than 80 percent of the contributions to the nonprofit fund come from individual donors, Miss Morgenthau said. The fund needs $50,000 more to reach the $2.5-million goal for its fiscal year that ends Sept. 30. In addition to monetary gifts, the fund received 12,000 servings of Minute Maid orange and apple juice from the Coca Cola Company and about 18,000 servings of Haagen-Dazs ice cream from the Pillsbury Company. It costs $610 to send a child to camp for two weeks and $211 for a child to visit a volunteer family. Tax-deductible donations may be sent to The Fresh Air Fund, 1040 Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10018. Families who want to be hosts may call the fund at (212) 221-0900.

355-> OBSERVER; A Bird by Any Other Name
Several correspondents have pointed out that this column was all wet once again the other day for saying there was a shortage of colorful nicknames for women in public life. The mail suggests that nicknames, monikers, sobriquets et cetera may be just as common among women as men. A lot of the examples, of course, are from show business and bear press agentry's fingerprints. ''The Blonde Bombshell'' (Jean Harlow) is typical of the case, and ''The Oomph Girl,'' which was attached to Ann Sheridan a few years later, was obviously the work of an agent inspired by ''The Blonde Bombshell.'' All right: uninspired by ''The Blonde Bombshell.'' Probably some Warner Brothers big shot, envious of ''The Blonde Bombshell,'' demanded something just as dynamic for Ann Sheridan. The resulting ''Oomph Girl'' was clearly the work of a tired brain that remembered ''The It Girl'' (Clara Bow) and hoped everybody else had forgotten. ''The It Girl'' was so called because she was said to have ''It,'' which was what they called ''sex appeal'' before movie censorship abolished sex with the result that nobody knew what ''oomph'' was, so who cared that Ann Sheridan had it? Doris T. of New York City submits a generous compilation of such names, which includes ''The Swedish Nightingale'' (Jenny Lind) and ''The Little Sparrow'' (Edith Piaf), thus raising the question, are female singers more likely than male singers to put us in mind of birds? Can you imagine calling Enrico Caruso ''The Italian Falcon'' or Nelson Eddy ''The Great Crested Grebe''? In the swing era, slang terms for a woman who sang with big bands included ''canary'' and ''thrush.'' ''Lady Bird'' (Claudia Alta Taylor) Johnson was not a professional singer but a First Lady, of course, and her nickname was bestowed in infancy, the story goes, by someone in the Taylor household who said, ''She's as pretty as a lady bird,'' or something like that. A tendency to associate the human female with avian life forms may be built into Anglo-Saxon culture. In British slang of the 1960's, ''a bird'' was a woman. Probably a young woman, except when masters of ceremony were trying to patronize grannies. ''Avian,'' incidentally, comes from the Latin word for bird (''avis''), and has been extended in modern times to ''aviate'' and ''aviation,'' which have to do with human flight. Note the old (nowadays despised) stereotype of woman as a ''flighty'' creature. Men are never ''flighty,'' but rather ''nervous,'' ''edgy,'' ''unpredictable'' and dully earthbound in a dozen similar adjectives. Some nicknames applied to women have been as cruel as the meanest given to men. Most recently, everybody around Washington knew that if you referred to ''The Steel Magnolia,'' you were talking about Rosalynn Carter. In England, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is ''The Iron Lady,'' a subtle variation on the name of the ancient torture device called ''The Iron Maiden.'' It would be interesting to know whether these cruel terms are coined by men or the victims' fellow women. Their associating Mrs. Carter and Mrs. Thatcher with iron and steel is an obvious way of suggesting they are deficient in femininity. Metallic nicknames are usually applied to males of the harsher variety. Bismarck was ''The Iron Chancellor,'' Wellington was ''The Iron Duke,'' Vyacheslav Molotov was ''Old Iron Pants.'' ''Stalin,'' the name Iosif Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili gave himself, could translate as ''Man of Steel.'' When she was Prime Minister of Israel, Golda Meir was sometimes called ''Pistol Packin' Mama,'' but this was an affectionate nod to her readiness to take on Egypt's tough Gamal Abdel Nasser in times before their countries made peace. Possibly the meanest sobriquet for a public woman in our humane modern age was ''La Boca Grande,'' the term with which Westbrook Pegler's newspaper column regularly referred to Eleanor Roosevelt. It's Spanish, meaning ''The Big Mouth.'' Pegler, being ingenious at using language as an instrument to inflict pain, was obviously attacking Mrs. Roosevelt's physical appearance as well as her habit of speaking her mind. The most alliterative nickname applied to a First Lady was worn by Mrs. Rutherford B. Hayes, whose refusal to serve alcohol in the White House won her the name ''Lemonade Lucy.'' The happiest nickname ever attached to a woman who didn't quite get to be First Lady was ''Happy'' Rockefeller. Like ''Lady Bird,'' ''Happy'' was a name bestowed long before the White House came in view. Once that grim edifice is sighted, charity ceases among the nicknamers of women.

356-> Aides to Bush Rebut Report on Noriega
Aides to Vice President Bush moved swiftly today to combat a report that prompted a new round of questions about when Mr. Bush first learned of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's alleged involvement in drug trafficking. Craig L. Fuller, Mr. Bush's chief of staff, said today that there had been no discussion of the Panamanian leader's alleged role in drug trafficking at a December 1983 meeting with Mr. Noriega and others in Panama City. He did say that the participants discussed press reports that some members of the country's Defense Forces might be involved in drug trafficking, although Mr. Fuller insisted that no Panamanians were mentioned by name. General Noriega is the leader of the country's Defense Forces. The December 1983 meeting has been previously described by news organizations. But interest was renewed today by the release of a British television documentary suggesting that Mr. Bush and Panamanian leaders had discussed drug trafficking concerns more directly than Mr. Bush has said. Mr. Bush, the Republican Presidential nominee, has said he knew nothing of General Noriega's alleged drug trafficking activities until his indictment on racketeering and drug charges last February. The 1983 meeting took place at an airport in Panama City where Mr. Bush had made a refueling stop in route from Argentina. Among those present were General Noriega and Ricardo de la Espriella, Panama's President at the time. Details Revealed Earlier Details of the 1983 meeting have largely been revealed by Mr. Bush, in an appearance on the ABC News program ''Nightline,'' and by Donald P. Gregg, his national security adviser. Mr. Gregg said earlier this year in sworn statements for a civil lawsuit that Mr. de la Espriella had discussed with Mr. Bush whether Panamanian officials were involved in ''drug activities.'' But Mr. Gregg insisted, ''There were no allegations, whatsoever, concerning any role by Mr. Noriega.'' According to Mr. Gregg's account, President de la Espriella mentioned published allegations about drug activity in Panama. Mr. Bush replied: ''Well, that's interesting; I wasn't aware of these allegations. If I had been aware of them, I would have raised them with you.'' Mr. Fuller said today in answering reporters' questions about the British documentary that he was basing his answers on Mr. Bush's ''recollection'' and on a classified diplomatic cable that reported what had been discussed at the meeting. Cable Won't Be Made Public Mr. Bush did not answer questions himself, and a senior Bush aide said the cable would not be declassified so that it could be released. Mr. Fuller said: ''There was a discussion of press reports that the Panamanian officials had seen that alleged that Defense Force people were involved in this. That was denied in the meeting by the President, but it was not something that was discussed at length. ''There was no indication from the reporting cable that any names were mentioned.'' Mr. Fuller said the discussion centered on how to curtail financial transactions that hide the illegal source of money. He said drug-related money laundering was a concern of Mr. Bush and Mr. de la Espriella. ''The President of Panama, in fact, expressed their desire to continue to cooperate with us and cooperate with the Treasury Department and others who were trying to prevent money laundering,'' Mr. Fuller said. 'Not Directed at Noriega' He said the discussion ''was not directed at Noriega and Noriega didn't appear to respond at that point.'' Mr. Fuller spoke at a hastily arranged news conference at Andrews Air Force Base as Mr. Bush left for Boston. Mr. Fuller termed it ''curious'' that the latest report surfaced so soon before the first broadcast debate between Mr. Bush and his Democratic opponent, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts. The documentary, produced by Thames Television and broadcast tonight on Britain's commercial Independent Television Network, was shown to London journalists Wednesday. In it two former Noriega aides, Jose I. Blandon, and Col. Roberto Dias Herrera, raised another issue concerning Mr. Bush. They indicated that General Noriega had pictures and tape recordings showing that Mr. Bush or his aides knew that the United States was helping to train Nicaraguan insurgents at a time when this was prohibited by American law. They contended General Noriega was blackmailing the Bush campaign. Mr. Fuller flatly denied the blackmailing assertion, saying: ''We've heard the report before, and one, we don't believe that he is blackmailing us; two, we don't believe there's anything with which he could blackmail us, and three, anybody who's alleging that he is blackmailing somebody ought not to be trusted.''

357-> DINING OUT; Scrutable Surprises at a Chinese Oasis
JANI Chinese restaurant, squeezed between Herman's and Toys 'R' Us in Huntington Station's Filene's Shopping Center, is a cooling oasis in what seems like a culinary desert of chain stores. Although the restaurant is dwarfed by its larger neighbors, Jani is surprisingly spacious. It is deep, high and handsome. Twenty-foot ceilings even allow for a balcony. All is serene dove-gray highlighted with royal purple, subdued Oriental art and dramatic bouquets of flowers on the smoky-mirrored bar. Surprises do not stop there. This is a Chinese restaurant with tempting desserts and an honest-to-goodness wine list. Although there are only 20 selections, the list is thoughtfully assembled and includes French, Italian and California choices. There is even Dom Perignon Champagne for $90. Still wines range from $9.95 to $28, with boutique vineyards like Stag's Leap and Hawk Crest represented. Our 1985 Hawk Crest chardonnay ($12.95) was a lively, grapy treat. Beer drinkers will enjoy the wide selection of brews, including the Chinese import Tsing Tao. There are no canned litchis or pineapple chunks for dessert. Instead, diners can dive into mandarin cheesecake (good cheesecake with mandarin orange slices on top), chocolate mousse pie and lime mousse pie with chocolate crust. For Chinese food purists who insist on ice cream for the finale, there are chocolate and strawberry parfaits. That ice cream is Haagen-Dazs. Raspberry sorbet, icy, tangy, tempting, would also be a fit ending to any meal. Just because finales are fine doesn't mean starters suffer. The standard soups ($1.25 to $1.50) - egg drop, wonton, wonton egg drop mix and hot and sour - are all above the Chinese-restaurant norm. The wonton includes chopped spinach as well as scallions; the egg drop is full-flavored; the hot and sour has zing. Such other soups as bean curd with vegetables, velvet corn with chicken and the house special are slightly more expensive ($2 to $2.50), but are underseasoned and routine. Only one appetizer falls short. The shrimp toast is high but rubbery. It is difficult to go wrong with any others. Coconut shrimp, firm and crisp in their semisweet coconut covercoats, are addictive. Crabmeat Rangoon, deep-fried wonton wrappers enclosing sweet crab, are greaseless treats. Baby ribs, Peking style, small succulent chunks in a hoisin-flavored sauce, outshine the standard barbecue variety. Dumplings, both fried and steamed, feature savory pork fillings but do not float from the plate. If there is one entree that puts any Chinese restaurant to the test, it is lemon chicken. Jani's version passed with distinction. The chicken breast is moist; its coating crisp. The lemon sauce is not too sweet and is served in a bowl on the side. Most of the hot and spicy dishes (starred on the menu) are not. Shredded pork with garlic sauce is especially listless. Orange beef is tender and properly crisp but the sauce is anything but zesty. Spiced pork, touted as ''one of the spiciest in the pork category,'' is ordinary breaded pork cutlets with a ginger-dominated sauce on the side. That sauce is flavorful but the heat quotient registers low on the scale. This same sauce accompanies the golden scallops, tender sea scallops rolled in crumbs and fried to a turn. Entrees not starred and not meant to be hot pack a lot of flavor. Spring lamb tossed with scallions is a serendipitous combination. Blossom shrimp, eight large lovelies in a tangy wine sauce, is another tantalizing choice. Shrimp in a nest combines smaller shrimp with a lusty brown sauce in an edible taro root nest. The soggy nest, though, let down the rest of the combination. Four seasons in a swan-shaped foil creation melds lobster, scallops, shrimp and chicken with snow peas, water chestnuts, baby corn and mushrooms into a melange with no weak sisters. Service is unrushed and accommodating. Each dish is announced as it is placed on the table with appropriate sauces pointed out. Wilting shoppers could do worse than duck into Jani for its refreshing atmosphere and good Chinese food. JANI Good 350 Route 110, Huntington Station, 421-5264. Atmosphere: Surprisingly classy shopping-center Chinese. Service: Knowing, swift and scrutable. Recommended dishes: Egg-drop soup, wonton soup, wonton egg-drop mix, hot and sour soup, coconut shrimp, crabmeat Rangoon, baby ribs Peking style, lemon chicken, four seasons, golden scallops, blossom shrimp, spring lamb with scallions, desserts.

358-> For Quick Sale: College Nest Eggs
NOT LONG AGO, a devoted grandfather laid out a total of $13,113 to cover four years' worth of tuition, room and board at the University of Wyoming for his two granddaughters. Quite a gift. The earliest that the older child, a 6-year-old, might become a freshman is 1999, when the school's four-year costs are expected to be $19,225, more than two and a half times the prepayment of $7,488; for the other grandchild, who is 3, the $5,625 prepayment will become the equivalent of nearly $23,000 starting in 2002. The grandfather is Tom Stroock, who as chairman of the Wyoming Senate's appropriations committee sponsored legislation that led last year to the first state tuition-guarantee program. Mr. Stroock also became the first American to make a lump-sum payment for four years of state-sponsored higher education, for his grandchildren, Monica and Maria Leotta. About 400 other Wyoming families gamely followed suit in the program's first year. Last January, Richard and Lynn Rushkiewicz, of Glenview, Ill., bought their daughters Katie, 4, Jill, 8, and Amy, 11, each a $5,000 tax-exempt Illinois College Savings Bond - at zero-coupon prices of $1,330, $1,940 and $2,480 respectively. The occasion was the nation's first statewide college bond sale, a $90 million fund-raiser that sold out in two days. For $5,750, the Rushkiewiczes will realize $15,000 between 1998 and 2005. They also will receive a bonus $20 in interest for each year they hold the bonds - up to a maximum of $400 - providing the money is used to attend a public or private college within the state. Both Wyoming and Illinois have the same motivation: helping families save for the ever-rising costs of college education, growing at twice the inflation rate. Versions of these two basic approaches -education prepayments or education savings - have been discussed in nearly every state legislature. Besides bonds, other savings alternatives have included tax-exempt savings accounts and installment-plan tuition certificates. States Are Reviewing Plans Cautiously While some plans are being reviewed in about half the states, a few states have already put off instituting their legislated prepayment plans. Critics worry that the tuition plans could infringe on aid for the neediest students or spur tuition increases. Others say that because in most cases the savings as well as prepayment plans offer special incentives to encourage attendance at in-state schools, they ultimately create divisions and state boundaries to education. Some advocate national plans. Congress is already considering options such as tax-exempt savings accounts, and savings bonds free of Federal tax when used for college expenses. And a nationwide consortium of leading private colleges and universities, including those in the Ivy League and Stanford University, is seeking to transcend state borders by developing a savings plan that would be open to everyone. Between 1980 and 1987, tuition and fees at American colleges rose about 75 percent, nearly two and a half times faster than the Consumer Price Index. The average cost of four years of private college - tuition, fees, room and board - is $42,000; $16,000 for residents at a public college. Eighteen years hence, assuming the current 7 percent yearly cost rise, those figures will be about $168,500 and $64,500, respectively. Speaking last summer at a national forum on saving for college, Donald M. Stewart, president of the College Board, whose organization includes 2,500 educational institutions and organizations, spoke of a college ''affordability crisis'' and attributed it to the leveling off of student-aid subsidies and steadily climbing debt burdens. ''Families need to understand that they really do have choices about how to finance their burden: that longer-term plans - of saving, investing, borrowing, or combination thereof - create smaller monthly impacts, that starting earlier rather than later lets them earn interest rather than pay it, and minimizes their eventual debt burden,'' Mr. Stewart said. To date, four basic approaches dominate the state savings-for-college scene: tuition guarantees, savings bonds, savings plans similar to Individual Retirement Accounts and tuition certificates. TUITION GUARANTEES. There is a powerful appeal in being able to assure a child's educational future in one stroke, and such programs have a trendy tag - tuition futures. The program in Wyoming, where all the schools are publicly financed, takes its inspiration from Michigan, which modeled its idea in 1986 on Duquesne University, a private college in Pittsburgh. Earlier this year, however, Duquesne found it could not earn enough to provide for four years of college in the future and announced it would refuse applications until investment opportunities improved. With state tuition guarantees, parents can purchase a contract for a single price or for a number of prorated payments to cover tuition alone or with room and board - starting at their child's birth if they want, and paying into a general fund. The state guarantees that the total sum, invested in the intervening years, will be enough to cover college costs, even if tuition rises beyond the investment pool's earnings. Last week, the Michigan Education Trust signed up its first potential beneficiaries. For $6,756, at a 25 percent discount from the current average statewide public-college cost of $9,000 for four years of tuition, newborns got the best bargain. That pays for in-state residents attending any publicly supported school, including the best investment of all, the highest-priced - the University of Michigan. A smaller prepayment of $6,116 covers lower-cost four-year institutions and $2,208 covers two-year community colleges. The package ''could easily be worth $30,000 for four years,'' said a spokesman, Robert Kolt. Michigan went ahead with its plan and weeklong sale despite a mixed tax ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, which decided that the trust was taxable. Students, though free of state tax, will nonetheless be taxed on the increased value of their investment, on a year-by-year basis, while at college. Those choosing to attend a private Michigan college will receive an amount equivalent to average state tuition. Caveat for Buyers Another caveat for buyers into the Michigan Trust is that their investment does not absolutely guarantee tuition. Any shortfall of funds that occurs would either be raised by adjusting prices on future enrollees or, if there are not enough enrollees, by making prorated refunds to contract holders. Starting Sept. 1 and lasting the rest of the year, Florida will accept applicants for tuition and, optionally, housing. ''We're going to have 100,000 beneficiaries by the end of 1988, easy,'' said William W. Montjoy, executive director of the Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education Expense Program. ''Inquiring parents don't ask us how much -they want to know where to send the check.'' Costs for future enrollees will be adjusted yearly. As in other states, the contract is transferrable to another family member if the stated beneficiary does not attend college. Opponents of tuition guarantees fear such plans leave non-participants, taxpayers and students enrolling later on with the tab for keeping the trusts solvent. Tuition may increase for everyone, they say. ''In order to make up for lost revenues, a state or an institution where the guarantee fund has appreciated at a rate slower than tuition will be tempted to raise still further the tuitions charged to students who have not participated in the plan,'' said Arthur E. Hauptmann, a consultant to the Brookings Institution and the American Council on Education, the umbrella organization for the nation's colleges and universities. These financial anxieties have cast a pall on some state trust-fund legislation. Ron Gamble, the executive secretary of Tennessee's trust, noting that the legislation does not provide for the state ''to pick up the tab'' in case the trust proves actuarially unsound, said a shortage ''could be covered only by future purchasers. The plan might be made so highly priced that no one would want to participate.'' Mr. Gamble, whose office will press the Tennessee law's sponsors for possible changes, said ''that it is safe to say that it will be at least another year before a program can be started - if ever.'' Indiana and Maine, among the first states to enact trust laws along with Tennessee, are also having second thoughts lest they have to bail out failing plans. Robert Bowman, Michigan's state treasurer and chief architect of its plan, argues that the Michigan trust is sufficiently funded. The trust, estimating that tuition rises will average 7.3 percent yearly, is geared to earn at least 9.5 percent - half of what the state's pension funds have netted over the last five years. Mr. Bowman, who said that 60,000 applications had been sent to inquiring families, expressed confidence that because of the ''conservative'' investment structure, subsequent enrollees might be better off than the first group signed up last week. Florida, unlike Michigan, must pay up on all contracts at enrollment time; in Wyoming, the college picks up any shortfall if the legislature doesn't appropriate funds. Mr. Hauptmann and other critics of tuition guarantees also worry that money could be diverted to shore up shortfalls and/or cut into financial-aid programs for the neediest students. ''Instead of lobbying for tax exemptions for tuition futures, the higher-education community would be better off advocating and getting enacted a national incentive plan that would encourage parents at every income level to save more for their children's college expenses,'' Mr. Hauptmann said. SAVINGS BONDS. About a dozen states have bond proposals similar to those bought by the Rushkiewicz family. The tax-free holdings are zero-coupon bonds, which cost less initially and accumulate money over time up to the maturity date; they are available in a variety of denominations to attract education-minded buyers as well as others. Some bonds mature in as many as 20 years - the Illinois bonds mature yearly between 1993 and 2005 - and can be cashed in to coincide with each year a student attends college. Dorothea Thrasher purchased a bond for her 12-year-old grandson, Anthony Thrasher, a seventh-grader in Springfield, Ill. Mrs. Thrasher, a widow who worked as a secretary for the Illinois Board of Higher Education before her retirement, said her bond, which matures in five years, would nearly double by the time Anthony is college age. ''I just knew it was a good buy,'' she said. Buyers like Mrs. Thrasher assume a risk that the interest earned on such bonds, plus the bonus for in-state college attendance, will keep pace with tuition inflation when they're cashed in. Iowa, North Dakota, North Carolina and Oregon have already sold the tax-free bonds (the last two without interest bonuses designed to encourage residents to enroll at in-state schools); Washington will do so next month, Colorado soon after. Alaska, Connecticut, Minnesota, Ohio and Rhode Island have authorization to issue bonds within the next year. SAVINGS ACCOUNTS. Working much like an I.R.A., these accounts can be set up with the state or banks, insurance companies, savings and loans and other financial institutions. When a child enters college, the parents authorize withdrawals. The risk is that in the interim the investment and interest on it will lose ground to inflation. New York, pending possible Federal savings-plan action, is considering a Regents College Savings Fund for families with incomes under $85,000. Contributions of up to $2,000 yearly for each child could be deducted from state tax returns. Other states are considering ideas to expand their programs beyond their borders. Kentucky has already approved such a plan, expected to be in place by next summer, in which the proceeds, free of state but not Federal tax, could be used at any college in the nation. A separate endowment, which the state hopes to fund from private business and foundations, would be available only for use in-state. The sponsor of California legislation, Senator John Seymour, says the proposed state College Savings accounts would use tax-exempt general-obligation bonds, available with deposits perhaps as small as $100, to guarantee ''a return on investment which will meet the rising costs of a college education.'' The ''floating'' interest rate would be linked to the average rate of inflation for costs as measured by the Independent College 500, an annual calculation issued by the College Board. It is similar to a plan promoted by the profit-making College Savings Bank, a private New Jersey company specializing in certificates of deposit designed for long-range college saving. According to a spokesman for the senator, the College Savings Bank ''helped with the technicalities'' of the plan.'' Residents could use the proceeds at any college in the nation. They would pay a 1 percent administration fee. TUITION CERTIFICATES. Massachusetts has developed a form of savings plan in which tuition certificates combine partial guarantees with a tax-exempt status for students attending public or private college in the state. Also pegged to the Independent College 500, it would set aside a portion of the state's tax-free general-obligation bonds, which finance bridges, roads and the like, for educational use. By contributing money in denominations as small as $50, parents could purchase a specified minimum tuition at local colleges. Each certificate is a portion of the tuition, and parents may accumulate up to the full tuition payment by the time their child is ready to enter college. Massachusetts would publish an annual list of how much the bonds were worth toward tuition at each participating school. For example, a $1,000 bond could represent one-fifteenth of a year's tuition at Harvard, one-sixth at the University of Massachusetts or one-quarter at a local public college. A college assumes the risk that its tuition will not increase faster than the certificate's investment earnings. The New Jersey legislature is studying a similar program, as well as a savings-bond plan. Beyond the many state and private plans, critics and observers agree that an enlarged Federal role in long-range financial planning for college is needed. One such proposal, a national savings trust similar to the New York Regents idea, would enable families earning under $100,000 to deduct contributions for tuition and other costs when a child reaches college age. The proposal receiving the strongest support so far was introduced by Senator Edward M. Kennedy. It would make interest on Double EE bonds tax-free for families earning up to $75,000; two-thirds tax-free for earnings up to $125,000, and one-third free up to $150,000. An Administration-backed proposal would grant tax exemption at annual levels of adjusted gross income under $80,000. Action on either proposal is uncertain this year. Backing National Plan Dr. Richard E. Anderson, a Columbia Teachers College professor and adviser on the Massachusetts plan, is editor of Capital Ideas, a publication dealing with issues of college finance. The national savings-bond idea is one he endorses, primarily because it ''would help discourage the development of state plans that pose barriers to interstate college attendance.'' The Consortium on Financing Higher Education, a Washington-based group of 30 private colleges, shares some of those same concerns. In June, a committee - consisting of financial specialists from Harvard, Yale, Cornell and Pennsylvania universities, Amherst, Mount Holyoke and Swarthmore colleges and the University of Rochester - met ''to set up a better version of the tuition-savings program,'' said its chairman, Loren Hart, vice president and treasurer of Swarthmore. The program's goal, Mr. Hart said, is to earn a higher after-tax return on savings for families than is currently available in public or private commercial plans, ''without adding risk to the colleges.'' The consortium's intention is to operate its proposed fund like the endowments at the larger universities, which, according to Mr. Hart, have ''as much as 80 percent in common stock,'' depending on market conditions. Mr. Hart noted - as does Dr. Anderson - that stocks have historically fared better than bonds and other fixed-income securities, and an endowment is regularly adjusted ''to how its managers view the market at any particular time.'' The plan probably would combine the Massachusetts certificate idea with an average college cost. It would take at least a year to establish, Mr. Hart said. Sooner or later, everyone making college plans might be able to sort through a welter of options, including some offered by private profit-making companies. In any event, the process will prod people to begin saving for the biggest bill they have encountered since their home mortgages. At a conference in Denver on college-savings plans, Herman B. Leonard, a professor of public management at Harvard and chairman of the committee that developed the Massachusetts plan, said: ''The problem is not how to reject the Michigan model if we don't like it. The problem is to figure out a model that we think will work, that we think will mitigate the risks.'' A PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR'S CHECKLIST The College Board, a national group of 2,500 educational institutions and organizations based in New York, developed the following questions to help parents, students and other consumers evaluate college savings and prepayment plans. 1. Is a minimum contribution required to enter the program? Are incremental additions possible? 2. Is there a maximum amount that can be contributed annually? Will such a maximum prevent accumulation from keeping pace with a realistic projection of future college costs? 3. Can any family member, or an agent thereof, contribute? Are there exceptions? 4. Can the plan's proceeds be transferred to another family member? 5. Is eligibility restricted to a particular type of institution, either within a state or within a school category, such as independent colleges? Are there any penalties? 6. Is the plan's yield guaranteed? How is the family protected from investment shortfalls? 7. Is the plan fully insured? Can the contributing family's investment be recovered if the sponsor ceases to exist? 8. Does the plan cover all college costs, or only tuition? 9. Are there residency requirements for eligibility? What happens if the family moves out of state? 10. Are there age restrictions or time limits on use? Do plan proceeds have to be used within a fixed number of years after high school? 11. How many years of study are covered by the proceeds? Undergraduate only? Is graduate study possible? Full-time only, or is part-time attendance possible? 12. Are there restrictions on who can match funds contributed to the plan? Could an employer or state contribute? 13. What are conditions for refunds in the event of a student's nonadmission to college, disability or death? 14. Does the family benefit from any investment surplus over the necessary cost levels, or would a surplus profit the sponsor only? 15. Are the plan's benefits taxable? Will any tax accrue to the contributor, plan sponsor or student?

361-> Health; Paris Surgeons Transplant Same Liver Into 2 Patients
Surgeons in Paris transplanted parts of the same liver into two different patients, one of the doctors has reported. The doctor, Henri Bismuth, a liver transplant surgeon at Paul Brousse Hospital in Paris, said Tuesday that the surgery occurred May 1. He described the transplants at a conference here on liver disease. The procedure has apparently been performed only once before, in February in West Germany, according to Dr. Christoph E. Broelsch, a professor of surgery at the University of Chicago. Because the liver is the only organ in the body that can regenerate itself, it grows naturally along with the body after being reduced in size. Dr. Bismuth said the transplanted organ was functioning well in both patients. Doctors here said such operations could help overcome the chronic shortage of donor organs. ''If you have patients who are terribly ill and in equal need, it's one way out,'' said Dr. Thomas E. Starzl, of the University of Pittsburgh, who performed the world's first successful liver transplant in 1967. #450 Await Transplants About 450 people are awaiting liver transplants in the United States, according to Arthur Harrell of the American Council on Transplantation. About half are children. Dr. Bismuth said he had no choice but to divide the liver of a 40-year-old brain-dead man for two women, both of whom were unconscious and near death. The donor had been rushed to France from Switzerland and was a suitable match for either of the two recipients, who were 40 years old and 54. Unable to choose between the women, Dr. Bismuth transplanted half the liver into each patient. He told about 100 physicians from around the world gathered in Pittsburgh for the conference on liver disease that both his patients' transplanted livers were functioning well. One of the women, however, is still critically ill because of kidney and lung complications she suffered before surgery. On Feb. 2, Dr. Rudolf Pichlmayr of the University of Hanover's Medical School in West Germany performed a similar split-liver transplant. Dr. Pichlmayr said he, like Dr. Bismuth, was desperate to save two patients' lives even though just one liver was available. As a result, he split the liver of a 23-year-old man and transplanted half into a 2-year-old boy and the other half into a 63-year-old woman. Both recipients are back home and doing well, Dr. Pichlmayr said in a telephone interview from West Germany early today. In recent years, Dr. Pichlmayr and other surgeons in Europe and the United States have trimmed livers so the organs can fit into transplant patients, particularly children for whom donor organs are most scarce. Split liver transplants are more complicated than simply paring down the organ because doctors need to divide a common artery and bile duct, Dr. Pichlmayr said. As a result, half the split organ is often weaker than the other. Dr. Broelsch said the one-year success rate was about 50 percent to 60 percent for children who receive reduced-size livers, as against 80 percent to 90 percent for those who receive an entire organ. The risk for split-liver transplants is expected to be even greater and, until more is known, will remain a method of last resort, doctors said.

364-> WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING; Pride and Deficit
You might think that anybody who had reached the pinnacle of power at an agency like the Office of Management and Budget could take a little ego bruising now and then. But no. James C. Miller 3d, the budget director, has issued a formal protest to the Nike Capital Challenge over the official result of the Sept. 15 running race sponsored by the shoe company. According to the judges, Mr. Miller finished second to William J. Bennett, then Secretary of Education, in the Cabinet subdivision of the contest. Mr. Miller offered a drawing ''provided by an O.M.B. employee of impeccable character'' to disprove the verdict. It depicted a vibrant Mr. Miller several steps ahead of a dispirited Mr. Bennett at the finish line. ''I hope your panel of judges gives appropriate weight to this incontrovertible evidence and reverses this injustice at the earliest possible moment,'' Mr. Miller wrote to the race director, Jeff Darman. But Mr. Darman responded that a review of the race tape had revealed that Mr. Miller was ''incurring some oxygen debt.'' That, he said, ''resulted in a small deficit in yardage between you and Secretary Bennett,'' and added: ''Your argument in this case that deficits don't matter I am afraid is open to serious question. However, if you wish to appeal further I will ask advisory committee member Judge Glenn Archer Jr. of the U.S. Court of Appeals to convene a panel to hear the arguments.'' A spokesman for Mr. Miller said yesterday that he would accept the decision ''as it stands with great reluctance, realizing he may be forfeiting some of his constitutional guarantees.''

366-> Congressional Negotiations On Tax Bill Are Broken Off
Congressional negotiations on a compromise tax bill broke off today after Senators and House members could not even approach agreement on how large a tax increase they should approve. ''Whether the conference gets back together at all again is very much in the air,'' said an aide to House negotiators who demanded anonymity. ''At the moment, it is doubtful.'' ''We have not selected the pallbearers yet,'' said Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, who is heading Senate negotiators. ''Senate conferees feel we can still get a bill if the House wants one.'' He added that Senate staffers would review the latest House offer over the weekend. Many Provisions in Doubt The breakdown left in doubt the fate of a package of corrections to the 1986 tax law, selected new tax reductions, the tax increases to pay for them, and a ''bill of rights'' for taxpayers facing enforcement or collection action from the Internal Revenue Service. The negotiations are complicated by the absence of Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee. Ever since Senator Bentsen was nominated in July, there have been indications he did not want to be identified closely with a bill that opponents could point to as evidence of a Democratic tendency to raise taxes to finance more spending. ''Senator Bentsen's position all year long has been that he is not interested in raising a lot of taxes to be plowed back into other tax cuts,'' said Bill Maddox, a Finance Committee spokesman. Differences on Tax Increase Negotiators are trying to work out a compromise between a House-passed bill that would raise taxes by between $7 billion and $7.5 billion over three years and a Senate plan with a price tag of just under $3 billion. Meeting behind closed doors, Senator Baucus and Senator Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon, offered a compromise of about $3 billion. Representatives Dan Rostenkowski, Democrat of Illinois, and Bill Archer, Republican of Texas, rejected it as no compromise at all and responded with a $4.5 billion proposal. The Senate, in turn, said no to that offer, and negotiations ended. The shuttling of proposals between the two sets of negotiators indicated that the final bill - if there is one -would include some form of the taxpayers' bill of rights. It also would include at least one year of special tax relief for about 20 million owners of mutual funds and would free farmers from paying a tax on diesel fuel used on the farm. Corporate Tax Issue In backing away from its $7 billion-plus package, House negotiators agreed to drop a money-raiser, opposed by the Reagan Administration, that would require corporations to pay more tax on dividends from stocks they own in other companies. The House also agreed to modify slightly its call for repeal of the ''completed-contract accounting'' method used by military contractors and many large builders. This method allows postponement on some building profits. Under the proposed compromise, the benefit would be retained only for construction of housing. Passage of this tax bill has not been a high priority of the Administration or either house of Congress. What pressure there is has come from accountants, who want to clear up some ambiguities in the sweeping 1986 tax law, and from farmers eager to win repeal the diesel-fuel requirement. The House and the Senate bills both contain those provisions.

368-> Patent Problems
To the Editor: Donn Lobdell's letter of July 24 proposes some revamping of the patent system that would be counterproductive. The legal requirement for obtaining a patent is that the invention must be new, useful and non-obvious to a person with ordinary skill in the art. Mr. Lobdell's suggestion that a panel of experts offer proposed solutions to a problem to determine obviousness misses some important points. First, the legal standard for obviousness is not determined by what experts would consider obvious. It is the person with ordinary skill in the art. More important, the panel would be put in motion to solve a problem that has already been stated. As any creative person can tell you, the hardest task of invention is to identify the problem. When a problem is not obvious, neither is an invention. Some countries publish inventions for opposition before a patent is granted, as Mr. Lobdell proposed. This would drastically alter the United States patent system, under which applications are kept secret. An applicant who fails to get a patent has the option of keeping his invention a trade secret. This alternative would be lost if his invention were published before the patent is granted. ADRIAN CALDERONE Brooklyn, July 25

372-> An Only Child Speaks
To The Home Section: I never felt the need for a brother or sister as a child [ Parent & Child, April 14 ] . I was never spoiled and basically shared in the household chores because of a constantly ailing parent. I never had a ''play group''; I honestly don't see the need for it now. Kids seem to have too much organized activity planned for them. I must share a remark that I think sets us ''only children'' apart. While my mother was ailing from a stroke and other related disorders, I was constantly running. I worked all day, then drove 45 minutes to the nursing home to be with my mother. I was constantly exhausted. When I complained to a friend, she reminded me of how lucky I was not to have brothers or sisters. She said: ''Imagine: you never have to fight with your family over whose turn it is to visit your mother.'' MILLICENT K. BRODY Westfield, N.J.

373-> To Many, Mexican Press Is Meek . . .
Mexican voters had not even arrived at the polls on the morning of July 6 when the weekly magazine Impacto was beginning its press run with a surprising headline. ''The People Decided: Carlos Salinas de Gortari,'' the headline announced, hours before the presidential vote count was scheduled to start. As the magazine saw it, the elections were ''conducted in tranquillity'' and ''everything indicates the triumph of Salinas was clear and resounding.'' The magazine reported that Mr. Salinas's party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, ''achieved its objective of winning 20 million votes in its favor.'' But it was not until a week later that Mr. Salinas was officially declared the winner of an election in which he achieved a bare majority. The election turnout was put at only 19 million. As for Impacto, which withdrew the issue after events intruded, and for most of the rest of the Mexican press, credibility has fallen to its lowest level. Libelous and Misleading? Throughout the campaign, the opposition candidates, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the left-of-center National Democratic Front and Manuel Clouthier of the right-of-center National Action Party, complained that much of the news coverage was libelous, misleading and corrupt. But after an election in which Mexicans made it clear that they wanted sweeping social and political changes, the opposition has been joined by a disgruntled and nonpartisan citizen's chorus and even by the voices of some journalists. Mexico City has more than a dozen daily newspapers, but little diversity of opinion on sensitive questions involving the governing party, known as the PRI. With the exception of a few publications like the news magazine Proceso, which this week accused its competitors of ''beating the drums'' for Mr. Salinas, almost all the national publications follow guidelines put forth by the Government. The Monterrey newspaper El Norte, which takes an independent line, is all but impossible to find in the capital. Traditionally, a dependence on advertisements from Government agencies and on newsprint from a state-run company have reinforced that indirect control. There is also a long and well-established tradition of paying off individual reporters and editors, a practice known in Mexican slang as ''el embute'' - derived from a Spanish verb meaning ''to stuff'' -to assure that coverage is favorable and that the proper photograph is displayed in the proper place. Quick on the Draw For whatever reason, most newspapers accepted at face value the PRI's claim of victory hours after the polls closed, ignoring the absence of any voting totals that would have substantiated the party's assertion that it had won ''clearly and resoundingly.'' As a result of this and other lapses, a columnist for the newspaper Excelsior, whose own weekly magazine, Jueves de Excelsior, also declared Mr. Salinas the winner before the polls closed, took the press to task for a ''slippery partisanship'' in covering the election. The most pointed criticisms, however, have been directed against the two national television networks. Although the intellectual elite and upper middle class look to print outlets for their information, the bulk of the population, especially those living outside the capital, relies on the state-run Imevision network or its privately owned counterpart, Televisa, for news. As the news organization with the largest audience in Mexico, Televisa and its news anchorman, Jacobo Zabludovsky, have come under intense fire from all quarters for openly favoring the PRI. At vote tallying centers in the capital, protesters last weekend expressed their disgust with the network by chanting ''Televisa stupefies'' and ''Jacobo is a fool.'' Strident Commentary Some demonstrators said they were referring to the main news broadcast on the night after the vote, in which Mr. Zabludovsky criticized a vote fraud protest presented to Interior Minister Manuel Bartlett Diaz by three opposition candidates. Mr. Zabludovsky said he found it strange that ''Trotskyites, Communists and the right wing'' had acted together, but he skipped over the substance of the statement, in which the candidates said they were uniting ''in defense of the integrity of the vote.'' Later, during live coverage of meetings of the Federal Electoral Commission, both television networks broadcast speeches in which Mr. Bartlett assured viewers that the count was proceeding normally. But any time members of opposition parties rose to complain of delays or to challenge the totals from various districts, the networks returned to regular programming, mostly movies and cartoons. ''The strategy has been to dissipate reality by the simple method of not allowing it to appear on television,'' said Carlos Monsivais, a writer who often criticizes Mexican news organizations. ''That has continued from October 1987,'' when Mr. Salinas was named the PRI candidate, ''until this very day.'' Distorted Reports Indeed, during the campaign, both television networks often showed Mr. Cardenas and Mr. Clouthier with only a handful of people around them, implying that they had little popular support. Mr. Salinas was always shown drawing huge crowds, but there was never any mention of the fact that the PRI regularly pays people to attend its rallies. One Televisa program focusing on the opposition candidates superimposed Mussolini's image next to footage of Mr. Clouthier delivering a campaign speech. Another segment, on Mr. Cardenas, lingered over photographs of Fidel Castro, Salvador Allende Gossens and Nikita Khrushchev as Mr. Cardenas, the leader of a four-party coalition, was asked what historical figures he admired. In response to this coverage, opposition candidates joined this week in a libel suit against Televisa and the host of the program, Juan Ruiz Healy. Mr. Cardenas has also written a letter to Mr. Bartlett demanding that the opposition be granted time on the networks as compensation for slanted coverage. 'A Cantina Squabble' But even if the petition is granted and the libel suit is dismissed, the pressure on Televisa in particular seems unlikely to diminish. Neither the network nor Mr. Zabludovsky responded to telephone calls requesting that they comment on the criticisms directed against them. ''The case of Televisa was scandalous, and the opposition as a whole will have to do something to rein in so much arrogance and voraciousness,'' wrote R. Perez Ayala, the Excelsior columnist. ''The news anchor treated his viewers as if the obligation to inform could degenerate into a cantina squabble.''

375-> Auctions
Washington Under Fire George Washington's handwritten account of his participation in the French and Indian Wars will be auctioned at Christie's Nov. 18. ''My father died when I was only 10 years old,'' Washington wrote at the beginning of this revealing 11-page manuscript, in which he goes on give a vivid description of Gen. Edward Braddock's defeat and death in the battle of Fort Duquesne and a tragic skirmish between two groups of British soldiers. Christopher R. Coover, one of Christie's manuscript specialists, said this week that the autobiographical work was ''the most important Washington manuscript to be auctioned in this century.'' The presale estimate is $150,000. ''There are very few Washington autographs of importance around,'' Mr. Coover said, adding that the rarest of all are ''Washington on Washington'' accounts. Washington's undated, richly detailed narrative of his early military career, written at Mount Vernon between 1786 and 1789, was compiled for his biographer, David Humphreys. In these ''Remarks,'' Washington writes that the notes were to be returned to ''G W'' or destroyed - in his words, ''committed to the flames.'' The manuscript is the most important offering in the sale of the collection of John Fleming, a New York rare-book dealer who died at the age of 77 last December. The 400 lots to be auctioned in the two-session, all-day sale are expected to total up to $1 million. Colonel Humphreys, who became Washington's personal secretary after the general was elected President, never completed the biography. Information from the draft and from Washington's ''Remarks,'' appeared anonymously in 1789 in Jedidiah Morse's ''American Geography'' and, over the years, in other publications. The manuscript descended in Humphreys's family to his widow, Anne, who gave it in 1829, the year she died, to John Pickering, a friend. Pickering's descendants, through the Pickering Foundation, sold the manuscript in 1974 to Mr. Fleming. ''Washington was only 23 when he served with Braddock,'' Mr. Coover said. ''At that young age he was an experienced campaigner.'' Washington rejoined the British forces as Braddock's aide on July 8, 1755, at the Monongahela River. They were attacked while crossing the river and, Washington wrote, ''by the unusual Halooing and whooping of the enemy, whom they could not see, were so disconcerted and confused as soon to fall into irretrievable disorder. . . .'' Braddock was wounded fatally after several horses were either killed or wounded under him, Washington added. Washington was also hit: ''G W remained the sole Aid through the day, to the Genl; he also had one horse killed, and two wounded under him. A ball through his hat, and several through his clothes, but escaped unhurt. . . .'' He recalled the army in retreat with horror: ''The dead, the dying, the groans, lamentations and crys along the Road of the wounded for help . . . were enough to pierce a heart of adamant.'' Several months later, Washington, a colonel, participated in a battle at dusk that appeared to haunt him when he wrote of it 30 years later. The skirmish was between two groups of British soldiers, each of which mistook the other for the enemy, firing at one another and killing several men. Washington wrote that it was ''a circumstance w [ hic ] h involved the life of G W in as much jeapardy as it had ever been before or since.'' He continued: ''G W never was in more imminent danger by being between two fires.'' Mr. Coover said this was Washington's only firsthand report of an incident cited far less poignantly by others. Crustacean Calling Salvador Dali's ''Lobster Telephone,'' from 1936, one of the most famous artifacts of the Surrealist movement, is among the bizarre offerings from the Edward James collection to be auctioned Oct. 6 at Christie's. Dali combined two unrelated items in this Surrealist object -a painted plaster lobster and a telephone - to fulfill what the artist had once said a Surrealist artifact should be: ''An absolutely useless object from a practical and rational point of view.'' It is expected to sell for $20,000 to $30,000. The Dali lobster telephone may be one of only two that he made - both of them for Mr. James, according to David Ellis Jones, a Christie's fine-arts specialist in London. Mr. Jones said Mr. James had sold the other one - it fetched $42,940 - at Christie's in London in 1981. It is now in the Tate Gallery in London. Mr. James, a British collector of Surrealist art who was the heir to several American fortunes in lumber, metals, mining and railroads, was a patron of the Surrealists. At his death at the age of 77 in 1984, he bequeathed virtually all of his fortune to the Edward James Foundation, which manages West Dean College, a school of crafts and conservation based at his estate in Sussex, England. An auction in 1986 of more than 2,000 items from his collection totaled $6.6 million. This sale of 115 works remaining from the James collection is expected to total between $840,000 and $1.3 million. Among the paintings in the sale are Dali's ''Tristan and Isolde,'' from 1941, a depiction of human bones and drapery in a landscape of pine trees (up to $350,000), and Delvaux's ''Night Comedy,'' from 1936, a moonlit setting of half-nude women against a background of Roman buildings (up to $280,000). 90 Works Withdrawn Most of the plaster models and bronzes of works by such American artists as Frederic Remington and Daniel Chester French were withdrawn beforehand or did not find buyers at Guernsey's auction last Saturday at the Seventh Regiment Armory. The sale was to have offered 407 pieces of sculpture consigned mostly by the Roman Bronze Works, a Queens foundry. The presale estimate for the sale was $5.8 million. Last Friday, a restraining order was placed by six people and one institution on 75 works in the sale, questioning the right of the Roman Bronze Works to place the sculptures in the auction. As a result of this group action and other problems, 90 works were withdrawn. The auction of the remaining works fared poorly. Many - 134 plasters and bronzes - did not sell, and the 183 that did totaled $463,000. ''We were very disappointed in how the pieces sold,'' said Philip J. Schiavo, the president of the Roman Bronze Works. When asked about questions raised by dealers and collectors in the field - concerning the foundry's right to sell these plasters and whether they were original - Mr. Schiavo said: ''As far as we know, these are the original plasters.'' He added that in some cases the foundry had letters showing the works had been purchased from the estates of artists. In others, he said, the plasters had been on the premises for decades and not claimed.

376-> 'The Predators' Ball'
To the Editor: In his review of my book ''The Predators' Ball'' (July 10), James Sterngold asserts that I have delivered an indictment of the Wall Street firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert based on reporting done by others. He quotes the following sentence: ''Indeed, it seems plain to this writer that if the above or some similar assortment of Milken's and, by extension, Drexel's actions are not worth prosecuting, then the securities laws were not worth passing.'' But if he had read the preceding paragraph, he would have seen the list of acts by Drexel and by Michael Milken, head of Drexel's junk-bond department, to which I refer. One of them is, as I say in the book, based on reporting done by two Pulitzer Prize-winning reporters, James Stewart and Dan Hertzberg, in The Wall Street Journal; the other four, described in considerable detail, are based solely on my own reporting. That list, moreover, does not repeat numerous other examples in the book, again based on my reporting, of actions that may well be worthy of prosecution but that many lawyers may argue fall in the gray area between legality and illegality - where Drexel has made its home. Mr. Sterngold also adds that his articles in The Times are among the sources I drew upon. In both articles of his that I alluded to, Mr. Sterngold had presented - uncritically, without any further illumination - Drexel's side of a particular story. And I used both examples to show just how misleading Drexel's version of the facts is. Mr. Sterngold has shown the same tireless devotion to getting at the truth here. When Drexel's ''truth squad'' approached him, as they have other reviewers of my book, with a list of purported inaccuracies, Mr. Sterngold - despite the fact that Drexel is his beat - apparently considered it too taxing to try to ascertain (unlike Chris Welles at Business Week) whether Drexel's charges had any merit. Instead he threw up his hands and declared that ''if correct'' those charges mean I am guilty of ''sloppiness.'' This from a reviewer who has just accused me of delivering an indictment based on others' evidence! CONNIE BRUCK New York James Sterngold replies: I stand by the statement that ''she presents no convincing new evidence'' and note that Chris Welles came to the same conclusion in his review, saying ''her evidence does not go much beyond published speculation.'' Ms. Bruck asserts that I wronged her by not checking out each of Drexel's claims of inaccuracies in the book. I concluded, like Mr. Welles, that none of Drexel's assertions would ''sharply alter the basic picture Ms. Bruck presents.''

378-> A Feasible End Run For Food to Ethiopia
To the Editor: Your coverage of Ethiopia's ban on emergency relief efforts to the millions of starving people in Eritrea and Tigre documents the tragedy of that land, where food is used as a weapon in a continuing civil war (news story, April 29). However, I was distressed to read that unnamed ''relief officials'' said that the flow of food from across the Sudanese border cannot be increased. The Eritrean Relief Association, the only agency bringing food aid to rebel-held territory, has identified one million Eritreans in need of food aid. The association could expand its operations to bring help to these people through the Sudan, given sufficient food and trucks from the United States and humanitarian organizations. In fact, your article mentions an appeal by the Eritrean Relief Committee for trucks and food to support the cross-border work of its partner agency, the Eritrean Relief Association. Your sources are right to be concerned about the effects of the Ethiopian Government's action, but the statement that ''bad or nonexistent roads and bridges'' make increased cross-border operations unfeasible is simply wrong. I have traveled in the region as acting director of international programs for the Unitarian Universalist Service Committee, an international development and human rights agency that has worked in the Horn of Africa for several years. Almost all areas are accessible to trucks; the remainder can be reached easily by pack animals. The service committee has worked in partnership with the Ethiopian Relief Association on health care and agricultural programs and can attest to its organizational abilities. We are confident that if its appeal for assistance is met, it can bring food to those who need it. LOU WITHERITE Boston, April 29, 1988

380-> Kimco Buys Campeau's Gold Circle
Gold Circle discount stores, one of the nation's biggest discount chains, will soon cease to exist. The Campeau Corporation said yesterday that it had sold its 76 Gold Circle stores to the Kimco Development Corporation, a privately held developer based in Roslyn, L.I. Kimco is paying $325 million for the Gold Circle stores and a few Richway stores as well, Campeau said. In turn, Kimco will sell 31 stores to Target Stores, a division of the Dayton Hudson Corporation, and will lease 35 stores to Hills Department Stores Inc. Terms of those arrangements were not disclosed. Target and Hills intend to remodel the stores and reopen them under their own names. Campeau said the stores' inventory would be sold in the next 12 weeks. Kimco, which owns and manages shopping centers, is trying to sell the remaining 10 stores, Campeau said. Sale Had Been Anticipated The sale of the Gold Circle chain had been expected to follow Campeau's acquisition of Federated Department Stores Inc. The Toronto-based developer said it had planned to sell a number of units in an effort to reduce the debt it incurred in buying Federated in May and Allied Stores in 1986. Only six of Federated's 22 divisions remain and five Allied Stores. Separately, Roger Ashton, Campeau's chief financial officer, said the company expected to sell its Ann Taylor division within the next four to six weeks. Price Seen as Low Because Gold Circle's annual sales are near the $1 billion level, some analysts said the price was very low, representing less than one-third of the company's revenues. Department stores other than discount stores have been drawing takeover prices in recent years of about 100 percent of revenues, said Robert F. Buchanan, senior analyst at A. G. Edwards of St. Louis. According to industry reports, however, Campeau had difficulty selling Gold Circle at a more desirable price, because of the profit pressures on discounters and the generally erratic trend of retail sales for more than a year. ''The low price, indicative perhaps of a 'fire sale,' shows what a tough environment discount stores are operating in in today's retail arena,'' Mr. Buchanan said. ''The problem with discount stores today is that all they have to sell is low price when every retailer is selling that, too, plus ambiance and better service. Given a choice, a shopper would probably choose a store with low price, ambiance and service.'' But he also said that discounters were finding it difficult to keep their traditional price differential against department stores because of rising costs of labor and operations. Chain Started in Ohio Gold Circle, founded in 1967 by Federated with one store in Columbus, Ohio, was expanded to 30 stores in four states by the end of 1977. Richway was begun in 1970 with two stores in Atlanta by Rich's Inc., the Atlanta department store chain. Rich's was acquired by Federated in 1976. In 1980, Federated made the 31 Richway stores a separate division. But in 1986, Federated merged Richway into Gold Circle while keeping the Richway name in a number of stores. The 31 stores Target will buy are in Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Kentucky. Hills, a discount chain, will lease 35 stores in New York, Ohio and Kentucky.

381-> METRO DATELINES; Purple-Heart Project Gets Site for Museum
The Town Council has voted to donate 14 acres of land and spend $7,000 to help establish the proposed National Purple Heart Museum in Enfield. The council's decision, made Tuesday night, came after veterans accused local officials of dragging their feet and not showing enough support for the project, which is expected to cost $17 million. Both the state and the United States House of Representatives have approved Enfield as the site of the museum. The Purple Heart is awarded to those who were wounded in battle. The drive to establish a museum here is based on the fact that Elijah Churchill, a Revolutionary War soldier from Enfield, was one of the first two recipients of the Badge of Military Merit, the forerunner of the Purple Heart. The medal was awarded to Churchill in 1782. The chairman of the organizing committee, Anthony J. Porto, a World War II Navy veteran, said the town had until the end of the month to use $250,000 in state money to design the museum or risk losing the funds. The town will spend $7,000 to have the tract surveyed.(AP)

384-> Headless Body Identified as Officer's Ex-Wife
A headless body found in the Hudson River in April has been identified as that of a Bronx woman whose former husband, a police officer, retired after refusing to answer questions about her disappearance, the authorities said yesterday. The woman, Rita Fioretti, was last seen on Aug. 10, 1986. Her husband, Robert C. Fioretti, was indicted in January 1987 on a charge of stealing $17,600 from his wife's bank account. The authorities said they were investigating the possibility that Mr. Fioretti was involved in his wife's disappearance. The body of the 35-year-old Mrs. Fioretti, which had been submerged by weights for at least a year and was headless, was found on the banks of the Hudson by schoolchildren, said Bronx District Attorney Paul T. Gentile. Forensic detectives matched X-rays of the body to those in a medical file on Mrs. Fioretti to confirm its identity, he said. Another Marriage According to the police, Mr. Fioretti secretly obtained a divorce from his wife several years before she disappeared, but he never told her about it and they continued to live together until her disappearance. The validity of that divorce has never been officially determined, but the month after Mrs. Fioretti was reported missing, Mr. Fioretti married his former patrol partner, Maureen Brooks, who is currently a police officer assigned to Queens, and who was pregnant with their child. They now live together on City Island in the Bronx with that child, as well as two children from each of their previous marriages, Mr. Gentile said. #15 Charges Dismissed Neither Mr. Fioretti nor his lawyer, David Richman, could be reached for comment last night. There were people at at Mr. Fioretti's house, at 440 King Avenue, last night, but they turned off the lights and declined to answer when a visitor knocked at the door. Fifteen of the 16 charges against Mr. Fioretti relating to the forgery and tax evasion were dismissed by a Bronx judge earlier this summer on technical grounds - the bank withdrawal reportedly did not occur in the Bronx - but the matter has been turned over to prosecutors in Westchester and Nassau Counties. The withdrawal was made in Westchester, and the money was transferred to an account at a Long Island bank. Mrs. Fioretti's body lies in potter's field on Hart Island in Long Island Sound, a few hundred yards from City Island. Mr. Gentile and Bronx Chief of Detectives Daniel Ryan now plan to have it exhumed for further study. Mrs. Fioretti was definitely murdered, Mr. Gentile said, who added that ''everything about this is consistent'' with the theory that she was murdered by her estranged husband, but he declined to elaborate. Mr. Fioretti is under surveillance, Mr. Gentile said, but because he has not been arrested there is nothing to prevent his leaving the area.

386-> GOLF; Watson Closing In on Record Earnings
Suddenly Tom Watson is there again. The 38-year-old Kansan, who was once master of all he surveyed in golf, charged into position to make some significant golf history in the final round of the NEC World Series of Golf. Just one shot off the lead today after three rounds of the $900,000 event, Watson could become the leading money-winner in the history of the sport, replacing Jack Nicklaus, who has been in that spot for more than 15 years. But Watson has managed only one victory in the last four years and two months. Improving at a rapid rate of five shots per round on the strong and lengthy Firestone Country Club South course, Watson today tied a World Series record of eight birdies in a round as he scored six-under-par 64 to stand at three-under 207. Watson, who won the 1980 World Series at the height of his domination of the game, opened this limited-field, 42-man tournament with a 74 on Thursday and followed it with a 69 on Friday before shooting a 64 today. 'Sparks of Greatness' ''Today there were sparks of greatness back in my golf swing and putting,'' Watson said. ''I have to build on that. Even though I shot 74 the first round and 69 yesterday, I felt very confident about the way I hit the ball then. You get a feeling of confidence. Again, the putter is back on line.'' But it won't come easily for Watson on Sunday the way it used to from 1977 through 1984, when he gained 29 of his 32 PGA Tour victories, including one United States Open, five British Opens and two Masters. Larry Nelson, a two-time PGA Champion, shot a superb back nine of five-under 30 today for 66 and a share of the lead with Friday's co-leaders, Mike Reid and Ian Baker-Finch. Reid and Baker-Finch slipped with one-over 71's to fall into that three-way tie at 206. And Watson was tied with Sandy Lyle, the Scot who won the 1988 Masters, and Mark McCumber, winner of the 1988 Players Championship. The top prize in this tournament is $162,000. If he wins, Watson will boost his career earnings on the PGA Tour to $5,035,913. Nicklaus, who is not playing in this tournament, has won $5,002,825 and has led in career earnings since 1973, when he broke the $2 million mark. This tournament is limited to the winners of all PGA Tour events over the last 52 weeks and winners of selected foreign golf tournaments. Isao Aoki of Japan equaled the World Series record of eight birdies in a round on this course as he also shot a 64. Denis Watson is the only other man who got eight birds in a round on this 7,136-yard course. He did that in the second round of the 1984 World Series, which he went on to win. Like Aoki, Tom Watson caught two bogeys. Without them, he would have taken over the lead. In an unusually accurate round, Watson missed only one fairway, the 16th, with a 1-iron tee shot that went a few inches into left rough. He missed only one green in regulation and took one of his bogeys there at the par-3 12th. And his putting today was a carbon copy of his superb putting of years ago. On 17 holes, everything he rolled at the cup had a chance, and when he missed he went by the hole, the way a pro wants to miss a putt. On the ninth, however, he three-putted the ninth for the other bogey. Watson opened with a big charge by getting birdies on four of the first five holes. This spurt ended with a 25-footer at the fifth for birdie 2. Then, with the accurate drives to fairways, Watson birdied the 10th and 11th and then got in another 25-footer for birdie at 13. His last birdie came from a wedge shot over the water to 15 feet from the cup at 16, which he rolled in. ''Yesterday I played a better round of golf than Thursday,'' Watson said. ''Today I played a great round of golf, and tomorrow I need another great round of golf to have a chance.'' Watson said that a few minutes before his position moved to within a stroke of the lead. He said it before Reid double-bogeyed the 16th and bogeyed the 17th and Baker-Finch bogeyed the 18th by three-putting.

387-> Group Assails School Lunches
School lunches are too often made up of fried foods and other dishes with a high fat content, a consumer nutrition group said, urging the Federal Government to change its farm commodities program to encourage cafeterias to serve healthier meals. Ellen Haas, executive director of Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, said that a survey of school menus showed that school meals too often consisted of fried foods and other dishes high in saturated fat. Public Voice said surplus commodities, ''often high in fat, sugar or sodium,'' were bought by the United States Department of Agriculture for its $3.7 billion school lunch program, which serves about 27 million children. Surplus food accounts for 20 percent of that used in the program. Suzanne S. Harris, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for Food and Consumer Services, said in a statement that it would be ''irresponsible'' to let the commodities go unused. And, she said, scientists did not yet support setting absolute levels for sugar, fat or sodium for children. Pat Bayer, executive director of the Denver-based American School Food Service Association, which represents 65,000 school nutritionists and school lunch directors, said the report offered a ''shallow view of research.''

389-> Fighting the Greenhouse Effect
THE worst of this summer's searing heat may be over, but the concerns that it raised about a global warming trend - known as the greenhouse effect - seem certain to linger. Whether the earth is really warming is still a matter of debate. One thing is clear, however: finding a way to slow or stop the accumulation of gases thought to be responsible for the greenhouse effect would involve a drastic change in the amount of fuel we burn and in our sources of energy. The shifts could ultimately affect the cost and availability of all types of energy and be felt in every corner of society, changing manufacturing processes, construction techniques, even driving habits. ''The implications go very deeply into modern industrial society,'' said William R. Moomaw, director of the climate, energy and pollution program of the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based study group that has played a prominent role in the greenhouse debate. ''In many ways we're talking about changing the quality of life of everyone in the world,'' said Carl Crawford, a spokesman for the American Electric Power Company of Columbus, Ohio, the nation's biggest user of coal. The burning of coal, oil and other combustion energy sources produces carbon dioxide, a natural constituent of the atmosphere. Elevated levels of carbon dioxide are thought to be responsible for half the greenhouse effect. There is good reason to do something now to curb that production, many experts argue; enough carbon dioxide has been sent into the atmosphere already, they say, to cause a significant temperature increase - and energy use continues to grow. Indeed, scientists are already scrambling to think of ways to limit the potential effects. And Congress is weighing what it can do. Curiously, business, which produces most of the energy used and whose products are so energy-dependent, seems largely to have stayed out of the debate. Perhaps for good reason. Barring some futuristic technological solution that scientists can now only fantasize about, the choices facing business - as well as policy makers - are tough ones. Indeed, the magnitude of the changes could easily dwarf the conservation efforts of the early 1970's sparked by the oil embargo. This time around, cutbacks in energy use and the search for alternative energy sources would be just the beginning. The main event would likely involve a fundamental restructuring of every industry that is dependent on energy, as well as the energy industry itself. In particular, the warming trend poses critical problems for coal producers and users, unless cost-effective pollution control techniques can be developed. At the same time, it could provide new life for nuclear power, which produces virtually no greenhouse gases. The gases thought to be responsible for the greenhouse effect - besides carbon dioxide, they include methane, nitrous oxide and chlorofluorocarbons - are a byproduct of many industrial processes. But mostly they are produced when fossil fuels are burned in boilers, furnaces and car engines. The gases cause the earth's surface to warm by trapping the infrared radiation that otherwise would be reflected back into space, just as a greenhouse keeps in heat that would otherwise escape. A change of just a few degrees in atmospheric temperature over the next century could be catastrophic. A parade of scientists appearing before a Senate committee in June painted a graphic picture of what that could mean: melting icecaps and rising sea levels that would inundate seaboard cities and drown thousands in fierce storms; rainfall shifts that would make the deserts bloom and turn breadbaskets into dustbowls; and, of course, heat everywhere. Proposals are coming from various camps to meet the potential threat. Senator Timothy E. Wirth, a Colorado Democrat, has introduced a bill to spend $4.3 billion to study ways to combat the greenhouse effect. The bill, which would provide more money for conservation research and for a new generation of nuclear plants, is sure to have a host of competitors. But the challenge confronting all the planners is the scope of the greenhouse issue. ''If this is a problem,'' American Electric's Mr. Crawford said, ''it is so global and so diffuse in our economy, it's going to be very hard to come up with a strategy.'' THE heart of the problem, said Jay Agarwal, vice president for technology assessment of Charles River Associates, a consulting firm based in Boston, is that energy consumption is fundamental to the economy. ''You can't make steel without energy, or make copper, or aluminum, or food, or clothing,'' he said. ''The transformation of things we eat, things we consume, all takes energy.'' And energy, to a large degree, currently means the combustion of hydrocarbons in coal, oil and gas - and the resulting production of carbon dioxide. Combustion provides nearly 90 percent of the energy needs of the United States. The balance comes from hydroelectric power, which has a limited potential for expansion, and nuclear fission, which has been consigned to slow extinction in this country because of its high cost and safety concerns. Before concerns about global warming, carbon dioxide was considered a harmless byproduct of combustion. But if it comes to be considered a pollutant, a new pecking order could emerge among energy sources. The two criteria that have determined the choice of fossil fuels for more than a century are price and availability. The new standard would be how much carbon dioxide a fuel produces. For the amount of heat that results in four pounds of carbon dioxide when coal is used, oil would produce only three pounds and natural gas, two. Switching to fuels that produce less carbon dioxide would require huge dislocation. The Shell Oil Company, for example, estimates that in 1987, total world energy production of hydrocarbon fuels was the equivalent of 135 million barrels of oil a day. Of that amount, 32 percent was coal, 45 percent was oil and only 23 percent was natural gas, the best of the lot. Shifts are possible, but they would create new strategic problems. The United States has enough coal to last more than 300 years, but there are just a few decades' worth of gas reserves at current rates of consumption. While there is more gas to be discovered, the total would still be a small fraction of the coal supply. At the moment, some utilities are interested in gas, especially for a new generation of power plants that produces more electricity and useful steam from a given quantity of fuel. Over all, however, energy users have considered natural gas unattractive because of questions about availability and whether the price will remain competitive in years to come. Demand is low and production has fallen by more than 25 percent since the early 1970's; recently natural gas has lost market share to cheaper oil. And coal is far cheaper than either. The biggest users of coal - and therefore, perhaps, the biggest greenhouse targets - are the electric utilities. American utilities alone contribute 7.5 percent of the world's carbon dioxide output, according to the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit consortium based in Palo Alto, Calif. If the utilities could curb their carbon dioxide production, the benefits would be twofold. Their own electricity would be ''cleaner,'' and more electricity could be used to heat homes and run factories, replacing fossil fuels burned in boilers and furnaces. With a few advances in battery technology and provisions for easy recharging, electricity could begin to replace gasoline to power cars. But producing ''clean'' electricity now is not practical. The utilities have already spent billions of dollars to install equipment to capture the sulfur dioxide created by their plants that is linked to acid rain. In theory, they could install equipment to capture carbon dioxide, as well. The cost would be staggering, however. A study earlier this year by the Brookhaven National Laboratory, commissioned by the Department of Energy, estimated that the capital cost of installing the technology would be 70 to 150 percent of the cost of the original plant. The average cost of electricity itself, the study estimated, would rise 75 percent. And there are equally daunting concerns about storing the millions of tons of carbon dioxide gas that would be captured each year. Another possibility for the utilities would be more nuclear plants. There are 109 nuclear plants licensed to operate in the United States, but the technology became uneconomic in the early 70's and the accident at Three Mile Island in 1979 raised safety concerns that have not receded. As a result, all plants ordered after 1974 were canceled or abandoned during construction. THE manufacturers, not surprisingly, think it is time to bring them back, especially in light of the greenhouse effect. At the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, for example, Richard J. Slember, vice president and general manager of the energy systems unit, ran down the list of technologies his division, the energy systems business unit, is doing business and research in: photovoltaics (or electricity directly from sunlight), windmills, coal, waste-to-energy plants, fuel cells (which combine oxygen and hydrogen to make water and electricity) and coal-bed methane production (in which a burnable gas is made in coal mines). ''It seems that the major solution that's available presently is to stop burning,'' he said. ''The only one you're really left with, in a very pragmatic sense, is nuclear.'' Westinghouse, which has sold some plants overseas during the long hiatus in American orders, is working on what it calls ''a new half-generation'' of reactors, with more backup safety systems and a ''user-friendly'' standardized design. Besides offering improved safety, the new design would be far more economical, the company said. To some, the Westinghouse program and similar ideas from other reactor builders make nuclear energy more attractive than it used to be. Senator Wirth said at a hearing earlier this summer that it might be time for the country to get over its case of ''nuclear measles,'' and his bill calls for spending $500 million on research for a reactor that would be ''passively safe,'' with non-mechanical features to prevent meltdown, and which would minimize the volume of nuclear waste. ''We have to re-think nuclear,'' he said. ''We really have to start all over again, but we've got time to do it.'' Some climate changes may already be inevitable, he said, and mankind will be fighting the greenhouse problem for decades. ''The environmentalists will come around,'' he added. ''They can't help but come around.'' But some experts are not convinced. ''Let's remember why nuclear power died before we suddenly say let's restart it,'' said John Ahearne, a former member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and now a vice president of Resources for the Future, a Washington study group. ''Costs were rising rapidly, a number of plants were seen to be operated very poorly and electricity demand wasn't there.'' ''How does the greenhouse effect change that?'' Mr. Ahearne asked. ''It's really only the electricity issue. The greenhouse question for the first time says, maybe all those coal plants should be significantly cut back or closed. But the first two problems don't automatically go away.'' Some environmentalists are reviewing their options. ''I think it's time to re-think our energy policy as a whole,'' said Jan Beyea, a scientist at the Audubon Society, which is based in New York. ''I don't think the current generation of nuclear plants is a viable option, even if one wanted to solve the greenhouse problem that way. With public fears, you're just not going to get enough built.'' But Mr. Beyea said, ''There certainly should be research into inherently safe nuclear power plants, provided that an equal amount is put into photovoltaics.'' He added that photovoltaic cells were likely to be a cheaper energy source. Others believe the construction of new reactors should be made contingent on solving the nuclear waste problem. ''The waste problem is of overwhelming importance,'' said Lynn A. Greenwalt, vice president for resources conservation of the Washington-based National Wildlife Federation. Even without safety concerns, the higher costs of nuclear power would appear to be prohibitive. But nuclear energy has the edge over a conservation approach to the problem in at least one respect, said David G. Hawkins, a senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington. ''You're dealing with human beings whose psychology tends to be dominated by what appears to be the easiest fix,'' he said. ''How do you get attention focused on more diverse issues like energy efficiency, when you're sitting at a table with nuclear people who say, 'Here, we're willing to sell you the answer, in a technological box'?'' A general increase in energy efficiency, from gas mileage in autos and trucks to foot-candles per watt in light bulbs, would be a faster and cheaper answer to the greenhouse effect than building more nuclear plants, environmentalists say. And the conservation route is certainly within reach. ''In West Germany today, per capita energy consumption is just about half what it is in the U.S.,'' Mr. Hawkins said. Scott G. Denman, director of the Safe Energy Communication Council, a coalition of environmental and anti-nuclear groups in Washington, made a similar point. ''Today we spend 10 percent of our G.N.P. on energy,'' he said. ''Japan, our primary competitor in many areas of the economy, spends only 5 percent on energy.'' The group favors increasing the Federal standards for car and truck mileage, which were scheduled to rise to 27.5 miles per gallon but which the Reagan Administration lowered to 26. ''If we want to mine for oil, Detroit is the biggest field we have,'' Mr. Denman said. ''We can be contributing to a healthier economy and a healthier environment,'' he added, suggesting that the standard be doubled over the next few decades. EFFICIENCY can also be achieved by getting more power from each ton of fuel used to produce energy. Mr. Moomaw of the World Resources Institute, for example, foresees a strong future for a new model of generators, of a type under development by the General Electric Company. The generators are expected to be about 25 percent more efficient than current models. In the long term, many existing technologies may benefit from the fear of the greenhouse effect. Mr. Moomaw points to the burning of trash to make electricity, an idea that cities are turning to as they exhaust their landfill space. Trash burning has environmental hazards of its own, producing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. But the landfill process produces methane gas, which also contributes to the greenhouse effect. As long as garbage results in greenhouse gases of one kind or another, Mr. Moomaw suggested, society should try to get the maximum energy benefit from it; the electricity generated by burning trash could replace some generated from coal or oil. Another obvious technology is photovoltaic solar power, whose cost is dropping but is still not competitive. Engineers at the Electric Power Research Institute have recently made enough progress in the fabrication of photovoltaic cells to suggest that the technology will soon be competitive with the more expensive fossil-fired electric plants. The importance of future technological innovation is difficult to measure. ''It's hard to imagine powering 20th century industry with sunshine,'' said Gerald Kraft, an analyst at Charles River Associates. ''But maybe we can. Nobody knows.'' And nobody knows, as the long hot summer of '88 draws to a close, just how serious the greenhouse effect will prove to be. But while it is too soon for a scientific consensus about the extent of the warming trend, most experts say enough evidence already exists to place everyone - business included - on the alert. A PAIR OF PAINFUL SIDE EFFECTS THE greenhouse effect has some odd twists. One is that it will probably raise electric demand, and thus help perpetuate itself. The Electric Power Research Institute calculated that an increase of slightly under 1 degree centigrade in atmospheric temperature by the year 2015 would make it necessary for utilities in the Southeast and New York to have 10 to 20 percent more generating capacity. That capacity is most likely to come from additional burning of fossil fuels, which will create more of the gases that cause the greenhouse effect. Another twist concerns chlorofluorocarbons, which contribute to the greenhouse effect and also help to destroy ozone in the stratosphere. Curbing chlorofluorocarbons to stem the depletion of the ozone layer would also help to ease the greenhouse effect. But according to one theory, easing the greenhouse effect would damage the ozone layer. That is because the rate of ozone destruction increases with the temperature of the stratosphere, according to Douglas G. Cogan, a researcher at the Investor Responsibility Research Center and the author of a recent study of the problem. If heat cannot escape the lower atmosphere because of the greenhouse effect, then it cannot heat the upper atmosphere, and the loss of ozone is slowed. But if the greenhouse effect is curbed and the upper atmosphere heats up, the global ozone loss may increase, and with it the risk of cancer.

390-> Soviets in U.N. Council Ask For U.S. Pullout From Gulf
The Soviet Union called here today for the withdrawal of American naval forces from the Persian Gulf and indirectly urged Iran to end its war with Iraq. The remarks by the deputy Soviet delegate, Valentin V. Lozinsky, reflected what several diplomats said was an unusually cautious tone taken by members of the Security Council as it met for the second day to debate Iran's call for condemnation of the United States in the shooting down of an Iranian airliner. All 290 people on board were reported killed in the incident on July 3. Most of the 13 delegates who spoke today echoed the position taken by Vice President Bush on Thursday when he contended that the real problem in the Persian Gulf was that Teheran had ignored a resolution by the Security Council last year demanding an end to the Iran-Iraq war. Mr. Bush, the likely Republican Presidential nominee, defended the United States in the debate. A Western European diplomat said the Iranians ''must be disappointed with so many people saying that if you had done what we had told you and implemented the resolution, this wouldn't have happened.'' Compromise Statement Sought The debate was adjourned early this afternoon until Monday to give the President of the Security Council, Paulo Nogueira Batista of Brazil, time to try to work out a compromise statement on the downing of the plane that would be acceptable to all members of the Council, including the United States. Iran had orginally hoped to get some members of the Council to introduce a resolution condemning the United States, but it was unable to find sponsors for such a strongly worded resolution. There was uncertainty among diplomats today over whether the President of the Council could reach a consensus text and over what it would say. ''This is a very tricky business,'' a senior diplomat said. ''No one is happy about the choices we have to make.'' To a certain extent, diplomats said, the Iranians had undermined their credibility by ignoring the Security Council for years and accusing it of being biased against Teheran. Washington had also helped its case with President Reagan's prompt expression of regret for the downing of Iran Air Flight 655 and with his decision to pay compensation to the families of the victims, they said. Worry Over 'Big Lessons' In addition, said a delegate friendly to the United States, ''there is an unease here about the big lessons to be learned from the incident.'' If the captain of the Vincennes, the American Navy warship that shot down the airliner, could make such a mistake, what about the potential for a much larger accident with nuclear weapons, the diplomat asked, adding, ''People are thinking about this, and it makes them cautious.'' In the debate today, the Soviet delegate largely restated the longstanding Soviet position that the United States Navy should leave the Persian Gulf and be replaced by a United Nations force including Soviet ships. ''The tragedy has demonstrated once again that the U.S. Navy fleet must leave the Persian Gulf waters without delay,'' Mr. Lozinsky said. ''The Soviet Union supports the efforts made by the United Nations Secretary General for the implementation of Resolution 598,'' he said, referring to the resolution calling for an end to the Iran-Iraq war.

392-> Hopes Rise for Space Shuttle's Repair on Pad
Officials expressed growing confidence yesterday that they would be able to repair the fuel leak on the space shuttle Discovery without rolling the vehicle back to its assembly building. Even so, they said the launching was expected to be postponed at least two or three weeks. ''It looks like they are going to fix it on the launch pad,'' said Steve Nesbitt, a spokesman at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. ''That's good news, if they can do it.'' Moving the Discovery back to the hangar for repairs would likely delay the mission, the first by a space shuttle since the Challenger disaster in January 1986, by as much as two months. The launching is still officially scheduled for Sept. 4. But the National Aeronautics and Space Administration announced yesterday that the formal pre-mission news briefings, which had been set for Aug. 1 and 2, had been rescheduled to Aug. 22 and 23 in Houston. Such briefings are usually held about a month before the planned liftoff. Delay in Engine Test Firing Other pre-launching preparations were also falling behind. The critical test firing of the shuttle's main engines has been delayed two more days, from next Thursday until at least Saturday. In a dress rehearsal of countdown procedures and a test of engineering modifications, the three liquid-fuel engines are to be fired 20 seconds with the shuttle anchored to the launching pad. Dick Young, a spokesman at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla., said work getting the engines ready was being hampered by lightning alerts and the troubleshooting involved in trying to identify and determine the seriousness of the fuel leak. No attempt to repair the leak, either on the launching pad or back in the hangar, will be made until after the engine test is completed and evaluated. It will take about five days after the firing to prepare for the repair work or the rollback, officials said. The leak was detected last week in a half-inch connector in a line involved in supplying nitrogen tetroxide gas for steering thrusters. The line is six feet from the nearest panel on the pod for the left orbital maneuvering system in the shuttle's tail section. Keith Hudkins, director of the shuttle orbiter program at NASA headquarters in Washington, said the choices for dealing with the problem that were under consideration varied from doing nothing and flying with the leak to repairing it. As a last resort, he said, the shuttle will be returned to the hangar, where the entire pod could be replaced.

393-> Drug Search Angers Workers
More than 200 workers at a city construction project last week were forced to kneel before drug-sniffing dogs or lose their jobs after a former employee reported that drugs were being used at the construction site. An angry union official likened the experience to slavery. City officials said Thursday that the Aug. 18 search at the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center turned up nothing. ''When they make you get down in front of an animal on your knees, that's getting back into slavery,'' said Bill Hawkins, business manager of Local 481 of the the ironworkers union.

394-> DINING OUT; Where Roadhouse Looks Can Deceive
RESTAURANT explorers on the prowl for the unexpected will be in their glory at Riverhead's Peconic House. It is an almost total surprise. The name surprises. It says seafood but is Italian. The menu surprises. It reads like standard cliche Italian-American, but the cooking here is anything but routine. Even the location in Riverhead is a surprise. This is not a community known as a gourmet crossroads. Nor does the Peconic House's setting around the corner from a Caldor shopping center (Riverhead Plaza) give a clue that this is anything but an ordinary roadhouse. If the Peconic House has a rustic fish house look outside, inside it is modest and mundane. A rough wood-paneled bar dominates. The plain dining room has a minimum of amenities: white tablecoths topped with paper place mats, a few abstract paintings and seashell collages. Strains of ''Volare'' and ''That's Amore'' drift in from the bar's jukebox. What makes Peconic House stand out is the execution of standard-sounding dishes. Additionally, some of the nightly specials, particularly the salads, are not the usual reruns. Beets and endive, raddichio and mushrooms and hearts of palm show imagination. We tried them all, plus the Caesar, tomato, spinach and the mixed green (all it should be and a steal at $2). Every salad is recommended. The dressings are lively; the ingredients farm-stand fresh. The tomato salad is a soup bowl of ripe chunks glossed with smooth vinaigrette and flecked with fresh basil. Ruby raddichio and large luscious mushrooms are a great double play combination. Another inspiring partnership matches spokes of endive surrounding a cog of sliced beets. Both spinach salad bathed in a warm dressing and the tasty Caesar topped with homemade croutons are expertly made. The efficient waitress in charge of those tableside creations also prepared a rousing linguine with white clam sauce. The pleasing pasta was loaded with clams and garnished with a few baby bivalves still in their shells. That same evening, we were told that no clam or mussel appetizers were available. Why not? There were clams for the pasta but none for the baked clams. It would be a shame to miss the perfectly prepared baked baby clams, lightly sprinkled with crumbs and perched in a pool of terrific garlic-infused juices just made for dunking. A dish of mussels in a dunkably good white wine sauce is another seafood paragon. The mussels themselves are huge and gritless. If you hit a night when clams and mussels are not being offered, try the roasted peppers glossed with virgin olive oil and sparked with cracked black pepper. Shrimp cocktail, too, is an exceptional rendition of the classic. The waitress touts the shrimp as superior South American imports. Follow her recommendation. Shrimp francese features four colossal (each the size of a lobster tail), firm tempters. Shrimp scampi and shrimp marinara have 8 to 10 smaller but equally sweet crustaceans. Sirloin steak is prime and cooked to perfection. Veal and chicken dishes are outsized (three large cutlets), tender and appropriately sauced. The one entree disappointment was the broiled fillet of sole, sizzling on a too-hot platter that cooked it to a degree past perfection. Accompanying green vegetables are outstanding. Even green bean haters started to munch these fresh, crisp goodies. Another night, a mix of baby peas and crunchy zucchini brought smiles. Potatoes, though, are unusual and unappealing. They appear to be boiled and left languishing in a pool of liquid. The tops are browned as though they were given a last-minute shot under the broiler. Desserts are predictable. Peach melba and coupe marrons are the usual ice cream concoctions. Both Italian and Jewish cheesecakes are good representatives of these rivals. Chocolate mousse pie suffers from a topping of aerosol whipped cream. An attractively presented plate of ripe honeydew and canteloupe is a refreshing ending, and probably the best dessert. Peconic House is unassuming; its menu uninspired; but the old Italian standbys shine brightly in these ordinary surroundings. Peconic House Very Good Address: Route 58 and Oliver Street, Riverhead, 727-9188. Atmosphere: Rustic road house Italian. Service: Involved and informed.

395-> For Accuracy, Artist Stages Civil War
THE young soldier falls to the ground, his facial features frozen in an agonized grimace. His comrade, poised by his side, falters and also falls. They are the dead; two young men fallen in the service of their country during the Civil War. But appearances can be deceiving. The hillside upon which these soldiers lie is, in reality, a perfectly manicured lawn in suburban Southbury. In the background the rumble is not from gunfire, but from the thunder of a fast-appoaching, late-summer storm. And the two young men, David Blyn and Jeff DeCausemacker, are not Civil War soldiers. They hail from Roxbury and Southbury, respectively. Mr. Blyn works in construction, and Mr. DeCausemacker plans to enter the ministry. They are spending part of their summer posing for Don Troiani, who is crouched in front of them, camera in hand, photographing and directing the action. As they move about, his camera clicks, taking numerous rolls of film that he will then develop and use in the creation of one of his historical paintings. ''O.K., let's do it again, and let's see real despair in your faces,'' Mr. Troiani orders. ''You guys are trapped behind this ridge. Dave, you roll on your back, and bring the butt of your musket up. Now, mess up your hair real good, really scruff it up, and, when I yell 'Go!' charge.'' Using live models dressed in reproductions of Civil War uniforms is one way that Mr. Troiani, a Southbury artist, imbues his paintings with the realism for which he has become known. Other methods include traveling miles to visit Civil War battlefields and delving into his private library of 1,500 volumes, including a 150-volume official record of the war. Mr. Troiani does not mind the added work. Ever since he was a child, he has been fascinated with military painting and now, at 39 years old, he has managed to center his life around it. In his spacious three-story home in Southbury, is his studio where he paints his original works. Also there is Historical Art Prints Ltd., the business he created to market the prints he makes from the paintings. He is a one-man company, and he could not be happier, he said. Devoting himself to chronicling the Civil War is a dream-come-true for Mr. Troiani, who has always been equally entranced by military history and the world of art. ''I always had toy soldiers,'' he said. ''My father gave me a Civil War cavalry sabre when I was young. I really liked that.'' The son of antique dealers, Mr. Troiani learned early about collecting and, while still in high school, earned money buying and selling military collectibles. ''I never held a regular job because I could make more money collecting,'' he said. ''I've probably been at this for 25 of my 39 years.'' He was always interested in drawing, and the only subjects he considered were military ones. ''I've never sketched anything else, except when I was forced to in art school,'' he said. He studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia, and the Art Students League in New York, but, of his art work, he said, ''I learned 10 percent in art school and taught myself the rest.'' He remained true to his goal to become an accomplished painter of historical art, a virtually unknown art form in the United States, he said. Fascinated by the Civil War ''When I was younger, I'd buy books about the Civil War, and I was always disappointed in the illustration,'' he said. ''There would only be a few woodcuts. I figured, somebody's got to do something about this.'' Mr. Troiani never served in the military, and this might have something to do with his fascination for it, he said. He got his professional start with some assignments from American Heritage magazine. ''Usually, when they hire an artist, they hire a regular illustrator and have to coach him through the historical aspects,'' he said. ''With me, they soon discovered they didn't have to do that.'' Over the years, it has been the Civil War that has most interested him. ''It was the last real war that had a lot of pagentry, with troops who charged each other at close range,'' he said. ''It was a horrible war, there's no question about it, but it was the last really colorful war. There's a lot of romanticism attached to it.'' Mr. Troiani's research provides him with unlimited topics for paintings. His subjects range from dramatic battle scenes, like ''The Fight for the Colors,'' which shows two soldiers fighting over the Confederate flag in hand-to-hand combat, to the immortalizing of lesser known brigades, like the Irish Brigade of Massachusetts, which charged into battle carrying aloft their special emerald-green banner. Although most of his works deal with the Civil War, he sometimes tackles other topics, like the series of six works he did depicting the 350-year history of The National Guard, for which he received the Meritorious Service Award of the National Guard Bureau. A painting from that series appeared as a United States postal card last year. Mr. Troiani's illustrations have appeared in American Heritage magazaine, Time-Life Books, Smithsonian magazine and other publications. His original work can be seen at in the West Point Museum, the Smithsonian, the National Park Service and in numerous historical collections. Because of his following, Mr. Troiani no longer accepts commissions, preferring to paint whatever subject he chooses, then announcing the availability of the prints. His original paintings sell in the $15,000 range, and are sold before he begins them. From each painting, he makes 1,000 prints, which are usually sold within a few days of their announcement, he said. Coupled with Mr. Troiani's passion for military painting is his obsession with historical accuracy. Because of this, he established the Society of American Historical Artists, which has about 15 members throughout the country who strive for historical accuracy in their work. This penchant for accuracy is evident in the way Mr. Troiani works. Before beginning a painting, he has already spent a few years gathering information about the battle he plans to recreate. In doing so, he amasses enough information to write a book. ''Each painting,'' he said, ''is a visual book in that it is a split-second of history. ''There are a vast number of things I have to find out. What was the weather like the day of the battle? Were the troops charging through rye, wheat or clover? Was the ground fresh or trampled on and, if it was trampled, who trampled it? When had the troops gotten their last issuance of clothing? Were some regiments wearing ragged uniforms and others not?'' Often, Mr. Troiani can find the exact item he is looking for in his own collection. He is a passionate collector of original artifacts, like an entire uniform collection from a Civil War soldier who served in Windham. His collection includes uniforms, sabres, drums, flags and anything else he can amass. Not surprisingly, Mr. Troiani has little use for the way Hollywood has portrayed the Civil War. ''The TV mini-series are historically vile,'' he said. ''They trample on historical facts. The real Civil War was much more interesting than anything they've come up with.''

397-> Greenspan Asks Change In Banks Bill
The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board has criticized major portions of the banking legislation in the House of Representatives, recommending that some parts be struck and warning that others could impose ''massive'' costs on the banking system. In a letter to Fernand J. St Germain, chairman of the House Banking Committee, Alan Greenspan urged the committee to eliminate the restrictions on banks expanding into insurance and real estate sales, as well as provisions that would stop banks from underwriting mutual funds. Nearly the entire banking industry has opposed Mr. St Germain's bill because of the limitations on new businesses that banks would be allowed to enter and because of several consumer provisions. The effort in Congress to revamp Federal banking laws is intended to give banks new powers, like the right to underwrite commercial paper, mortgage-backed securities, municipal revenue bonds and corporate bonds. Consumer Provisions Opposed He also urged the committee not to seek to require the nation's 14,000 banks to offer a series of low-cost banking services to the poor and elderly, like low-cost checking accounts and the cashing of Federal, state and local government checks. Such consumer provisions, Mr. Greenspan wrote in the letter dated July 21, ''will constitute a massive new burden on the banking system, particularly on smaller banks without the resources to handle these regulatory requirements.'' Mr. Greenspan also opposed provisions in the bill that would prohibit a bank and its securities affiliate from sharing the company logotype, advertising and name. ''They are clearly unnecessary for effective insulation of affiliated banks,'' he wrote. Greenspan's View Expected Many banking experts and lobbyists expected that Mr. Greenspan would come out against the St Germain bill. But they did not predict that the Greenspan opposition would stop the legislation from proceeding. Mr. Greenspan indicated that he wanted changes to make the St Germain bill acceptable to the banking industry and sufficiently akin to a Senate-passed bill so that the entire Congress could ''begin the process and establish the framework for future change.'' ''I cannot emphasize too strongly that the banking system is urgently in need of modernizing changes,'' Mr. Greenspan wrote. ''The future vitality of the banking system depends upon a demonstration that Congress is capable of taking the crucial first steps.'' The Industry's Opinion The banks have particularly objected to provisions that continue the prohibition on their underwriting corporate equities and selling real estate. They also oppose the measure's limits on their sales of insurance products. But the banks have considered the consumer provisions most onerous, arguing that the requirement that they cash any and all government checks brought in by the public, for example, could lead to widespread fraud. ''The St Germain bill is essentially an anti-bank bill,'' said Kenneth A. Guenther, executive vice presidnet of the Independent Bankers Assocation. While the banks would prefer at this point that no bill be voted on by the House, they acknowledge that Mr. St Germain appears determined to proceed and that he may have sufficient support to get his bill through the Banking Committee, which will vote on the bill on Wednesday. ''We have all been forced into our fallback positions,'' Mr. Guenther said. ''Since we don't have the power and clout to kill the bill, we are forced into an amendment strategy. But we know that whatever happens, it is not going to come out as we want it.''

398-> Profits Up at 2 Banking Companies
Two major United States banking companies, the BankAmerica Corporation and the Bank of Boston Corporation, yesterday reported improved earnings in the third quarter. BankAmerica earned $190 million, more than a twofold increase over the $54 million it earned in its weak third quarter of 1987, and a 17.2 percent increase over the $162 million it made in the second quarter of this year. The earnings per share of the bank, based in San Francisco, rose to 97 cents, compared with 25 cents. Analysts said the results were especially encouraging because, unlike some previous quarters, BankAmerica's report was not full of unusual, nonrecurring gains. The profit also occurred despite the bank placing $394 million in Argentine loans on a nonaccrual basis. The action restricted BankAmerica to counting as income only the cash received from interest payments on the loans, not the total amount of interest due on them. ''The quality of the earnings looks much better,'' said Carole Berger, a bank analyst at C. J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. She attributed the improvement largely to the bank's aggressive efforts to cut expenses. BankAmerica's non-interest expenses, for example, declined by $44 million from its previous quarter, to $890 million. The bank continued to show an improvement in loan quality, an area that has caused considerable trouble in the past. Its nonaccrual assets were $4.61 billion, but excluding those to Argentina, the total was $312 million lower than in its second quarter. Bank of Boston The Bank of Boston's earnings were also up, but not as dramatically. The bank reported a net income of $79.2 million, a 7 percent increase over the $74 million earned in the corresponding period last year. Its per-share earnings increased to $1.14, compared with $1.09. Ira Stepanian, the company's chief executive, said the improved earnings resulted from stronger net interest revenue and gains from venture capital. Profits from its venture capital and subordinated-debt investments totaled $36 million, up from $7 millon in the 1987 quarter. The Bank of Boston's net interest revenue of $299 million was reduced in part by the bank's decision to continue reducing loan exposure to developing countries by writing off loans or by placing them on a nonaccrual basis. By the end of the third quarter, the bank's reserves against possible credit losses were equal to 84 percent of its third-world loan portfolio. ''The key thing is, it's getting its reserve closer to 100 percent,'' said Ronald I. Mandle, a senior research analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. ''That should give it more flexibility in the future.'' Although some of the analysts praised the Bank of Boston's conservative treatment of loans to developing countries, others were troubled by the $43 million increase reported in troubled domestic real estate loans. The bank experienced net credit losses of $23 million on real estate loans, up from $5 million for the period last year.

399-> WASHINGTON TALK: THE PRESIDENCY; Waning Days Cast New Glow Over White House
Nancy Reagan, sitting in the Capitol Monday night watching her husband deliver his State of the Union Address, was touched by the moment. This performance, so familiar after six re-runs, was making its final appearance on national television. ''It was the last time,'' said Elaine Crispen, Mrs. Reagan's press secretary. ''She probably made a note in her journal about it.'' Life this week in the White House was marked by a sense of poignancy. The State of the Union Address officially signaled the beginning of Mr. Reagan's final year as President, and many denizens of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue shared the emotions of the occasion. A Need to Be There In the past, said Marlin Fitzwater, the President's spokesman, White House staff members would often skip the State of the Union if their seat was bad or the weather was threatening. ''This year,'' he said, ''everybody wanted to be there.'' The mood of sentimentality seems laced with a certain sense of relief. Mr. and Mrs. Reagan have occupied the White House longer than any family since the Eisenhowers, who left 27 years ago, and the Reagans have been saying privately that they can now see ''the light at the end of the tunnel,'' as one close friend put it. Mr. Reagan has never been known as a workaholic, or as a fan of Washington. He ran as a critic of the capital, and he came here with the aim of reducing the role of government, not expanding it. After seven years in office, he still sounds at times like an outsider, blaming others for the evils of the Federal city. In this respect, the First Family seems quite happy at the prospect of leaving Washington behind. ''I think they'll be ready,'' said the close friend. ''There'll be regrets at leaving some things, but I think they're ready to go back to California and start a new kind of life.'' An Upbeat Mood Mr. Reagan and his advisers are trying hard to project an image of an active and buoyant leader who still has a lot to accomplish before retiring. As one senior official told a news briefing, ''This President is going to serve until the last day of his term.'' People who have talked to Mr. Reagan recently insist that this image reflects his upbeat mood. A year ago, his Administration was floundering amid disclosures of the Iran-contra affair. His chief of staff, Donald T. Regan, was about to be pushed overboard. Mr. Reagan's energy and enthusiasm were still being drained by the aftereffects of a serious cancer operation. Today, Mr. Reagan has recovered his physical health, and his political standing has received a significant boost from his summit meeting last month with Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll puts his public approval rating at 50 percent, well below his peak of popularity, but well above his own nadir, and the usual standing for Presidents in their final year. Moreover, Mr. Reagan faces an intensive travel schedule in the months ahead, including visits to Mazatlan in Mexico, Brussels, Toronto and Moscow, and there are rumors of other trips, perhaps to Africa or South America, later in the year. The Russian journey, in particular, tentatively scheduled for late May, has energized the White House, and both Mr. and Mrs. Reagan have already started reading intensively to prepare themselves, according to their aides. ''It's too early for nostalgia,'' said Anthony Dolan, chief White House speech writer. A Show Business Device The President also took an active interest in preparing his State of the Union Message, and forcefully argued for a show business device that won warm applause - loudly dropping 43 pounds of legislation to dramatize his unhappiness with the Congressional budget process. ''That was something he really got into and thought was a good idea,'' said one senior adviser. ''People might think he's a lame duck, but he doesn't act like one.'' Nevertheless, the tone of the White House is different now in significant ways. Everybody can count, and for some, the effect is liberating. ''The pressure is off,'' said Mr. Fitzwater. ''You can kind of enjoy the Presidency without having to worry about campaign pressures. I was in the White House during 1984 and 1986, and those were terrible years to be a White House staff person. Everything you did was supercharged politically. The pressure from the press was enormous, in terms of their scrutiny of every misstep. But in your final year, there's sort of a freedom from those political pressures that allows you to enjoy what you're doing.'' Some staffers, he said, feel ''a little forlornness'' as they work on projects that they can never complete. Others feel a growing sense of urgency. ''You know it's your last shot, that you might as well pull out all the stops,'' Mr. Fitzwater said. That can lead to some fierce in-fighting among aides who want to leave their stamp on the Administration's last policy statements. In recent weeks, for instance, a pragmatic faction within the White House has been arguing that in light of political opposition, the President should severely reduce his aid request for the Nicaraguan rebels. A purist group of hard-line conservatives has been arguing for a larger package. The final request, $36 million, with 10 percent devoted to military aid, probably represents a standoff. But the purists have largely lost another internal battle - over the President's attitude toward Moscow. Despite cries of dismay from his right-wing supporters, Mr. Reagan has told his aides that he can deal with Mr. Gorbachev, and that ways must be found to end the threat of nuclear war and to increase trade between the two superpowers. As these final struggles play themselves out, the Reagans are starting to plan the lives they will begin to lead on Jan. 20, 1989. They are close to buying a house in Bel-Air, a wealthy enclave near Los Angeles. The house was originally purchased for them by a group of California friends. Mrs. Reagan is probably going to write a book, based on her extensive journals, according to Ms. Crispen. The President is also likely to spend time writing, while campaigning actively for Republican candidates and his own political ideas. 'The Glass House' More than anything else, the Reagans are looking forward to more privacy in their personal lives. ''I'm going to rename this The Glass House, not the White House,'' said Ms. Crispen. Presidential aides said the State of the Union Message was the last one that Mr. Reagan would personally deliver to Congress, although they would not rule out the possibility that he might submit a written one. Many staff members are starting to contemplate the future, and perhaps beat the rush to the job market. One senior staff member, who makes no secret of his eagerness to leave, said that if his colleagues are not starting to think ahead, ''they ought to.'' ''A lot of people assume things will naturally open up, that doors will slide back,'' the official said. ''But it doesn't work that way.'' Time to Relinquish Chair Ms. Crispen pointed out that she has driven the same route, parked in the same spot and walked through the same gate every day for seven years - not counting days on the road. ''It's all been very special,'' said Ms. Crispen, who first worked for Mrs. Reagan in California. ''But it's time to turn my chair over to somebody else. That is, if I ever clean up my office. That could be a problem.'' Mr. Dolan, the speech writer, also started work on the first day of the Reagan Presidency. As a die-hard conservative, he said, he still ''cannot quite get over the fact that we're here, and that Ronald Reagan is President.'' Asked what he would do when Mr. Reagan retired, Mr. Dolan answered quickly: ''Work for the next conservative hero.''

401-> S.E.C. Seeks Power to Fine
The Securities and Exchange Commission voted today to seek authority from Congress to levy civil fines against securities-law violators, a bid to strengthen its enforcement efforts. The S.E.C. commissioners voted 4 to 1 to make its request next week when a Congressional committee holds hearings on recommendations made in October 1987 by a private commission set up to improve the quality of financial reporting by public companies. Among the recommendations made by the National Commission on Fraudulent Financial Reporting was a measure to grant the S.E.C. authority to ask the courts to impose fines in cases of financial reporting violations of the nation's securities laws. The S.E.C. was granted the authority by Congress in 1984 to levy civil fines only for insider-trading offenses. With other violations, the S.E.C. itself can only seek a civil order prohibiting further lawbreaking, but can refer its cases to the Justice Department for possible criminal prosecution. The S.E.C. chairman, David Ruder, will formally ask the House Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee for fining authority on Monday when he presents S.E.C. opinions on several of the October 1987 recommendations. While in agreement that fine authority should be sought, most commissioners and other S.E.C. officials stressed caution and careful case-by-case judgment in levying fines if the power should be granted.

403-> Righetti Falters As Yanks Lose
Billy Martin waved his arms in disgust and walked away, and Dave Righetti kept his post-game remarks brief. In the silence of the Yankee clubhouse last night, it seemed as if they wanted to forget the game as quickly as they lost it. Righetti had let it slip away, losing a 1-0 lead in the ninth inning before the Kansas City Royals - down to their final out and facing a pitcher considered the best reliever in the game - won it in 11 innings, 3-1 at the Stadium. The failure by Righetti, who has been unable to protect three straight leads with two outs in the ninth, made Tommy John a forgotten man. The 44-year-old warrior, who had admittedly pitched poorly in two of his three starts this season, recovered brilliantly after a crash course Monday with his former pitching coach, Mark Connor. John worked seven and one-third innings, gave up two hits and retired 14 straight batters before Steve Balboni's single with one out in the eighth. When he left, it was to a standing ovation from 20,484. But John's victory crumbled quickly. Righetti, despite getting the Yankees out of trouble in the eighth, had two outs in the ninth before Danny Tartabull hit a 1-and-1 fastball for his second homer in two nights, tying the game. And then the Royals, who had lost seven in a row at Yankee Stadium, won it with two in the 11th off Charles Hudson. But it was surely Righetti's defeat. 'My Best Pitch' ''He hit my best pitch,'' he said of Tartabull. ''He took me deep, and that's it. I've got nothing else to say.'' The games Righetti has failed to save since April 20 say enough. In Minnesota that night, he gave up a two-out single to Gene Larkin, losing a 6-5 lead in a game the Yankees eventually won. Then last Friday night against Toronto, Lloyd Moseby's single pulled the Blue Jays into a 3-3 tie, and they won the game in 12 innings, 6-4. Righetti had begun the season impressively, earning saves in three of the Yankees' first four victories. But since April 9, he has saved just one game. Last night's loss left John with no decision on an evening that should have been his personal triumph. He had gone to Knoxville, Tenn., last Monday, a day off for the club, to see Connor, the University of Tennessee coach and before that the Yankees' pitching coach for most of the last two seasons. In two of his starts, John had allowed 14 hits and 9 runs in just four innings. ''Mark understands my motion,'' John said before the game, ''and we're good friends. I've been less than spectacular and felt I was inconsistent at best.'' John said he went south with the approval of the team's owner, George Steinbrenner, although neither Martin nor Art Fowler, the current Yankee pitching coach, had been informed of his plans. But John said he spoke with them before he walked to the mound to face Kansas City. ''Billy and Art talked to me before I went out,'' he said. ''They just told me to lighten up: 'Go out and pitch like you can, it's not the end of the world. Throw free and easy.' Coming from your bosses like that, it helps.'' If John was facing a turning point with the team - the Yankees attempted to trade for Zane Smith of Atlanta but failed, according to sources - he said he was not aware of it. ''Billy and Art didn't indicate it,'' he said. He got a lead that stood for eight and a half innings when the Yankees scored in the first off Mark Gubicza, the Royals' starter. Willie Randolph walked with one out, took third on a single to right by Don Mattingly, then scored when Jack Clark grounded out on the grass near third base. It seemed enough. John set down the first six batters of the game, gave up an infield hit to Bo Jackson leading off the third and ended the inning with a double play after Mike Pagliarulo made the first of two fielding errors. He did not permit another base runner until Balboni's single, and then Martin called for help from the bullpen. The Royals loaded the bases before Righetti struck out Stillwell on a 2-and-2 fastball, then retired Wilson. But in the 11th, Hudson walked Stillwell to open the inning before Wilson sacrificed him to second and Kevin Seitzer delivered a single through the middle to break the tie. Frank White's ground-rule double added another run. ''You can't walk the leadoff batter and expect to win the ball game,'' Hudson said. ''You learn from your mistakes.'' Bud Black, the winning pitcher, ended a career full of futility at Yankee Stadium. His record in the Bronx before last night: 0-8. . . . The game marked the first time this season the Yankees have failed to get at least one extra-base hit in a game.

404-> When It Comes to Population, More Isn't Better; No Room for Edisons
To the Editor: Your statement that ''more people also means more Edisons and more Einsteins'' (''The Great Majority,'' editorial, Feb. 20) undermines the seriousness of problems arising from a much faster population growth rate in the third world countries than is optimum for their development. Take, for example, the progress of literacy in India. It increased from 17 percent of total population in 1951 to 36 percent in 1981, but the number of illiterates in India increased from 301 million (out of 361 million population) in 1951 to 437 million (out of 684 million population) in 1981. The massive increase in the number of illiterate people itself has contributed to a social and economic environment extremely difficult for the necessary development of human resources, including those few potential Edisons and Einsteins.

405-> Export-Import Bank Allows Loan Guarantees to Be Sold
The United States Export-Import Bank will allow its loan guarantees to be sold on secondary markets and to be used to support bond issues by state-owned and private foreign companies, a senior bank official said. The Export-Import Bank is an entity of the United States Government that issues long-term loans to importers of American products. It also provides loan guarantees to banks to finance purchases of goods from the United States. The bank finances about 85 percent of the total value of United States exports. Rita Gonzalez, a director of the Export-Import Bank, said here that the bank's new policies would make its loans and guarantees more attractive to Latin American countries. 'They Can Sell It' She said the bank's guarantees are now totally transferable, so that a loan backed by the Export-Import Bank can be sold like any other in a commercial bank's portfolio. ''Although they may not want to sell a loan immediately, they know that if they have a liquidity problem, they can sell it,'' Ms. Gonzalez said. She said the guarantee ''is a document equivalent to a note or a Government bond of the United States, from the legal point of view.'' The Export-Import Bank will also allow foreign importers of United States goods to use guarantees to back bond issues. The Likely Buyers With the guarantee, Ms. Gonzalez said, it will be possible to issue bonds that would be placed with those investors who would normally buy United States Government bonds. No bond issues have yet been floated under the new program, Ms. Gonzalez said. She added that the bond issues would be underwritten by investment banking firms, which have indicated that they would require a volume of at least $50 million. The buyers for such bonds would be companies like insurance concerns, which had not historically taken part in export financing, Ms. Gonzalez said. In Venezuela, the Export-Import Bank has already issued loans and guarantees of about $370 million, Ms. Gonzalez said. She added that additional transactions totaling $200 million were now being considered.

406-> Maine Company Drops Suit
The Patten Corporation, a large development company based in Vermont, has agreed to drop its $1 million lawsuit against Hartford, Me., a small town in Maine's western mountains. The company sued Hartford, a town of 500 people, after the town adopted a six-month moratorium on subdivision construction in October. Patten representatives had told town leaders a month before the moratorium was imposed that they planned to develop an enclave for summer homes on 150 acres beside Canton Lake, a popular area for swimming. Patten officials contended that the moratorium should not apply to their project because it was proposed before the moratorium was adopted. Town officials countered that Patten had not make a formal application. Town Gets 5 Acres The agreement between Patten and Hartford calls for Patten to abide by the moratorium and to give the town five acres and 1,000 feet of shoreline on Canton Lake. The town agreed not to rezone Patten's property when it adopted standards for subdivision development. The agreement was announced Tuesday. Many Mainers saw Patten's action against the town, which has an annual budget of $278,000, as one in which a huge company was trying to browbeat a small, rural town. Offers of help came from towns throughout the state and from the State Attorney General, James Tierney, who assigned a staff lawyer to help defend the lawsuit. Hartford residents objected to Patten's plans because the development would cause a seasonal increase in population of 25 percent, increase traffic on already overburdened roads and cause algae buildup in Canton Lake. Wilbur F. Hammond Jr., a Patten vice president, said the filing of the lawsuit was ''unfortunate.'' ''It's the kind of thing that happens when people don't sit down to talk things over,'' he said. He said the main reason for filing the lawsuit was that the company feared Hartford officials would rezone the property during the moratorium.

407-> Stalking the Cookie Jars of Lot 844
CAROL ADLER LEVINE had her heart absolutely set on Lot 844, which consisted of four of Andy Warhol's cookie jars. They reminded her of everything homey and warm about America; of ''cooking for your family with fuzzy slippers and an apron on instead of buying a roll of David's cookies and cutting them up.'' She was determined to triumph. So she took the Hampton jitney from Long Island back to Manhattan Saturday for Sunday's auction, went to sleep early and cleared the shelves in the kitchen so that everything was ready for the cookie jars. Alas, there was a more determined buyer out there, someone willing to spend $9,350 for the four cookie jars. Mrs. Levine was bereft. ''Go buy a diamond,'' her husband said. ''I don't want a diamond,'' she replied. ''I want a cookie jar.'' Fortunately, Martin Dinowitz, a manager of Secondhand Rose in Greenwich Village, stepped in. He had been amassing cookie jars for 15 years, selling them to Mr. Warhol and others. Like other cookie-jar dealers in and around New York this week, Mr. Dinowitz suddenly realized that it might be in his interest to dust off the 100 cookie jars languishing in his basement. Now, Mr. Dinowitz's cookie jars are on display at Secondhand Rose, 573 Hudson Street (11th Street), where they are $350 to $650 apiece. But be warned: Mrs. Levine has already purchased four. Her delight in the pursuit seems to mirror Mr. Warhol's. ''I feel like I've just won the lottery'' she said.

408-> 117 Secret U.S. Atomic Tests Are Indicated in Seismic Data
The United States has concealed at least 117 nuclear explosions at its underground test site in the Nevada desert over the past quarter-century, a group of private scientists reported yesterday. The secret explosions were all very small, their force usually less than a kiloton, or 1,000 tons of TNT. The tests nonetheless made up 20 percent of all American nuclear explosions in that period, an amount experts called surprisingly large. The new figures, a result of the analysis of seismic data about earth tremors that has been publicly available for years, offer a look into the hidden dimensions of the nation's program to test nuclear weapons. First Firm Estimates Although the Government has long reserved the right to hide the existence of nuclear tests, until now there were no firm estimates of how many American explosions had been kept secret since East and West agreed 25 years ago to ban nuclear testing everywhere except beneath the Earth. A Federal spokesman said the Government would neither confirm nor deny the accuracy of the new report. Experts said the report of the large number of small, secret explosions is likely to have a major impact on the often heated debate in Congress and among scientists over whether and how such underground nuclear tests should be limited. Group Favors Ban on Tests The existence of the 117 secret tests was reported in a 61-page study by the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private group based in New York that favors a ban on nuclear testing. The organization is widely recognized as having extensive expertise in seismic studies, and it recently participated with Soviet scientists in monitoring American and Soviet nuclear test sites. ''The findings could potentially shift moderates in Congress to accept a test ban since it suggests that even the smallest tests could be detected,'' said Representative Edward J. Markey. The Massachusetts Democrat supports limits on testing and is a member of the House committee that oversees the nuclear testing program. The Administration has long contended that it would be impossible to verify for treaty purposes whether small tests were taking place. On several occasions, Congress has tried and failed to win enough votes to ban all United States nuclear tests greater than a kiloton. In addition, a one-kiloton cutoff has often been discussed as a possible element in proposals for international limits on nuclear tests. 'The Public Has a Right' The new figures might make that goal less attractive to members of Congress who want stringent limits on nuclear testing, because they show that many tests could take place despite the limits. But experts said the new report could also make a ban on tests greater than one kiloton more appealing to those who once feared such a limit would have all but ended the nation's program for testing nuclear weapons. ''The public has a right to know its size,'' said Riley R. Geary, an analyst at the Seismological Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology, who aided N.R.D.C. scientists. The new report, ''Known U.S. Nuclear Tests,'' was made public yesterday at the International Scientific Symposium on a Nuclear Test Ban, being held in Las Vegas, near the nation's nuclear test site. Among the surprises in the report is the disclosure that the first secret test took place just weeks after the signing of the Limited Test Ban Treaty of 1963 and that in some years as many as 11 or 12 secret explosions took place. ''It shows a more active test program than we expected,'' said Robert S. Norris, one of the report's authors. The other authors are William M. Arkin and Thomas B. Cochran. Soviet Testing Is Uncertain The Department of Energy, which runs the nation's nuclear weapon program, has disclosed a total of 469 underground tests from 1963 to the present, including 18 conducted jointly with Britain. By treaty, current tests are allowed to be as large as 150 kilotons. The atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima had an explosive force of about 15 kilotons. The Soviet Union over the years has had a mixed policy on disclosing its nuclear tests. For a time, it tested in nearly complete secrecy, although recently it has become more open. Based on distant seismic measurements outside the Soviet Union, the Russians are thought to have conducted fewer tests than the United States since 1963. However, the seismic devices might not have picked up the smallest tests. In the American program, the small, secret tests were discovered by probing several sources of seismic data, the scientists said. Nuclear tests in these recordings can be distinguished from earthquakes by their location, their timing and the way measuring devices graphically represent the earth motion they create. Most nuclear tests at the Nevada site occur on the hour or the minute. Forty-six of the secret explosions were discovered by analyzing data published by the United States Geological Survey and by the Hagfors Observatory, which is run by the Swedish National Defense Research Institute. Seventy-one more were found by Mr. Geary of the California Institute of Technology, who mainly studied Caltech data gathered from seismometers in Southern California, which is near the nuclear test site in southern Nevada. The closeness of these seismometers allowed them to pick up very small nuclear tests. Mr. Geary estimated some of them were as small as 10 or 20 tons. More Secrecy Under Reagan Nevertheless, the Caltech seismometers failed to pick up all the tests announced by the Government over the years. Mr. Geary, extrapolating from this apparent limitation of the sensor instruments, estimated that perhaps as many as 50 to 60 more secret explosions remain to be uncovered. A striking fact seemingly confirmed by the emerging picture of secret nuclear testing is that the Government at one time announced all explosions. Federal officials have been variously quoted as saying this period began in 1975, in the Ford Administration, and in the late 1970's in the Carter Administration. The seismic data clearly support the latter assertion. By 1983, the Reagan Administration had reverted to the earlier practice of keeping the existence of some tests secret. Two years ago, the N.R.D.C. issued a preliminary estimate on the number of secret tests conducted in the Reagan Administration, saying they could range from 12 to 19 explosions. That policy of secrecy has drawn fire from critics who say it misleads the American public about the scope of the weapon program but hides nothing from the Soviet Union, which can use spy satellites and seismic data to discover undisclosed tests. But Chris L. West, an Energy Department spokesman at the Nevada test site, said that even very detailed Soviet observations might still leave room for Russian doubts. ''For security reasons, we don't want to make it easy,'' he said.ment, as a matter of policy, would neither confirm or deny the accuracy of the N.R.D.C. report. Several Purposes for Tests The N.R.D.C. scientists said the Government's small nuclear tests were apparently meant to probe the basic physics of nuclear reactions, to test the effects nuclear radiation has on military hardware, and to perfect the design of very small nuclear arms for the battlefield. The tests would have no direct use in developing very powerful nuclear warheads for long-range missiles, they said. The disclosure of the small nuclear tests is likely to stir the Congressional debate on a test ban, experts said. The proposed ban is seen by its advocates as a way to slow the development of new arms. First, the sheer detection of the small tests can be viewed as a demonstration of the sensitivity of general-purpose monitoring equipment, and a suggestion that a ban on all but the smallest nuclear tests could be effectively policed by specialized networks of sensors. Second, the disclosure of such a large number of small tests is likely to make the one-kiloton goal less attractive to some Congressmen and more attractive to others. On three occasions in recent years, the House of Representatives has voted to prohibit all tests greater than one kiloton, although Congress later backed down on the issue under pressure from the Administration, which says testing is necessary to maintain the reliability of old weapons and develop new ones. Now, Congressmen advocating stringent limits might want to lower the threshold above which no testing could take place, Congressional experts said. But others who feared a one-kiloton threshold would cripple the weapons-testing complex might be heartened and now vote for such a measure. ''It would have teeth as far as strategic weapons are concerned,'' said a Congressional aide. ''But it would allow basic physics and weapons effects to be explored. The scientists would clearly have the skills to oversee safety and reliability.''

409-> MANILA; In the Philippines, The Politics of Turmoil Casts A Murky Shadow Over the Arts
The major artistic creation of the Philippines today is a passion play in which a simple widow challenges a dictator she believes killed her husband, and leads her nation to freedom. In its second act, the widow, as president, faces down a series of violent challenges, clinging perilously to power as the forces of darkness struggle to reassert themselves. The passion play, of course, is being enacted daily in the theater of real life, where the Philippine people have written a fugue of political variations as complex, exhilarating and full of surprises as anything to be found on the world stage today. For the great art form of the Philippines at the moment, the medium in which the creative impulse is in full flower, is not painting or theater or poetry, but politics. Events have followed each other quickly and unpredictably and have left little to the artistic imagination: revolution, political coup, family feud, assassination, massacre, suicide. The characters in this living passion play are so vivid and sharply defined that they could well be named Greed, Sincerity, Ambition, Duplicity, even Good and Evil. In a country with a history of politically engaged art and literature, the events of the last two years, rather than stimulating creative artists, have left them exhausted, divided, bewildered and uninspired. Many have slowed down or have mechanically repeated earlier themes. Some who have attempted to build on recent history have found themselves trapped in cliches. Some of the scenes created by the Philippine political imagination must be the envy of its blocked artists. The deposed dictator, from his Hawaiian exile, declares himself the legal president while his wife sings patriotic songs to their visitors. Hundreds of political prisoners are freed in a giddy fiesta of democracy, only to go into hiding two years later as vigilante squads hunt them down. A luxury hotel is occupied by homeless squatters and a new government is briefly declared in its lobby. A local warlord is put on trial, meanwhile running for political office against the lawyer who is prosecuting him. The President is accused of hiding under her bed during a coup, and three months later the coup leader is captured hiding under his own bed. The most prominent monument to what Filipinos loosely call their revolution shows a man falling down stairs. It is a statue of Benigno S. Aquino Jr., whose assassination as he disembarked at Manila's international airport in 1983 was the catalyst for his widow's eventual accession. At first, the message of history seemed straightforward, and celebration was easy. Enthusiastic works produced in the weeks after the ouster of Ferdinand E. Marcos in February 1986 portrayed the icons of the moment: a laughing Corazon Aquino garlanded and dressed in yellow, massed crowds of supporters, nuns confronting tanks. Theater productions satirized Mr. Marcos and his wife, Imelda, safely in exile across the Pacific. There was a boom in kitsch, and for a while Manila was swamped with yellow T-shirts, badges, banners, stickers and sun visors. A minor genre of celebratory songs produced some of the most pleasing immediate works of art, one of them entitled ''The Philippines' Lesson to the World'' by a group called the Apo Hiking Society. But it quickly became clear that the ''revolution'' was not so simple, as the nation's deep-rooted problems began reasserting themselves. Artists, along with the rest of their countrymen, found their reactions slowed by the uncertainties of events. ''The problem now is that most artists have not made up their minds what to think of this new dispensation,'' said Nicanor Tiongson, artistic director of the Cultural Center of the Philippines. ''One cannot quite commit at this point.'' ''There is a general reaction of frustration, disappointment, disillusionment,'' said Bobi Valenzuela, curator of the Hiraya Gallery, one of Manila's main showplaces for social-realist art. ''What is an artist expected to do? They don't know what to do with their lives. They don't know what to do with their art.'' The social-realist school of painters, who led the artistic protest against Mr. Marcos's government, has failed to find a response to events since his departure. And as visual artists despair of keeping up with real life, with the fast-moving events that have become a national obsession, public interest in painting has declined. ''There has always been a very small market for art in the Philippines,'' said Mr. Valenzuela at his gallery one morning last month. ''We are not that mature as a people.'' Now even that small market has almost died. Newspapers, crammed with political gossip, have virtually cut out their coverage of art. Mr. Valenzuela's gallery, which supports itself with a framing business, has fallen on even harder times. ''Never before have we had zero sales for a month, but that is happening now,'' he said. Today the most successful art forms seem to be those that reproduce the political theater of the real world most closely. In the visual arts, photography has shown the most creative response to events. Among writers, it is journalism that has flourished. ''Most of our writers have gone into journalism, and it is the present that seduces them,'' said Petronila Daroy, who writes about culture and politics for The Manila Chronicle. ''They attempt to re-create society, rather than to transform it imaginatively.'' One of Mr. Daroy's colleagues at the newspaper, Tence Ruiz, is a social-realist painter who in the last few months has turned to producing brilliant political cartoons. In theater, perhaps the most ambitious and successful production is ''An Oath to Freedom,'' a play by the Philippine Educational Theater Association that attempts to encompass the sweep of recent history. The play too succeeded artistically because of its fidelity to unfolding events. During an extended tour of the United States and Europe, the troupe kept abreast of news from home and continually modified its production to reflect it. Film makers face greater problems. ''You have to have a point of view that will not look ridiculous with the turn of events,'' said Mr. Tiongson. Some painters and playwrights have not been troubled by the ambiguities that have stymied their colleagues. These are the committed leftists, who continue to turn out red-hued works of protest that announce that nothing has changed. But most artists find that there have been changes, both in the audience and the targets. It is harder now to find villains or heroes, even though much remains to protest. Things are no longer as clear-cut as they were before Mr. Marcos's departure. ''Under Marcos there was some hope that we could be united, that we could fight,'' said F. Sionil Jose, one of the country's leading novelists. ''The challenge was there. Under Marcos there was a giant there. We could shoot at him with our peashooters. Now it's like that sticky rat poison that your feet get stuck in.'' The past two years have been a sobering and disillusioning period for Filipinos, and much of the idealism of both the protesting artists and their audience has gone. In the passion play of Philippine politics, it is no longer Good and Evil who walk the stage, but characters much less clearly defined and more bewildering to the audience that must share the stage with them. As the high hopes of the 1986 ''revolution'' fade, and events degenerate into run-of-the-mill violence and ambition, the moment of political creativity could be passing.

410-> SPORTS PEOPLE; N.H.L. Suspends Two
Calling one incident ''potentially very dangerous'' and another ''totally irresponsible,'' Brian O'Neil, the executive vice president of the National Hockey League, issued suspensions yesterday totaling 12 games to Steve Konroyd, the Islanders' steadiest defenseman this season, and Randy Cunneyworth, the Pittsburgh Penguins' free-swinging left wing. Konroyd will sit out the Islanders' next four games, starting this evening against the Devils, for his part in a stick-swinging scuffle with Cunneyworth last Tuesday night. Cunneyworth drew a three-game suspension, a lighter sentence, according to O'Neil, because Konroyd swung first and acted more severely. But there was nothing light about the penalty Cunneyworth drew for striking Michael Thelven of Boston on the helmet and knocking down the Bruin defenseman during an altercation last Dec. 29. That stunning blow brought a five-game suspension, meaning that the Penguins will lose Cunneyworth for eight straight games.

414-> 3 Officials Named for Democratic Convention
The Democratic high command today chose the convention officials who will referee the opening rounds of competition between the party's Presidential candidates who survive the primaries and caucuses. Paul G. Kirk Jr., the Democratic national chairman, named Gov. James J. Blanchard of Michigan as chairman of the convention's platform committee; K. Leroy Irvis, Speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, as chairman of the credentials committee, and Kathleen Vick of Louisiana as chairman of the rules committee for the 1988 Democratic National Convention, which will be held July 18-21 in Atlanta. The first two committees could play an important role in determining the party's Presidential nominee. The credentials panel decides contested delegate elections, which are common in close races for the nomination. Credentials Battle in 1972 In 1972, for example, the battle between George McGovern and Hubert H. Humphrey was heavily influenced by a series of credentials committee decisions. When two or more Presidential candidates are still competing at convention time, they often engage in preliminary skirmishes in the platform committee, submitting planks designed to attract uncommitted delegates and winning committee approval for proposals designed to demonstrate their political leadership. According to Democratic aides, Mr. Kirk received assurances from all three committee leaders that they were not committed to any candidate and would remain neutral. Governor Blanchard, a commanding figure in Michigan politics, was elected in 1982 after four terms in the House of Representatives, and was re-elected by a huge margin in 1986. Mr. Irvis is the first person in Pennsylvania history to serve three successive terms as Speaker of the House. He has represented a Pittsburgh district in the State Legislature for 15 consecutive terms. Expert on Party Rules Mrs. Vick has been a state and national leader in the Democratic Party for more than 20 years. She is an expert on party rules and procedure, and is chairman of the 1988 convention's Compliance Assistance Commission, which has responsibility for assuring that all state delegations are properly selected. Mr. Kirk urged Democrats last month to write a short platform with as few specific promises as possible instead of the usual ''legislative laundry list,'' but it is not clear that he will be able to achieve that goal. One national party official said today that it would be impossible to keep competing Presidential candidates from trying to influence the platform in the committee and probably thereafter on the floor of the convention. If no candidate comes to the convention with a majority of the delegates, the official added, Governor Blanchard and his committee will probably have plenty of work to do. The executive committee of the Democratic National Committee had barely ratified Mr. Kirk's selection for convention chairmen when rumblings of discontent were heard. Although Mr. Kirk had managed to include among his choices a woman, a black, a Southerner, a Governor, a state legislator and a former member of Congress, he did not include a Hispanic person, and Hispanic representatives expressed strong disappointment. Mr. Kirk told members of the executive committee that the Omni, the Atlanta sports arena where the convention will be held, would impose ''some constraints with respect to space'' on the delegates. Don Fowler, the chief executive officer of the convention, said the Omni would accommodate the delegates, alternates, candidates and news media representatives ''in good order and in good style,'' but that the party would have to take care of its ''guests, friends and contributors'' in the Georgia World Congress Center, a huge exhibition hall next door to the Omni.

415-> NEW YORK UNIONS NEARING DEADLINE
With contracts covering 195,000 workers expiring this week, New York State is negotiating with bargaining units representing everyone from prison guards to chemists who test blood samples for AIDS. Contracts expire Thursday with five unions representing most of the employees. Negotiators are also working on a new contract for 18,000 professors and nonteaching employees who belong to United University Professionals. Their current contract runs through June 30. Although negotiators would like to reach tentative agreements by the deadlines, under state law union members are prohibited from walking off their jobs, even in the absence of a new contract. In addition to negotiating the usual issues such as salaries, the state is pressing for changes in workers' health insurance plans this year. State officials say they are alarmed by recent premium increases and want the unions to accept new co-payment options and deductibles. 'A Tough Round' ''It's a tough year, it's a tough round,'' said Elizabeth D. Moore, the director of the State Office of Employee Relations. In contrast to the last round of contract negotiations, in 1985, state officials will not say how much money is allotted for raises in Governor Cuomo's proposed budget for the fiscal year beginning Friday. In the last round of negotiations, the budget listed a 2 percent increase. But long before the final round of talks, the word in Albany was that more money was available. The Civil Service Employees Association, with four bargaining units representing 98,800 workers, won 5 percent annual increases, and other bargaining units won similar raises. This time, the state decided not to disclose the figure in advance. ''If the unions knew what the number was, it would be impossible for us to negotiate,'' said a spokesman for the employee relations office, Ron Tarwater. The state and all but one of the bargaining units have agreed not to discuss details of the issues being negotiated. The one union that did not agree, the 55,000-member Public Employees Federation, presented salary demands last week as part of a package calling for a two-year contract. The pact that expires Thursday is a three-year agreement.

417-> Kohl's Party Wins State Election
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic party managed to maintain its control of West Germany's wealthiest state, Baden-Wurttemberg, in elections today. The results, however, were seen less as a success for Mr. Kohl than as a spur for Lothar Spath, the Premier of the southwestern state who is considered a contender to succeed Mr. Kohl as the next leader of the Christian Democrats. During the campaign, Mr. Spath distanced himself from some of Mr. Kohl's policies, most notably some proposed tax law changes that would cut into the benefits of workers at auto plants. Baden-Wurttemberg has West Germany's heaviest concentration of car manufacturing, including Mercedes, Porsche and Audi. All major parties lost ground compared with the results of the last election in 1984, with the gains going to several small parties, most notably the far-right National Democratic Party. Part of the shift was evidently an expression of frustration by farmers, who are angry over cuts in subsidies and increased competition from the European Community. The Christian Democrats took 49.1 percent of the vote, 2.8 percent less than 1984 but enough under the electoral system in Baden-Wurttemberg to control a majority of the seats in the state parliament. The state thus remains the only one in West Germany where the conservative party rules alone. The Christian Democrats have been suffering in national polls and regional elections since the federal elections last year, and there had been widespread anticipation that Mr. Spath would fail to win the 48 percent necessary to retain sole control. Commentators had suggested that he would need to form a coalition with either the Free Democratic Party, which shares power with the Christian Democrats in the federal Government, or with the Social Democrats, the main opposition party. The Christian Democrats' success in at least maintaining sole control was credited largely to Mr. Spath's personal popularity, and strengthened his position as a strong contender to succeed Mr. Kohl. ''I am sure that my success in a very difficult situation will be noted,'' Mr. Spath said in a television interview. The Socialists took 32 percent, 0.4 percent less than four years ago. The environmentalist Green Party received 7.9 percent, a drop of 0.1 percent, while the centrist Free Democrats dropped to 5.9 percent, a loss of 1.3 percent. Small parties gained a total of about 5 percent.

419-> ORGANIZATION MAN: Victor E. Millar; Why Saatchi Chose a Stodgy Ad Chief
MADISON AVENUE was alive with drama last week, as top executives at Lord, Geller, Federico, Einstein defected from the shop's British parent, WPP Group P.L.C., and set up their own firm. But news of this bitter - and much-publicized - dispute appeared to elude Victor E. Millar, who oversees all the ad shops owned by Saatchi & Saatchi P.L.C., parent of the world's largest ad group. Asked mid-week for his comments on the furor, the Washington-based Mr. Millar (pronounced Mil-LAR) said he was not aware of it. An accountant by training and an organization man by nature, Mr. Millar, named chief of London-based Saatchi's Communications division last October, is clearly detached from the daily world of advertising. In fact, his appointment as head of Communications - which handled a reported $9 billion in ad billings last year - seemed so incongruous there were rumors that it was temporary. Analysts found it easier to understand his earlier Saatchi role - head of consulting, a post he still holds. Indeed, former associates at the accounting firm of Arthur Andersen & Company, where Mr. Millar spent his career before being lured away by Maurice and Charles Saatchi, say his strength is planning and designing business information systems. Some at Saatchi argue that an organization man is just what the corporation needs to run an advertising and consulting empire with a presence in 57 countries and revenues of $1.2 billion in fiscal 1987. ''Victor Millar has one of the best track records and one of the best strategic brains of anyone in the business service sector,'' said Michael Dobbs, a spokesman for Saatchi & Saatchi in London. ''We already had the best advertising brains.'' This organization man has his work cut out for him. ''He's in a pivotal role,'' said Richard Dale, an analyst with James Capel & Company, a London brokerage. ''He has to develop the consulting side of the business while maintaining a drive organically on the communications side.'' Founders Maurice and Charles Saatchi have stopped buying large ad agencies like Ted Bates, Dancer Fitzgerald Sample, Compton and others. Saatchi Communications now provides a laundry list of services including advertising, direct marketing, public relations and promotion. It falls to Mr. Millar to prove Saatchi's resulting supermarket theory: that clients will use many services in the network. ''We have to learn to work collectively to take advantage of our scale,'' said Mr. Millar. His current quest is for ''synergy,'' building business through ''cross referrals'' from within Saatchi. To strengthen Consulting - which includes litigation counseling, development of information systems, management consulting and market research for example - Mr. Millar is on an acquisition drive to reach his own goal of revenues of $1 billion by 1990. At $198 million in fiscal 1987, he is far from the mark. He is unlikely, though, to create autonomy problems of the sort that plagued Lord, Geller. That is not Saatchi's style. ''I haven't had any overt Saatchi control,'' said Robert Lenz, president of the domestic division of Backer Spielvogel Bates. ''They essentially have left us alone.'' And Mr. Millar will not deal with day-to-day ad operations. ''It's not my job to write copy or place advertising,'' he said. ''It's my job to work through the strategic options and help us take advantage of our scale.'' SITTING in his antique-filled Washington office, the 52-year-old Mr. Millar, who earns about $1 million yearly in salary and bonus, is far from his roots in the small oil town of Brea, Calif. His father was a drilling foreman who, by the time Mr. Millar was in high school, was spending much of his time in Peru, Australia and Iran. During the summer, young Victor Millar - whose talents lay in academics and music (he played piano, accordian and oboe) - was a roughneck on an oil rig. ''You would screw and unscrew the pipe; you'd get covered with mud,'' he said, recalling some un-fond memories. ''It was a dirty job.'' By the time he enrolled at the University of California at Berkeley, Mr. Millar wanted to get as far away as possible from the sodden oilfields. He soon dropped original college major - petroleum engineering - in favor of accounting and finance, completing his undergraduate and M.B.A. degrees in four and a half years. Then he landed a job on the audit staff at Arthur Andersen's San Francisco office. His big break came in 1960, when he was selected for a two-year computer-training program in the company's Chicago headquarters. He never returned to San Francisco. By 1968, he was head of computer consulting worldwide. Eventually, he helped Andersen build the world's largest consulting practice, most of it in developing computer-based information systems. Former Andersen associates say Mr. Millar used his strong analytic skills to become a powerful persuader - an executive who ruled not by might but by logic. ''I used to watch Vic in board meetings,'' said Randal B. McDonald, a former chief financial officer at Andersen and now president of Pennzoil Inc. ''He'd talk for an hour with no notes. He had complete mastery of details. I used to wonder, 'How can he know all these details?' '' Mr. McDonald added, ''If he didn't get what he wanted the first time, you knew he'd get it through a back door.'' At Andersen, Mr. Millar also wound up supervising employee training. In 1970, the firm took over an old college campus near Chicago, and employees were sent to learn technical and communications skills. By 1986, when Maurice Saatchi approached him to build Saatchi's fledgling consulting division, Mr. Millar had been a managing partner for three years at Andersen, supervising tax, accounting and worldwide management consulting practices. His drive seemed to inspire his son and two daughters, all of whom work in consulting (and all of whom have worked at Andersen). Still, close associates at the firm say they were not surprised by his leaving the firm after almost three decades. He was sorely disappointed, they say, when he realized he would not succeed Duane Kullberg, who was re-elected for another term as chief executive. ''Victor is very ambitious and wanted to run his own show,'' Mr. McDonald said. In January 1987, he joined Saatchi as head of Consulting. His current title: chairman and chief executive of Communications and Consulting. AS chief of Communications, Mr. Millar is markedly different from his predecessor, Anthony Simonds-Gooding, who left Saatchi in September to head British Satellite Broadcasting. A stout British charmer, Mr. Simonds-Gooding, a former marketing man, had the requisite flash to get along in the ad world. His charm, associates say, eased traumatic times when large agencies were being merged. And he could move mountains and assuage wounded egos with his wit and wiles. His successor is less charismatic. A formal man who speaks in modulated tones, Mr. Millar wears conservative gray suits and - almost always - white shirts whose cuffs bear his embroidered initials. His approach was underscored last November in Copenhagen at a meeting of senior executives of Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide. In his first speech as Saatchi's Communications chief, Mr. Millar lost some of his audience with his abstract theories and dry presentation, according to an executive who was there. ''We were desperately trying to stay awake,'' said this executive. ''We said, 'Oh, God, bring out the coffee.' '' Mr. Millar's style stands out on Wall Street, too. ''He's like everybody's junior high school principal,'' said one analyst. ''Everything is like a list, like a syllabus.'' Mr. Millar does speak in the argot of consulting - using terms like ''soft skills'' (relating well to clients, for example) and ''engagements'' (say, a new account) that are not everyday parlance in the ad world. What's more, some argue, his painstakingly logical approach runs counter to some strains in the ad business. ''Some people say he's too logical,'' said Robert C. Snell, director of corporate business administration at Saatchi's London headquarters. ''Advertising people like to make logic leaps. They can make a decision on gut feel. Victor won't do that.'' Not everyone sees that as a flaw. ''He knows about management and that's more important,'' said Robert Holmen, chairman and chief executive of Backer Spielvogel Bates. ''He has a disciplined approach to business that's going to benefit us.'' Whatever the pluses or problems with that approach, Mr. Millar has applied it throughout his career. Even his own work habits are not exempt. For example, he routinely stands when he is working - at an antique schoolmaster's desk - because he noticed that this shortens impromptu meetings with colleagues. Soon after he was appointed Communications chief at Saatchi, he conducted a survey: What does a client look for most in hiring an agency? Creativity came out on top, but the term is too imprecise, he says. ''Does creativity mean shocking and new?'' he asked. ''Is it creative even if it doesn't sell the product?'' And he chose Washington as the location for Saatchi's United States operating headquarters after he consulted surveys that showed it was the most frequent destination of traveling chief executives. (Saatchi's New York office houses corporate public relations, investor relations and financial and legal operations.) MR. MILLAR lives in a historic district in Alexandria, Va. His renovated home was originally built in 1750. He loves history and uses what free time he has to read about it. His favorite figure is Winston Churchill, because ''he was a man able to argue a case effectively. He had great command of language. He was logical, syllogistic.'' Mr. Millar also finds time for collecting wines. He and his wife, the former Charlotte Hein, are building a wine cellar in their stone basement. But most of his energy is spent on the quest for synergy at Saatchi. He is breaking new ground with the concept, he says. ''I have looked for a good example of synergy, but I've never found one,'' he said. ''Synergy is an unnatural act, but the economic impact is enormous; it reduces marketing costs and helps the client.'' Unnatural indeed. Executives are often guarded about referring a client to another firm, even if it's all in the family. If the client comes away unhappy, there's too much fallout. A happy client means sharing the limelight - or, worse yet, the budget. ''It's certainly not easy to do,'' conceded Stuart Upson, co-chief executive of Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising Worldwide, a major prong of the Communications division. ''But we're going to work on it.' Mr. Millar stops short of saying that there will be financial rewards for those who synergize best, but he said that ''over the long run, people who introduce sister firms to opportunities should do better than people who cubbyhole clients.'' Rewards may be required. Only 5 percent of all current business came through Saatchi synergy, Mr. Millar says, though he adds that he is encouraged by the fact that 20 percent of all new projects are internal referrals. To date, he says, more than 50 clients - among them, British Airways and I.B.M. - work with three or more Saatchi operations. He hopes that gatherings at his Center for Competitive Advantage, a new training and conference facility that sprawls over half of Saatchi's 16,000-square-foot Washington offices, will get more executives to see the light on synergy. But as he tries to generate business from within, Mr. Millar is also under the gun to make some acquisitions on the consulting side. In the last year, he has talked to more than 20 consulting firms. He joined the pack of would-be rescuers when Arthur D. Little, of Cambridge, Mass., was in a hostile takeover skirmish with Plenum Publishing. (Mr. Millar says no formal discussions took place.) He even went after Arthur Andersen's consulting practice. (They rejected his overture.) He wound up with three firms - Cleveland Consulting, Litigation Sciences and Peterson & Company. So far this year, he has acquired Syllogistics, a Government consulting firm, and Knoth & Meads, a recruitment advertising company. He needs more. ''He hasn't made significant, blockbuster, acquisitions,'' said James Kennedy of Consulting News, an industry publication. ''He's under a lot of pressure to come up with something big.'' He may now be ready for something big. With the October crash, Saatchi ''had to re-evaluate resources and priorities,'' Mr. Millar said. But now the stock is at about $24, up from its post-crash low of $17. ''If anyone believes that our appetite for acquisitions has slowed,'' he said, ''they are mistaken.''

420-> Hopes for Bidders Fade For 1st Republicbank . . . As Tension Mounts At First City of Texas
As bank regulators searched for a bidder to take over the deeply troubled First Republicbank Corporation, many analysts said the nation's 13th-largest bank holding company is too large and too crippled by bad loans to attract any serious offers. The more likely outcome, they said, would involve the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's operating the largest financial institution in Texas for several years. To halt substantial withdrawals of deposits from First Republicbank's 73 subsidiary banks, the F.D.I.C. injected $1 billion in cash last Thursday and guaranteed all deposits, including those of more than $100,000. The assistance to First Republicbank, which has lost $2 billion in deposits since the first of this year, has so far amounted to the second-largest bailout in banking history. Depositors Were Calmed A bank spokesman, Joseph C. Bowles, said Friday that the action by the F.D.I.C. quelled the deposit outflows. Some analysts said that First Republicbank's problems with rapidly deteriorating real estate loans may push the rescue bill beyond the $4.5 billion that was needed to steady the Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Company of Chicago in 1984. ''It wouldn't surprise me if it is more,'' said William M. Isaac, who headed the F.D.I.C. at the time of the Continental bailout. He now is managing director and chief executive of the Secura Group, a consulting firm in Washington. First Republicbank, formed last June when the Republicbank Corporation acquired the Interfirst Corporation for $544 million, held $1.16 billion in stockholders' equity at the end of December, and $3.2 billion in total capital. A Rapid Deterioration The equity figure, at 4.5 percent of total deposits, did not drop alarmingly below industry standards, despite First Republicbank's growing loan problems. Its nonperforming loans, however, soared in the second half of last year, to $3.2 billion, from $1.8 billion last June 30, three weeks after the merger. Analysts noted that 40 percent of its $9.5 billion in real estate loans at the end of the year were concentrated in land development and construction loans, the most-depressed part of the vastly overbuilt Texas real estate market. ''I expect their nonperforming assets to rise throughout 1988,'' said Sandra J. Flannigan, an analyst with Paine Webber Inc. in Houston. Experts close to the bank estimate that as much as $3 billion of First Republicbank's real estate loans may be uncollectible. Its reserves to cover loan losses totaled $1.3 billion at the end of 1987. Drastic Steps Needed Gerald W. Fronterhouse, First Republicbank's chairman and chief executive, reportedly warned the bank's executives in January that the 1988 loss could approach $450 million if drastic steps to cut costs were not taken. In an interview last week, Mr. Fronterhouse declined to forecast a range for the company's first-quarter loss. L. William Seidman, chairman of the F.D.I.C., said Friday in an interview on public television that bank examiners concluded before last week that First Republicbank was headed for insolvency in ''a matter of months.'' He said there was ''absolutely no way'' to know how much the F.D.I.C. will eventually have to pay to cover First Republicbank's losses. The agency has $16 billion in cash, plus another $2 billion in various investments. Continental Illinois Bailout Although the F.D.I.C. paid out $4.5 billion in the Continental Illinois bailout four years ago, Mr. Seidman estimated the final cost will be cut to about $1.7 billion because of the bank's success in recovering money from bad loans. ''It might be less'' at First Republicbank, Mr. Seidman said. Analysts said Mr. Seidman's goal is to attract another bank or investor group to take control of First Republicbank as a way of minimizing the final cost to his agency. He estimated that as many as 50 banks would fail in Texas this year. On the other hand, Texas is the nation's third-largest state and First Republicbank has the largest retail banking system in Texas, with 134 banking sites. ''The bank is in trouble because of the economy in Texas,'' Mr. Seidman said. ''That economy is going to recover. It's a question of when.'' Modest Growth Has Begun In fact, the economies of Houston, Dallas and San Antonio all grew at modest rates last year and are continuing to add jobs. Each of the cities ranks among the nation's 10 largest cities. Mr. Isaac, the former F.D.I.C. official, said a list of conceivable bidders could include Citicorp and Chase Manhattan, both in New York, and Security Pacific and Wells Fargo, on the West Coast, and perhaps a handful of Japan's largest banks. ''I don't know if they would be interested, but they have the capacity,'' he said. He said he was ''familiar'' with the F.D.I.C.'s handling of the Texas bank's bailout but declined to say what if any role he has taken since the bailout was announced. Caution About Texas Ronald W. Meek, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York, said Citicorp and Chase Manhattan ruled out acquisitions in Texas after Chemical Bank acquired Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc. of Houston last April. Citicorp had $203.6 billion in assets, and Chase Manhattan $99.1 billion at the end of last year. Wells Fargo, with $44.2 billion in assets, is only slightly larger than First Republicbank. Security Pacific of Los Angeles with $72.8 billion, recently completed acquisitions in Arizona, Oregon and Washington State. ''We are not looking'' at First Republicbank, said Susan B. Taha, a spokesman for Security Pacific. ''We have a full plate already before us.'' The F.D.I.C. did find an outside investor group to take over the First City Bancorporation of Texas, a Houston-based bank holding company with $12 billion in assets. First City's Buyers The group, headed by A. Robert Abboud, raised more than $500 million, coupled with $970 million in notes from the F.D.I.C., to finance the takeover. Some First City bondholders, in an effort to receive higher prices for their bonds, prevented the deal from closing earlier this month. . Mr. Meek said the prospect of a similar investor group appearing to bid for First Republicbank was more remote, because it is nearly triple First City's size. ''It's very difficult to imagine someone would have the kind of bucks for the capital infusion First Republic would need,'' he said. It also seems unlikely that a Japanese bank would get seriously interested, Mr. Isaac said. ''It's difficult to find a foreign bank that would be big enough and willing to take on a troubled situation of this sort,'' he said. ''The F.D.I.C. might provide the financial wherewithal to make it feasible, but it's still an enormous management challenge to oversee the workout of the problems,'' he said. ''Foreign banks are going to find it doubly daunting.''

421-> A TOWN LOST IN THE GALAXY
SANDMOUTH By Ronald Frame. 476 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $19.95. Ronald Frame is a Scot whose award-winning first novel, ''Winter Journey,'' stirred expectations, as did the two volumes of his short stories - ''Watching Mrs. Gordon and Other Stories'' and ''A Long Weekend With Marcel Proust.'' One saw in Mr. Frame a subtle literary intelligence groping its way among possible forms. His second novel, ''Sandmouth,'' comes dressed to kill: nearly 500 pages, with characters galore, set in a picturesque English coastal town. Incest, lust, greed, insanity, even literary ambition figure in the dozen or so lives that Mr. Frame observes in the course of an April day in the mid-1950's. The novel jitters, like an overloaded 747, down the runway. But it just won't fly. The problem with ''Sandmouth'' has something to do with the genre itself, the town novel, which has become self-replicating. You don't even need a novelist any more - certainly not one of Mr. Frame's ability -to insure that every publishing season will count several new ones, each thicker than the last. The formula is quite simple: pick a town, preferably one with some distinguishing features, then focus on a cross section of its citizens. Be sure that all classes are duly represented (upper, lower, emerging middle) and be sure that everyone has a plump, dark secret. Like all literary forms, the town novel can play host to a range of talents. It can result in ''Middlemarch,'' ''Peyton Place'' or ''. . . And Ladies of the Club.'' ''Sandmouth'' fails as art, and it fails as trash, though it occasionally approaches both. The writing can be devilishly good, as in the novel's final mock-grandiloquent sentence: ''Sandmouth in the first years of this second half of the twentieth century is a faint dot on the map of Britain, and Britain is a red smudge on an atlas map of the northern hemisphere, and all the red countries of a diminishing empire amount to just a blur on a whirring globe on a table-top, and the globe of the world as it spins at one thousand miles an hour in an unending void (at a velocity of sixty-six thousand miles an hour in its orbit round the sun) is only a clouded silver round of cooling gas, stranded in one galaxy out of many, among countless other stars of more and less life.'' Mr. Frame has considerable powers of description, and there is plenty of room in ''Sandmouth'' for him to exercise them fully. He also has a talent for witty understatement, as when he writes apropos of a newly rich family of Italian immigrants: ''Doing decently well in business is admirable, especially if the hours involved are long and hard, but a point is reached when industry becomes disturbing if it seems to be obsessive and when the reward of prosperity loses its moral stamp and is seen to be vulgar, ill-bred, and not a quality of the angels any more.'' Nevertheless, Mr. Frame too often lapses into cliche and caricature. There is the mad girl, Tilly Moscombe, the product of an illicit relationship that becomes a focal point for the plot. ''To the truly percipient,'' Mr. Frame writes, ''Tilly Moscombe is part of a grander design, a minor figure woven into the panorama on a tapestry.'' She bears (fairly) silent witness to the town's various degenerate acts, and many people hate her for it. She reminds them, all too frequently, that the heart of man is infinitely wicked. We have met her before in dozens of novels, just as we have met her guardian, Lady de Castellet of Hallam House, the elderly (and dying) aristocrat who presides over the town's tremulous class structure. Everyone is after Lady de Castellet's money, of course. Distant relatives with a mercenary gleam in their eyes circle the house like vultures. This is mildly funny. The sexual exploits of Norman Partiger, a local building tycoon, with his lawyer's wife are also diverting in a kinky sort of way (he's into bondage). But the most vivid of the novel's endless strains concerns Howard Trevis, a fastidious young banker who has recently married the girl next door to mask his homosexuality. His fantasies and torments are well described, and his final encounter with a transient actor in a public lavatory is nothing if not vivid. For most part, alas, the denizens of Sandmouth sit like frightened hens on their dirty little eggs, which uniformly hatch on exactly the same day in April. It seems highly improbable. Then again, fiction often seems improbable, since it resembles life. One could accept the use of coincidence in ''Sandmouth,'' however far-fetched. What seems harder to accept is the cast of derivative characters, the predictability of their stories and the writer's uncertain grasp of his own purposes.

422-> Critic's Notebook; Has Stanley Kowalski Become an Unactable Role?
From the moment Tennessee Williams wrote the final line of ''A Streetcar Named Desire,'' the role of Stanley Kowalski has been the most difficult to cast in the modern repertory. After seeing the revival of ''Streetcar'' at Circle in the Square, one wonders what would have happened if the play had been written today. The production might have been abandoned for lack of an appropriate Stanley. Most other great roles are adaptable to the attributes of available actors, and vice versa. Hamlet can assume a diversity of physical or emotional forms, and a slim actor can always be padded to play a fat Falstaff. Dustin Hoffman proved that Willy Loman could be a ''shrimp'' instead of a ''walrus'' (Lee J. Cobb). But, in that sense, Stanley Kowalski is exceptional, partly because of Marlon Brando, who created the role, and largely because of how Williams conceived the character. It begins with a question of physicality. Stanley must have an animal ferocity. Always, as with Mr. Brando, there must be menace, a threat of violence to anyone - or anything -within striking distance. Stanley's cry of ''Stella!'' so often parodied, must shake theatergoers. It is, in fact, a primal scream. Necessarily, there must also be a sensuality, so that he attracts at the same time he repels Blanche. Any actor who plays Stanley should convey both aspects of his nature, and he must avoid making him too sympathetic. It was precisely on that ground that Harold Clurman, reviewing the original Broadway production, criticized Mr. Brando. With the ''collusion'' of the audience, said Mr. Clurman, the play became ''the triumph of Stanley Kowalski'' rather than the tragedy of Blanche DuBois. That criticism was the exception. The performance has been widely regarded as an exact meeting of actor and character. Furthermore, Mr. Brando, as Stanley, came to represent the epitome of the newly emergent naturalistic school of American acting. The Brando image, preserved on film (for those who missed it on stage), is a mountainous obstacle for anyone trying to make his own impression in the role. With the possible exception of Jason Robards as Hickey in ''The Iceman Cometh,'' it is difficult to name any other actor whose signature is as firmly fixed on a contemporary character. When Williams died, it was said that his characters, especially his women, and Blanche DuBois in particular, would live on. The current production of the play at Circle in the Square represents the second time Blythe Danner has played Blanche (the first was two years ago at the Williamstown Theater Festival), and she offers, as before, a distinctive and a refined characterization. Other actresses certainly will play the role, and they will be shadowed but not haunted by Jessica Tandy and Vivien Leigh, who preceded them. Producers will continue to face the steeper challenge of whom to cast as Stanley. Aidan Quinn, a fine actor (in films as well as on stage), who plays the role at Circle in the Square, is not a persuasive Stanley. At his best, with his sensitive, even soulful, manner, he resembles Montgomery Clift, another fine actor who would not have been anyone's logical choice to portray the character. In Ms. Danner's previous ''Streetcar,'' Christopher Walken was her Stanley, and though he caught the preening cock-of-the-walk side and a measure of the danger, the performance was too mannered to have the desired impact. In recent years, Treat Williams (opposite Ann-Margret on television), James Farentino (opposite Rosemary Harris, at Lincoln Center) and Kenneth Welsh (opposite Shirley Knight at the McCarter Theater in Princeton) have been, in varying degrees, effective, but no one has come close to superseding the image of Mr. Brando. Earlier in their careers, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and Robert De Niro could have done battle with Stanley. Of those of stature at a younger age, John Malkovich would seem to be the most obvious choice - but his position toward playing Stanley is almost like that of Governor Cuomo toward running for President. The actor's statement is not Shermanesque, but he is certainly exceedingly reluctant. Meanwhile, in Lanford Wilson's ''Burn This,'' Mr. Malkovich plays a city cousin of Stanley, the demonic Pale; here, as earlier, in Sam Shepard's ''True West,'' the actor clearly articulates his volatility. Among other talented performers in their 30's and early 40's, Kevin Kline is certainly a ranking American actor. We have seen him move effortlessly from musical comedy to Richard III to Hamlet, but Stanley is not a role that would come naturally to him. Other estimable actors would be excluded for reasons of size, voice or emotional power. Think hard and one might come up with possibilites - from movies as well as from the theater. Willem Dafoe, Don Johnson and James Woods may each have a Stanley in him, and, if nationality were not a question, one could always look to England (Daniel Day-Lewis, whose range seems limitless) or to Australia (Mel Gibson). No doubt somewhere there is an unknown actor with the required weight. As Aidan Quinn said in a recent interview, ''It's a great play and a great role, so what's not to do.'' His point is that it would be cowardly not to attempt Stanley. As long as there are brave actors, there will be a Stanley Kowalski.

423-> Sports of The Times; The Heart of Pistol Pete
TOO many times, said Atlanta Hawks Coach Richie Guerin in 1970, Pete Maravich gets himself ''stuck up there in the air.'' It's a great trait for a moon, but not necessarily for a basketball player. Pistol Pete Maravich was then a rookie in the National Basketball Association, and finding that his $2 million contract and his all-America press clippings and his great one-man show replete with feathery touch, blind passes and slick dribbling - all done with long hair flopping and gray socks sagging - did not entitle him to immediate success in the league. At Louisiana State University, where he averaged 44.2 points a game during three seasons (he remains college basketball's scoring leader), Maravich could go up for a jump shot and remain for a while, taking his good time, until he decided to pass or pop the shot. But then, there weren't many other 6-foot-5-inch guards. When he soared in the N.B.A., he discovered he had company. The guards there could hang from a roof beam or a moonbeam with as much perseverance as Pete. He soon adjusted his game and generally soared only when it was most propitious. He went on to play a decade in the N.B.A., twice making first-team All-Pro, and eventually making the Basketball Hall of Fame. This was recalled the other day when an autopsy of Maravich, who died last week, revealed that he suffered from a rare, natural heart defect that had gone undetected during his life. He had no left coronary artery. Normally, humans have two. ''All those years,'' noted Earl Ubell, the science reporter on CBS-TV, ''his life hung by a thread.'' Most people with the kind of heart condition Maravich had die before they are 20; a relative few may live to 30. Maravich, who had been retired as an athlete for seven years, died at 40. ''For a guy to go 10 years in the N.B.A. and have a congenital anomaly like that is, to say the least, very unusual,'' said Dr. Paul Thompson of Brown University, an expert on sudden death who was quoted in an Associated Press story Wednesday. ''How could a guy like that run up and down the court for 20 years?'' The question is provocative. WE often talk about someone having heart. That their heart was in it. Songs tell us we gotta have heart. Could it be that Maravich, although with less physical heart than most, metaphorically had more? Could it be that he actually strengthened his heart because of his passionate involvement in the game? And was it this fulfillment that possibly contributed to his living virtually twice the expected lifetime? What did Dr. Thompson think? ''I often tell my patients, the heart bone is connected to the head bone,'' he said. ''There is no scientific proof that emotions and feelings and desire affect how we feel, but I think most physicians believe there is a correlation. It's entirely possible that Maravich's drive to excel and love for the game kept him alive.'' Did Pistol Pete have heart? ''Oh yes, oh sure,'' said Butch van Breda Kolff, who coached Maravich for two years with the New Orleans Jazz. ''No one learns to handle the ball the way Pete did and not love the game. The hours that he spent on it. I remember one trick he did that I've never seen before. He would take a ball and slam it on the floor with two hands and have it bounce between his legs and he'd catch it behind him.'' Maravich would recall that, as a boy, he dribbled a basketball wherever he went. In the movie theater, he once said, he'd sit on the aisle so he could keep bouncing the ball. He played with a clear love of the game, sometimes even to his detriment, for as someone recently pointed out, he was an individual in a team sport. And early in his pro career, with two Southern franchises, Atlanta and New Orleans, he was also a ''white hope,'' it was said, in a black-dominated sport. When he was derided early on by fans, and even by teammates, Maravich persevered, just as he had in college, when he was the whole show, playing for his father, Press, which was a kind of burden as well. HE had dreams and strivings, perfectionist's dreams and strivings. ''One of these nights,'' he said, after a game at L.S.U., ''one of these nights I'm going to hit all my shots. Forty shots, maybe. I'll hit 'em all. I don't know when that night will be. I just know it's coming.'' It never came, not that kind of night, although he had many brilliant ones, like the February night in 1977 when he scored 68 points against the Knicks, on 26 for 43 from the field and 16 for 19 from the free-throw line. Only four players have ever scored more in an N.B.A. game His heart never showed signs of weakness, although he proved physically vulnerable. He came down with mononucleosis, and separated his shoulder. In 1972, he suffered from Bell's palsy, a temporary nerve disorder that caused headaches and a partial paralysis of the right side of his face. ''Heart'' may also mean conquering adversity. Maravich came back from illness and injury. He became a strong enough team player to twice make first-team all-N.B.A. He had problems with alcoholism during his playing days, but beat that, and became a health-food enthusiast. In retirement, he was active as a born-again Christian. Then, 11 days ago, after not having played the game he loved for nearly a year, he entered a halfcourt pickup basketball game in Pasadena, Calif., with a chance to once again soar and hang in the air. ''I feel great,'' Maravich said, breaking a sweat. A few minutes later, the concealed thread from which his life had been hanging since birth, snapped. Pistol Pete Maravich collapsed and died on the basketball court, where, for so many years, his heart had been.

424-> Many Haitians Ignore Strike on Inaugural Eve
On the eve of the inauguration of Leslie F. Manigat as President of Haiti, a general strike today closed most stores in the heart of the capital. But many people who earn their living in open-air markets and street stalls went about their business as usual. Support for the protest was far less extensive than for a strike that preceded the election on Jan. 17 in which Mr. Manigat was declared the winner amid widespread protests of fraud and irregularities. In several cities around the country, correspondents for independent radio stations in the capital reported that few people were observing the strike. Many Haitians continued to bitterly criticize the election, charging that the army rigged it for Mr. Manigat. But many said they felt continued protests were fruitless and others said they were prepared to give Mr. Manigat, a 57-year-old former political science professor, time to prove that, despite the manner in which he came to office, he can be a good president. After establishing a center for international studies at the University of Haiti shortly after Francois Duvalier to power, Mr. Manigat broke with the dictator and advocated his overthrow during most of his 23 years in exile. Today workmen were hammering together grandstands and trimming palm trees in front of the whitewashed Legislative Assembly building where the inauguration is to take place. Four former presidential candidates who have become opposition leaders have urged Haitians to stay off the streets tomorrow until after the inaugural ceremonies are over. The United States, which has said the presidential elections were neither free nor fair, is expected to be represented at the ceremony by its Ambassador, Brunson McKinley. Several other countries are also sending ambassadors. Mr. Manigat is to replace Lieut. Gen. Henri Hamphy, who has led a provisional government since Jean-Claude Duvalier fled into exile in France two years ago, ending more than 29 years of family dictatorship. The main question for most Haitians and foreigners alike is how independent of the army Mr. Manigat will be. Friends and critics say he is strong-willed and would be an unlikely candidate for a puppet. But he has made clear that he does not intend to challenge the army. He says he intends to run a democratic government and that his primary concern is the social and economic development of the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. One of his first objectives, he says, is the restoration of United States economic aid of about $70 million. The aid was suspended last November after thugs and soldiers broke up the country's first attempt at presidential elections in 30 years with the massacre of at least 34 people. Marc Bazin, one of the former presidential candidates who boycotted the Jan. 17 vote and who now lead the opposition, said he regarded the strike today as successful even though participation was limited. He said that ''for people to forgo revenue just for something symbolic, in my view, that counts.'' However, an aide to Mr. Manigat, Roger E. Savain, said, ''It is true that some stores were closed and some people were abstaining from work. But I saw a lot of taxis operating and a lot of people on the streets. I don't see how you can call that a strike.''

425-> In New York, Quest for Campaign Money Never Ends
Faced with ever-rising campaign costs and hoping to intimidate potential challengers, top officeholders in New York State have geared up their fund-raising operations to run constantly, not just during election seasons. The perennial flow of money, with some incumbents raising and spending millions of dollars each year, was one of the themes that emerged last week in hearings by the State Commission on Government Integrity. The commission, appointed by Governor Cuomo, is investigating, among other things, why and how politicians raise so much campaign money. It is one of the major topics in the panel's investigation of potential corruption and unethical practices in state, New York City and local governments, and in political parties throughout the state. In New York City, a new campaign financing measure is expected to put at least some limit on the expenditures. Or, as Mayor Koch said, explaining in an interview why he favored the new $3 million limit on mayoral campaign expenditures, ''You won't spend money like a drunken sailor.'' 'Wanted a Landslide' Coincidentally, $3 million was the initial goal of the Mayor's 1985 fund-raising effort, according to testimony before the panel by Lawrence Mandelker, the Mayor's longtime campaign treasurer. Despite relatively weak opposition in the Democratic primary and general election, the Koch campaign doubled its goal and spent all the money. ''We wanted a landslide,'' said Mr. Mandelker in a later interview, echoing candidates and their advisers who say there is no such thing as raising or spending too much in a campaign. Between elections, campaign funds today are being used to pay for retainers for consultants and polls; fund-raising expenses, such as the considerable cost of dinners, cocktail parties and other candidate entertainment; contributions to other politicians; tickets to charitable and political affairs; rental cars for the politicians; and flowers, air fare and any other expense that can be remotely ascribed to promoting the candidate's election. Increasingly, incumbents are also spending the money to thwart potential challengers. For instance, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat who is seeking re-election, acknowledged recently that one reason he publicized his fund raising this year and ran a television advertising campaign in February - unusually early in an election - was to deter Rudolph W. Giuliani, the United States Attorney in Manhattan, as a possible Republican opponent. Mr. Giuliani, citing concern over important cases his office is investigating, decided not to run, despite the entreaties of New York and national Republican leaders. Spending to Win Still, most of the money being stockpiled between elections is intended for the races themselves, which are becoming as expensive as they are complex. ''I have been involved in a good many campaigns,'' said Lawrence Huntington, the campaign treasurer for State Comptroller Edward V. Regan. ''I have not been in a single campaign in which the candidate didn't panic in the last week. He would come upon an adverse statement by the opponent and spend an awful lot of money to salvage what appears to be a disaster.'' More consultants and pollsters and telephone banks and direct-mail techniques, all expensive, are being used. In addition, the high cost of television advertising, especially in New York City, was cited by every politician interviewed. Mr. Regan, for example, told the ''beeswax'' story: His Albany office was to be the setting for a 1986 television commercial, but the office didn't quite suit the phalanx of advertising experts. ''There was a crew of 10 or 12 people,'' Mr. Regan recalled. ''They redid the office. They bought new lamps with green shades. It didn't even look like my office. They had a trolley with a camera on it that was used for panning. I don't know how many lights with umbrellas they had. ''And over in the corner was a black box. It turned out there was beeswax in it, and they heated the beeswax to create a mist, a softening effect. I learned how to sit still like a dummy for six hours.'' Such a production can cost up to $15,000. State Financing Questioned ''Television eats money,'' said the Comptroller. ''And the commercials have to be sophisticated, because you're competing with soap and beer commercials. No more candidates with an American flag in the background; the voters go 'click' when they see that.'' Mr. Regan, noting efforts by some New York officials to establish government financing of political campaigns at the state level, echoed some other politicians when he questioned whether ''the taxpayers should pay for the beeswax machine.'' He added, ''What do the voters get out of that?'' Campaign managers invariably allocate at least half their treasuries for television. One leading television and political consultant, David Garth, usually insists on at least 75 percent for television, contending that it is most cost-efficient. High Cost of Consultants Mr. Garth receives $25,000 a month for his services, plus expenses and up to 15 percent commission on the cost of the television air time that he buys. Another consultant, Philip J. Friedman, received at least $850,000 in fees from John S. Dyson, an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic nomination to the United State Senate in 1986. A chagrined Mr. Dyson has since said that Mr. Friedman charged him for ''hot and cold running limousines and airplanes.'' It is not uncommon, politicians noted, to spend more than $500,000 a week for television commercials in the final weeks of the campaign. ''Television took the place of the ward bosses who used to turn out the vote,'' said another political consultant, Ronald Maiorana, former press secretary to Nelson A. Rockefeller. The Pollsters Emerge The political-party managers have also been replaced by pollsters who charge as much as $30,000 for a statewide survey. And direct mail - campaign literature sent straight to voters - can cost up to 50 cents per piece, according to experts. This tactic, in effect, has replaced the doorbell-ringing of local political committee members. Many politicians believe that in 1982, Lewis E. Lehrman, who was a wealthy newcomer to elective politics, nearly defeated Mario Cuomo in the governor's race on the strength of a vast mailing campaign with as many as a half dozen pieces going into a single household. ''We took a lesson from Lehrman,'' said Mr. Mandelker of the Koch campaign, which used for the first time in 1985 a costly storefront and field operation, as well as direct mail, to secure the votes of people thought likely to prefer Mr. Koch. One way such voters were identified was through months of phone calls, with each phone requiring a deposit of about $500 to insure that there would be no unpaid campaign telephone bills, once a serious problem for telephone companies. Lehrman Campaign Cited Mr. Cuomo has often cited the Lehrman campaign as a rationale for his large-scale raising and spending of money - $12 million taken in since he defeated Mayor Koch in the Democratic primary in September 1982. William Stern, Mr. Cuomo's campaign treasurer at the time, told the commission last week that on primary night, with the victory in hand, former Koch supporters began to arrive at Cuomo headquarters. ''As we were going toward the stage, I was going to the stage with the Governor, people were giving me checks, people were giving me money on my way to the stage, saying, 'I have been looking for you for weeks, where have you been?' '' Mr. Stern recalled. Two Brooklyn Democratic Congressmen, Stephen Solarz and Charles Schumer, have run virtually unopposed every two years but nevertheless maintain substantial campaign treasuries. As of last Dec. 31, Mr. Solarz had $880,998 and Mr. Schumer $518,432. Their stated reason for these war chests is that Brooklyn is likely to lose one Congressional seat after the 1990 census, so the two Representatives may have to run against each other or seek another office if their districts are merged. Lieut. Gov. Stan Lundine, who normally would count on Governor Cuomo's coattails to win an election, raised $1.2 million with the help of the Cuomo financial experts in 1986 because of the threat of a Democratic primary challenge by a wealthy businessman, Abraham Hirschfeld. Meanwhile, the Cuomo camp staved off the primary by successfully challenging Mr. Hirschfeld's nominating petitions. Mark Green, the underfinanced and unsuccesful Democratic candidate against Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato in 1986, summed up the prevailing view of politicians about campaign funds. ''Candidates look at money the way Mark Twain regarded bourbon,'' Mr. Green said. ''Too much is never enough.''

426-> OVERPOWERING THE SCENT MARKET
EVERY NIGHT WHEN CARL SCHAAB RETURNS FROM WORK to his New Jersey home, his wife gives him a kiss - and a sniff. If her husband smells as though he has been romping with several women, each wearing a different fragrance, then all is well. Wanda Schaab can be sure he spent the day at work. For Carl Schaab is in the perfume business, sort of. He is a project manager at the laboratory at Webcraft Technologies Inc. in North Brunswick, N.J., which makes the colorful slurries that get coated on special paper that gets inserted in millions of magazines so that certain pages smell like beautiful women are supposed to smell (according to the perfume companies) so that other women, perhaps not quite so beautiful, will want to spend a lot of their money to smell like that, too. Such fragrance strips, bearing those almost invisible bands of chemicals, have revolutionized the global fragrance industry in recent years. They have inspired thousands of pages of lucrative new advertising in magazines and attracted millions of newly stimulated customers to dozens of new and established fragrances. But this intrusive marketing ploy has, simultaneously, revolted a few million other souls who don't want the pages of their magazines smelling like the back of someone's ear. Fragrance strips, sometimes known as scent strips, are just a decade old, but they have already created a $40 million a year business and breathed new life into the $4 billion a year American fragrance industry. Meanwhile, the technology is being applied outside the perfume field. Pages are being impregnated with smells designed to drive readers crazy for vanilla, liquor, even the stately Rolls-Royce. Still to come: food scents such as popcorn and lasagna. The fragrance strips are really a descendant of the scratch-and-sniff strips that appeared in children's books in years past and were used to promote deodorants and shampoos. But women, it seems, do not like scratching, and the high-fashion purveyors of perfumes wanted to separate their products as far as possible from the likes of shampoos and deodorants. Two senses are touched by fragrance strips - sight and smell. A reader turning a page can see a gorgeous woman dreaming of who knows what delicious things and, by simply lifting a flap of paper, can sample the fresh scent of spring flowers or something musky, exotic, maybe a little sexy. This might just prompt many women - and some harried men too busy for shopping - to fill out the scented envelope attached to the page and order up a bottle or two or three with their credit cards. The potential is enormous in a nation that is both the world's largest fragrance market and the world's largest direct-mail market. The fragrance strips play on two thoroughly modern, very American traits: the desire to smell good and the compulsion to save time. ''We haven't even begun to touch the potential yet,'' said George F. Lane, vice president of Webcraft's fragrance and cosmetic division, which has turned out hundreds of millions of fragrance strips. His competitors include Arcade Inc. of Chattanooga, Tenn., and 3M, the St. Paul, Minn., manufacturer of Scotch tape and Post-it note pads. Like so many of mankind's truly pioneering inventions, the ability to make magazine pages redolent was an accidental byproduct of a search for something else. Back in the 1940's Barrett Green, a research chemist for the NCR Corporation, was trying to find a way to prevent purple fingers, the stains that remained after changing his company's cash register tapes. His new process, which produced tiny capsules of ink safely sealed in chemical bubbles, eventually led to carbonless paper. About 25 years ago 3M and NCR, working independently, developed a new microencapsulation process that inspired scratch-and-sniff strips and, ultimately, fragrance strips. This time around, the microscopic pimples contained not ink but scent. The potential for the fragrance industry did not become apparent until the early 1980's when a Beverly Hills boutique named Giorgio sought to introduce its own perfume using strips. Inserted in several magazines and attached to envelopes, the strips ignited $2.5 million in sales the first year, a figure that has since risen to more than $100 million. In days of old, perfume was sold mainly at department stores. And just as movie theaters always took customers' tickets at the door nearest the savory precincts of the popcorn machine, perfume companies and department stores placed their fragrance counters on the first floor for maximum exposure to strollers. There they stationed saleswomen who would lure the customer to the counter where she might be persuaded to dab a drop or two on her skin. Only with the interaction of the perfume with the chemicals of her body could a customer determine whether the perfume was right for her. Some companies offered trial vials, but they were expensive. Next came tiny ink blotters impregnated with the fragrance and mailed along with the store's monthly bills. But in the past five years Giorgio's success, a stagnating fragrance market and increasingly fickle customers with declining brand loyalties convinced perfume companies and magazines that the strips carried the irresistible smell of success. For the fragrance companies, the publications provide a relatively inexpensive way of getting a sample scent into the hands of millions of precisely targeted women who might rarely visit stores but who regularly wander through such magazines as Vogue, Mademoiselle, Glamour and Elle. For magazines, the fragrance strip inserts offer a lucrative opportunity for revenue. The magazines charge close to a full-page rate for running an advertiser's preprinted half-page insert. The magazines also insist that the advertiser take out an additional full-page backup ad on the premise that no other advertiser would buy a page half-obscured by the fragrance insert. The strips come in a variety of shapes. Some look like bottles or boxes. Some have pullout tabs, rip-back leaves, turned-down corners, anything to be different and prompt customer curiosity and sales. The same high-speed presses that print the inserts and add the perfumed strips can also die-cut the paper so that removing the top of a bottle in the printed ad also releases the scent. Some inserts even include ruboff makeup samples. Although the idea is to get the customer to buy the product anywhere it's sold, most fragrance strips also have an attached order form. This has the advantages of prompting an immediate sale plus creating a computerized data bank of that fragrance's customers and their addresses for future study and solicitation. Fragrance strips are also included in catalogues for specific department stores, which already know from their credit card applications which customers are the most affluent and thus the most likely to buy expensive fragrances. Strips are also included in mailings for some direct-mail houses offering a variety of products. Those companies keep close track of which fragrances prompt the most sales. Since more than half the after-shave lotion and men's cologne is bought by women, even men's fragrances have begun running fragrance strips in women's magazines. ''Right now,'' said Art Spiro, vice president of marketing for Christian Dior Perfumes Inc., ''fragrance strips are still the economical, effective way to get sample fragrances in the hands of large numbers of carefully chosen customers quickly.'' In the fall of 1986 Dior launched its Poison perfume through fragrance strips. ''We were very, very pleased,'' Spiro said. ''The latter part of the year we had to hold up a lot of orders because we ran out of the product.'' All of which is good news, of course, for companies like Webcraft, one of the largest producers of fragrance strips. Once a subsidiary of the Beatrice Company, Webcraft was taken private in a leveraged buyout of more than $200 million in late 1986. The company has more than 2,000 employees in 12 states and annual sales in excess of $200 million. Besides fragrance strips, Webcraft's presses churn out nonstop streams of lottery tickets for Michigan, California and Spain, scratch-off game cards for fast-food restaurants and pre-addressed envelopes full of coupons, literature and computer-personalized letters (''We know, Mr. Jones, that you recognize a good deal when you see one'') for all kinds of retailers in the growing direct-mail marketplace. In 1986 more than 55 billion pieces of mail produced $50 billion in sales. Fifty-one percent of all adult Americans - 56 percent of the women and 45 percent of the men - shopped by mail at some time that year. WITH A NEW PRODUCT and the client's ad format in hand, Webcraft's chemists set about making a fragrance strip magazine insert. In the laboratory, the fragrance oil, which can have from one to 200 different ingredients, is combined with a polymer to create a special slurry inside huge stainless steel vats. The process is delicate since each perfume contains its own distinct chemical personality -the industry speaks of a fragrance's ''high notes'' and ''low notes'' - that must be carefully preserved. In the slurry, microscopic droplets of the fragrance are coated with the polymer, which seals in the scent. The tiny bubbles are then laid down on strips by the printing presses. There are about a quarter-million droplets on the average five-and-a-half-inch by one-half-inch strip. The goal is to have 100,000 of the bubbles break on what is called ''the initial burst'' while the others provide fragrance for three or four later rubs on the wrist. In 1987, Webcraft produced more than 500 million of these strips for American and foreign markets. For much of the year, the company has six presses devoted full time to producing fragrance strip inserts 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Giant rolls of special paper begin unrolling at one end of the high-speed presses. In a matter of seconds the paper is printed, twisted, glued, folded, looped, glued again, coated with the slurry, sealed and spit out the other end. The boxes of inserts are then shipped to the bindery for insertion into the magazine. ''Frankly,'' said Nancy LeWinter, advertising manager for Vogue, ''we predicted last year that fragrance strips would decline. But 1988 is going to be quite a strong year, with many new introductions.'' The demand is such, she added, that the magazine could run 10 fragrance strips in each issue. Vogue could. But Vogue doesn't. Like many magazines, it has received numerous complaints from readers who don't like to pick up reading material and find them-selves assaulted by a range of smells. So Vogue has an informal limit of three an issue. Even three fragrance strips is too many for some noses -and for some fragrance companies, as well. ''Like any good idea,'' said Dior's Spiro, ''a good idea like fragrance strips doesn't stay exclusive very long. And a lot of people feel that enough is enough already; their magazine smells funny.'' Chanel will not advertise in a magazine issue unless it is the only fragrance strip. ''It's not as effective now as it was in prior years,'' said Steven V. Caputo, Chanel's executive director of marketing services. ''We don't like scents competing with ours.'' Chanel now places most of its 10 million yearly fragrance strips in urban magazines in Chanel's top markets, including Chicago, Los Angeles, Washington, Dallas and New York. Fragrance advertisers are finding new uses for the strips these days; it's called cross-sampling. A woman buying stockings may find a fragrance strip tucked into the package or one hanging with her new dress. Armani has attached a men's fragrance strip to its men's suits. One untapped area is mass market fragrances, the kinds available in drugstores. ''We haven't even begun to touch that one yet,'' said Webcraft's George Lane. Some ad executives have even suggested that in-flight magazines and airline ticket jackets might be good fragrance strip carriers, putting them in the laps and pockets of millions more. But some dramatic scent strip action is taking place beyond the world of perfume. Gourmet magazine has advertised itself with a chocolate fragrance strip. A recent mailer for Golf Magazine had a picture of a golf ball on bright green grass; peel off the ball and there's the unmistakable scent of fresh-cut grass. Last July's issue of Architectural Digest had a fragrance insert for Rolls-Royce with the headline, ''This, in essence, is Rolls-Royce.'' The essence was the aroma of fine leather. Wait, there's more. Pipe tobacco companies give away fragrance strips with the aromas of their various blends. Liquor companies have strips that smell like their liqueurs. Ralston Purina even has fragrance strips for its dog food, which may result in some inadvertently chewed newspapers. WHAT OF THE FUTURE? It is taking shape in Webcraft's library of food odors, all ready and awaiting a customer: popcorn, fruits, root beer, lasagna, chicken, a variety of spices, coffee, pizza. Webcraft dreams of magazine inserts that would have the aroma of fresh-baked bread, of packages of pasta that might bear a suggestive spaghetti fragrance strip. One of Schaab's favorites is a cedar fragrance strip. ''It's a very good cedar,'' he said. Maybe someone out there would like to make millions of cedar fragrance strips and sell them for making chests of drawers smell good to humans and bad to moths. With his nonstop exposure to odors at the office, Schaab himself buys only unscented personal products. He has still not used the after-shave one relative gave him at Christmas. But he does admit to one solitary scented indulgence. He took home a large bottle of an experimental fragrance and sprayed it on his artificial Christmas tree. Everyone agreed it was a perfect pine.

427-> GOLF; CRENSHAW POSTS 66 FOR ONE-SHOT VICTORY
Ben Crenshaw, whose superb iron shots today matched his always deadly putting, hit an excellent 8-iron of 150 yards just 18 feet short of the final hole. He rolled in the birdie putt to win the $1 million Doral Ryder Open by a single shot over Mark McCumber and Chip Beck. The Texan started today four shots behind the third-round leader, Bobby Wadkins. But Crenshaw birdied two of the difficult last four holes on the Doral Country Club's 6,939-yard Blue Monster course to shoot a six-under-par 66 without a bogey for a winning score of 14-under 274. After rolling in the putt, Crenshaw; his wife, Julie, and their five-month old first child, Katherine Vail, waited behind the 18th green as first McCumber and then Beck missed longer birdie putts on 18. Reluctant to Look ''I didn't want to look,'' said Crenshaw, who stood 5 feet off the green watching intently during both putts. McCumber, the Floridian who won the 1979 and 1985 Doral Opens, had a 68 for 275. Beck, who gained his first PGA Tour victory last week, scored 70 for 275. McCumber came up short on a 25-foot birdie try at 18 and then Beck rolled his 30-foot sidehill putt 8 inches under the cup at 18. ''I told my wife this morning that I needed 66 to win,'' Crenshaw said. ''And that's just what I did. The best part today was no bogeys.'' Wadkins, who was seeking his first victory in 14 years on the Tour, led each of the first three rounds. But he suffered a collapse and shot a 76. He needed a 69 to win. He finished tied for 15th at 281 after taking a double bogey at No. 4 and again at No. 10. At both holes, a shot went into the water. Narrow-Necked Fairway The 425-yard 18th at Doral is a par-4 with water down two-thirds of its left side and around the left of the green. There are huge trees along the right of the dog-leg-left fairway, which is quite narrow at the neck. Crenshaw, who was tied for the lead teeing off with driver at 18, sent the ball right down the middle on the short grass. He was playing downwind; that hole is usually played into the prevailing wind. He hit the 8-iron that gave him reason to say later, ''I was proud of my iron shots today, particularly on those last four holes.'' ''That lake's got plenty of my golf balls over the years,'' Crenshaw said of the final hole. It grabbed one in the third round Saturday when Crenshaw drove into the water and took a double-bogey 6 for his second straight 69. He shot 70 on Thursday. Nicklaus Falls Short Crenshaw, who has one major victory to his credit with the 1984 Masters, achieved the 14th triumph of his 16-year PGA Tour career. With the $180,000 first prize, he increased his career earnings to $3,208,333, He is seventh on the career money list. Jack Nicklaus, who had a chance to become the first man to win $5 million on the PGA Tour, fell about $16,000 short when he shot 75 for 283 and a tie for 24th. Playing in third place for most of the tournament, Nicklaus needed to finish 11th or better to reach $5 million Ray Floyd, playing with Crenshaw, chipped into the hole for a birdie at the 16th and finished with 68 to take fourth place at 276. John Mahaffey, who sank a 30-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole, finished in a tie with Larry Nelson and Joey Sindelar at 277. The northwest wind that brought in rain during the late morning and softened the greens quite a bit, was behind the golfers on those last four crucial holes: the par-3 15th at 174 yards followed by three par 4's at 360, 406 and 425 yards. Crenshaw hit a 7-iron tee shot at 15 and rolled in a 14-footer for birdie 2 there. Then he hit a 9-iron just 10 feet from the cup at the 16th but missed the 10-footer. An 8-iron into the 17th green left him 8 feet and he lipped out the putt. ''I wanted to make birdie in the worst way on 18,'' Crenshaw said. He did it and won. KING WINS KEMPER PRINCEVILLE, Hawaii, March 6 (AP) - Betsy King shot a final-round three-under-par 69 and took advantage of Beth Daniel's bogey on the 18th hole for a one-stroke victory today in the Kemper Open. Daniel led King by a stroke going into the 18th hole, but bogeyed after putting her approach shot in the water. King two-putted from 40 feet for a birdie. King finished with a 72-hole total of 280, eight under par on the Mirage Princeville Ocean and Lake course on the island of Kauai. Daniel, who had held the lead since the second round, shot a 73 and finished at 281. Tammi Green hit a 3-foot birdie putt on the 18th to cap a 68 and finish at 282. MOODY SETS MARK INDIAN WELLS, Calif., March 6 (AP) - Orville Moody birdied six of the last eight holes today to win the Vintage Invitational with a nine-under-par 63 that gave him the lowest total ever in a four-round PGA Seniors tournament. Moody finished at 25-under 263. His final round also set a Vintage tournament record and a course record at the Vintage Club's Mountain Course. Using an unconventional, 50-inch putter, Moody started the final round three shots ahead of Al Geiberger, an Indians Wells resident. Geiberger, who shot a final-round 71, and Harold Henning, who shot 64, tied for second at 14-under 274, a distant 11 shots back of Moody.

428-> Latest Study Disputes Link Of Breast Cancer to Alcohol
A new study of 7,000 women has found no association between alcohol consumption and breast cancer, researchers reported today. The new finding stands in sharp contrast to one last year that linked as little as a few drinks a week to an increased risk of breast cancer and led to some experts to encourage women to curb their drinking. The study, discussed at a seminar for science writers held here by the American Cancer Society, involved 3,000 women newly diagnosed with breast cancer and 3,000 who did not have cancer. The women were carefully questioned about their medical histories, medical care and alcohol consumption. The cancer patients were selected from tumor registries and the women without cancer were chosen by random telephone calls to households near those of the women with cancer. Too Soon for Advice ''We found no increased risk of breast cancer with alcohol use,'' said Dr. Susan Chu of the Federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, who directed the study. She also noted that scientists have not discovered a biological mechanism by which alcohol might affect the breast tissue to produce malignancy. She said the contradictory findings of the studies on breast cancer and alcohol suggest that it is too soon to make any recommendations about drinking. ''If we make too many recommendations, the danger is that people will stop taking us seriously,'' she said. Dr. Harmon Eyre, the president of the American Cancer Society and a cancer researcher at the University of Utah, said Dr. Chu's study was ''very well done'' and that it leads him to conclude that ''we still don't know whether alcohol causes breast cancer.'' The cancer society officially recommends that women drink moderately if they choose to drink, and has never said that they should stop drinking entirely. But, Dr. Eyre said, the message has gotten out that drinking causes breast cancer. Drinking, Cancer and Age ''My perception is that American women are frightened and worried,'' he said. But he said that ''data supporting an association'' between drinking and breast cancer ''are very weak.'' ''And if it is a factor it is a weak factor,'' he added. With Dr. Chu's study, he said, ''women can breathe a little easier.'' Another study, conducted by Dr. Robert Hoover of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md., and published last year showed a link between drinking, breast cancer and age. It concluded that women increased their risk of developing breast cancer if they drank moderately before they were 30 years old; after 30, drinking had no effect on breast cancer risk. ''There is a major uncertainly here,'' said Dr. Walter Willett of the Harvard University School of Public Health. Dr. Willett and his associates conducted one of the large studies that did find increased breast cancer risk in women who drank. He said he was planning to investigate whether there is a relationship between breast cancer, alcohol and age. Earlier Studies Suggest Link In a telephone interview, Dr. Hoover said he agreed with Dr. Chu that it was ''too early to make public health recommendations'' on breast cancer and alcohol. ''In terms of risks that we can identify in human populations, the alcohol risk is right at the border,'' Dr. Hoover said. Nevertheless, earlier studies have linked even moderate alcohol consumption with breast cancer. In May, The New England Journal of Medicine published reports of two large studies, one conducted by Dr. Willett. In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Saxon Graham of the State University of New York at Buffalo wrote that ''women at especially high risk of breast cancer'' should ''curtail their alcohol consumption.'' Dr. Willett and his colleagues questioned 89,538 nurses and found that those who drank one to two drinks a day increased their chance of developing breast cancer from about 7 percent to about 11 percent. The other study, by Arthur Schatzkin and his colleagues at the National Cancer Institute, involved data from a national survey of 7,188 women. The researchers found that as few as three drinks a week raised breast cancer risk by 50 to 100 percent. By way of comparison, Dr. Hoover said, smoking increases the risk of lung cancer 1,000 fold.

429-> Navy Limits Role of Workers In Washington State's Vote
Republican and Democratic leaders are protesting a decision by the Navy to bar civilian shipyard employees from participating in the state's Presidential caucuses Tuesday. The Navy order allows workers at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard to attend caucuses but prohibits them from discussing candidates. Naval spokesmen here cited a provision of the Federal Hatch Act that forbids Government workers from ''addressing'' a party gathering ''in support of or in opposition to a partisan candidate for public office.'' At the Pentagon, a spokesman said officials were unaware of the action.

431-> Gore Is Asking New Yorkers To Be Kind to an Underdog
Senator Albert Gore Jr. is citing his underdog status as a virtual badge of honor in speeches across New York. He says, ''New York City and New York State have always been kind to underdogs, and I'm the underdog in this race.'' , What the 40-year-old Tennesseean seeks over the next 11 days before the New York primary on April 19 is to exploit his self-proclaimed underdog status to gather the support of centrist and conservative Democrats who remain loyal to the party but are nonetheless concerned about the policies expressed by the front-runners, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts and the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Citing the overwhelming defeats of Democratic Presidential candidates in recent elections and saying the party is out of touch with the American people, Mr. Gore told the New York State Democratic Committee yesterday, ''This business of just marching off the cliff like lemmings is ridiculous.'' Seeking to emerge as the alternative to the front-runners, Mr. Gore has devised a somewhat haphazard strategy that has stirred the anger of not only Mr. Dukakis and Mr. Jackson but also Governor Cuomo. The Tennesseean has decided, in effect, to break some china and accuse Mr. Dukakis and Mr. Jackson of inexperience, naivete and foreign policy views that are anathema to most Democratic voters. $1 Million TV Campaign ''The problem Gore has in New York is getting known - people just don't know anything about him,'' said David Garth, the media adviser who is one of his key strategists in New York. ''The question is to get on the tube. There is a very strong vote out there for a bright intelligent young guy with a moderate voting record that would go for him.'' Mr. Garth, who has begun a $1 million television campaign for Mr. Gore, said it was ''ludicrous'' that Mr. Cuomo ''had come down from the mountaintop to give Gore a little kick in the head'' by saying the 40-year-old Senator was waging a negative campaign. ''Gore says Dukakis is naive and Jackson is inexperienced - that's a negative campaign?'' Mr. Garth asked. ''What's the idea? Make nice in New York, don't test anybody and see what happens in the fall? It's embarrasing.'' Former Lieut. Gov. Alfred DelBello, a Gore supporter, said the Senator needed a substantial turnout among centrist and conservative voters. Some Liberal Views On the other hand, Mr. Gore's campaign chairman, Fred Martin, indicated that the Senator would stress his liberal views on most social and domestic issues while seeking to separate himself from his rivals on foreign policy and national security issues, on which he is more conservative. The campaign, aides said, will fight efforts to depict Mr. Gore as an old-line Southern conservative Democrat in contrast to Mr. Jackson and Mr. Dukakis. Mr. Gore has been accused of pandering to Jewish voters by tacitly supporting Israel's Prime Minister. Yitzhak Shamir, in rejecting the latest White House peace proposal, and he implied that Governor Dukakis's general refusal to criticize Mr. Jackson was patronizing to Mr. Jackson and a form of racism. Mr. Gore's television strategy seems, at the moment, to be to gain free time on news programs by attacking his rivals, while his paid ads are intended to introduce the Senator to New York voters. #3d in Wisconsin The ads center on his background as a Vietnam veteran ''who has been a leader in the fight for arms control, a Harvard graduate who supported the first comprehensive bill to help the homeless and has built a 12-year record of protecting senior citizens.'' The ads also cite Mr. Gore's civil rights record, his sponsorship of environmental measures, his ''strong and consistent'' support of Israel and his work on health care legislation. Mr. Gore, who finished third in Tuesday's Wisconsin primary and has failed to stir large numbers of voters in states like Michigan, Illinois and Connecticticut, is turning New York into a virtual make-or-break state for him. A powerful showing in New York, and he plans to campaign heavily upstate, would prolong the three-way Democratic contest into the final round of contests in states like California, New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania. A poor showing could end the Gore campaign. But Mr. Gore faces financial challenges in his New York campaign. His campaign debt is estimated by aides at about $1.5 million, and another $50,000 loan is ''being processed,'' according to a press aide, Mike Kopp. ''If we can get the money, we can turn it around,'' Mr. Garth said the other day. ''He has the potential to do better in New York than anyone thinks. He's the kind of candidate New York likes, and he's more in keeping with the Democratic Party, but not the Democratic Party that that usually votes in the primary. We've got to expand that.''

434-> BUSINESS PEOPLE; New Head Sees Growth At Minnesota Exchange
The Minneapolis Grain Exchange, a regional cash and futures commodities market, has named James H. Lindau president and plans to embark on a period of growth. Mr. Lindau, 54, spent 23 years with the Pillsbury Company and was also mayor of Bloomington, a Minneapolis suburb, for 11 years. The Minneapolis exchange is one of three major wheat exchanges, the others being in Chicago and Kansas City, Mo. It has a futures contract and an options contract for spring wheat and a big cash trade in hard red winter wheat. It has none of the exotic trading instruments that mark the exchanges in Chicago and elsewhere. ''In this city we've got Cargill, Pillsbury, General Mills and Multifoods,'' Mr. Lindau said. ''So we should be bigger than we are. My challenge will be to help members find ways to grow.'' He rules nothing out. ''We have not said no to anything,'' Mr. Lindau said. ''We don't believe in developing a contract just because we think it's a good idea. But if there is demand, we will be part of it.'' Mr. Lindau takes over on June 6 from Robert Martin, who has been interim president. He filled in after Paul A. Tattersall resigned several months ago. The post is a full-time paid position, but the exchange declined to disclose the salary. Mr. Lindau, a Republican, was a candidate for governor of Minnesota in 1986 and was mayor of Bloomington until January. He said he had lost a re-election bid by 100 votes after he threw his support behind development in Bloomington of a ''megamall,'' the largest shopping center in the state. ''The city has grown so fast it walks a fine line between a village and a city,'' he said. ''Major changes are always somewhat controversial.'' He added: ''I've had enough'' of politics. ''I'm going back to work.'' Mr. Lindau owns two Burger King franchises, which are operated by his son, Jim Jr., 30. At Pillsbury, which owns Burger King, Mr. Lindau was a vice president responsible for international commodity trading. He recalls working out Pillsbury's first direct cash grain sale to the Soviet Union in 1980. He is a graduate of Grinnell College in Iowa and was an Air Force pilot. He worked for the Aero division of Honeywell Inc. before joining Pillsbury in 1960.

435-> How Much Does Bankruptcy Cost?
For Texaco, Inc., the answer could be $50 million. Texaco's bankruptcy filing was a catalogue of superlatives: the nation's third-largest oil company filed the country's biggest bankruptcy case to protect itself from the legal system's largest damage award: $10.53 billion to Pennzoil. So it may not come as a total surprise that the fee requests in the case are adding their own impressive statistics. This month Bankruptcy Judge Howard Schwartzberg is reviewing applications by 144 law, investment banking and accounting firms who have asked for $50,556,000 for tens of thousands of hours of work that they say Texaco urgently needed to get through its ordeal. With the exception of a $10 million request for 19 law firms representing individual shareholders, legal insiders expect Judge Schwartzberg to approve most of the requests without controversy. ''I'm not going to tell you that $50 million is not a lot of money,'' said Harold Jones, the Federal bankruptcy trustee who supervised the Texaco case. ''But I don't think the fees were in any way shape or form out of line.'' Following are law firms that asked for more than $1 million in fees. $ Fees Expenses 19 law firms Counsel to individual shareholders $10,594,058.75* $ 153,724.78 Weil, Gotshal & Manges Counsel to Texaco 7,113,133.75 1,184,982.71 Cravath, Swaine & Moore Special counsel to Texaco 4,039,627.00 594,741.00 Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays & Handler Special counsel to Texaco 2,564,168.00 375,458.69 Duker & Barrett Special counsel to Texaco 1,763,318.90 66,731.38 Kramer, Levin, Nessen, Kamin & Frankel Counsel to committee of unsecured creditors 1,667,732.45 384,704.47 Keck, Mahin & Cate Counsel to the committee of shareholders 1,543,479.90d 262,457.79 * In an agreement with Texaco, the fees would be capped at $10 million. d Firm later reduced this amount by 20 percent after judge said he usually rejects bonus payments, which the firm had added to its hourly rate.

436-> Dry Spell Is Called a Threat to Farms
Farms across the middle of the country must have rain soon or a fierce drought that is scorching fields could become a national disaster, Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng told lawmakers today. ''I guess the best thing for us to do is pray for rain,'' Mr. Lyng told the Senate Agriculture Committee. Mr. Lyng said his department was already providing drought aid, and he agreed with lawmakers that Congressional action might be necessary. But he told the panel, which is considering legislation to assist drought-striken farmers, that it was too soon to assess the full effects of the drought. ''It is still a little bit soon to say we have a general disaster nationwide, but the potential is there,'' Mr. Lyng said. ''It is still only mid-June and July weather is more important.'' Agricultural officials say crops over much of the Corn Belt and the South are surviving on moisture stored in soils and that a good dousing once a week would be enough to restore the crops. But some wheat fields in the North Central states have been hit too hard to expect much of a crop. Last week the department revised its forecast for the winter wheat harvest downward to 1.57 billion bushels. That was 3 percent, or 50 million bushels, below its forecast a month earlier. The department said that while the new figure was still slightly ahead of last year's winter wheat harvest, inadequate moisture and disease had hurt the crop in the central and northern Great Plains in May. Rising Crop Prices The drought is already driving up crop prices as wheat fields turn brown. That, in turn, threatens to shrink income-support payments the Government makes to farmers. Some farmers are thus faced with the prospect of having no crop they can take to market at the same time that their Federal payments are drying up. ''The emergency is upon us,'' Senator John Melcher, Democrat of Montana, said. ''The disaster is here.'' ''If the skies open up, it looks like we have lost 40 percent to 50 percent of the crop,'' said Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota. One plan being discussed by lawmakers would guarantee minimum income-support payments to farmers. These amounts represent the difference between market prices and target prices that are set by Congress and adjusted each year by the Secretary of Agriculture. As market prices move up, the difference becomes smaller and smaller, and the farmers therefore receive less from the Government. The shrinking Government payments mean cost estimates for farm programs ''are moving downward in the hundreds of millions of dollars,'' said Ewen M. Wilson, Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for economics. Lawmakers are talking about recycling the savings and using them to increase farm incomes in drought areas.

437-> House Approves Plan by G.O.P. to Limit the Cost of Welfare
The House of Representatives today instructed its negotiators to limit the cost of revising the welfare laws to $2.8 billion over five years after being warned by Republicans that anything higher would jeopardize the chances of an overhaul this year. The House voted 227 to 168 to accept a Republican move to instruct lawmakers meeting with the Senate to draft a compromise bill to abandon the $7 billion cost on the version passed last December by the House for the lower ceiling adopted by the Senate in its version of the legislation. The Senate bill was passed last month. Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who is the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said that to get President Reagan's signature on a welfare compromise, ''obviously, the bill's cost will have to be closer to the Senate.'' 'Bottom Lines' But in unsuccessful arguments against the Republican's move, the chairman added, ''Now is not the time to issue ultimatums and bottom lines.'' The Senate and House have passed extensive bills to overhaul the welfare system, shifting its emphasis from cash benefits to employment and child-support payments. States would have to increase collections for child support and organize work, education and training programs for recipients. The major cost differences include open-ended Federal financing for employment programs in the House bill, while the Senate legislation limits funding and incentives in the House version for states to raise their cash benefits. Besides the cost instruction, the Republican motion tells House conferees to accept ''no impediments which would disallow work'' beyond those in the Senate legislation. The phrase appears to refer to House restrictions on workfare programs and a provision saying that welfare recipients would not be required to take jobs paying less than the prevailing local wage. 'The Outer Limit' Robert H. Michel, the Illinois Republican who is his party's leader in the House, said that $2.8 billion was ''the outer limit'' of what President Reagan and the nation would accept for welfare reform. He and other Republicans said that the defeat of their motion would jeopardize welfare reform this year. The Democrats urged flexibility and expressed confidence that the negotiators could develop a compromise bill. Representative Thomas J. Downey, the Long Island Democrat who is the chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee that handled the House legislation, said its cost might ''come down dramatically because we'd like to see a Presidential signature.''

440-> Company News; Lipton Acquisition Blocked by Court
R.C. Bigelow Inc. said that a Federal appeals court injunction on Tuesday had blocked Thomas J. Lipton Inc. of Englewood Cliffs., N.J., from acquiring Celestial Seasonings Inc., pending Bigelow's appeal of the dismissal of its challenge to the acquisition. In reversing a United States District Court ruling and granting a stay, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New York, found that Bigelow has a substantial chance of prevailing on the merits of its appeal, Bigelow said in a news release. Bigelow, a family-owned maker of herbal teas, has contended the combination of Lipton's 32 percent market share with Celestial's 52 percent share would constitute an effective monopoly specifically intended to eliminate competition. Norwalk-based Bigelow has a 13 percent share of the United States herbal tea market.

441-> For Le Pen, France Is Proving Fickle
As if on some wild roller coaster, Jean-Marie Le Pen's anti-immigrant National Front has in the space of six weeks been lifted to the heights of French politics and then, in legislative elections on Sunday, plunged to the bottom. But if the National Front is down, it is not yet out. On April 24, Mr. Le Pen persuaded 4.4 million voters, 14.4 percent of those casting ballots in the first round of a presidential election, to send a message of anger and alienation to the nation's political establishment. Profiting from a realignment of politics that has loosened many loyalties, Mr. Le Pen assembled a coalition exasperated with stubbornly high levels of unemployment and inclined to accept his argument that most of France's problems are the fault of immigrants. Mr. Le Pen's political eruption left the traditional French right torn between an impulse to repudiate his message and a desire to recapture his electorate, and it helped make possible the re-election on May 8 of President Francois Mitterrand, a Socialist. Could Lose All 32 Seats On Sunday, Mr. Le Pen was cut down in the first round of parliamentary balloting. His party fell back to 9.8 percent of the popular vote and looks as if it may lose all of its 32 seats in the 577-member National Assembly in the runoff balloting next Sunday. In Marseilles, where he finished second to a Socialist candidate, Mr. Le Pen complained about an ''underhanded'' first-past-the-post electoral law that discriminates against small parties. ''I continue to think that it is necessary that there should be deputies of the National Front to express the sentiments of the French who have given them confidence,'' he said. Mr. Le Pen criticized a majority-vote system that was designed by his rightist foes to tame the National Front. In 1986, when a proportional voting system was used, his party took 35 National Assembly seats with 9.7 percent of the vote. The same results this time will at most permit one or two National Front candidates to salvage their seats on Sunday. 'The Civilized Right' In the Marseilles area, Mr. Le Pen and Jean-Claude Gaudin, the local leader of the traditional right, may quietly work out a deal that will allow National Front candidates to run alone on Sunday against Socialists in nine constituencies. In return, the National Front would withdraw its candidates in other constituencies to give Mr. Gaudin's supporters a better chance. But other rightist leaders will be able to argue with some credibility that Marseilles is a special case and that, at the national level, no under-the-table arrangements are being struck with the National Front. For the moment, this should ease one of the major sources of tension at the heart of what is sometimes called ''the civilized right.'' Emmanuel Todd, a political analyst, said that the National Front ''is crumbling and will disappear.'' ''It will take a while for the political elites to get it under control,'' Mr. Todd said. ''But already one can see that the National Front is withdrawing into its bastion of Marseilles. The vote that Le Pen got in Alsace was not repeated this time.'' Comeback Called Possible Others argue that the National Front could still stage a comeback in cantonal elections scheduled for the autumn and in municipal elections next March. A further opportunity will arise in the elections to the European Parliament next year. Yet without seats in the National Assembly, the National Front will have difficulty making its voice heard from Paris, where the national press and television are concentrated. If he is beaten on Sunday in Marseilles, Mr. Le Pen will have to exploit the meager opportunities to be heard that are offered by membership of a district council in Paris, which would be his sole elected position. But a senior adviser to President Mitterrand said that the issues popularized by Mr. Le Pen will still mobilize ''between 3 percent and 12 percent of the electorate.'' ''If the right wants to eliminate Le Pen it will have to eat up his space,'' said the adviser, arguing that any attempt to use the National Front's arguments would sow fresh divisions in the rightist camp. Mainstream Right Bolstered Whatever the National Front's ultimate fortunes, its returns on Sunday have bolstered the morale of the mainstream right as it squares off with the Socialists for Sunday's vote. The traditional right had expected to be smothered in a Socialist landslide, but was agreeably surprised to find that it polled 37.6 percent of the popular vote to 37.5 percent for the Socialists. Even with the popular Mr. Mitterrand remaining aloof from their campaign, the Socialists are favored to win back the National Assembly majority they lost to the right in 1986. The balance of forces between the Socialists and the conservatives is almost exactly the same as it was after the first round of parliamentary balloting in 1981, when the Socialists went on to win a big majority.

442-> Dykstra Goes to Bat for Ojeda
When Lenny Dykstra batted in the first inning last night, he singled but the Mets didn't take advantage of it. When he batted in the second, he doubled and the Mets took a 2-0 lead. When he batted in the seventh, he tripled and the umpires took his bat. Dykstra, whose glove was not questioned when he made a run-saving diving catch in the first inning, grounded out using a different bat in the eighth inning, but by then the Mets had just about wrapped up a 5-0 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. The umpires did not take Bob Ojeda's bat. The Mets' pitcher doubled in the fourth inning and singled in the eighth for his first major league run batted in. More important, he gained his first victory since May 18, having struggled for four weeks with three losses and a no-decision. Cards' Slump Continues ''That was as important as last night,'' said Manager Dave Johnson, who the previous night called a 2-1 victory ''the largest in my career here.'' ''Bobby hadn't won for a while. He usually is pretty happy-go-lucky, but he's such an intense competitor that things were getting to him. He hasn't been happy.'' Whitey Herzog, the Cardinals' manager, wasn't happy. His team suffered its fifth consecutive defeat and fell eight and a half games behind the Mets, matching its largest deficit in three weeks. ''Maybe that's why he took the bat,'' Howard Johnson, the Mets' third baseman, said of Herzog. ''Maybe he's really teed off at losing.'' Herzog, who has done this sort of thing before, asked the umpires to confiscate Dykstra's bat after he led off the seventh by grounding a triple along the right-field line. He scored a moment later on Tim Teufel's sacrifice fly. 'I'm Suspicious' ''I'm suspicious,'' Herzog said afterward. ''I saw him hit the ball one-handed and hit it on the warning track. He did it in St. Louis, too. I know he's a strong little guy. I like the way he plays the game. He had a hell of a game tonight.'' But Herzog still asked for the bat. Twice last season and once this season he asked the umpires to take Howard Johnson's bats. X-rays revealed nothing but wood in them. ''No one on this team is corking their bats and never have,'' Howard Johnson said. ''It's ridiculous to do it over and over again. I have a lot of respect for Whitey, but if he keeps doing this . . . But I am glad he's doing it to somebody else besides me.'' With his three-hit performance last night, Dykstra has 17 hits in 38 times at bat in his last 10 games for a .447 average. ''I'm surprised they were checking that time,'' Dykstra said. ''If they want to check it, fine. But that's the bat I've been using the last month and a half. I'm going to get it back and it's all going to blow over.'' Dykstra will have the brown bat back for tonight's game if the X-ray machine shows no material that shouldn't be in it. Harry Wendelstedt, the chief of the umpiring crew, said he planned to give the bat to Ed Vargo, the umpires' supervisor, last night. The rules allow each manager to have one bat confiscated each game. Dave Johnson said he would ask for one of the Cardinals' bats tonight. ''That doesn't surprise me,'' Wendelstedt said. Dykstra wasn't the only Met hitter who hit, but he was the most productive. His two-run double in the second inning marked the first time in seven games that the Mets scored more than one run in an inning. It was Ojeda's first complete game since a two-hit shutout against Montreal on April 15. The Cardinals peppered him with nine hits, but only two of their runners reached third base. Actually, it was Tom Pagnozzi both times, in the second inning and in the ninth. In the second, with two out and the bases loaded, Vince Coleman grounded out. In the ninth, with two out and the bases loaded, Ozzie Smith grounded out. It was a fine effort by the left-hander, who had compiled a 5.56 earned run average in his previous four starts as his record sagged to 4-5. ''I pitched rather than threw,'' explained Ojeda, who had elbow surgery 13 months ago. ''It's like I have a new arm here and it has taken me a while to learn how to use it.'' ----Mets 8 for 11 in Series The Mets have won 8 of 11 games from St. Louis this season. . . . They went over the million mark in attendance last night. . . . Dave Magadan doubled home a run in the fifth. He is hitting .405 in his last 10 games. . . . Dykstra gave himself credit for making a significant play in the first inning when he made a diving catch of Tom Brunansky's fly ball with two out and a runner at second. ''That was one of the most important plays of the game,'' he said. ''Instead of them going up, 1-0, we were coming up with a chance to take the lead.''

443-> General Mills Net Up 52.1%
General Mills Inc., the large consumer food concern, yesterday reported a 52.1 percent increase in net income for its fourth quarter, which ended May 29. The company attributed the higher earnings to productivity savings, a lower tax rate and charges last year from discontinued operations. For the quarter, the Minneapolis-based company reported net income of $54.9 million, or 65 cents a share, compared with $36.1 million, or 41 cents a share, in the corresponding period last year. Sales for the quarter were up 5.7 percent, to $1.3 billion, from $1.23 billion in the 1987 quarter. For the fiscal year, General Mills' earnings climbed 30 percent, to a record $283.1 million, or $3.25 a share, from $222 million, or $2.50 a share, last year. Sales rose 10.2 percent, to $5.18 billion. The company said that sales in its consumer food division increased 7 percent for the quarter, while operating profits were down 11 percent. In its restaurant division, which includes the Red Lobster chain, sales increased 4.3 percent in the quarter, while operating profit fell 22.8 percent. General Mills recorded a $5 million loss in the fourth quarter of 1987 from discontinued operations and a $7.1 million profit from discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of this year. As part of its retreat from non-food businesses, the company recently sold its Talbots and Eddie Bauer retail stores.

445-> Even Decisions on Civil Rights Can Be Wrong; Amend the 1866 Act
To the Editor: Jack Greenberg (Op-Ed, May 18) and others see ''bad news'' in the action of the Supreme Court ordering reconsideration of the 1976 decision that the post-Civil War Civil Rights Act covers discrimination by private schools, employers and others. The Court's order is ''bad news'' simply because it opens the door to weakening the statutory prevention of invidious discrimination. It is not, however, as disastrous as a comparable decision on constitutional grounds would be, and action can be taken now to prevent the threatened weakening. Congress can be asked to amend the 1866 Civil Rights Act with a simple, one-sentence amendment, stating that the act bans the kinds of discrimination involved in the 1976 case and other kinds of invidious discrimination. The political climate of 1988 might make passage of an amendment easier. Even if the Court's majority in the pending case should narrow the scope of present law, it would have no effect on future actions covered by the amended statute. The pending case might even be declared moot. MICHAEL H. CARDOZO Washington, May 23, 1988

The General Motors Corporation's Delco Products division announced plans to build an 82,000-square-foot plant that would use high technology and new management techniques to make struts for small front-wheel-drive cars in this Dayton suburb. Production is scheduled to begin next year with 60 people, expanding to 150 by 1992, said a Delco spokesman, Charles W. Kronbach. The plant will be organized in flexible manufacturing cells with increased responsibilities for workers, instead of the traditional assembly line. Mr. Kronbach said the struts had already been accepted for use on G.M.'s new Saturn models and on Toyota Camrys to be built in Georgetown, Ky.

447-> FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; Corporations' Credit Quality Declined in the First Quarter
The credit quality of United States corporations declined in the first quarter, as did the volume of new bond issues, Moody's Investors Service reported yesterday. The drop reflected weakness in the banking, securities, retail and automotive sectors. Moody's said that 69 percent of the rating changes for the first quarter were downgradings. The rating agency also noted that the volume of downgraded debt surged during the quarter; it lowered the ratings on about $137 billion worth of securities, while upgrading only about $14 billion. Downgradings of General Motors Corporation and GM Acceptance Corporation debt in January accounted for $52 billion of the quarter's downgrading. For the quarter, special events - mergers, acquisitions and stock buybacks - accounted for 24 percent of company downgradings. In January, the debt rating of eight money center banking institutions were downgraded as a result of loan-quality deterioration, including loans in Latin America. The downgradings accounted for nearly $40 billion. Moody's reported a lessening in volume of new corporate debt for the first quarter. About $29 billion was issued, or roughly $2.2 billion per week. The weekly average in 1987 was $2.6 billion. Investment-grade bond issues rose slightly, to $1.93 billion a week, compared with an average of $1.8 billion in 1987.

448-> Washington Talk: Briefing; Paper Chase
As part of the investigation of the Pentagon, agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation searched last week for documents at the Space and Naval Systems Command and found them in the office of George Stone, director of communications acquisitions. He is one of those under investigation. The F.B.I. asked the Navy to make photocopies. ''No, we don't have the time - if you want copies, make them yourselves,'' a Navy officer told an agent, according to a Pentagon official. The Navy also had no copy paper. So the bureau agents returned to their headquarters for a box of paper, took it to the Navy copy room and went to Mr. Stone's office for the documents. By the time they returned to the copy room the box of copying paper had vanished. ''We've been very short of copy paper due to budget constraints,'' Cathy Partusch, a spokeswoman in the Navy public affairs office said after the incident. She said that while the Navy had not been officially told of the incident, she had learned that the F.B.I. ultimately copied the documents on paper supplied by the Navy.

450-> Company News; Volvo to Get 20% of Hertz Parent
The Volvo North American Corporation said today that it would pay $100 million in cash to the Ford Motor Company in exchange for a 20 percent interest in the parent company of the Hertz Corporation, the nation's largest rental car agency. Of the 160,000 cars that Hertz directly rents out in this country, more than half are Fords and fewer than 2 percent are Volvos. Hertz franchises rent out another 40,000 vehicles, and the company's overseas fleet numbers 200,000. Bjorn Ahlstrom, the president and chief executive of Volvo North American, said Hertz was mainly attractive as a good financial investment and, then, as a way to advertise its cars to a wider public. ''It is in an industry that is not entirely foreign to Volvo and I hope that, over time, it will mean substantially more exposure for our products,'' he said. ''But in the final analysis, that is for Hertz and for Hertz's customers to decide.'' Ford and Hertz management formed the Park Ridge Corporation in September as an instrument with which to acquire Hertz from the Allegis Corporation, now UAL Inc. In the buyout, Ford obtained 80 percent of the equity and the management received the remainder. The $1.3 billion acquisition was completed in December, with $520 million coming from Ford and the rest borrowed, Richard W. Judy, a spokesman for Ford, said. Ford has said from the beginning that it invested in Hertz to keep rivals out and preserve its strong relationship with the rental agency. It has also said it wants to reduce its equity in Park Ridge to less than 50 percent, using the money for acquisitions in financial services or high-technology businesses. Ford has cash reserves of about $10 billion. ''They bought in to keep Hertz out of the hands of Chrysler,'' said David Healy, an auto industry analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert, in New York. ''My feeling is that Ford will want to retain a working control of Hertz to continue influencing its purchase of cars. Together, Ford and Volvo should probably be able to kick out all the G.M. and Chrysler cars.'' Volvo North America is based in Rockleigh, N.J., and is a subsidiary of A.B. Volvo of Sweden. Its 1987 sales totaled $3.2 billion, compared with the parent company's worldwide revenues of $14 billion.

451-> County Lists Historic Sites
COUNTY EXECUTIVE Andrew P. O'Rourke issued proclamations Tuesday to 10 county residents and organizations, placing their properties on the first listing of the Westchester County Inventory of Historic Places. ''This is a great way to preserve Westchester's past, both for today and for Westchester's future,'' Mr. O'Rourke said. ''We hope that by designating a property as part of the inventory, a great deal of care will be taken so that it will be maintained.'' There are Federal registers of historic places and a number of localities have passed laws to help protect historic sites, but there has never been a countywide inventory of the historic places. ''Many communities are considering legislation to recognize architecturally and historically significant sites,'' said Karen Kennedy, the county's Historical Preservation Planner. ''But there is a gap in the middle between local efforts and the state and national registers. We have to expand the level of awareness of these places by having an intermediary level between the national, state and local.'' It Is a List, No More The county inventory is only a list and provides no legal restrictions on the development of the property, nor do the owners of these sites receive any monetary benefit from their inclusion.. The 101 historic sites in the county that are on the national and state registers were automatically placed on Westchester's inventory. But Ms. Kennedy estimated that only one-tenth of the eligible historic sites within the county are on the state or Federal list. Any county resident or organization can apply, but officials are relying upon the help of local historians to bring to their attention historic places not commonly known. Richard M. Lederer Jr., Village Historian of Scarsdale, has responded by requesting 36 application forms for Scarsdale sites. Three Scarsdale Sites on List Mr. Lederer has been compiling a list of historic places in the village for the last six years in an effort to get a local preservation ordinance passed. While waiting for that to happen he is using his research material to help the county inventory. ''I'm feeding the county my list of places alphabetically,'' Mr. Lederer said. ''So far, I've only gotten to the B's.'' Scarsdale accounts for three of the first 10 sites on the county inventory. One, the Angevine-Morris House, was built in 1768 and ''you can see the original timbers around the fireplace,'' Mr. Lederer said. Another, the Burgess House, was built in 1750 and had an addition placed on it in 1903 by Henry Bacon, better known as the architect of the Lincoln Memorial. The third site, the 100-foot-high Boniface water tower was constructed in 1929. According to local lore, the water tower was supposed to be placed next to the first pool in the village, which was built by J. P. Morgan for his mistress, Mrs. Devor-Webb. Mrs. Devor-Webb was so upset at the prospect of a water tower next door that she sued the village. The water tower was constructed where planned, but twice as much money was spent on the masonry of the tower than on the steel water tank inside it in order to placate Mrs. Devor-Webb. Other sites on the inventory include the Anawalk Friends Meeting House and Cemetery in Yorktown, built by the Quakers in 1831; the James House on the ground of the Phelps Memorial Hospital in North Tarrytown built in 1850; the Mount Zion Church and cemetery in Somers, constructed in 1794 as a Methodist meeting house; Shaker House in South Salem, built in 1795, and the Caramoor House Museum in Katonah, which was built in 1935. Bathing Pavilions Included But historic sites are not limited to buildings. The Mianus Road in Bedford, a one-mile piece of dirt road hand dug between 1880 and 1885, linked Miller Mill to the Mianus River. Rye Town Park is a 28-acre site incorporating 1909 Mediterranean Revival-style bathing pavilions and Neo-Classical colonnades. Both are included in the inventory. The criteria for being named to the county list are similar to those of the state register, in that the structure must be at least 50 years old and have been associated with an event or person ''significant to Westchester County's past,'' or possess ''high artistic value.'' But the county added a criterion not used by the state. ''We added a distinctive Westchester flavor to the criteria,'' said the County Historian, Susan C. Swanson. ''A property can be acknowledged if it's been concerned with the lives of social and ethnic groups that settled within the county.'' Ms. Swanson pointed out that there were 60 separate ethnic groups living in Westchester. Many of the old ethnic neighborhoods, such as the Ukrainian and Italian ones in Yonkers, ''are fast disappearing,'' Ms. Swanson said. ''But their architecture and churches are still there. The people who built those structures are now just a memory. What I'm interested in is the contribution that these groups made to Westchester, something they often don't recognize themselves.'' A Word on Old Neighborhoods Ms. Swanson said she believed acknowledging the architecture of such ethnic groups would reinforce community pride. ''All neighborhoods are beautiful, no matter how old or rundown,'' she said. ''If you stop to see the beauty of an old Orthodox church in your neighborhood, your kids might be less likely to spray graffiti all over it.'' The idea for the inventory harkens to 1979 when Ms. Kennedy started working for the county. But she credited Ms. Swanson with using her influence as County Historian to make the inventory a reality. Since the beginning of the year, the county has received 20 applications to join the inventory; the ones announced Tuesday were the first 10 to have been processed and accepted. Once an application is sent in, it is reviewed by Ms. Kennedy and Ms. Swanson before being passed to a 14-member committee, which includes the entire historic preservation advisory committee of the Department of Parks, Recreation and Conservation. If the committee approves the application, it is sent to the County Executive for his approval. To obtain an application form for the Inventory of Historic Places, contact the County Historian's office at 285-2638.

452-> COMPANY NEWS; Deal for Koppers Unit May Have Collapsed
Beazer P.L.C., which struck a deal last month to acquire the Koppers Company, is expected to announce, perhaps as soon as today, that a preliminary agreement to sell Koppers's chemical unit to a management-led group has fallen through, people familiar with the deal said yesterday. ''This deal looks like it's going into a crater,'' one person said. Under the original letter of intent, Beazer would have sold the division to the management group for about $660 million. The group planned to get part of its financing from the Sterling Group, a Houston-based investment bank run by Gordon A. Cain. Under the deal, the Sterling Group would keep a stake in the company, which was to be called the Koppers Chemical Company. A woman answering Mr. Cain's telephone said he was unable to comment. A spokesman for Koppers could not be reached for comment. According to people familiar with the deal, Brian Beazer, the chairman and chief executive of the company, met in Pittsburgh Wednesday with the members of the buyout group and discussed the problems with their financing. Mr. Beazer could not be reached for comment. The central problem centers on the potential environmental liabilities of the chemical division. During the hostile takeover, Koppers's officials had said that the liabilities could be very large and that Mr. Beazer's plans to sell the division could cause future problems. As part of the agreement for the leveraged buyout, according to one person familiar with the talks, BNS Inc., the company established to take over Koppers, would put more than $40 million in escrow to pay for the potential liabilities. But banks that were approached by the management group wanted more cash on hand to deal with the potential liability. This person said that, after being rejected by banks for the financing, Mr. Cain had asked Mr. Beazer to increase the amount in escrow to deal with the potential problems. Mr. Beazer declined to do so. Because of the difficulty in financing, Mr. Beazer has recently been expressing reservations about the likelihood that the deal would succeed, one person said. But Mr. Beazer had agreed to give the buyout group until Aug. 8 to close the deal. According to one person close to the deal, the only way that the problems could be resolved would be if bank financing were found or if Sterling increased its equity stake. Neither of those options is likely to happen, this person said, which led officials to believe the deal would be called off.

453-> Disputed Soviet Region Asks For Its Transfer to Armenia
Officials in the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh have called on the Soviet Parliament in Moscow to consider its transfer from Azerbaijan to Armenia, Soviet television reported today. Nagorno-Karabakh's governing council met on Tuesday as thousands demonstrated in the region's capital, Stepanakert. ''The deputies considered it necessary to appeal directly to the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. to consider attentively the petition of the Armenian Supreme Soviet about the transfer of Nagorno-Karabakh from Azerbaijan to Armenia,'' the report said. The Parliament of the Armenian Republic voted last week in favor of annexing the region, which has been part of Azerbaijan since 1923 although most of its residents are Armenian. But Azerbaijan's Parliament met two days later and ruled out ceding the region. Under the Soviet Constitution, border changes require the consent of all republics concerned.

454-> Dukakis Avoids Taking a Stand On No. 2 Post
Gov. Michael S. Dukakis danced around the issue of the Vice Presidency today, saying that the Rev. Jesse Jackson was under ''very serious'' consideration and that his lack of government experience did not disqualify him from the running. But the Massachusetts Governor went on to say that the process of choosing a running mate was ''just beginning,'' a judgment that was not reflected on Capitol Hill today, where the contest seemed at full heat. In the halls of Congress, the first round of requests for background information from the Dukakis campaign set off waves of speculation. There were three groups of people caught up in the speculation on Capitol Hill today: those who acknowledged receiving a request for background information, those who said flatly that they had not, and those who declined to comment. Not Seen as Clear First Cut Among those with an official ''no-comment'' position were some politicians widely considered to be very likely prospects, including Senator John Glenn of Ohio and Representative Tom Foley of Washington. For all the tea-leaf reading, a Dukakis campaign official said this was not a definitive first cut, and that requests for information would continue to go out in the days to come. Mr. Dukakis said at a news conference this afternoon, ''At this point, I cannot tell you exactly who has or who has not been asked.'' Mr. Dukakis's task has been complicated by growing pressure from supporters of Mr. Jackson, many of whom assert that their candidate deserves the No. 2 slot. Asked if Mr. Jackson met his primary criterion, and was thus capable of being a first-rate President, Mr. Dukakis replied, ''Jesse Jackson is under very serious consideration. Asked if Mr. Jackson's lack of experience in government was not a disqualification, Mr. Dukakis replied, ''I don't know that you have to have held public office, in fact, in order to be qualified for President.'' Jackson Acknowledges Contact Mr. Jackson acknowledged at a news conference in Los Angeles today that he was among those asked to furnish background and personal financial data to the Dukakis campaign. In response to questions, Mr. Jackson presented a lengthy case for his placement on the ticket, from geographical balance to foreign policy expertise. Still, Mr. Jackson said he had ''not yet made the decision'' on whether he wanted the job. Aside from Mr. Jackson, Senator Bob Graham of Florida acknowledged through a spokesman that he had been asked to furnish background information. But aides for others who are considered likely prospects said they had not yet received such a request, including Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Senator Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii, and Senator Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee. Mr. Bradley, one of the most talked-about potential running mates in recent weeks, reiterated his lack of interest in the job. ''It's just not in the cards,'' Mr. Bradley said, adding that his reasons for not wanting the No. 2 slot were the same reasons he chose not to run for the Presidency this year: ''It's not the right time.'' Mr. Dukakis, on the other hand, said at his news conference that Mr. Bradley had not expressed that lack of interest to him personally. Endorsement From Biden Governor Dukakis, who won enough delegates in the primary campaign to clinch the Democratic nomination but who has yet to be formally selected, today received an endorsement from a one-time opponent in the Presidential campaign, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. Aides for Mr. Biden, who is recuperating at his home in Delaware from surgery to remove aneurysms from his brain, said he told the Governor by telephone today that he would work for him on his return to the Senate and that he felt ''very confident that the Democrats will win back the White House and retain control of the Senate in November.''

455-> Convict Executed in Georgia
James Messer Jr. was executed in the electric chair tonight for beating and stabbing to death his 8-year-old niece when she fought his attempts to molest her. The 34-year-old convict was pronounced dead at 7:23 P.M., said a spokesman for the Department of Corrections, John Siler. Walter Zant, the warden, asked Mr. Messer if he had any final words, and the prisoner replied that he did not. Mr. Messer did ask for a prayer, and the prison chaplain, Nolan Lavelle, placed his hands on Mr. Messer's left forearm and recited a one-minute prayer. At the conclusion, Mr. Messer said, ''Amen.'' Demonstrations Outside Prison Outside the prison, 12 death penalty protesters sang, while about 20 people demonstrated in favor of the death penalty, including one man wearing a white Ku Klux Klan robe. The execution came just over an hour after the United States Supreme Court refused to halt it. Justices Thurgood Marshall and William J. Brennan dissented in a 7-to-2 vote. There was no immediate elaboration from the Court. The Supreme Court order followed a similar action today by the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles, which had been asked to commute Mr. Messer's death sentence to life in prison. The chairman, Wayne Snow, said the panel had concluded that ''there are insufficient grounds for further consideration'' of the commutation request. He said the board rejected a psychiatrist's testimony that Mr. Messer's ''explosive'' behavior may have been caused by brain damage. Mr. Messer was convicted of murdering of Rhonda Joan Tanner on Feb. 13, 1979. Prosecutors said he abducted her from her school in Cedartown, tried to molest her and then killed her when she fought him. He was the 13th person executed in Georgia's electric chair since the state resumed executions in 1983.

456-> Books of The Times; A Frustrated Hunter on the Trail of J.D. Salinger
In Search of J. D. Salinger By Ian Hamilton 222 pages. Random House. $17.95. Ian Hamilton ends his controversial and long-delayed book, ''In Search of J. D. Salinger,'' on an ever so faintly bitter note. He admits that he can hardly ''rejoice that, whatever happens, my name and J. D. Salinger's will be linked in perpetuity as those of litigants or foes'' over Mr. Hamilton's right to use in his study selected quotes from Mr. Salinger's unpublished correspondence. That right was finally forbidden him, after much legal skirmishing, by the Supreme Court's denial of his petition for certiorari on Oct. 5, 1987. Still, when he asks himself why he doesn't feel ''more victimized,'' he has to admit that when ''this whole thing began,'' there was more to it than ''mere literary whimsy.'' He continues: ''There was more to it than mere scholarship. Although it will seem ludicrous, perhaps, to hear me say so now, I think the sharpest spur was an infatuation, an infatuation that bowled me over at the age of seventeen and which it seems I never properly outgrew. Well, I've outgrown it now.'' This resolves, with something of a whimper, a drama that began for Mr. Hamilton as it did for many of us, when as an adolescent he read Mr. Salinger's novel ''The Catcher in the Rye,'' fell in love with it, found it to have possessed him, and desired to possess Mr. Salinger in return. But this is only the most elementary drama in a book with so many conflicting themes that in time it comes to seem less a study of a writer and more a study of the act of studying a writer. Not that a conventional biography doesn't emerge from the many layers of this rich and subtly dramatic book. Mr. Hamilton, an Englishman with two volumes of poetry and an estimable biography of Robert Lowell to his credit, has conjured a substantial portrait more or less out of thin air, and it has much to recommend it to a public also hungry to possess the famously elusive J. D. Salinger. There is Mr. Salinger as a student at Valley Forge Military Academy, on the one hand cynically critical of his surroundings, on the other hand ''the straight-faced joiner'' who wrote a class song still ''enshrined in the Valley Forge school hymn book, along with works by Martin Luther and John Wesley,'' and still sung at graduation ceremonies. (''Aye, soon they'll know why misty are/Our eyes at last review.'') There is the history of Mr. Salinger's relations with the publishing industry he came to hate, including the story of how the editor Robert Giroux was forced by his superiors to reject ''The Catcher'' after a textbook editor, who was consulted because the novel was ''about a preppie,'' turned in a negative report. There is a meticulous analysis of Mr. Salinger's literary development from a master of the commercial short story to the writer who preferred to withdraw completely from commerce. And, of course, there is a careful examination of that withdrawal: Mr. Hamilton respectfully avoids analyzing it psychologically, but he leaves the distinct impression that despite its many subtle motives, it was undertaken not least of all to gain Mr. Salinger the very attention he purported to loathe. Yet Mr. Salinger is not the only one who comes out playing ambiguous games in these pages. Mr. Hamilton, too, seems divided against himself. On one hand, he is the writer who was only kidding when he undertook this project, who hoped to charm his subject by so scrupulously respecting his privacy, who planned to write ''a biography, yes, but it would also be a semispoof in which the biographer would play a leading, sometimes comic, role.'' On the other hand, he is his own alter ego, the aggressive biographer who not only insisted on digging out the facts on Mr. Salinger's life, but who also hoped in the process to smoke out Mr. Salinger himself, or so we are led to suspect. These two characters quarrel throughout the book -''me grappling feebly with the moral issues and my biographizing alter ego, now my constant companion, merely eager to get on with the job.'' It is the polite version of Mr. Hamilton who insists on observing the amenities - who refuses the temptation to track down the French woman to whom Mr. Salinger was briefly married after World War II, even though to do so might have shed some light on ''the nervous breakdown'' that Mr. Salinger apparently suffered around that time. It is the aggressive alter ego who, when Mr. Hamilton discovered various caches of Mr. Salinger's letters, insisted on using their contents to reconstruct portions of the writer's life. Of course, by doing so the aggressive biographer did succeed in smoking Mr. Salinger out. But the most interesting aspect of the resulting lawsuit does not concern Mr. Salinger's secret character. It doesn't even involve the legal issues surrounding ''fair use,'' however provocative may be the discussion of those issues, and however ironic is the spectacle of Mr. Salinger publicizing the language of his letters to ensure their privacy. What finally resounds in this ill-starred literary venture is the point that Mr. Salinger may or may not have intended to make by blocking Mr. Hamilton from using his letters and the point that Mr. Hamilton may or may not have learned from his experience - namely, that to love a writer's work does not entitle one to possess him personally. And alternatively: to turn against a writer for whatever personal cause does not by itself permit one to reject his work. Advance Publicationsd(Random House)

457-> Lawsuit Is Filed Over Exemptions From Statute on Warning Labels
A coalition of environmental groups and labor unions has filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn state regulations that they charge illegally exempt food, cosmetics and medical devices from a state law that requires labels warning consumers of the presence of potential carcinogens. The civil lawsuit, filed Tuesday in Sacramento County Superior Court, seeks a permanent injunction barring Gov. George Deukmejian and officials of the State Health and Welfare Agency from enforcing agency regulations that rely on existing Federal safety standards.The plaintiffs argue that the Federal standards often do not assess the risk of cancer. The lawsuit seeks to enforce a measure that was initiated by voters in California, the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act, which was passed in November 1986 by a margin of nearly 2 to 1. It went into effect last February. Among many provisions, the act prohibits the discharge of chemicals known to have caused cancer or birth defects into the drinking water supply and requires posting of safety warnings in the workplace where such chemicals are present. One section of the law requires warning labels alerting consumers when products contain chemicals shown to have caused cancer in humans or in laboratory animals or known to cause birth defects. The law mandates that the list of such chemicals must be compiled by the Governor's office. Exemptions from the labeling are allowed only when it can be shown that exposure to the product over a lifetime poses ''no significant risk.'' 'Massive Loophole' Charged The lawsuit charges that the day before the labeling requirement was to take effect, the State Health and Welfare Agency adopted emergency regulations exempting food, cosmetics and medical devices on the grounds that such products were already in conformity with pre-existing Federal and state laws. ''This massive loophole for the big food and drug manufacturers is blatantly illegal,'' said Nini Redway, a spokeswoman for the Sierra Club, one of the organizations bringing the lawsuit. She said the voter-approved law ''gives us the right to know when we're being exposed to significant cancer risks whether it's in the workplace, the supermarket or the drugstore.'' Thomas E. Warriner, Deputy Secretary of Health and Welfare, who is named as a defendant in the lawsuit, denied that his office had sought to exempt any product from the law. He said that the agency had acted on the advice of the Governor's science advisory panel in adopting the Federal safety standards as an interim measure until its own studies could determine the proper ''action level'' for each chemical. ''We want to be sure people get warnings where they need them,'' Mr. Warriner said, ''but we don't want to be overwarning or it will just be ignored.'' Opponents of the labeling included brewers and wine makers whose products can contain trace amounts of urethane, a chemical that sometimes occurs as a byproduct of fermentation and can cause cancer in humans. The other groups bringing the lawsuit include the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Environmental Defense Fund, Citizens for a Better Environment and the A.F.L.-C.I.O.

459-> Durables Orders Fell 2.2% in May
A slump in aircraft orders caused a 2.2 percent decline in overall orders to the nation's factories for ''big ticket'' durable goods in May, the steepest drop in nine months. The Commerce Department said today that orders for durable goods, items expected to last three years or longer, totaled a seasonally adjusted $114.8 billion last month, down from $117.4 billion in April. The decline in orders surprised economists because they had expected a rise of more than 2 percent, but they noted that the Government's survey apparently did not include several multibillion-dollar orders placed with the Boeing Company. Even though the overall May decline was the largest since August's 2.3 percent drop, analysts saw little reason to view the report as forecasting a significant decline in manufacturing, which has been booming as the cheaper dollar bolsters exports. Last month's transportation orders (including aircraft) fell 9 percent, to $28.6 billion, after an April increase of two-tenths of 1 percent. Effect of Military Orders Military orders, another category that swings widely from month to month, were down 16.6 percent in May, to $8.3 billion, after rising 1.9 percent in April. Excluding military goods, orders fell only nine-tenths of 1 percent. Excluding airplanes, orders rose six-tenths of 1 percent. ''It's really not a report of great consequence in terms of showing any fundamental weakness in the manufacturing sector,'' said Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist of the National Association of Manufacturers. Before May, orders of durable goods rose three months in a row. The April increase, which previously had been pegged at 1 percent, was revised today to a stronger 1.8 percent. The financial markets and the White House accepted the report as good news for inflation. Many traders and some analysts have worried that the export boom, coupled with steady consumer demand, might strain manufacturers' capacity and cause shortages and price increases. Nonmilitary Capital Goods Nonmilitary capital goods, considered a sign of business expansion plans, fell 6.9 percent last month, following increases of 3.4 percent in April and 3.8 percent in March. Despite the setback in May, analysts still expect export-producing manufacturers to spend heavily on modernization and expansion. At the current rate of shipment, capital-goods manufacturers would need five months to use up their order backlog even if they received no new orders. Orders for primary metals such as steel zoomed 5.5 percent after a 1.6 percent rise in April. Orders for electrical machinery also posted a strong gain in May, 3.5 percent, following a 5 percent rise the month before. There was a 2.4 percent decline in orders for non-electrical machinery, more than erasing April's 1.2 percent gain. Shipments of durable goods rose 1.5 percent in May, to $114.4 billion, after an April drop of nine-tenths of 1 percent. The backlog edged up one-tenth of 1 percent, to $405.4 billion.

460-> Citicorp Drops Dallas Proposal
Citicorp withdrew its bid for the First Republicbank Corporation yesterday, industry sources said. Citicorp's proposal would have involved participation in a federally assisted bailout of the troubled Dallas banking company. Citicorp's withdrawal narrows the active bidders to three: Wells Fargo & Company, the NCNB Corporation of North Carolina and First Republic's own management -all apparently still under consideration by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Why Citicorp dropped out is unclear. It and the F.D.I.C. had no comment. Some industry people suggested that Citicorp could not agree to some of the regulatory agency's conditions. The Dallas bank, which has $26.8 billion in assets, has lost $2.2 billion since Jan. 1.

461-> CONNECTICUT Q & A: TIMOTHY F. BANNON; 'It's a Very Difficult Tax to Collect'
TIMOTHY F. BANNON, the Commissioner of Revenue Services, administers a staff of 860 employees collecting $3.9 billion in taxes a year. A 41-year-old Ohio native whose father was from Connecticut, Mr. Bannon is a 1977 graduate of the Yale University Law School who worked at private law firms and corporations before becoming an aide to Governor O'Neill in 1985. On July 23, 1987, he was named to lead the tax-collection agency, and in his first year has started several programs. He talked about his job in an interview at his office on Farmington Avenue in Hartford. Here are some excerpts from the conversation: Q. You recently announced a reciprocal tax agreement with New York. How is that going to work? A. We're encouraging retailers in New York and Connecticut who have business with customers in the other state to register with their state of domicile to collect and pay sales and use taxes for both New York and Connecticut. A Connecticut resident may go across the border to New York and make a major purchase, which can then be shipped into Connecticut tax free, at the point of sale. That person still has a use-tax obligation in Connecticut that's the same as the sales tax, 7.5 percent, but because it's not collected at the point of sale, it's a very difficult tax to collect. We've been losing a lot of revenues because of our inability to collect that tax. This should make the collection easier and more efficient. And it's simple. A New York retailer will file a single return with the State of New York, and we would get a copy of that return and our money. Q. Have you seen any effects yet? A. We certainly have seen some effects, in that we've got now nearly 200 registrants since its announcement on June 30. I think it's going to work fine. We expect it will bring $5 million additional into Connecticut's revenue without any new taxes, and we're doing it essentially overhead-free. We're not hiring any new people for this program. It's $5 million found and a terrific example of cooperation between the two states. Q. What is the advantage to the retailer to sign up for this program? A. For one thing, it returns them to a level playing field. Competition among retailers will revert to a question of price and quality of the goods sold. You'll no longer have retailers whose main attraction is their ability to engage in tax-free transactions. And at the conclusion of the period for open registration, on Oct. 1, we will be vigorously enforcing the use-tax laws. Q. Are there any other reciprocal agreements in the works? A. Yes. We hope we will have agreements with our neighboring states. We have not consumated those agreements because we've been busy with the New York agreement. But I've sent drafts of our New York agreement to Massachusetts and Rhode Island, and I've had preliminary discussions with my counterparts in those states. Q. Is this as much of a problem in Massachusetts and Rhode Island? A. We had a problem with marine sales on the Rhode Island border, where not only boats, but also hardware was being sold tax free. We get complaints from Connecticut merchants that Rhode Island merchants are luring customers away with the promise of tax-free sales. We get complaints from Rhode Island merchants that Connecticut merchants are doing the same thing. On the Massachusetts border, there are appliance and furniture stores reciprocally depriving one state or the other of revenue. In New York, we've got not only the appliance and furniture stores, we've got art coming across the state line, very expensive jewelry. Q. You recently sent a form letter to 2,002 Connecticut residents who purchased appliances at one Port Chester, N.Y., store informing them of their use tax liability. What was the response? A. We had great response. That tax liability is not well known, but that shows people are willing to meet their obligation. As a consequence of an audit, we obtained the records of an appliance dealer who shipped purchases to Connecticut residents. We've received over $200,000 in revenue. More than 92 percent of those people paid their tax obligation as a result of those letters. But that necessitated a lot of mailing to a lot of individuals. Q. Your FAIR program, which stands for Fair Audits Increased Revenues, has started. Could you explain what it is and what you hope it will accomplish? A. It got under way July 1, and the FAIR program itself has a goal of $90 million, which represents $90 million from the existing tax base over and above what we collected last year. That's an important distinction to make, because it's $90 million that would have to be made up through a tax increase or budget reductions. We did a survey of the department that revealed out-of-state audits are twice as productive as in-state audits, which means they produced twice as much revenue per hour. So a large part of the program will be auditing out-of-state companies doing business in Connecticut. Approximately 100 people will be hired in the audit division; 93 of them will be audit personnel. The last component, which I expect to generate a third of the $90 million, is enhanced voluntary compliance. Through a strategy of enhanced audit capacity, emphasizing the effectiveness of our audits and publicizing the penalties of not paying taxes, we hope to generate an additional $28 million in voluntary contributions. Q. Are you noticing any additional pressure as budget-deficit projections continue to mount? A. Yes. There's more pressure on, because the deficit can be responded to in a number of different ways. You can cut programs, or you can raise taxes, or you can be more efficient at getting revenues from the existing tax base. That last is so clearly preferred, and that's right in our lap. Q. Many legislators have complained that Connecticut's tax system is a patchwork and that to overhaul it, we need an income tax. Do you agree? A. The state's tax program is a patchwork, but any legislative program is a patchwork. You pass something, and the next year you get an idea how to improve it, and it develops. No, the state of Connecticut does not have to go to the income tax. So far, we have had the ability to fund our state programs with our existing tax structure. And we have also, through the patchwork process, shaped a sales tax which is a progressive sales tax. Q. How long, and what would it take, to gear up your department for an income tax? A. That would be an enormous undertaking. I think you can get a sense of the enormity by comparing the staff of this agency to the staff of surrounding states that have an income tax. We have about 860 positions in this agency. Massachusetts, which has approximately three times our tax base, has about four times the number of employees. I would say, conservatively, we would have to double the staff here to administer an income tax. Q. The dollar amount of tax liens placed in June more than doubled over 1987. Is that an indication that in addition to audits you are placing more emphasis on enforcement of tax liability? A. Absolutely. We have begun to publish the largest tax liens and the gross lien figure on a monthly basis. We are stepping up the collection process and the enforcement process. Q. Are there any other plans for stepped-up tax-collection programs? A. We are constantly looking at new opportunities to improve our efficiency, ranging from automating our collection system, which will take place some time next summer, to ways of simply getting the check through the process faster, and saving money that way. Because the sooner the state gets somebody's check to the bank, the more interest we earn. We're doing things with other state agencies to take advantage of information they have which can be used for tax purposes. We've begun a pilot program which will enable us to quickly check sales prices on automotive transactions, to see if there's an underreporting of sales price. We're going to be doing things with the Department of Labor. We're going to check sales-tax returns against corporate-tax returns, and if there's an inconsistency that could indicate an underpayment. We've obtained tapes of information from the Federal Government, which enables us to identify people who've filed capital gains returns with the Federal Government but not with the state. This year we've sent letters out to 22,000 individuals to ask them why. Q. Is there an underground economy avoiding the sales tax in Connecticut, and if there is, is there any estimate of its size? A. I don't know what the size of it is, but I certainly don't intend not to acknowledge the existence of an underground economy in Connecticut. It's just a difficult thing to measure. The underground economy consists of things as seemingly innocuous as a flea market, where vendors don't register to pay the sales tax. Any trafficking in untaxed goods is an underground economy. We don't find many thieves willing to come forward and acknowledge that their tangible personal property is taxable. Periodically, there are episodes of stolen cigarettes sold with fraudulent tax stamps or without tax stamps. We have episodes where bootleg motor fuel is coming into the state. But it's so far underground it just isn't going to surface.

462-> Costly Faux Pas for Paris Bourse
The French Bourse's hopes of becoming one of the world's major stock markets took an embarrassing step backward today when the president of the French Stockbrokers Association resigned after a disclosure that the group lost $86 million because of mismanaged investments. Xavier Dupont, the association's president, submitted his resignation today after a storm of controversy followed last weekend's news that one-third of the stockbrokers' fund, which was for the most part managed by Mr. Dupont's family-owned brokerage, was lost. As head of the association, which is largely responsible for regulating the Bourse, Mr. Dupont dominated recent efforts to modernize and expand the market. Brokers Stress Irony ''This doesn't present the image of a great stock market,'' said Jacques Rondeleux, a partner in Rondeleux S.A., a Paris brokerage. ''It doesn't say much for our system of controls either.'' Several brokers pointed to the irony that the fund, which was set up to protect brokerages and their clients from devastating losses, had suffered such losses itself. The scandal is the worst to hit the Bourse since it instituted major changes two years ago that set up a financial futures market, the Marche a Terme des Instruments Financiere, or Matif, and ended the stockbrokers' monopoly on trading shares that was established by Napoleon in 1807. ''The credibility of the entire market is threatened,'' said Regis Rousselle, a vice president of the association who was named to replace Mr. Dupont. Mr. Rousselle, 40 years old, is president of Messchaert Rousselle, a Paris brokerage. Over the last two days, Mr. Dupont, the dynamic, 55-year-old head of the Dupont Denant brokerage, assumed responsiblity for the 500 million franc losses. Other stockbrokers expressed surprise and shock at the losses, but said they had been caused by poor investment decisions and lack of management controls, rather than by dishonesty. Several brokers also expressed anger that Mr. Dupont had not exercised closer control over management of the fund and that they did not learn about the losses until they read about them in the newspapers. Mr. Dupont explained to the association in a meeting on Monday that a portfolio manager had lost money in taking highly speculative positions in bond futures trading. The manager took what some investors described as ''double or nothing'' positions in the hope of offsetting losses suffered during the October market turmoil. Mr. Dupont said the trades took place last November and December, but were not made public until last weekend because they were being investigated and because he wanted to liquidate the positions. He added that the trader who was responsible for the losses was discharged as of Dec. 31. Mr. Dupont learned about the losses at the end of the year. 'A Lapse of Management' ''It's the result of a rapid modernization without having set up controls at the same rate,'' Mr. Dupont said in an interview in Le Figaro today. ''It is a lapse of management, but it should not hurt the image of the Bourse.'' Because of major losses suffered by others, there have already been some efforts to step up Government and internal management controls of trading at the new financial futures exchange. Last December, Cogema, a state-controlled company that produces nuclear fuel, brought a fraud suit against unidentified traders after announcing that its corporate treasury lost $44.6 million as a result of trading on the Matif. The Banque de l'Enterprise, a small bank belonging to the French construction industry, reported losses of about $34 million in Matif trading, or twice its capital base. To shore up the brokers' reserve fund and to restore investor confidence, the association announced today that its 61 members would pay in a billion francs, or $172 million, to approximately double the size of the reserve fund. Before the losses, the fund was valued at about $272 million, but it has fallen to $186 million. ''This is the occasion to show that the security of the Bourse lies not only in the reserve fund, but also in the solidarity of the stockbrokers,'' said George Py, a senior partner in Tuffier, Ravier & Py, a Paris brokerage. Several brokers added, however, that it might be hard for some small, independent brokerages to come up with their share of the increase in the reserve fund. This, they said, might accelerate the trend in which French brokerages link up with banks or foreign brokers, something that was made possible by the recent modernization measures. Pierre Beregovoy, France's Finance Minister, praised today's moves by the stockbrokers' association, saying ''they have acted quickly and well.'' He said he did not want the state to intervene in Bourse activities, but called for stricter controls to help protect investors. ''If the Bourse is not capable of putting its affairs in order, then the state may intervene,'' he added. Many brokers said that Mr. Dupont would be missed, and some added that they had urged him to stay on because of the need for a strong leader in such a time of crisis. ''Mr. Dupont's departure is sad,'' Mr. Py said. ''He was the father of the modernization of the Bourse.'' Several brokers denied that Mr. Dupont had been dismissed, and a spokesman for the association said he had resigned. Also today, Philippe Cosserat, the Government's representative at the brokers' association, resigned. The Government replaced him by naming Gerard de la Martiniere, chairman of the clearinghouse for the Matif.

463-> Company News; Inquiry Set On Farmers Group Trades
The Philadelphia Stock Exchange said today that it would consider disciplining some member firms if an investigation under way determines that a ban on after-hours trading in options of the Farmers Group Inc. was violated last week. Separately, Farmers's spurned suitor, B.A.T. Industries, filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court seeking to reverse a ruling made by the California Insurance Commissioner on Friday. The ruling, which prevents insurance companies in the state from being owned or controlled by government entities from outside California, was a major setback for B.A.T.'s $4.3 billion takeover bid. The decision was based on a 1957 government ownership statute that the lawsuit contends was ''misinterpreted.'' Link to New Inquiry The ruling also figures in the Philadelphia investigation. Several Wall Street traders estimated that improper transactions allowed some traders to make $3.4 million in questionable profits on a certain class of Farmers' options. The California ruling was issued about 7 P.M., Eastern standard time, on Friday. On Monday, shares of the Los Angeles-based insurer dropped $5.25, to $56.75, in over-the-counter trading. But under exchange rules, the expiring options in question, the June put options, had to be exercised by 5:30 P.M., well before the announcement. On Friday, Farmers' shares had closed at $62 each, which meant that those holding the June put options, which give the holder the right to sell Farmers stock at $60 a share, were holding worthless securities. But the call holders, who had the right to buy the stock at $60, were ''in the money,'' the exchange said. 'The Exact Opposite Happened' As a result, ''all of the calls should have been exercised and none of the puts,'' said Joseph P. Fenton, the head of the New York options department for Janney Montgomery Scott Inc., a Philadelphia brokerage. ''But the exact opposite happened.'' The Philadelphia exchange, which makes a market in Farmers' stock, said that 97 percent of the 10,000 June put options were exercised, and only 28 percent of June call options. The exchange declined to specify the total number of call options. ''There was no logical reason for anyone to exercise those puts,'' said Mark L. Berman, the general counsel for O'Connor & Associates in Chicago, the Philadelphia specialist in Farmers' options. He declined to say whether the exchange was investigating O'Connor's trades. ''We wouldn't have anything to do with knowing who exercised an option and who didn't,'' he said. Another options trader said that the suspected traders apparently either had advance knowledge of the California ruling, which would indicate an insider-trading violation, or somehow backdated the transactions, which are submitted upon expiration to the Options Clearing Corporation, a Chicago entity that clears trades for the five leading options exchanges. ''Either way, it's a violation,'' said the trader, who asked not to be identified. S.E.C. Declines Comment A spokesman for the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington declined to comment on whether a parallel inquiry was under way. The Philadelphia exchange also declined to identify the member firms that exercised the expiring Farmers' options. Sanctions could occur through fines, censure or suspension, the exchange said.

464-> CURRENTS; A Book Of Bovine Madness
EMILY GWATHMEY first felt ''the cows coming to me'' about four years ago, when she was spending more and more time leaning over Anthony Babinski's farm fence in Bridgehampton, L.I., staring at the herd of dairy cows and thinking about documenting her passion for bovines. The result is ''Wholly Cow!'' about to be published by Abbeville Press ($19.95). ''Cows are symbolic and picturesque and seem to elicit an emotional response from everyone,'' Ms. Gwathmey said. ''I just knew that I was tapping into some kind of nerve.'' Ms. Gwathmey, who spends weekends and summers in a converted cow barn in Bridgehampton, started collecting cow paraphernalia and coined a word for people who are completely cow crazy. ''I call them boviniacs,'' she said. Ms. Gwathmey's book is a lively compendium of testimonials from cow lovers, plenty of cow lore and cow quotes, as well as photographs by Niki Berg of collectors and their prize possessions. Will Ms. Gwathmey's interest expand to include other barnyard favorites? ''People have suggested I do goats or pigs,'' she said. ''But that's simply not for me.''

466-> Cuomo Rebukes Brawley Family For Not Talking
Governor Cuomo, in his most forceful statement thus far on the Tawana Brawley case, yesterday condemned the family and its advisers for defying a special grand jury investigation, saying that ''our law has been mocked and trifled with.'' He said the state itself had been victimized by ''the blatant refusal'' to cooperate and obey the law and he called on the State Attorney General, Robert Abrams, not to abandon his investigation as long as there was ''the slightest hope'' of uncovering the truth. In an unusual public letter of advice to Mr. Abrams, the Governor also voiced support for the arrest of Miss Brawley's mother, Glenda, for defying a grand jury subpoena to testify in the racially charged investigation into her daughter's allegations of abduction and rape by a white gang last November. No Cooperation Expected The Governor's strong position, set forth in the letter to Mr. Abrams, at a news conference yesterday in Albany and in recent interviews with The New York Times, came as all signs pointed to an inconclusive end to the long-stalemated investigation. On Monday, in a separate interview with The Times, Mr. Abrams said that it was now clear that the state could expect no cooperation from the Brawley family and that the inquiry would soon be winding down. In response to Mr. Cuomo's remarks yesterday, the Attorney General said in a statement that ''the Governor's views and mine are identical'' and thanked him for his ''strong and constant support.'' Mr. Cuomo's decision to release his letter to Mr. Abrams came partly in response to the Attorney General's assessment of the grand jury's progress, aides said, and to the Governor's decision over the weekend to strengthen comments he made in an earlier interview with The Times. In the letter, the Governor began by praising Mr. Abrams for doing ''everything you could reasonably be expected to do in a difficult assignment and in the face of extraordinary obstacles.'' For months, the family's advisers have dismissed the investigation as a cover-up, taunted Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Abrams as racists and suggested the involvement of the Mafia, the Irish Republican Army and the Ku Klux Klan. They have also accused several white Dutchess County law-enforcement officials of participating in the attack on Miss Brawley, but have refused to provide evidence. 'Law Has Been Mocked' Despite Mr. Abrams's efforts, the Governor said, ''it appears that this investigation may end leaving us with nothing but victims. Tawana - and members of the Dutchess County community whom the Brawleys and their advisers have accused, but refuse to confront - are victims. And in a real sense, the people of the entire state are victims as well because our law has been mocked and trifled with. ''I am, as I know you and many others are, especially concerned about the blatant refusal by the Brawleys and their advisers not only to offer their cooperation but to respect the mandate of the law when it has been properly and legally applied to them.'' To permit the law to be violated, Mr. Cuomo added, would be to weaken the force that has bound the nation's democracy for 200 years and protects the powerless from oppression. Although, he said, the bitterness of the case may tempt the authorities to ignore the ''flagrant violation of the court's process,'' that would be a mistake, he said. Not to apply the law here, Mr. Cuomo said, ''will make it more difficult to apply it everywhere else.'' The Governor noted that while the legal judgments were up to Mr. Abrams, the grand jury, the courts and law-enforcement agencies, his advice - sought by the Attorney General -was that ''the process of the court, already oustanding, should be enforced.'' A State Supreme Court justice last week ordered Glenda Brawley jailed for 30 days and fined $250 for refusing to explain why she had ignored a grand jury subpoena. A Public Report Only after all leads were exhausted ''and there is no further realistic hope that the truth will be uncovered'' should the investigation be ended, the Governor advised. At that point, he said, Mr. Abrams should prepare a public report on the entire case. Mr. Abrams was in Washington yesterday, testifying before a Senate committee on insurance, but his office released the following statement: ''I appreciate the Governor's strong and constant support for the investigation we have been conducting. The Governor's views and mine are identical as to the steps which should be taken in concluding this matter. I will be reporting to the Governor at the conclusion of our investigation.'' Miss Brawley's lawyers, Alton H. Maddon Jr., and C. Vernon Mason, did not return telephone calls, but a family adviser, the Rev. Al Sharpton, saying he was speaking for them, repeated that the family would continue to withhold its cooperation. ''We don't believe Bob Abrams is impartial,'' he said. If Mr. Abrams were replaced as the special prosecutor in the case, Mr. Sharpton insisted, Tawana would testify. Of the Governor's letter, he said: ''As far as him saying we advisers have trifled with the law, we have tried to expose the imbalance in the protection of the law. We have exposed the abuse of law when it comes to black people. The Governor has done a disservice to the state by his rhetoric excusing suspects.'' Disjointed Accounts The Governor's effort to project a more forceful position on the half-year-old case case comes as the flagging investigation appears all but over. It was on Nov. 28, 1987, that Miss Brawley, then 15 years old, was discovered after a four-day disappearance, dazed, her body smeared with dog feces and daubed with racial epithets, in a plastic garbage bag outside her family's former apartment in Wappingers Falls, N.Y. In initial disjointed accounts communicated largely by nods, shrugs and a few written notes, she indicated that she was abducted by two white men, one with a police-type badge, and raped and sodomized by up to six men in a woods. Medical tests found no injuries, evidence of sexual activity, exposure or malnutrition. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, among other agencies, said it was unable to corroborate her account. The latest events appeared to stem in part from an interview Governor Cuomo gave to The Times in Albany last Friday. Asked whether he believed that the jail sentence should be executed against Glenda Brawley, Mr. Cuomo replied: ''That's the law. The law is the law. Preserve it. You're not being tiresome when you take that position. Stick to the damn law. It makes more sense than people.'' ''Glenda Brawley must be arrested,'' he added. ''You can't not arrest her. This is the process.'' But he also said he thought it was ''appropriate'' to delay seizing her while she sought sanctuary in various New York City churches. Repeated Charges In the interview, Mr. Cuomo voiced concern over repeated charges by Miss Brawley's advisers that several white Dutchess County law-enforcement officers, whom they named, were guilty of raping her. One of them, Steven A. Pagones, an assistant district attorney, ''is being asked to come in and defend himself when the accuser won't come in and accuse him,'' Mr. Cuomo said. Aides to the Governor said he had been ''brooding'' over the case and the interview since Friday evening. Following Monday's comments to The Times by Mr. Abrams, they said, Mr. Cuomo wanted to send a strong signal to the Attorney General that every possible effort should be made to get to the truth of the matter before the investigation was terminated.

469-> High-Tech Whistle-Stops for Dukakis
Cloaking himself in the mantle of Harry S. Truman, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis rode a whistle-stop train into small-town America today, past the heaps of rusted automobiles, the factories, towns, water towers and working-class backyards of the country's midsection. At each stop - Belleville, Ill., Bismarck and Poplar Bluff, Mo., and Walnut Ridge - Mr. Dukakis repeated his promise of economic opportunity and again contrasted his running mate, Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, with the Republican nominee for Vice President, Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana. ''Nobody has ever questioned the qualifications of Lloyd Bentsen to be Vice President or the President,'' he said, using a line he has repeated in some form or another in virtually every appearance since the young Indianan was chosen by Vice President Bush to be his running mate. ''The test of strong Presidential leadership is the quality of the people you select to serve with you,'' Mr. Dukakis said. Reception for Candidate Varies Asked here about Mr. Bush's criticism of his positions, Mr. Dukakis said: ''I think that is a losing campaign. I don't think you can go to the American people and win their support for your candidacy if you spend 80 percent of your time cutting up the other guy.'' The candidate's reception varied along the way, from a lukewarm crowd in Belleville that included as many anti-abortion protesters as Dukakis supporters, to what seemed to be about half the town in Bismarck, a community of 1,600 people with freshly painted depot and a Main Street that so epitomizes a small Midwestern town it looks almost like a movie set. But on a trip calculated to make nice pictures for the television cameras -after all, the whistle-stop tour was not a particularly efficient mode of campaigning even in Truman's day - the people cooperated nicely, shouting from back porches, waving flags and setting balloons free as local politicians massed along the tracks to meet the candidate. High-Technology Trappings Mr. Dukakis invoked the Truman legacy at each stop. But this is the age of high-technology campaigning. And the 239-mile trip bore as much resemblance to Truman's campaign swings as the video cameras of today's campaign journalists bear to the 4-by-5 Speed Graphic cameras used by the Truman press corps 40 years ago. Like the Truman train, which crept along behind a steam-powered locomotive, Mr. Dukakis's retinue moved along slowly at first, its twin, 3,000-horsepower diesel locomotives slowed by tracks that had warped in the dank summer heat. Truman was wont to stop his train whenever a crowd gathered along the tracks and would probably have made a dozen quick stops in the two and a half hours it took to get from Belleville to Bismarck. The strictures of modern campaigning made that kind of spontaneity impossible for Mr. Dukakis. Four advance teams had been working for days to provide platforms for television crews and telephone lines for reporters at each stop. The advance teams, posted at the stations today, communicated with the staff on the red, white and blue train by cellular telephone. Squads of Secret Service agents patrolled the train and sat in a high observation car. A security helicopter paced the engines, and a truck capable of running on the rails sped along behind, carrying a squad of armed guards.

471-> Bolshevik Coup Lacked Popular Support
To the Editor: Having been detected in his error of attributing the overthrow of Czarism to the Bolsheviks, who had nothing to do with the February Revolution of 1917 (letter, July 13), Howard L. Parsons lapses into two equally serious misstatements (letter, Aug. 1). He asserts that the Kerensky Provisional Government was made up of ''a small minority of wealthy professional men'' and that the Bolshevik seizure of power in October had the support of ''the massive revolutionary movement among the peasants, the industrial workers and disaffected soldiers.'' Alexander Kerensky, the foremost figure in the cabinet of the Provisional Government, was a right-wing Social Revolutionary. He had joined the Government with the approval of the Petrograd Soviet and was the Government's vice president at the time. The ambitious political and social programs of the regime remained unimplemented while Russia was engaged in war with Imperial Germany. Even so, Government reforms made Russia one of the freest countries of the world at the time. It stayed in the war largely because of the desperate pleas of the Allied and United States Governments, which urged Kerensky not to slacken the war effort lest German troops overrun all of Europe. The elections to the All Russian Constituent Assembly, for which the Bolsheviks agitated under Kerensky's regime, were held in January 1918 after the Bolsheviks seized power. It was the nearest thing to a free and democratic election ever held in Russia from 1917 to the present day. The Bolsheviks received less than 25 percent of the vote (their count), and forcibly dissolved the Constituent Assembly. Even Rosa Luxemburg - in a German jail -condemned Lenin's action as a betrayal of democratic socialism. In a conversation with me in rehearsing the days of his regime, Kerensky said he made two great errors - the first in not taking more effective action to repress the insurrectionary potential of the Bolsheviks in July, when they organized armed demonstrations against his regime; the second, and more serious, was in not taking Russia out of the war after Lavr Kornilov's right-wing revolt. Kerensky made errors of judgment, and his personality was not strong enough to master the pressure of events. But he was a person of integrity.

472-> Key Testimony Is Faulted In Queens Firebombing Case
Lawyers for two defendants charged with firebombing the Queens house of a drug-case witness sought to show yesterday that the homeowner's identification of their clients - the key evidence - was not to be believed. The lawyers did this by arranging for the judge to inform the jury of statements, reportedly made by the homeowner to investigators shortly after the firebombing last November, that contradicted his testimony Thursday at the trial. The reported statements involve the issue of whether the homeowner could have seen some of the things that he claimed in his testimony to have seen. The jury was informed of the statements on the last day that evidence was presented in the two-week trial in State Supreme Court in Queens - a trial in a case that was widely publicized because it was part of a series of events that included the execution-style murder of a rookie police officer. The defendants in the trial, Claude Johnson, 28 years old, and Robert Webster, 17, are charged with firebombing the South Jamaica house of a Guyanese immigrant who uses the single name Arjune. The firebombing took place in the early morning of last Nov. 10, after Mr. Arjune's call to the police the previous night about drug dealers operating outside his house had led to the arrest of another man on crack-possession charges. An Officer's Death After the attack on the house, the police posted a 24-hour guard at the house. Last February, one of the guards, Officer Edward Byrne, 22, was shot to death in what the police said was an execution ordered by high-level drug dealers to retaliate for their own prosecutions and imprisonment. Mr. Johnson and Mr. Webster, residents of Mr. Arjune's neighborhood, are not accused of involvement in the killing, for which four other men have been charged. Rather, they are both charged with throwing incendiary devices - gasoline-filled bottles with wicks - at the house at 4:25 A.M. Mr. Webster is charged with doing the same thing a second time nearly two hours later, with another man who has not been identified. Lawyers for the two men -who could face 25 years to life in prison if convicted of the most serious charge against them, first-degree arson -have argued that their clients are the victims of erroneous identification by Mr. Arjune and members of his family. In his testimony Thursday, the 46-year-old Mr. Arjune dramatically described how he had already been awakened by a ''bad dream'' before the 4:25 firebombing and was telling his wife about the dream when he heard his dogs start barking. He said he went to a window and ''I saw these two guys'' -whom he identified in court as the defendants - ''walking up to my house'' and that each was each carrying ''two bottles in their hands'' with ''wicks blazing.'' 'Breaking Glass' He recalled shouting at them and seeing Mr. Webster ''trying to open the window'' before both men threw the bottles, causing light damage to the two-and-a-half-story wood-frame house. But after the defense and prosecution had agreed on the statements in so-called stipulations, Justice Thomas A. Demakos told the jury that two investigators were prepared to testify that Mr. Arjune had given them different accounts of the first firebombing. One detective, if called to the witness stand, would testify that Mr. Arjune told him the day after the attack that he had been awakened by the ''sound of breaking glass,'' the judge said. He said a fire marshal, if called, would testify that Mr. Arjune told him on the day of the attack that he had been awakened by the sound of a ''fence shaking.'' Mr. Webster's lawyer, Joseph Justiz, said later that if Mr. Arjune had been awakened by the sound of breaking glass, it meant he had been awakened by the sounds when the bottles were thrown and that his graphic description of the defendants and their actions before that point could not be true. The lawyer also contended that the reported statement to the detective and Mr. Arjune's reported statement to the fire marshal about being awakened by the fence rattling also showed that ''the man says different things every time someone speaks to him,'' and this ''goes to his credibility'' in general. A son of Mr. Arjune has testified he saw Mr. Johnson fleeing the scene after the first firebombing and a cousin has testified he saw both defendants fleeing the scene. But neither witness said he saw the defendants throwing the firebombs. Defense lawyers have also been challenging those witnesses' identifications.

473-> DREXEL BURNHAM CHARGED BY S.E.C. WITH STOCK FRAUD
The Securities and Exchange Commission charged yesterday that Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. had engaged in a secret agreement with Ivan F. Boesky to defraud Drexel clients, trade illegally on insider information, manipulate the prices of stocks and violate a host of other securities regulations. Although some of the charges against Drexel, one of Wall Street's most powerful firms, had been anticipated for some time, the nature of other allegations were more serious than had been generally expected. The 184-page civil complaint, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan after the stock markets closed, named Drexel and four of its employees, including Michael Milken, the head of the firm's high-yield ''junk bond'' department. Role in Corporate Mergers The complaint recounts Drexel's role in a litany of high-powered corporate mergers and restructurings involving such names as MGM/UA Entertainment, MCA Inc., Diamond Shamrock, the Wickes Companies and the Stone Container Corporation. In its filing, the agency accused the Miami industrialist Victor Posner and his son Steven N. Posner of violating Federal securities laws by scheming with Drexel to conceal the ownership of securities, an illegal practice known as stock parking. The commission does not have the authority to bring criminal charges. Nonetheless, the complaint is regarded as a preview of criminal charges expected to be filed by the end of October by the United States Attorney in Manhattan. Statement From Drexel Those prosecutors are in the middle of a similar investigation and have spent months presenting evidence to a grand jury. Frederick H. Joseph, chief executive of Drexel, issued a statement saying, ''We disagree with the charges filed by the S.E.C., and in due course we expect to be vindicated.'' He added, ''There is little in the filing that is not based on Ivan Boesky's allegations.'' But Gary G. Lynch, head of the S.E.C.'s enforcement division, said that none of the charges are based solely on the allegations of one witness. Mr. Boesky is known to be cooperating with the Government in its investigation, presumably in the hope of receiving a parole from the prison sentence he is now serving for making a false filing with the S.E.C. Others said to be assisting the Government include Charles Thurnher, an accountant who is responsible for maintaining Mr. Milken's records, and three former Boesky employees: Michael Davidoff, Setrag Mooradian and David Jachimczyk. The day's events prompted Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who wrote insider-trading legislation now pending before Congress, to assert, ''Wall Street con artists like Ivan Boesky were mere puppets controlled by one of the most successful Wall Street firms of the 1980's.'' Mr. Posner could not be reached for comment. A message left at the office of his Washington lawyer, Vincent J. Fuller, was not returned. While the complaint does not spell out precise fines, S.E.C. lawyers said yesterday that if they were successful Drexel could be penalized hundreds of millions of dollars. In addition, all the defendants could be forced out of the securities business after an administrative proceeding, which typically follows cases brought by the S.E.C. A securities industry analyst said yesterday that Drexel, a closely held firm, was in a strong financial position and would be able to withstand large fines if it loses the case. Drexel has an estimated total capital of about $3 billion, with $1.5 billion of that in equity capital, according to Perrin Long, an analyst with Lipper Analytical Securities Corporation. The total assets of the firm are estimated to be more than $7 billion. S.E.C. lawyers said the securities violations outlined yesterday occurred in 18 deals, 16 of them involving Mr. Boesky, who in early 1984 struck a secret trading agreement with Mr. Milken. Mr. Boesky has been a crucial element of the Government's investigation of Drexel, and he is expected to be the star witness for the S.E.C. and Federal prosecutors if their cases make it to trial. The Government charged that Mr. Boesky had been ''a front'' for a series of securities violations, such as using the Boesky organization to buy stock in a corporate target, causing the takeover deal to be more expensive and making a Drexel client pay a higher fee. In exchange for making such illegal trades or concealing stock ownership on behalf of Drexel, Government lawyers said, Mr. Boesky was ultimately paid $5.3 million by the firm in March 1986. To conceal the real purpose of that payment, they said, Drexel and Mr. Milken described it in an invoice as a fee for consulting services. The Government also contended that after Dennis B. Levine, a Drexel investment banker, was charged with illegal insider trading in May 1986, Mr. Boesky and Mr. Milken undertook to destroy many of the documents of the arrangment between them. Mr. Milken said in a statement issued by his lawyer, ''When the truth is substituted for false accusations, I am confident that I and my colleagues will be fully vindicated.'' Other defendants listed in the complaint are Mr. Milken's brother, Lowell J. Milken, a lawyer and employee of Drexel; Cary J. Maultasch, a senior equity trader in Drexel's New York office, and Pamela R. Monzert, a junk bond trader in Beverly Hills, Calif. Michael F. Armstrong, the lawyer for Lowell Milken, said the naming of his client was ''unwarranted and unfair.'' Lowell Milken is named in connection with two transactions; Mr. Armstrong said his client had little involvement with them. The other employees could not be reached for comment, and a spokesman for Drexel said the firm would issue no statement on their behalf. Of the many charges brought by the Government, Wall Street experts said the most serious for the firm's image would be those accusing Drexel of having defrauded its clients. It was not immediately clear whether any Drexel clients might drop the firm as financial adviser. One S.E.C. allegation is that Drexel defrauded the Maxxam Group Inc., a real estate management and development company retained in 1985 when it was interested in acquiring the Pacific Lumber Company. The S.E.C. said that Michael Milken directed Mr. Boesky in October of that year to buy Pacific Lumber stock after executives from Maxxam had a dispute with Mr. Milken about Drexel's fees. On Oct. 22, 1985, the two companies agreed to merge. The S.E.C. maintains that Drexel's advisory fee for the deal, $22 million, was inflated because of the huge purchases by Mr. Boesky. In addition, Drexel, through Mr. Boesky, made money on its insider trading purchases, the S.E.C. asserted. The S.E.C. lawyers also charged that the Wickes Companies was defrauded by Drexel after the firm was retained about a 1986 takeover of the National Gypsum Company. But apparently unknown to Wickes, Drexel employees are said to have ordered Mr. Boesky on April 8 to buy 400,000 shares of Gypsum stock for the accounts of Drexel and Michael Milken before the takeover was announced. Later that day the tender offer was announced at $54 a share, and the next day the investment bank and Mr. Boesky secretly bought 130,000 more shares. In all, the trading netted Mr. Boesky's company and Drexel $6.6 million. One of Wall Street's leading investment bankers commented that although many of the charges against Drexel had been expected, ''it's another thing when it actually happens.'' Agreeing to comment only if he were not identified, he said, ''People will now wait to see what Giuliani does.'' Rudolph W. Giuliani, the United States Attorney, is expected to lodge criminal charges against Drexel. The investment banker said Wall Street would be watching to see how far the S.E.C. goes in seeking to curb Drexel's operations. He said that if Mr. Giuliani files racketeering charges against Drexel, involving triple damages, ''it could involve big numbers.'' The S.E.C. also cited three instances of ''stock parking,'' an illegal practice of concealing the ownership of shares in order to avoid either the reporting requirements or the net margin requirements of Federal securities laws. In addition, the agency charged that in two instances Drexel engaged in illegal insider trading without the aid of Mr. Boesky. Those trades took place in the stocks of Lorimar Inc., while that company was in the midst of merger talks, and Viacom International, at a time when its management was planning to take the company private. The filing of the S.E.C.'s complaint had been delayed several months after its approval as the commission and Government prosecutors tangled with legal issues presented by the lawsuit, lawyers familiar with the case have said. At the time lawyers said that the S.E.C. could not make public any charges until the United States Attorney in Manhattan was prepared to bring criminal charges. The concern of Federal prosecutors was that Mr. Boesky would be available to Drexel to counter the civil charges before a criminal case could be mounted. the prevailing wisdom is that yesterday's action is a strong indication that the United States Attorney is close to bringing his case. Unless there is a motion for a stay of the case by either the Federal prosecutors in Manhattan or the S.E.C., Drexel will have the opportunity for full discovery, including deposing Mr. Boesky. It was not clear yesterday whether the Government prosecutors would move for such a stay. ''We're not in any different position today than we were in yesterday,'' said Bruce Baird, head of securities and commodities fraud unit at the United States Attorney's office. ''We are not confirming or denying that there is an investigation.'' The complaint is expected to have a significant effect on the consideration of insider trading legisaltion, which is scheduled to be considered by the House of Representatives next week. ''The S.E.C.'s action today insures that the Congress will send the President this year a tought, common sense insider-trading bill,'' said Representative Markey.

476-> FUTURES/OPTIONS; Coffee Prices Continue Rise On Brazilian Drought Fears
Coffee futures prices rose sharply for the second day yesterday on fears that a dry spell in Brazil could lengthen into a drought in the world's largest coffee-producing nation. The talk of a Brazilian drought that has driven up coffee futures prices on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York may be premature, but there was little other information to trade on yesterday, analysts said. Fears of drought damage have underpinned a dramatic rally in the coffee market in the last month. Coffee for delivery in September has risen more than 21 cents a pound since falling to about $1.08 in early August. Yesterday coffee settled 3.32 cents to 3.79 cents higher, with September at $1.295 a pound. But it is still fairly early to be worried about drought damage to the Brazilian crop, said Sandra Kaul, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York. ''To put this in perspective, in 1985 when drought trimmed the crop back sharply, people had not begun to focus on the drought until the second or third week of October and it wasn't until Thanksgiving that they began noting damage to the crop,'' she said. But Kim Badenhop, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. in New York, said conditions were becoming a little more critical as the coffee crop approaches its flowering stage since Brazil had an early, dry spring this year, resulting in unusually low soil moisture. Brazilian weather conditions could continue to determine the market's direction before the Sept. 19 opening of the International Coffee Organization's semiannual meeting in London. Cocoa futures skidded to new 12 1/2-year lows on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange as producer and consumer nation-members of the International Cocoa Organization, meeting in London, began tackling issues that threaten the existence of the price-support group. Cocoa was $20 to $28 lower, with September at $1,173 a ton. Oil futures finished mixed on the New York Mercantile Exchange, surprising many who had expected a continution of Tuesday's sharp sell-off. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 8 cents lower to 13 cents higher, with October at $14.16 a barrel. Reports that Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates had increased their crude-oil production last month caused panic selling of futures Tuesday on fears that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was in complete disarray.

477-> Encore on Swan Lake: 8 Births in Prospect Park
To nature lovers, a twice-told tale is far from tedious. For the second year in a row, the only nesting pair of swans in New York City has produced a new family in Prospect Park Lake. In a repeat of last year's well-timed performance, the cygnets hatched from their six-inch long eggs over the Mother's Day weekend. Last May, in what officials said was the first known breeding by swans in mid-city in decades, five of the fluffy gray babies with black bills emerged from five tan, speckled eggs. This year the female swan, who is now experienced in coping with two-legged intruders, was 8 for 8. Plastic Bags and Broken Glass The reproductive success of this wild pair of mute swans is testimony to the growing effectiveness of an effort by the city's Department of Parks and Recreation to support wildlife. The effort, directed by the department's Nature Resources Group, includes establishing in the parks suitable breeding areas and favored food plants for insects, birds, reptiles and other animals. Along with the swans, Brooklyn's Prospect Park Lake this spring has been home to many exotic resident and transient birds, including two nesting pairs of black-crowned night herons, four migrating Arctic loons and a male wood duck. The lake is also home to pied-billed grebes, American coots, Canada geese and mallard ducks. The swans, which flew to the Brooklyn park two years ago, presumably from Long Island, were more careful in choosing a site for this year's nest, placing it deep in reeds at the edge of an island that was not easily accessible by paddle boat. However, like last year, the six-foot wide nest of woven reeds was interspersed with plastic shopping bags and other debris and surrounded by plastic bottles, potato chip bags, broken glass and beer cans. The eggs were laid, one a day, in the third week in March and piled into the nest. Not until the last egg was laid on March 31 did the female begin incubating them. From that moment, until the day after hatching, she never once left the nest. Throughout the nearly six-week incubation (although ornithologists say swans' eggs should hatch in 28 days), the male foraged for the two of them and was often seen by birders and morning exercisers bringing his mate breakfast. Ferocious Hissing at Intruders Barely a day after hatching, seven of the cygnets were swimming the lake, with their highly protective parents, in search of their breakfast. The eighth cygnet, clearly the runt of the brood, rode for days on its mother's back, protected by her enormous wings. At the sign of danger, however, all eight were gathered up onto this elegant swan boat and the father assumed a frighteningly aggressive posture - head lowered, wings bent upward and mouth opened to emit a ferocious hissing at intruders. The aggressiveness of mute swans can be something of a problem. Park officials worry about children getting pecked by the male if they get too close. The male swan has a wont for chasing geese, forcing them and their goslings onto the park road. And last year, he so intimidated the grebes that nested elsewhere. As for his own offspring, four of the five that survived last year stayed with their parents on the lake until it froze. Then they all flew to the salty coastal waters of Gateway National Recreation Area. As soon as the lake thawed, the adults returned with only one grown offspring. It left as soon as its parents started nesting. In a lake the size of Prospect Park's, apparently there is room for only one pair of mature swans.

482-> Cleaning the Ocean: Use Existing Facilities
Letta Tayler's article [ ''Congress Considers Ocean Cleanup Plan,'' Aug. 7 ] outlines well both the problems of ocean pollution and certain legislation proposed to address those problems. Clearly, more funds are needed for marine research and, as Representative Hochbrueckner pointed out, for additional cleanup efforts. What is not needed is a new regional center with attendant administrative costs, meetings, memoranda and talk. The mechanisms for funding additional marine research and cleanup exist within the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Marine Fisheries Service; they should be used for this purpose. If the article quoted Boyce Thorne Miller of the Oceanic Society correctly that ''the E.P.A. has a very poor record of carrying through on its environmental projects, so I for one would not trust its efforts as being enough,'' then that is an unfair statement and no reason to create some regional center. N.O.A.A. was emasculated and E.P.A. and National Marine Fisheries Service were hogtied by lack of adequate funding through the Reagan Administration for the past seven years. It was the policy created in Washington, not by the rank and file of these agencies, which created any ''poor record.'' The agencies have existing administration and excellent research abilities; the marine research required could be handled through in-house programs and through contract to researchers in colleges and universities. Tudor Davis of the E.P.A. summed it best in the article by noting that the centers would be ''cumbersome, costly and duplicate existing Federal and state programs.'' I suggest any new marine research funding be sharply focused through existing channels. Unless window dressing is more important. TERRY C.

485-> New Woes for Space Shuttle
The space shuttle Discovery sprang a small gas leak in one of its steering engines today, creating a possibility that the first post-Challenger shuttle flight will be further delayed, the space agency said. After several hours of inspection, technicians had not found the source of the leak, said Lisa Malone, a spokeswoman for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. She said it was too early to determine if the leak would delay the planned launching of the Discovery in early September. If the problem cannot be repaired on the launching pad, the Discovery might have to be rolled back to an assembly building for repairs, a process that could result in a delay of several weeks, officials said. The first space shuttle flight since the Challenger explosion two and a half years ago, in which seven astronauts died, has been delayed many times since NASA first set a launching date for last February. Fuel Used in Orbital Maneuvering Officials said they believed the gas leak was in one of three places: a power valve, an oxidizer tank filter or a jet thruster, all within the pod that covers the left Orbital Maneuvering System engine. The engine is one of two used to steer the shuttle in orbit. Ms. Malone said that if the leak was in a thruster, the problem could be corrected on the launching pad. Technicians detected an odor of nitrogen tetroxide gas, a component of the craft's fuel for the orbital maneuvering, while preparing the Discovery on Pad 39B for launching. Ms. Malone said that the rate of the leak, when initially detected, was 15 parts per million, considered very minor but it later dropped to 3 or 4 parts per million, making it difficult to find the source. Effect on a Test Is Unclear She said technicians were using sniffing devices and testing valves to track down the source. It was not certain today what effect the leak would have on a critical test-firing of the Discovery's three main engines on the launching pad for 20 seconds. The test had been planned for late July. Another test-firing, of a solid-fuel booster rocket, has been delayed from late July until at least mid-August while experts consider what repairs should be made to a test booster rocket that was damaged last week when a joint was mistakenly overpressurized. Engineers at the Morton Thiokol plant in Utah are inspecting the rocket, That test, the fifth full-scale firing of the solid-fuel booster rocket, redesigned since a faulty joint triggered the Challenger explosion, is considered essential before the Discovery can be launched.

486-> LARGE SAVINGS UNIT WANTS TO SWITCH DEPOSIT INSURERS
The nation's third-largest savings and loan association announced today that it wanted to leave the beleaguered Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation in favor of the much stronger insurer for commercial banks. The move by the Great Western Financial Corporation of Beverly Hills, Calif., with $31 billion in assets, would be the largest defection by far from the savings insurance corporation, which is likely to fight the move out of fear that other large institutions would follow. Most savings institutions are barred by Congress from leaving the F.S.L.I.C., but Great Western says it is exempt from the rule. Pressure on Congress The departure, which would have no real impact on depositors, would put pressure on Congress to move more swiftly to resolve the mounting problems in the savings and loan industry, where losses at some 500 insolvent institutions are thought to be growing by as much as $1 billion a month. ''You have one of the strongest, biggest and best-run thrifts in the United States attempting to escape'' from the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and its bankrupt insurance fund, said Jonathan Gray, an analyst for the Wall Street firm of Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. The F.S.L.I.C. is the fund that insures deposits for the nation's savings and loan associations, which traditionally take consumer deposits and make mortgage loans while commercial banks also make business loans. Peak of $6 Billion The fund's resources have vanished from a peak of $6 billion in the mid-1980s as it liquidated or merged failing institutions. At the end of last year, it had a deficit of $13 billion. On the other hand, the F.D.I.C., which insures deposits at commercial banks, has a surplus of around $16 billion. Both funds offer identical Federal guarantees on deposits up to $100,000. Great Western said that, after paying nearly $100 million in extra deposit insurance premiums over the last four years to prop up the F.S.L.I.C., it was no longer willing to continue to deplete its resources and shareholder value. ''It is costing us a lot of money to remain in the F.S.L.I.C.,'' said James F. Montgomery, chairman of Great Western. ''We qualify for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, so why shouldn't we switch?'' Mr. Montgomery has said for months that Great Western might apply to leave the savings insurance fund, which charges more than twice the annual premium of the banks' deposit insurance agency. The savings institution filed a formal application today to make the switch. Although the practical effect on Great Western's operations of such a change will be negligible, the institution will save $26 million a year in excess premium payments. Today's action reflects a growing complaint among healthy savings and loan associations that they are unfairly being forced to pay for the mistakes of those who led more than 500 institutitions into insolvency. High Cost Cited They argue that the cost of solving the industry's problems is now so great that the healthy segment of the industry could never cover those losses. And if the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates the nation's savings institutions, insists on imposing high premiums for its insurance arm, they say, it will eventually cripple many of the now-sound institutions. Current estimates of the cost to the Government range from $50 billion to $100 billion, an amount so large that many industry analysts are predicting that the only viable solution will be a direct taxpayer bailout. ''This is a statement by the healthy segment of the industry that it believes its net worth is being confiscated by a Government agency that has failed repeatedly to fulfill its responsibility of adequately regulating the industry,'' Mr. Gray added. ''It indicates once more the need to get the F.S.L.I.C. problem resolved promptly and that the new Congress and the new Administration need to address it early,'' said Mark S. Clark, senior vice president of the United States League of Savings Institutions, the industry's largest trade group. Loss of Confidence Feared Regulators and savings executives continue to be concerned about the possibility that the public will lose confidence in the system. Though some will inevitably argue that the desire to migrate to the F.D.I.C. underscores the case for merging the two insurance funds, which some in Congress have suggested, sentiment seems to be moving away from that as a workable solution. Industry experts note that, even if the $16 billion in assets at the F.D.I.C. were used to shut down or merge savings and loan institutions, it would be far from sufficient, and at the same time would jeopardize the funds of both industries. Mr. Montgomery said his plan was to merge the institution's principal subsidiary, the Great Western Bank, into its subsidiary in Washington state, the Great Western Savings Bank, and seek F.D.I.C. insurance. In September, Great Western Savings, with $900 million in assets, received permission to switch to F.D.I.C. insurance. Assessment in Contention The point of contention is the so-called special assessment that the bank board has imposed on the nation's 3,100 savings and loan institutions since the first quarter of 1985. As the resources of the F.S.L.I.C. began to dwindle in the mid-1980's, the bank board imposed an extra insurance premium equal to 12.5 cents per $100 of deposits, in addition to the existing premium of 8.3 cents per $100 of deposits. The F.D.I.C. currently charges 8.3 cents per $100 of insurance. Though the industry accepted the higher premium for a time, it expected the bank board to phase out the special assessment. But earlier in the year, M. Danny Wall, the bank board's chairman, stunned the industry by first announcing that, to pay for the cost of rescuing more than 500 insolvent savings institutions, he would have to extend the premium through 1998. Later, as he raised his projection of the size of the losses in the insolvent institutions, he announced that the special assessment would have to be extended as long as 30 years unless Congress took action that would cover some of the losses. Chances Called Small ''With 30 years of special assessment, we just can't see the end of this tunnel,'' Mr. Montgomery said. But few analysts expected that the bank board would let Great Western abandon the F.S.L.I.C. without a fight. ''My view is that their chances are small, but well worth the effort,'' said Eric I. Hemel, a former chief economist for the bank board and now an analyst at the First Boston Corporation. Not only has the bank board tried to discourage institutions from leaving the F.S.L.I.C., but in 1987 Congress imposed a one-year moratorium on departures, and extended it for another year last summer, to prevent an exodus from the insurance agency while it is trying to come up with a permanent solution to the industry's problems. The extension of the moratorium will expire on Aug. 10, 1989. ''The moratorium has a purpose, to preserve the respective dues-payers to their respective deposit insurance funds,'' Mr. Wall said. Though he added that it was too early to say definitively whether the bank board would approve the move by Great Western, he indicated that in the end it might oppose it. ''It is not clear that the grandfather status is as clear as they say it is,'' Mr. Wall said. Exemption Is Seen The bank board chairman was referring to an exemption from the moratorium that some savings institutions were given if they had taken action ahead of the 1987 legislation to leave the F.S.L.I.C. Mr. Montgomery argued that Great Western's lawyers have said that the institution is exempt from the moratorium. Analysts said the move by Great Western, which has more than 900 offices nationwide, could be the first of several large profitable California savings and loan institutions to leave the F.S.L.I.C. in favor of the F.D.I.C. According to the U.S. League, almost 1,300 healthy institutions across the country could in theory qualify for F.D.I.C. insurance.

487-> Olympic Trials; Favorites Survive Jitters, Heat
Though the heat and humidity were oppressive, Carl Lewis and Jackie Joyner-Kersee were magnificent. They were easily the stars as the United States Olympic track and field trials began today. At 10:30 A.M., 15 minutes after the meet began, Lewis won his first-round heat in the 100-meter dash in 9.96 seconds. At 6:30 P.M., he won his quarterfinal in 9.96. Those times were the fastest in the world this year, the fastest ever in preliminaries and equal to the seventh-fastest time ever. No one had ever run two sub-10-second 100's in one day. When Lewis won four gold medals in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, the first came in the 100. In those Olympics, Joyner-Kersee won a silver medal in the heptathlon, a two-day, seven-event competition for women. Now she is the world champion. Here, Bob Kersee, her husband and coach, predicted she would score 7,194 points, breaking her 1986 world record of 7,158. Highest First-Day Score After the day's four events, Joyner-Kersee totaled 4,367 points, the highest first-day score ever. She was 222 points ahead of her world-record pace and 593 points ahead of second-place Cindy Greiner. She ran the 100-meter hurdles in 12.71 seconds and high-jumped 6 feet 4 inches, both American heptathlon records. Then she put the shot 51 feet 4 1/4 inches, a meet record, and won the 200-meter dash in 22.30 seconds, a world heptathlon record. ''Over all, I am pleased,'' she said, ''but I can do better.'' 'She Has Heart' ''She showed me she has heart,'' said Kersee, who seldom praises his wife's performances. The only final on the opening program was the men's shot-put. Randy Barnes, a Texas A&M junior, won with 71 feet 9 1/2 inches, a meet record. Gregg Tafralis (68-6) and Jim Doehring (67-8 1/4) also made the Olympic team. In preliminaries, the best athletes generally moved closer to a trip to the Olympics, which start Sept. 17 in Seoul, South Korea. Edwin Moses, the world and Olympic champion in the men's 400-meter hurdles, ran easily and won his heat in 49.31 seconds. Mary Decker Slaney (9:04.35) and Vicki Huber (9:06.62) won the heats of the women's 3,000 meters. Dixon Fastest in 400 Heats Diane Dixon of Brooklyn ran the fastest time (51.00 seconds) in the women's 400-meter heats. In the men's triple jump, Mike Conley (55-7 3/4) qualified second and Willie Banks, the world record-holder (55-6 1/2), was third behind Charlie Simpkins (56 feet 2 3/4 inches). The casualties included Ron Brown, the former wide receiver for the Los Angeles Rams, and Mark Witherspoon, the 1987 national champion, who were eliminated in the 100 meters. The 34-year-old Dwight Stones, an Olympic bronze medalist in the high jump in 1972 and 1976, failed to clear 7 feet 2 3/4 inches in the qualifying round and was eliminated. The nine-day trials create intense pressure for the athletes. If they finish first, second or third, they make the Olympic team. If they finish back in the pack, they stay home. Temperature of 103 Degrees So the atmosphere was nerve-wracking. And so was the weather in an area seared by heat for weeks. Today, the temperature climbed to 103 degrees with 56 percent humidity. The temperature track-side was measured at 120 degrees, and the temperature-humidity index, the summer equivalent of the wind-chill factor, reached 110. ''I've run in hotter weather,'' Moses said. ''In Sacramento in 1981, it was 105, but the humidity was nil. The humidity here makes it worse.'' ''It was stickier in Houston when I set the world record in 1986,'' Joyner-Kersee said. ''I train in Houston at 1 o'clock every afternoon,'' Lewis said, ''so this didn't bother me.''

488-> For the New York Assembly
New Yorkers vote next Thursday in a primary election. Here are The Times's endorsements for State Assembly races, all Democratic, in which primary victory is tantamount to election. THE BRONX. In the 74th District, Hector Diaz, the incumbent, with good ideas for expanding drug treatment, merits a third term over Lucy Cruz, a former liaison to the Mayor's office. 76th District: The forceful and independent-minded incumbent, Aurelia Greene, well deserves another term. 77th District: Sandra Ramos-Alamo, a spirited tenant organizer and child care advocate, promises stronger representation than Israel Martinez, a former aide to Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer. Appointed six months ago to fill a vacancy created by Jose Rivera's move to the City Council, Mr. Martinez has displayed little initiative. A third candidate is Efrain Gonzalez, a former Brinks guard. 78th District: The incumbent, Gloria Davis, an effective advocate for the Black and Puerto Rican Legislative Caucus, has earned another term. 79th District: George Friedman, the incumbent, who also serves as chairman of the Bronx County Democratic Party, faces an energetic challenge from Donald Reilly, a university researcher and longtime member of Community Board 7. Mr. Friedman warrants criticism for his fealty to the discredited regular party organization, but has been an able and conscientious lawmaker. He deserves to continue in the Assembly, but would reassure voters by resigning his county leadership. 81st District: It is a pleasure to endorse Jay Goldman to succeed Eliot Engel, who is running for Congress. Mr. Goldman, unusually knowledgeable about education issues, would be a powerful voice for school reform. His opponents are a former City Councilman, Steve Kaufman, and Gretchen Hazell, a community activist. BROOKLYN. In the 42d District, Rhoda Jacobs, an unusually conscientious public servant, has helped pass vital health and day care legislation. We endorse her with enthusiasm for a sixth term. Her opponent is N. Nick Perry, who leads Community Board 17. 43d District: Clarence Norman Jr., a persuasive advocate for the homeless, is challenged by Carl Roberts, a tax consultant and member of Community Board 9. Mr. Norman, the three-term incumbent, deserves endorsement. 45th District: Daniel Feldman, the incumbent, who has become an effective promoter of criminal justice reform, merits support over former Assemblyman Harry Smoler. 55th District: The Albany veteran William Boyland, a strong supporter of the state's upcoming transportation bond issue, warrants re-election. 57th District: The incumbent, Roger Green, chairman of the Black and Puerto Rican Legislative Caucus, showed courage earlier this year in speaking out against the tactics of the Rev. Al Sharpton and others in the Tawana Brawley case. Despite an erratic legislative performance, he has earned another term. His challenger, Stanley Frere, faces Federal criminal charges. QUEENS. In the 23d District, Audrey Pheffer has proved an unusually thoughtful lawmaker in her freshman term. She deserves to return to Albany. 26th District: Sandra Delson, an experienced health administrator who seeks better housing for senior citizens, merits endorsement over the amiable but ineffective one-term incumbent, Morton Hillman. 29th District: Cynthia Jenkins, the feisty and independent incumbent, is a capable public official. We endorse her over the challenger, Rudy Washington, a building contractor. 30th District: Joseph Crowley, a lackluster freshman, faces Harvey Katz, a teacher and knowledgeable health care advocate. Mr. Katz seems the better choice. 32d District: The veteran incumbent Ed Abramson's record of constituent service is not matched by legislative accomplishment. In this race we favor Lawrence Miller, an official with the State Division for Youth.

489-> Patents; Edmund Andrews System Gives National Ads Local Touch
Like an itch, the impulse to buy something can pass very quickly. Most good salespeople know that the easiest way to lose a sale is to delay when a customer seems eager to put down money. According to Bernard Riskin, that poses a problem for many companies that advertise products on network television or in national publications. An ad for personal computers, for example, might intrigue prospective buyers, but the company could lose the sale if the buyer does not know where to get a quick demonstration. Many companies now include a toll-free phone number for customers who want information, but these phone centers may also be far off. Mr. Riskin's invention, which received a patent this week, uses a computerized telephone system to give national advertising a local touch. The system, licensed to Applied Telematics, a start-up company in Wayne, Pa., answers phone calls from customers responding to an ad. The computer analyzes the first six digits of the customer's number and determines the location. It then selects the dealer nearest the location and connects the call to that dealer. Applied Telematics began operating the system in January. Revenues from the system, which is sold as a service to national advertisers, are still negligible, but users include Minolta Business Equipment; Chrysler Financial, a subsidiary of the Chrysler Corporation, and Yugo of America, which distributes the Yugoslav economy car. Mr. Riskin received patent 4,757,267.

490-> Consumers Say No To Machines That Talk
LOCKED away in a laboratory in Benton Harbor, Mich., far from the ring-around-the-collar crowd, is an ordinary-looking clothes dryer. Its almond-colored enamel finish is as shiny as any other dryer just off the assembly line at the Whirlpool Corporation plant there. It dries clothes as fast as any other dryer: 30 minutes for permanent-press fabrics, 60 minutes for terry-cloth towels. When it finishes, however, it does something other dryers cannot do: It speaks. ''Load dry,'' it declares in a voice that sounds uncannily human. But this dryer will not make the leap from laboratory to customer showroom soon: Whirlpool has decided that America is not ready for talking appliances. When market researchers showed the dryer to a group of consumers last year, one woman complained: ''My husband talks back to me. My kids talk back to me. I don't want my dryer talking back to me.'' Such has been the fate of talking appliances. Five years ago, electronics companies were planning alarm clocks that would wake you with soothing synthesized voices, microwave ovens that would announce when the hot dogs were ready, dishwashers that would declare when the rinse cycle was done and cameras that would warn that the light was too dim for a good shot. Detroit, meanwhile, was promising cars that would tell passengers when to fasten their seat belts or advise drivers when they are low on fuel. Most of those products were offered for sale. And, manufacturers and industry analysts say, most seemed to have run into the same resistance as Whirlpool's dryer: consumers balk at devices that talk. Many consumers were startled, not soothed, by the electronic voices. The machines' limited vocabularies left purchasers wondering if they had bought something as demented as Hal, the computer gone awry in the film ''2001: A Space Odyssey,'' or as discombobulated as the 1928 Porter on ''My Mother the Car,'' the 1960's television show that featured the voice of the actress Ann Sothern. Sony's talking alarm clock, which appeared in stores in the early 1980's, fared so poorly that company officials had difficulty remembering the pocket-sized device when asked about it recently. Panasonic dropped the chatty microwave oven. Chrysler, which at one time offered electronic voices on more models than any other American car maker, stopped selling the option last year. The British auto maker Austin Rover dropped voices in its cars earlier this year. And Nissan, which once installed voice warning systems in the sporty 300ZX and the top-of-the-line Maxima, no longer does. ''There was a consumer reaction of unfavorable dimensions,'' said Charles Ryan, an appliance-company analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company. Talking toys and talking bathroom scales seem to be exceptions; some have stayed on the market for years. There are no statistics on how many other talking products have come and gone, or how much money was spent developing them. The technology, electronic chips that can produce perfectly modulated voices, became available only in the last few years. Tom Waterback, a spokesman for the Electronic Industries Association, a trade group in Washington, shares the view that talking appliances never captured the imagination of consumers. ''Men didn't want to be prodded by a male voice,'' he said. ''It aroused their competitive instincts. But a nudge from a female voice wasn't so bad.'' Except to women. Other researchers found that women did not want their husbands listening to a woman's voice whispering ''washer fluid is low'' or ''trunk lid is ajar.'' These are not sweet nothings: electronic voices sometimes seem more likely to conjure up visions of horror rather than romance. A writer, house-sitting in a friend's Manhattan apartment several years ago, awoke in a panic, absolutely certain that armed robbers had broken in and were about to open fire. But it was only the tenant's Sony alarm clock squawking: ''Wake up! It's 5:30 A.M. Wake up!'' It took several minutes, however, for the house sitter to figure out where the voice was coming from and how to squelch it. An electronic voice had more troubling consequences for a woman who did not realize her new car had such an option, according to a story that made the rounds of car buffs several years ago. As Michael Marsden, a professor of popular culture at Bowling Green State University in Ohio, recalled, the woman had just started the car's engine when the voice commanded, ''Fasten your seat belt.'' ''That surprised her so much,'' he said, ''that she drove the car right through the wall of her garage.'' She was not injured. ''There is that initial shock that machines are talking to us,'' Professor Marsden said. ''The culture never really gives us enough time to prepare for technology. There's not enough of a buffer zone.'' As manufacturers discovered, some consumers do not want to cross the buffer zone. They do not want a friendly voice simulating the human condition. ''It's the ultimate insult to your intelligence,'' said Mel Miller, the Speaker of the New York State Assembly, who works in an office building with a talking elevator and whose son has a talking alarm clock. ''It's the ultimate in intrusiveness. These cars tell you to close the door. What's next, the toilet that says, 'Flush again'?'' Perhaps not, but inventors have not given up entirely on talking appliances. Several months ago, a high-school student, Richard LeGrand of Edmond, Okla., won a $3,000 scholarship in a National Science Teachers Association contest for designing and constructing a talking ruler. WHS Sales of Clearwater, Fla., is marketing a talking fire detector called Vocalert that is programmed with evacuation instructions: ''Open the door,'' ''shut the door,'' ''turn left.'' Professor Marsden, however, said he believed that consumers did not want machines ordering them around. ''We're not willing to give them that authority over us,'' he said. ''We don't trust them and we don't know what they'll tell us to do next.'' If Celia Merryman has anything to say about it, exercise rituals will march to the beat of different voices. She is the marketing administrator for Powercise, a Houston company that sells seven exercise machines, each with a distinctive voice. Among them are Wally the weight scale (''Hi, I'm Wally''), Harry the leg machine (''Come on, your grandmother can lift more than that'') and Pierre, which speaks with a French accent. All have a 100-word vocabulary and say ''please wipe me off'' whenever athletes leave them covered in sweat. ''We tried our inner-outer thigh machine with a female voice,'' Ms. Merryman said. ''It didn't go over. Women didn't like it. So now, he's a male.'' Whirlpool used a neutral voice, one that was ''not definitely feminine or masculine,'' said Joy Schrage, a Whirlpool spokeswoman. ''We wanted ours to be nonirritating,'' she said. ''The people we tested it on thought the voice was all right. They didn't like the fact that the dryer talked in the first place.'' Whirlpool still hopes the talking dryer has a future among the next generation of consumers, who are growing up with talking computers in school and may be less intimidated by talking appliances than their parents are. That generation may also be better at shutting such devices up. ''I've never figured out how to turn it off for more than five minutes,'' said Denise Lee, an investment banker who has a friend who owns a talking alarm clock. ''It says, 'Good afternoon, it's 12:45.' Then it says, 'Good afternoon, it's 12:50,' then 'Good afternoon, it's 12:55.' It talks to itself all day long.''

494-> EASTERN AIRLINES WILL SHARPLY CUT STAFF AND SERVICE
In the latest, most drastic action to reduce its size, Eastern Airlines announced yesterday that it would lay off 4,000 employees, sharply cut back flights from its hub in Kansas City, Mo., and end service to 14 cities. Phil Bakes, president and chief executive of Eastern, said that the move meant Eastern was ''going back to its roots.'' He compared the steps to a strategic withdrawal ''where we can defend ourselves from competitors.'' ''Boston, New York, Washington, Atlanta, Miami - Eastern will continue to be a strong competitor in these and other core cities, including extensive service throughout Central and South America,'' Mr. Bakes said. ''Service in Florida and the Caribbean will remain Eastern's mainstay.'' Daily Flights to Fall to 1,085 When most of the changes take effect Aug. 31, the number of daily Eastern flights will drop to 1,085 from 1,225. Service is being ended to 14 destinations: Albuquerque, N.M.; Fort de France, Martinique; Las Vegas, Nev.; Reno; Minneapolis-St. Paul; Oklahoma City; Tulsa, Okla; Omaha; Dallas; San Antonio; Pointe-a-Pitre, Guadeloupe; San Diego; St. Lucia, West Indies, and Tucson, Ariz. Most of these destinations are served by other major carriers. Some industry experts welcomed the trims in the airline's flight schedule, especially the elimination of the Kansas City hub. ''It's getting rid of their weakest link,'' said John Pincavage, an airline analyst for Paine Webber. But the cutbacks, which will affect every major work group at the airline, will further deepen the bitterness that has developed between some Eastern employees and management, which has been seeking wage and benefit concessions from its unions. Further Intervention Possible Ultimately, this could bring further intervention from the Department of Transportation, which found after an investigation in June that Eastern was operating its flights safely but said that the bitter discord between management and labor posed a possible safety problem. The reductions represent about 12 percent of Eastern's work force of 32,000. The cuts will include up to 500 pilots, about 1,000 machinists and about 1,000 flight attendants. The rest will come from nonunion workers and management staff. In terms of regions, the biggest effect will be in the New York area, which will lose about 1,100 jobs, 600 from a reservation center in Woodbridge, N.J., and 500 from flight attendants, pilots and managers based at Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark airports. Miami will lose 520 jobs, Atlanta 300 and Kansas City about 350. Last November, Eastern eliminated 3,500 jobs in another major cost-cutting effort, with most of the layoffs coming from the union ranks. In September 1986, about 1,500 jobs were cut, primarily from Eastern's management ranks. The latest move by Eastern was promptly criticized by some of the carrier's unions. Jack Bavis, chairman of the Air Line Pilots Association, said the action was another example of taking assets out of Eastern for the benefit of Continental Airlines. Continental serves some of the cities where Eastern is discontinuing service, but it is unclear to what degree Continental might benefit. Both airlines are owned by the Texas Air Corporation, which is headed by Frank Lorenzo. In the past, Mr. Lorenzo has vowed that, unless Eastern's labor costs were reduced, he would shift Eastern's assets, including planes and landing slots, to where he said they could be more productive. Challenge on Labor Losts Mr. Bavis also challenged Eastern management's contention that the carrier's labor costs were out of line. He said that Eastern's average salary per employee ranked ninth among the major carriers in 1987. Mr. Bevis added that 82 percent of all major airline pilots were paid more that Eastern pilots. ''That alone puts the lie to the myth of high labor costs at Eastern,'' he said. In announcing the changes, Mr. Bakes said that the inability of the carrier to get agreements with its unions, such as the machinists, that call for cuts in wages and benefits was a reason for the retrenchment. But he did not make the strong attacks against the union that have been made in the past, reflecting efforts by Eastern's management and unions to temper their conflicts since the recent Federal investigation. William E. Brock 3d, the former Secretary of Labor, had brought together all the major union groups with Texas Air and Eastern's management, and they have signed a statement to work to lessen tension and increase understanding. Mr. Bakes said that Eastern's financial problems had no bearing on the agreement signed at the behest of Mr. Brock, and he reasserted Eastern's dedication to safety. He said Eastern would try to do everything possible to minimize the number of furloughs by offering early retirement and severance pay. ''There's a human element involved, especially in the cities from which we are withdrawing service,'' he said. ''It's not easy to tell talented people to look for other jobs.'' Investigation Into Fitness Last April, Jim Burnley, the Secretary of Transportation, ordered an investigation into the fitness of the management of Texas Air, Continental and Eastern to run airlines, and he ordered safety inspections of both carriers. The move was spurred by Texas Air's announcement that it would sell the Eastern shuttle to one of its subsidiaries. As a result of the move, Eastern lost bookings because the inspections disrupted its service and because many businesses and individual travelers lost confidence in the carrier. Eastern had a net loss of $64.5 million in the first quarter, although its operating loss was only $3 million. Mr. Bakes said yesterday that Eastern expected a ''sizable'' loss in the second quarter. Other carriers expect to have high earnings for the second quarter, when traffic was high and fares went up substantially. The Kansas City hub was built up in 1983 under the leadership of Frank Borman, then Eastern's chairman. Mr. Borman believed that expansion was the solution to Eastern's problems and resorted to cutbacks reluctantly. Big Debt and Interest Costs Mr. Borman also updated a large part of Eastern's fleet with new Airbus Industrie planes, seeking to build a more fuel-efficient fleet at a time of high fuel costs. But that strategy left the airline with a huge debt and interest costs that have been a major drag on its profitability. Braniff, which has lower operating costs than Eastern, is expanding in Kansas City and plans to make it a major hub. Mr. Pincavage of Paine Webber said that the hub forced Eastern to maintain full-time work forces at such outlying cities as Albuquerque, which had only a few flights a day to feed the hub at Kansas City. ''There were not enough flights to cover the fixed costs,'' the analyst said. He added that Eastern could sell off some of its surplus aircraft at a time when the demand for planes is strong. Mr. Bakes estimated that since August 1986, Eastern had generated $560 million by selling assets and making new borrowings. He said these steps had helped Eastern maintain cash reserves that totaled $420 million as of June 30. Union leaders have maintained that drastic cuts are not justified given Eastern's strong cash position, the fact that it almost broke even in the first quarter on an operating basis, and the relatively small gap between the airline's overall costs and those of other major carriers.

495-> CRIME
DEATH TAKES THE STAGE by Donald Ward (St. Martin's, $15.95) is an unusual first novel. Hard to pin down, it is a combination of tragedy and a kind of comedy that often verges on farce. It also has moments of terror, including a Grand Guignol scene that will be hard to forget. It pokes good-natured fun at the little-theater movement of Los Angeles and the egocentric types who slave there hoping for the big break. It takes a sensitive look at homosexuals. And, yes, there are murders and a nebbish theater agent who sets out to solve them. The organization of the book is a little loose, but Mr. Ward writes with verve and knows how to create real characters. One of the more memorable ones is a homosexual giant almost seven feet tall who pumps iron, has muscles bulging from here to there, is not very smart and has a tendency to cry at the least provocation. He is a truck driver, and when he plays ''La Boheme'' while making a haul his eyes are so teary that he can hardly see the road. The attractive thing about Mr. Ward's approach to this character and, indeed, all the others is that he likes people. He can satirize, but he is never mean. As for the agent, Jake Weissman, he is putty in the hands of a woman; his track record as a Lothario resembles that of a pimply adolescent. If he is not the most brilliant guy around, his new secretary, a dazzling Mexican woman, has enough brains to supply the entire Supreme Court and enough sex appeal to create a meltdown. Her attempted seduction of Jake is riotously funny. Poor Jake. But he comes through at the end, solving the murders and being saved just when all hope seems lost. There are indications that Mr. Ward, to whom nothing seems holy, is kidding around with the private-eye genre. Have a ball. A fresh new talent has arrived. * Whereas ''Death Takes the Stage'' is a frolic, BAD GUYS by Eugene Izzi (St. Martin's, $16.95) is grim, terse, veristic and bloody. It is the story of Jimbo Marino, an undercover cop in Chicago who helped set up a mobster. Working for the mobster is a vicious killer just out of jail. Marino sent him there, and the thug has only one thing on his mind - Marino. ''I want him.'' The killer goes on a rampage, first trying to take out his boss. Mr. Izzi focuses on the mob scene and its double-dealings. But basically this book is white knight (policeman) versus black knight (killer). Their chemistry is such that they must come face to face in a duel to the death. The killer actually keeps his promise - man to man, no guns. It will be revealing no secret to say that the fight is really something. The only defect in this otherwise taut, powerful piece of writing is in the sections toward the end where the author goes into some standard psychobabble in a misguided effort to explain his characters. * Bob Reiss, in SALTMAKER (Viking, $17.95), has written a big book on an implausible thesis. But it certainly does not lack for original and even startling ideas. A new President is faced with what appears to be a missile attack from the Soviet Union. He surrenders before finding out that there wasn't an attack; a meteor shower triggered the American defense system. Immediately the President resigns, and things start spinning out of control. In the eyes of the world, America is weak, the Soviet Union strong. In the United States there is turmoil. Overseas, terrorists attack American installations. Part of the book is courtroom drama, as the former President goes on trial for treason. Is he really a traitor? Or did he think he was saving the world from nuclear annihilation? At the end there is a ray of hope. Strong stuff, this, unbelievable as many of the situations are. The trouble is that Mr. Reiss does not have the literary skill to infuse life into his characters; they are all stereotypes of one kind or another. The book suffers from incessant, often annoying flashbacks. There is a great deal of padding. And there are also solecisms, especially the frequent use of ''like'' as a conjunction. ''Saltmaker'' will win no prize for distinguished prose.

496-> Daily Car Sales Down 7.2%
Sales of domestic cars and light trucks ran at a daily rate of 34,946 units in August, down 7.2 percent from the same month last year, according to final industry reports. Toyota Motor Manufacturing, which reported today, a day later than the other six domestic manufacturers, sold an average of 188 domestically made cars a day in August, up 34.1 percent. Daily rates are used because there were 27 selling days in August this year and 26 last year. In the last 10-day period of the month, the company sold 2,778 units, up 59.3 percent, bringing the domestic industry's total sales of cars and light trucks to 352,794 units, down 2.1 percent. There were nine selling days in the period this year and last year. Sales of imported light vehicles ran at an average rate of 12,744 units a day in August, down 21 percent, according to final data supplied today by Toyota and the Hyundai Motor Company, which also reported late. This is equivalent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.1 million imported cars. The actual results of Toyota and Hyundai did not affect previous estimates of annualized selling rates for domestic cars, put at about 7.4 million units in August.

498-> Dover Journal; Will the Port Boom Again? Just You Wait and See
For 14 weeks, this port town with its white cliffs has been the center of a strike by British seamen who work on English Channel ferries. It is the bitterest industrial conflict in Britain since Rupert Murdoch crushed Fleet Street's print unions in early 1986. The seamen's strike is the kind of seemingly senseless confrontation that even in the late 1980's Britain can be particularly, and sadly, given to producing. It is as much a clash of cultures as a dispute over pay, hours and working practices, a conflict tinged with the slogans and resentments of class warfare, with the workers and the bosses staring across an unbridgeable social divide, distrustful and intransigent. The ferry dispute has a strong political undercurrent because of the personalities and sympathies of the main players. The general secretary of the seamen's union is Sam McCluskie, a hulking, bearded, gravel-voiced union veteran, who is also treasurer of the opposition Labor Party. His adversary is Sir Jeffrey Sterling, chairman of the Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation Company, whose P & O European Ferries subisidiary is the main Channel ferry operator. The Financial Times called Sir Jeffrey the ''apotheosis of Thatcherite capitalism,'' an image enhanced by his status as an unpaid special adviser to the Thatcher Government and his company's generous contributions to the Conservative Party, nearly $190,000 last year. Union and Company Hardened With the passing weeks, the management's position hardened, while the union remained defiant. At his annual shareholders meeting Friday, Sir Jeffrey declared, ''The time for negotiating is past.'' Earlier last week, the union's funds were sequestered by court order for an illegal sympathy strike by seamen against Sealink, the second-largest ferry company. Mr. McCluskie responded: ''They can take our money, but they can't take our dignity. They can't take our hearts and they can't take our minds.'' The present deadlock could hardly have been foreseen when Sir Jeffrey first met with union officials last October to discuss changes in working practices. The company wanted the seamen, who earn between $21,000 and $32,000 a year, to work more shifts. The union leaders did not dispute the need for some changes, given the challenges ahead for the industry. The ferries will face new competition from the Channel Tunnel, linking Britain and France, which is scheduled to open in 1993. To remain competitive, the ferries may have to reduce their fares for passengers and freight by 12 percent. The other major challenge for the industry stems from the 1992 deadline for transforming Western Europe into a single market. Under proposals by the European Community, value-added tax would be extended to ferry fares. In addition, duty-free sales of tobacco, alcohol and consumer items would be phased out. Duty-free sales alone represent an estimated 25 percent of cross-Channel ferry revenues. The strike began in February, when the P & O European Ferries' 2,300 seamen got caught up in a separate dispute over working practices between the union and a small ferry company operating in the Irish Sea, the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company. The union viewed that dispute as a showdown in the ferry industry generally and struck in support of the Isle of Man seamen. The seamen's union also walked out on Sealink. Service Out for 3 Months With both major companies strike-bound, cross-channel ferry traffic from Dover virtually ceased for more than three months. But at the end of April, P & O was able to get 2 of its 11 ferries back into service. Sir Jeffrey pulled it off when he said his company no longer recognized the National Union of Seamen. He then hired back a few hundred seamen who were willing to defy the union. P & O has said that it plans to gradually return to a full service by recruiting nonunion seamen. Today, it appears the union chose a fight for which it was ill prepared and now stands little chance of winning. For its part, P & O seems bent on crushing the union. ''It's just union bashing now - that's all,'' said Maurice Pritchard, a 55-year-old member of the seamen's port committee. ''I don't know what the outcome will be, except hard feelings and suffering. Nobody wins in a strike.'' Dover, a city of about 30,000 people dependent on ferry traffic, is the biggest loser. The bed-and-breakfast hotels along the shore, usually packed with travellers at this time of year, are deserted. Retail sales held up during the early weeks of the strike, but are now down an estimated 40 percent. Two soup kitchens have been set up for the seamen and their families. Local business leaders, Government and port officials have written to both sides, urging them to resume talks. 'A Tragedy for Dover' ''It's a tragedy for Dover,'' said Ron Dryden, general manager of the town's main shopping center. ''And it seems to be the result of faults on both sides, a self-inflicted wound. Merchant seamen are a proud, close-knit fraternity. Yet the strike has divided families, friends and neighborhoods, as some seamen chose to cross the picket lines to return to work and others remain out. One seaman who returned to work, John Rice, explained that he had to go back to keep up with mortgage payments. Besides, Mr. Rice added, ''the strike cannot be won.'' Neil O'Hare, a striking petty officer, noted that his next door neighbor had returned to work. ''No matter what happens, people won't forget,'' Mr. O'Hare said. ''There will be bad feelings among people who used to be friends for a long time.''

499-> Review/Dance; Margie Gillis Combines Styles Of 3 Cultures
Margie Gillis opened her weeklong engagement at the Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, on Tuesday evening with a piece that merged flamenco, African and Indian dance forms. Set to percussive music by J. F. Fabiano, Ms. Gillis's new ''Roots of the Rhythm Remain'' allowed her to pull out the stops, dressed in battered splendor and moving before a big orange moon. The point of such a synthesis was not clear. But the solo suggested that these generalized national styles do have in common a thrusting into the floor, a strong emphasis on the way the feet make contact with the floor and the use of arms to enhance rhythm. And Ms. Gillis, a Canadian choreographer, established herself as a dancer of impressive physical control in a dance that was at least as daring as taking on a 75-minute program of solos. Like Ms. Gillis, the piece was in turn assertive, meditative and passionate. But too often the seven solos on the program seemed to serve most as a pretext for those quick changes of mood and emphasis. Ms. Gillis, who has an enthusiastic international following, has been called ''the dance world's short-story choreographer,'' but her imagery is so general that it never offers the kind of startlingly specific and revealing detail that creates a universe. For the most part, the solos conjured visions of wide-open plains that breed ecstasy and a sense of freedom to move through space. Emotion or character is pretty much a matter of overlay, indicated more through Ms. Gillis's circling and quivering and her tossing of her magnificent head of hair than through vivid detail. There were two exceptions. Ms. Gillis was carried along to some extent in ''Waltzing Matilda'' by the affecting Tom Waits song to which it is set. But she also showed the connections between the dance's broken and completed lines and between its stagger and waltz, and got into the territory between those poles. Her ''Give Me Your Heart Tonight,'' set to a rock song by Shakin' Stevens, is a dance for a floppy doll with oomph who fails to rise, not too unhappily, in what might be an amusing commentary on female submissiveness. Physical detail came alive there. And there was a single step forward in ''Testimony of the Rose'' that had a simplicity and vigor that made one long to see more daring use made of her bold physicality.

501-> Patents; 3-D Devices for Surgery And Flight Simulation
Two inventions that imitate three-dimensional images on a flat screen received patents this week. Daniel Wright, a doctoral candidate in physics at the University of Illinois in Urbana, designed a system that he thinks could help plastic surgeons reconstruct faces. Mr. Wright's invention begins with a still camera that takes scores of pictures of every angle of the face. When combined, the pictures replicate the full face. A desktop computer, using software developed by Mr. Wright, then converts these images into digital data. The software offers an image of the face and what it would look like if certain features, like the nose, cheeks or chin, were modified. A plastic surgeon could then examine the effect of these changes from different perspectives. A key element of his system, Mr. Wright said, is replicating the shadows caused by the contours in a face. Such shadows can make a lean person appear gaunt or a muscular person appear beefy. By incorporating a mathematical model representing shadows into his software, Mr. Wright's program tries to simulate their effect from all sides. In a separate development, inventors at a Dutch technical school took a different approach to 3-D. Trying to re-create the sense of depth in human vision, the inventors have taken advantage of a principle known as ''motion parallax.'' Motion parallax governs the way objects appear to move when the eyes or head are shifted. When a person looks at an object and then turns his or her head to the right, things in front of the object appear to move to the left. Things behind the object appear to move to the right. Though most people never realize it, this phenomenon supplies a guide to gauging the relative distance of objects. A device developed in part for airplane simulation at Technische Hogeschool Delft, in the Netherlands, works on the same principle. The device trains a video camera on a fixed point in front of the scene or object to be watched. An observer watches the screen displaying this scene and is linked to the camera so that the camera mimics the person's head movement. The result creates an impression of depth, as a person's brain decodes the movement of the scene in relation to the fixed reference point. According to the patent, the invention could have uses in engineering and surgery as well as in flight simulation. Mr. Wright received patent 4,757,379. Technische Hogeschool Delft received patent 4,757,380.

502-> Mexico's Plans For Air Service
The Government today announced a major restructuring of air service after a two-week strike and bankruptcy at its Aeromexico airline. The Communications and Transportation Department said a commission would study forming a new trunk airline to replace Aeromexico, especially for the 15 Mexican cities now left without any major air service. Among the regional, privately owned airlines expected to benefit the most are Aeromar in central Mexico, Aero-California in the northwest and Aero-Caribe in the southeast. The daily business publication El Financiero said the Government and unions might still work out a plan to resume Aeromexico service on its most viable routes, to 10 or 14 Mexican cities, by as early as late this week.

505-> Reagan, Rejecting Navy's Advice, Promises Canada Sub Technology
President Reagan overrode opposition from senior Navy officers and told Prime Minister Brian Mulroney today that he would approve a Canadian purchase of nuclear submarines using American reactor technology. The President assured Mr. Mulroney that he would also recommend to Congress that it approve the transfer of the sensitive nuclear technology. The United States has been wary of sharing its nuclear technology with other nations, and previously had allowed only Britain to use the reactor technology. To Acquire 10 to 12 Subs Canada is planning to acquire 10 to 12 nuclear submarines to patrol its territorial waters beneath the Arctic ice cap. It is considering the British Trafalgar-class sub as well as French vessels. If it decides on the British submarine, which employs American technology in its reactor system, consideration by both Congress and the President would be required. This is necessary under the agreement that covered the original sale to Britain of the technology for the Trafalgar-class subs. The nuclear submarine issue was only one of many matters, including trade policy and the environment, discussed by the two leaders as Mr. Mulroney's visit to Washington began today. About half of a meeting this morning was spent discussing acid rain, which the Canadians regard as the sorest issue between the two countries. Opposition in Navy to Deal Senior United States Navy officials have expressed opposition to a Canadian-British submarine deal. They have voiced concerns that the United States could be blamed for a nuclear accident aboard a submarine with an inexperienced Canadian crew. They also have expressed the belief that Canada's limited defense budget should be spent elsewhere. In Canada, senior officials have dismissed Washington's publicly expressed concerns, including the desire to avoid accidents aboard Canadian submarines, as a pretext. They contend that the reason for the United States Navy's opposition to the Canadian plan is that the Canadian submarines could locate American nuclear submarines that regularly use the channels and passages that thread through Canada's Arctic archipelago, on missions that currently go unreported to Canada. For two decades, Canada has been increasingly concerned about challenges to its sovereignty in the Arctic, but it has been unable to persuade the United States to acknowledge Canadian sovereignty over the Northwest Passage, the main waterway through the archipelago, or to agree to notify Canada of American submarine activity in the region. The Canadians say this policy is short-sighted because it could invite penetration of the area by Soviet subs seeking polar routes to missile-firing stations within reach of American targets. In addition to the naval officers, some members of Congress have also expressed doubts about the wisdom of the submarine technology transfer. Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, a state where nuclear submarines are constructed, said in a statement today, ''My own private discussions among our senior military reveals a skepticism which will be explored extensively.'' He said he planned to call hearings on the issue. But after today's meeting between Mr. Reagan and Mr. Mulroney, a senior Administration official said: ''After a careful review of the views of his senior advisers, the President has determined that if the Canadians selected the Trafalgar design, the interests of the United States are best served by agreeing to the British request. We have so informed both the British and Canadian Governments.'' In their discussions on acid rain, Mr. Mulroney urged President Reagan and Congress to act to reduce the problem, which he said was ''despoiling'' both countries. Members of Congress responded enthusiastically to the proposal, but the President reportedly gave Mr. Mulroney little encouragement. Acid rain is pollution from coal and oil burned by power plants, factories and vehicles, chiefly oxides of sulfur and nitrogen that are transformed chemically as they travel through the atmosphere and settle on the surface of the earth as acidic rain, snow, fog or dry particles. The Canadian Government has repeatedly complained that acid rain originating in the United States is destroying its eastern lakes and forests. Mr. Mulroney told Mr. Reagan today that an agreement between the two countries to end the destruction caused by acid rain was ''inevitable'' and that ''it was not a question of whether but when, and the sooner the better,'' senior Canadian officials reported. The President said he would ''reflect'' on Canada's proposal for an agreement between the two countries to limit the pollution that causes acid rain, the Canadian officials reported. But they also said that in response to Mr. Mulroney's plea, the President repeated the ''predictable American view'' that the United States had already made progress in reducing such pollution, that it is committing money to develop technology to enable coal to burn cleanly and that the scientific evidence of the damage caused by acid rain is not clear. While not completely slamming the door on a plan to control acid rain, the President left the Canadians with little hope he would act on this issue. While he did not specifically appeal to Congress over the President's head, Mr. Mulroney made a strong plea in his speech to a joint meeting of the House and Senate today for United States action to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide, a chief component of acid rain, by 50 percent. His exhortation was vigorously applauded. Legislation to amend the Clean Air Act, including provisions to reduce acid rain, is pending in Congress. In his speech to Congress today, Mr. Mulroney called acid rain ''a rapidly escalating ecological tragedy,'' in the United States as well as in Canada.

506-> Mets Find Spark For a Late Surge
There is a sign that hangs on the wall of Chuck Tanner's office in the corner of the Braves' clubhouse. It read, ''Only One Way.'' Well, the arrow next to it may point up, but every other sign lately appears to indicate things are headed in the opposite direction. The Mets, who managed to advance only two runners into scoring position for eight innings, scored five runs in the ninth tonight to gain a 5-2 triumph and hand the Braves their 15th defeat in 18 games this season, a record for ineptitude outdone only by those redoubtable Orioles from Baltimore. ''That was the toughest loss we had all year,'' said Tanner, the manager of the Braves, who obviously had ample choices from which to select. ''A base on balls and a hanging curveball did us in.'' With the Mets trailing by 2-0, Tim Teufel led off the ninth by walking on five pitches. Keith Hernandez then drove Paul Assenmacher's second pitch just inside the right-field foul pole for his third home run in two games. ''I'm not saying I'm hot,'' maintained Hernandez, who had been lost at the plate for the entire season before driving in seven runs Tuesday night. ''But the slump is over. I'm dangerous at the plate.'' But then so is any batter when there is an Atlanta reliever on the mound. An infield single by Kevin McReynolds and another one ripped to left by Gary Carter, who was thrown out trying to stretch it into a double, was enough for Tanner to opt for Charlie Puleo in favor of Assen macher. What Puleo did then, though, was enough to make Tanner want to cry. After intentionally walking Howard Johnson to put runners at first and third with two outs, Puleo forced in the winning run by walking both Dave Magadan and Len Dykstra. Puleo had been ahead 0-2 in the count on Dykstra. ''I've been on teams that struggled,'' said Mookie Wilson, who drove in the final two runs with a single through the middle. ''I know what happens. What should work almost always doesn't.'' Good Game for Smith Zane Smith had worked seven superb innings for the Braves before a tightened left arm ended his game. Indeed, the Mets complained they couldn't see Smith's pitches, much less connect with them. ''The only time I saw the ball good was my last time at bat,'' said Hernandez. ''Games late in the afternoon are murder here. The ball goes from dark to light to back into shadows.'' The game started in late afternoon and in the course of the evening, Ron Darling was reintroduced to the unenviable experience of pitching well and then having nothing to show for it. Darling, who earned no decision in 10 of his first 17 starts a year ago, allowed the Braves two runs on four hits, while striking out five in seven innings. David Cone pitched a perfect eighth inning and got the victory, with Roger McDowell allowing one hit in the ninth and notching his first save of the year. No Bad Games ''He hasn't had a bad game yet,'' Hernandez said of Darling. ''He deserves a better record.'' The Braves, meanwhile, can only hope for a more rewarding future. ''They are a young team, a team with some inexperience,'' said Howard Johnson. ''It's going to take time. But they are a major-league team. There's some talent. I wasn't here, but I hear the Mets were the same way five or six years ago.'' For eight innings, the Mets mounted a respectable reprise of those forgotten antics. They lost balls in the sun, got picked off base, hit nothing but polite little singles. All of which put them three outs from the rude indignity of losing to the Braves. ''They are, probably, the premier ballclub,'' Tanner said of the Mets. ''And we were playing beautifully against them. To see it all go for naught, that's the tough part.'' Dale Murphy, the All-Star outfielder, again played the leading part in what otherwise has been a meager Atlanta offense. His second home run of the year to lead off the fourth gave them a 1-0 advantage, one they doubled later in the inning on Ken Oberkfell's r.b.i. triple over Darryl Strawberry's head in right. ''But when you are going like them, something always goes wrong,'' said Johnson. ''They seem, right now, to be a victim of that.'' Judging by his sign, Tanner appears to be, among other things, a victim of false optimism.

507-> AMTRAK PLANS A STOP IN YONKERS
SIXTY parking spaces and a few signposts are all that stand in the way of new Amtrak rail service at Yonkers, according to Amtrak officials and Mayor Nicholas C. Wasicsko of Yonkers. Amtrak has given preliminary approval to a new stop at Yonkers, but before the 18 Amtrak trains that roll through the station daily can stop for passengers, a few details must be worked out. The city must build the parking lot and put up new Amtrak signs, while Amtrak negotiates particulars of scheduling and ticket sales with Metro-North, the commuter railroad that owns the tracks and the station at Yonkers. Service at the station will probably begin next October, an Amtrak spokesman said last week. ''We just have to make sure the city will do the things it needs to do, and then we have to negotiate with Metro-North,'' said David Carol, director of government affairs for the rail line. The city is negotiating with the Parking Authority, said a mayoral spokesman, Steven Cohn. Yonkers officials said they hoped that the new stop would help revitalize the downtown neighborhood of the station, Mr. Cohn said. Announcing Amtrak's decision last week, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato and Representative Joseph J. DioGuardi, both Republicans, praised Amtrak's decision and predicted quick approval by Metro-North. Mr. D'Amato also said the additional passengers using the station could help the neighborhood. ''Adding the Yonkers stop would not only give residents of southern Westchester County more convenient access to Amtrak rail service but would be a tremendous asset to the City of Yonkers in its effort to revitalize the downtown waterfront area,'' Mr. D'Amato said. The Senator set up the first meetings last year between rail officials and former Mayor Angelo R. Martinelli of Yonkers. The new stop ''is great news for the residents of Westchester - it will be a major convenience for area residents,'' Mr. DioGuardi said. He added that the Yonkers stop would complement the Amtrak station already operating in Croton-on-Hudson. The proposal's only critic is the State Department of Transportation, which is worried that the extra stop on the New York to Albany line will cause delays and scheduling problems. After spending nearly $100 million to upgrade the tracks and trains three years ago, the Transportation Department is balking at the five-minute stop at Yonkers, fearing it will snarl connecting schedules. ''We cut nearly 40 minutes out of the trip and ridership has doubled,'' said Mark Silo, the department's director of inner-city rail passenger service. ''We're now looking at reversing something we paid a lot of money to improve.'' The state will not formally oppose Amtrak's plans, but it is questioning whether Amtrak needs to make three stops within the Metro-North Hudson Line zone, Mr. Silo said. ''Three stops, that's a lot, and we're concerned about that,'' Mr. Silo said. Currently, to travel north toward Albany, Westchester residents now must ride south on Metro-North to Grand Central Terminal and pick up Amtrak there, or take commuter trains north to the Amtrak station at Croton-on-Hudson. The third station referred to is at Poughkeepsie. Metro-North, a subsidiary of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority serving Westchester, Putnam and Dutchess Counties and Connecticut, supports the new stop but has had no formal negotiations with Amtrak yet, a spokesman said. ''It's fine with us; we have no problems with it,'' said David Brucker, a Metro-North spokesman. Amtrak agreed to the new stop after a marketing study indicated that it could yield $1 million in new ticket revenues, Mr. Carol said. Both Mr. Carol and Mr. Brucker cited the success of the recently opened Amtrak stop at New Rochelle, a Metro-North station on the New York-to-Boston line. Ticket sales on that line are up 45 percent since Amtrak began service in New Rochelle in October, Mr. Carol said. ''New Rochelle is working just great, and we hope the same thing happens in Yonkers,'' Mr. Brucker said.

512-> Punishing Toshiba Is a Secondary Boycott; Again, Overproduction
To the Editor: In ''A New Depression? Entirely Possible'' (Op-Ed, March 31), Sam Nakagama repeats the old argument that the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, signed in June 1930, caused the Great Depression. His warning that new protectionist legislation may cause another crash is the usual mixture of good economics and bad history. Six weeks before Smoot-Hawley was signed, the financier Bernard M. Baruch called for a ''worldwide supreme court of business'' to solve the overproduction crisis. Early in 1931, the National Industrial Conference Board called overproduction the major problem. While economists disagreed, excessive competition (too many producers chasing the same customers) was widely blamed in the early 30's; Presidents Herbert Hoover and Franklin D. Roosevelt labeled it the cause of the disaster. Tariffs and other forms of ''protectionism'' occur only after overcapacity and overproduction (glut) take hold. It is as silly now as it was in 1930 to argue that the United States, Europe, Japan and other countries can produce and sell an infinite quantity of exports while buying an infinite quantity of imports from one another. Tariffs are indeed clumsy responses to the chaos of global surplus, just as colonialism (selling at gunpoint) was at the turn of the century. Baruch, Hoover, Roosevelt and others correctly implied that long-term multinational quotas might be needed. One day, the fallacies of economic theory must give way to some respect for common sense and his-tory. FREDERICK C. THAYER, Professor, Graduate School of Public and International Affairs University of Pittsburgh, March 31, 1988

514-> New Company Finds Success Selling 'Champagne of Teas'
IN a storefront in downtown New Bedford, Mass., a 32-year-old entrepreneur, Sam Barrows, is busy packing his imported Darjeeling tea. What distinguishes Barrows's brand Darjeeling Tea from other Darjeelings is its single-estate provenance: it is one of a handful of unblended Darjeeling teas sold in this country. ''Most Darjeelings you buy come from different estates in India,'' said Mr. Barrows. ''I read that Darjeeling tastes best unblended, so that's why I imported it uncut.'' The tea is robust yet smooth, with no aftertaste. Mr. Barrows's decision to import tea, and only one tea at first, evolved over several years. Having his own business was an overriding goal, he said, and importing seemed an attractive way to achieve that. His first inclination was to import wine or beer, but that kind of importing, he found, is very competitive and highly regulated. Then, six years ago, he researched the tea industry at night while working as an options clerk in Philadelphia. Putting his own taste preferences aside, he knew his first tea product would have to be English style because of a tradition in his family: visits to his home by his maternal grandmother, a native of England, always called for a pot of Twining's Earl Grey tea. But a basic consideration regarding the choice of black tea also prevailed: 'My father's only rule, in raising my four brothers and me, was no coffee or cigarettes until you reach 16,'' he said. That left tea. ''At first I contacted the well-known English tea companies to see if they were interested in importing in America,'' he said, ''But most were already here, and those that weren't had no desire to be.'' Mr. Barrows then wrote letters directly to the tea estates in India to obtain samples, to no avail. Eventually he received samples from tea brokers in London and in Calcutta, India. The delicately flavored Darjeelings, which are grown on some 60 estates in the northern Indian province of Bengal, are known as the champagne of teas. The leaves are picked in June and in October, and no two harvests are consistently alike, depending on how wet, dry, hot or cold the weather has been, Mr. Barrows said. He purchased his first 100 kilograms of loose tea in 1986, having tasted teas from 20 Darjeeling estates. A friend who owns an advertising agency in Boston designed his company's large blue tea boxes with their elegant cameo of a setting sun, a mountain range, the ocean and a clipper ship. Mr. Barrows said the mountains recalled his days as a student at Colorado State University and that the sun, ocean and ship represented his childhood summers on the Massachusetts shore. Though initial sales for the young company were modest, eventually they picked up, thanks to his calls on buyers, sample giveaways, word of mouth and some attention by the news media. Prestigious stores began to order and reorder the tea. In New York, Barrows's Darjeeling Tea is sold at Balducci's, 424 Avenue of the Americas (Ninth Street); Zabar's, 2245 Broadway (80th Street), and Danal, 90 East 10th Street. It is also sold at the J. Bildner & Sons stores in Boston and at 70 specialty grocers around the country. The price is about $5 for four ounces. Barrows's tea must compete with such well-known English teas as Twining's and Jackson's of Piccadilly. ''The competition is old and established, with huge financial backing,'' Mr. Barrows said. ''But I think I offer a superior tea.'' After the success of his Darjeeling, Mr. Barrows plans to introduce two more loose teas in early July: American Breakfast, an Irish breakfast-style tea using a blend of Assam and Ceylon teas, and Sencha, a Japanese green tea. ''I named the one tea American because this is an American tea company and I'm an American,'' he said. ''I chose the Sencha because little is sold in the U.S. and store owners kept asking me, 'When are you coming out with a decaffeinated product?' '' Sencha is the most common variety of Japanese green tea, but very little of it is exported, he said. With other tea products in mind for the future, Mr. Barrows admitted that his goals were very ambitious. ''I want to capture 50 percent of the gourmet loose tea market within the next 10 years,'' he said. ''But more than anything, I want to be the most respected tea name in America.''

515-> BUSINESS PEOPLE; Presidio Oil's Head Buys Companies in Bad Times
George P. Giard Jr., chairman and chief executive of the Presidio Oil Company, says he is employing the J. Paul Getty strategy of buying up oil businesses during bad times. ''If you're a student of history, and I am,'' Mr. Giard said, ''we're doing something not very different from what Paul Getty did in the 30's and 40's.'' Mr. Giard, who is 49, has made two acquisitions since he took control of Presidio in 1986, and last week he went after the Sabine Corporation, a company with more reserves than Presidio. So far Sabine has not responded to Presidio's bid of $20 a share, or $256 million. Presidio already has its financing lined up with the Chase Manhattan Bank. Presidio's acquisitions, a private company in Dallas called the Petroleum Development Corporation and the Kaiser Energy division of Kaiser Aluminum, built it into a company with oil and gas equivalents totaling 21 million barrels. Sabine has some 32 million barrels in reserves, Mr. Giard said. Presidio and Sabine are not huge; Presidio's revenues are only $7 million and Sabine's $69 million. But Mr. Giard hopes to build a company with revenues in the billions, he said. His plans are to operate only on shore in the United States in regions ''where we know the oil and gas fields very well,'' he added. ''Sabine's assets are almost exclusively in the areas that we operate in.'' Mr. Giard grew up in Dallas, where Sabine is based and where Presidio has offices. His time is split between Dallas; Denver, where Presidio has its headquarters; Charleston, W. Va, where it has gas operations, and New York City. He is a graduate of Georgetown University and spent three years studying law at Oxford as a Rhodes scholar before entering the Columbia Law School, from which he was graduated in 1966. At the New York law firm of Davis Polk & Wardwell, he gravitated to oil industry matters. ''I had worked summers as a roustabout on rigs and they quickly found out I knew something about the business,'' he said. Mr. Giard then went directly into the business, joining the Pan Ocean Oil Corporation, a small enterprise that had a large exploration success. He became president in the early 1970's and did extremely well financially when the company was sold to Marathon Oil in 1976 for $265 million. For the next decade he was a private investor in the oil business. Then he put together an investment group, including two British companies, and invested $7.5 million in Presidio, becoming its chief executive. Although the price of oil had plummeted, Presidio was able to make a successful public offering in the spring of 1986. The company, Mr. Giard said, was able to attract investors because of its strategy. ''Our plan was to take advantage of the depression in the industry and that's what we are doing,'' he added.

516-> Cuomo Imposes Hiring Halt and Plans Program Cuts
Two weeks after he announced that the state was facing a $900 million budget shortfall, Governor Cuomo today imposed a hiring freeze on all state agencies and proposed spending cuts that would eliminate about 600 jobs. The cuts would curtail programs ranging from water pollution control efforts to the ''I Love New York'' advertising campaign. The hiring freeze and the cuts, as well as some proposed new revenues, are supposed to save the state about $400 million. Mr. Cuomo said the hiring freeze would be lifted from an agency once it submitted alternative cost-cutting measures. He said that many of the cuts would require legislative action. To close the remainder of the gap, Mr. Cuomo proposed reclaiming most of a $650 million fund set aside last year for use on housing, roads and bridges. That move, which would also require legislative approval, would mean that the projects the fund was supposed to pay for, including a program to build more than 2,000 units of housing for homeless families in New York City, would not be guaranteed financing beyond this year. Looking for Immediate Action In the last two weeks, Mr. Cuomo, who faced a $1.8 billion deficit in his first year as Governor and has built his reputation on restoring the state's finances, has sought to convince the Legislature that the budget shortfall requires immediate action. He reiterated that message today at an afternoon news conference, where he said, ''It would be an error and a substantial one, damaging to the state in a number of different ways, if we sought to put off this problem.'' He also warned that a delay in dealing with the shortfall would jeopardize the state's chances of borrowing $3 billion through a proposed transportation bond issue. Questioning Motives But his remarks appeared to have little impact on the Legislature, where many lawmakers have questioned the Governor's motives for rushing to cut spending before many of the year's tax revenues have even been collected. The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, John J. Marchi, Republican of Staten Island, said that ''having presented us with an instant deficit a few weeks ago,'' the Governor ''has now provided an instant solution.'' Some members of the Democratic-controlled Assembly, who have taken pains recently not to break with Mr. Cuomo on budget issues, questioned why his proposal relied so heavily on cuts in social and economic development programs and so little on increased revenues. The Governor's proposal includes plans to raise $47 million in new revenues, some of this by taking advantage of new Federal aid formulas. Mr. Cuomo's proposal, outlined in a 92-page booklet, is based at least in part on recommendations from agency heads, and today several commissioners said they would not cause significant service reductions. New York City's budget director, Paul Dickstein, said that it appeared that the proposed cuts would have only ''a very minor impact'' on the city's operating budget. But he questioned how the state could guarantee projects that were supposed to be financed out of the $650 million reserve fund, such as the housing program for the homeless, at the same time that the Governor wants to tap the fund to close the budget gap. 'Pay as You Go' The Governor's budget director, Dall W. Forsythe, said that after this year, the projects would have to be paid for on a ''pay as you go'' basis. The $650 million fund, part of which was to pay for the proposed transportation bond issue, has been a prime candidate for cutting. The fund was set up last year when the state discovered hundreds of millions of dollars in surplus revenues. Many financial analysts now say that the surplus last year was caused by the same forces that led to this year's shortfall - Federal tax code changes that prompted many state taxpayers to realize capital gains at the close of 1986. Under the Governor's plan, $600 million would be transferred out of the fund, but only half of that would go directly to closing the gap. The other half would go into the state's Tax Stabilization Fund, and would be withdrawn later as needed. Delays in Spending Many of the cuts are not supposed to be permanent reductions, but simply spending delays. Deferring some rehabilitation projects at the City University of New York, for example, is supposed to save $625,000. A one-month delay in filling 181 new positions at the Department of Environmental Conservation is supposed to save $490,000. Other cuts, however, involve the elimination of entire divisions of state government, including the Division of Servicemen's Voting, whose elimination would result in the saving of $30,000, and the Environmental Facilities Corporation, whose elimination would save $349,000. Among the agencies hardest hit by the Governor's proposed cuts is the State University of New York, which the Governor attacked in his budget presentation in January for its reluctance to propose spending cuts for itself. About $16 million in cuts are proposed out of the university system's general operating aid of about $1.2 billion. In addition, Mr. Cuomo has proposed raising state university tuition for out-of-state students to $4,700 a year, from $3,200. Under the Governor's proposal, tuition at the City University of New York would increase to $4,050 a year, from $2,550. The Governor also proposed that there be no increase in the state's Tuition Assistance Program. Since an increase in the program has been tied to approval for Mr. Cuomo's Liberty Scholarship plan, which would insure poor students enough money to attend college, it was unclear whether the scholarship plan would survive. While the Governor has stopped short of calling for across-the-board cuts, he has called on the Legislature and the Judiciary to follow his example and cut at least 1 percent from their budgets. The Governor has proposed a cut of $85,000 in the executive chamber's $8.5 million budget. In addition, Mr. Cuomo, in what is likely to bononofofisisososununpopular proposals, the Governor has also asked the Legislature to trim $2 million from its member items, programs sponsored by legislators for their own districts. The programs, which range from Little League uniforms to centers for the elderly, have come under criticism in recent years as diminutive ''pork barrel'' projects.

518-> Baker Voices Trade Doubts
Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d cast doubt today on the ability of countries to open up trade in agriculture. His remarks came just one day after the Group of Seven industrial nations resisted Reagan Administration appeals to work toward eliminating export aid to farmers. In a speech here, Mr. Baker said two-country accords, such as the American-Canadian agreement that Congress is now considering, might prove a way to force other countries to capitulate. Mr. Baker has on occasion cited the bilateral approach to freeing trade as an alternative to multilateralism, but after the struggle at the summit conference over agriculture, the area in which the Administration considers protectionism the most egregious, his threat to turn to more bilateral solutions was significant. Mr. Baker said that if multilateral initiatives fail, ''we might be willing to explore a market liberalization club approach'' to expand trade in North America. An American-Canadian agreement, he said, might help force other countries to talk.

519-> FOLLOW-UP ON THE NEWS; Seat Belts For Trains?
AFTER Amtrak's worst passenger train collision, in which 16 people were killed and 178 injured, John Riley, administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration, said he would seek comments from railroads on whether trains in the busy Northeast Corridor should have seat belts. The Amtrak train collided with three Conrail diesel engines near Baltimore in January 1987. Mr. Riley, the Government's top railroad safety officer, said he wanted to hear what railroad officials had to say about seat belts for Amtrak and commuter trains in the corridor between Washington and Boston. ''We have not pursued it,'' says a spokesman for the Railroad Administration, William Loftus. ''Amtrak was not interested in pursuing it.'' Instead, an Amtrak spokesman says, the railroad is installing retention devices to keep overhead luggage and other objects from flying about in a crash. And on seats it is putting plastic guards on sharp metal corners that might become exposed and injure passengers.

520-> FOLLOW-UP ON THE NEWS; Paying Damages For a Lynching
IT WAS a year ago this month that a Federal jury in Mobile, Ala., decided that when Ku Klux Klansmen commit violence, not only they - but the group to which they belong - can be held liable for damages. The jury decided that the United Klans of America and six Klansmen must pay $7 million to the family of a 19-year-old black man, Michael Donald, who was beaten, strangled and left hanging in a tree in 1981. In May 1987, the victim's 67-year-old mother, Beulah Mae Donald, received as partial settlement of the judgment the deed to the Klan headquarters near Tuscaloosa, Ala. She planned to sell the two-story building and its 6.5 acres of wooded land. News reports said the property had a market value of $225,000. It is scheduled to be sold within a month - for about $55,000, reports Morris Dees, executive director of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Mobile, who is helping Mrs. Donald. Trying to sell property that has ''the taint of the Klan'' and is ''sitting up in the woods'' 15 miles from Tuscaloosa has not been easy, he says. ''We have a contract for the sale of the building right now,'' Mr. Dees says, ''but I'm not at liberty to say who the buyer is.'' Premature publicity, he notes, ''has scared off several buyers.'' Mrs. Donald meanwhile has obtained a bank loan in expectation of collecting damages and has moved from public housing into a modern house that she bought in ''a very good section'' of Mobile, Mr. Dees says. State Senator Michael Figures is seeking further assets for Mrs. Donald from Klansmen who were defendants in the damage suit. He says he has moved to garnishee 25 percent of the after-tax wages of William O'Connor, a shipyard worker, and to attach a house and six acres belonging to Bennie Jack Hays. But there is no hope that Mrs. Donald will ever collect the full $7 million judgment that the family won. ''We might end up getting $150,000 total for her,'' Mr. Dees says.

521-> BRIDGE; Touching All the Bases At the Five Level
NOBODY noticed it at the time, but one deal in the 1987 world championships in Jamaica, shown in the diagram, produced a combination of circumstances that is probably unique on a major occasion: At all four tables in the semifinal play-offs the five-level was reached. All four suits were selected for the final contract. The only North player who did not judge his hand worth opening was the American representative, Mike Lawrence of Kensington, Calif. The majority of experts would certainly open, since the distribution is promising and the high cards are in the long suits; but he took a cautious position. He was probably planning to hint at slam when his partner opened one diamond, but five diamonds was the only sensible action when his right-hand opponent jumped to four hearts. The normal lead of the heart ace would have doomed the contract, but West chose the spade eight. The usual reason for leading a singleton did not apply, but West was reluctant to establish a hypothetical king in the declarer's hand. It might seem that the American declarer, Hugh Ross of Oakland, Calif., was headed for a one-trick defeat even after the reprieve of the opening lead. But he was able to give the defenders a problem. The spade eight was covered by the nine, queen and ace. He then drew trumps, cashed the spade king and the club ace, and ruffed the club queen. Since West had shown himself reluctant to lead his long heart suit, the singleton king was quite likely to be in the East hand. Ross therefore entered his hand with a spade lead to the jack and reached this ending: South now put his Taiwanese opponent to the test by leading a heart. West now realized that he had to guess the location of the heart king. With the actual distribution it was essential to play the ace, swallowing his partner's king in a crocodile coup situation. When he chose to play the jack, on the assumption that South held the king, East had to win and sooner or later concede a fatal ruff-and-sluff. In the replay South was again declarer, but this time in five spades after he had shown that suit in response to one diamond. This time the lead was the heart ace, and West followed cleverly with the heart nine. This forced East to ruff, and he worked out correctly that his partner wanted a diamond ruff. West could have achieved the same result by cashing the heart queen, but he could not know that his partner held a trump trick. The United States team gained 10 imps. In the other semifinal, between Britain and Sweden, the Swedish West player, Magnus Lindqvist, landed in five clubs doubled, which proved unbeatable. He jumped to four hearts after the one-spade response to one diamond and then showed clubs when North raised to four spades. The sophisticated artificial methods of the Swedish North-South created a problem for their opponents. The opening bid by North was not one diamond but one spade. This was natural, with 8-11 points and a possibility of a concealed long minor suit. South raised this to game, and West had to bid his hearts at the fivelevel, one higher than everyone else. This was doubled, and West had no way to solve his club problem. He escaped temporarily, for North led the diamond ace rather than his singleton club. But when West entered dummy with a heart to the king and led a club, South worked it out correctly: He put up the ace and gave his partner the ruff, giving Sweden a 13-imp profit on the deal.

522-> LONG ISLAND JOURNAL
Heavy Metal in a Quiet Room IT was hard to tell who was having more fun at the Nassau Coliseum recently, the 17,000 screaming teen-agers in the arena, who were boogying away to the heavy-metal sound of the rock band Whitesnake, or Rose Liss in the basement, who was ''up a couple of dollars'' in a deuces-wild seven-card-stud poker game. ''I don't know what you would call this,'' said Mrs. Liss, a parent from Mastic, as she displayed three tens and one deuce to the other parents of teen-agers who were seated at a large round table in the Coliseum's basement. ''I'd call it four tens,'' said Bart Lazurus of Malverne, throwing in his hand. ''Well then, what about these two jacks,'' Mrs. Liss asked. ''Don't I have a full house?'' The parents groaned, explaining patiently that four tens beat a full house, even though the full house still beat everybody else. ''I'm not really a good player,'' Mrs. Liss said as she pulled in another poker pot laden with silver coins. The poker-playing parents hadn't come to the Coliseum specifically to play cards. They hadn't even known one another when they arrived. They and about 100 other parents were crowded into what Coliseum officials call the Quiet Room, a room specially set aside for parents to pass the time while their children experienced a mandatory teen-age rite, attending a rock concert. A parent's part in the rock-concert ritual, mothers and fathers agreed, was to drive the kids to the concert, disappear - ''My 15-year-old daughter, Amy, said, 'Don't you dare walk anywhere near us,' '' said Curt Henning, a father from Hauppauge - and then drive home. At other rock concerts at other arenas, that meant killing several hours. ''We walked around the city for four hours when the kids saw Bon Jovi at Madison Square Garden,'' said Jean Ambrozaitis of North Babylon. But at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale, parents were playing cards, watching television, reading, doing office work or chatting as they enjoyed the free soft drinks, coffee and snacks the Coliseum provided in the Quiet Room. ''It's like a big party,'' said a Coliseum official, Hilary Hartung, as she refilled the pretzel bowl. Parents of teen-agers were unanimous in their praise for the room set aside for parents. ''With all the drinking beer and smoking pot, I would just as soon be here and know Gina's going to get home safe,'' said Marie Rotolo of Sayville, who had driven her 17-year-old daughter, Gina, and her friend Nancy Ordierno to the concert. Mrs. Rotolo, a medical technician, was busy filling out computer quality control charts as the sounds of Whitesnake sent a constant throbbing through the walls and ceiling. ''I can't do this work at home - there are too many distractions,'' she said. Compared with the sounds on the arena floor, where 90 speakers turned tens of thousands of watts into sound, sound that vibrated through the chest and caused ears to ring, the dull throbbing one heard in the Quiet Room was tolerable, and no different from the sounds normally coming from her daughter Allison's room, said Lois Beckwith, a mother from East Patchogue. A father, Gene Young of Mastic, was soon explaining the difference between hard rock and heavy metal to Mrs. Beckwith and the table of parents. ''Whitesnake is more hard rock then heavy metal,'' he said. ''Heavy metal is when they scream, rant and rave and it's painful in the first 30 seconds. With hard rock they don't scream as much and there's a melody.'' That made sense to Floyd Nutig of Huntington, who was sitting in the Quiet Room while his 15-year-old daughter, 13-year-old son and 45-year-old wife were upstairs enjoying Whitesnake. ''My wife likes all that music,'' Mr. Nutig said. ''I'm the stick-in-the-mud. The only concert I've ever gone to was Dionne Warwick's.'' Maryanna Shahon was sitting in the Quiet Room and guarding seven Whitesnake T-shirts that her teen-ager had bought before the concert. ''I forked out $120 and I got no change,'' Mrs. Shahon said. ''But that's O.K. This is going to give me a lot of leverage for a long time.'' Tom Farley of Islip was sleeping in the quiet room. ''I'm the bus driver for tonight,'' Mr. Farley said, as he awoke for a few minutes. ''I can sleep through anything,'' he added, as he started to doze off to the sounds of 100 adults laughing and talking, 17,000 screaming teen-agers and the relentless drums and guitars of Whitesnake. Learning to Love a Duck It seems almost heresy to report it, but there are some in Suffolk County who do not love the Big Duck; its new neighbors, for example. Jack, Josh, Solo and Foxfire haven't been the same since the giant white fowl moved next door. The 20-foot-high former roadside food stand, one of Suffolk's most distinctive landmarks, had to be moved from its Flanders site because the land on which it sat was being developed. So, with much hoopla, Big Duck was recently transported about four miles southeast to a temporary location on Route 24. Eventually it will be moved to a new, permanent site in Flanders, but for now the giant duck sits amid the scrub pines in Hampton Bays, right in front of a riding ring at the Sears-Bellows County Park riding stable. The nine or so horses that board at the stable have been in shock ever since it arrived, said Judy Butters, who helps run the place. ''Horses are very excitable anyway,'' she said. ''This is the first big duck they've ever seen.'' Having Big Duck on her doorstep has not been the most pleasant of experiences, Ms. Butters confessed. ''I think they could have put it in a better place,'' she said. ''The road is very narrow here and people keep stopping or making U-turns to see it. It's really becoming a traffic problem.'' At Last, Back on the Stacks Administrators of the Society for the Preservation of Long Island Antiquities can relax. The organization, which recently became the owner of what its director, Robert B. MacKay, calls ''Long Island's longest-circulating library book,'' won't have to pay what could have amounted to $80,000 in overdue fines. An 1809 edition of John Satchel's ''Thorton Abbey'' was recently donated to the Setauket-based historical society, Mr. MacKay said. But according to an 1806 bookplate attached to the brown leather volume, the book was the property of the Franklinian Library Company of Setauket and it was to be returned ''at the expiration of four weeks from the time on which it was taken out.'' Even though the book has been on the lam for 179 years, librarians and historians agree that the society is not holding on to any stolen property. The Franklinian Library, which was one of a network of subscription libraries started by Benjamin Franklin, gave way to the Three Village Community Library in 1892, according to the Three Village library director, Jeannine Cook. The library for Setauket and Stony Brook, which is officially known as the Emma S. Clark Memorial Library, never legally owned the Satchel book, Mrs. Cook said, and therefore has no plans to claim it or its large overdue fine. ''Anyway,'' the library director said, ''the most we charge for an overdue book is $2.'' The 19th-century book, which will eventually be put on display, is in excellent condition, said the society's curator, Deborah Federhen. But that may be because of the subject matter, she adds. ''Thorton Abbey'' is a solemn religous book. ''It's probably in such good condition,'' Miss Federhen said, ''because it wasn't checked out that often.''

524-> Seoul Threatens North Korea After Confession on Jet Bomb
South Korean officials threatened today to retaliate against North Korea for the bombing of a Korean Air Lines plane in which 115 people died in November. The threats came after a 25-year-old woman who had been a passenger on the plane on an earlier leg of its flight confessed today in a nationally broadcast news conference that she was a North Korean agent and that she had planted a bomb. Defense Minister's Warning Defense Minister Chung Ho Yong placed armed forces on alert and called an emergency military conference. He said South Korea could not ''let this incident pass without some appropriate response and retaliation.'' Lee Woong Hee, South Korea's Minister of Culture and Information, also hinted at retaliation. Neither specified what kind he meant. [ In New York, South Korea's permanent observer at the United Nations said his country had no plans to retaliate militarily against North Korea, The Associated Press reported. The diplomat, Keun Park, called instead for United Nations sanctions. [ Asked about reports of possible South Korean retaliation, Mr. Park said, ''I hope the world does not take it as a kind of military action that causes tension or other belligerence.'' [ A spokesman for North Korea's observer mission said of the accusations: ''Of course we deny the charges. Whenever the South Koreans have problems, they blame my country.'' He refused to give his name. ] Earlier today, the 25-year-old woman who confessed said she boarded the plane with an accomplice in Baghdad, Iraq, on Nov. 29, planted a time bomb and disembarked in Abu Dhabi. The plane, which continued toward Seoul, exploded over the sea near Burma. The woman, who traveled under a false Japanese passport under the name of Mayumi Hachida, said her real name was Kim Hyon Hui. She said she was under orders from Kim Jong Il, the son and political heir of North Korea's leader, Kim Il Sung, to disrupt the 1988 Olympics and to create unrest in South Korea in the midst of a presidential election.

526-> LONG ISLAND GUIDE
BLACK HISTORY MONTH Although officially it began last week, Black History Month really gets into gear this week as museums and libraries throughout the Island study the past, celebrate the present and look into the future. For example, ''Out of Africa,'' a traveling photographic exhibition from the Smithsonian Institution that traces the rich cultural heritage of West Africa, is at the African-American Museum in Hempstead, 110 North Franklin Street, through February. It is accompanied by a series of Sunday lectures at 2 P.M. (today's is by Dr. Josef Ben-Jochannan, an Egyptologist); concerts Feb. 21 and 28; Saturday crafts workshops for children at 11:30 A.M., and a puppet show next Saturday at 2 P.M. There is an opening reception at 6 P.M. Saturday. For hours and a complete schedule call 542-0470. Another kind of exhibition - one exploring ''Blacks in Biography and and Autobiography'' - comes to the 10th-floor gallery of the Axinn Library at Hofstra University Thursday for a stay through March 14 (call 560-5672 for hours), and a different literary pursuit, drama via ''For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf,'' is followed for three performances, Friday through next Sunday, on the same Hempstead campus. Call 560-5669 for ticket information. Music gets the nod when the Dave Burns Quintet plays jazz today at 2 P.M. at the Freeport Memorial Library on South Ocean Avenue. On Tuesday, the Westbury Jazz Ensemble performs at 8 P.M. at the local junior high on Rockland Street and, farther east, in Copiague at its senior high school, 1100 Dixon Avenue, Babatunde Olatunji, master drummer, and his African Cultural Troupe appear at 8 P.M. Among the film programs, tomorrow the Port Washington Public Library on Main Street showcases a film maker, St. Clair Bourne, who will screen and discuss ''In Motion: Amiri Baraka'' and ''Big City Blues'' at 8 P.M.; and the Hempstead Public Library, 115 Nichols Court, runs three documentaries, including ''From These Roots'' and ''Yonder Come Day,'' at 3 and 7 P.M. In its Black Film Festival, the Elmont Public Library, 1735 Hempstead Turnpike, shows ''Alberta Hunter''on Tuesday at 2 P.M. CLASSIC JAZZ There is classic jazz and then there is classical jazz, and they share the spotlight this week. Today, performing a premiere of ''Via Portofino -Octet for Sea Cliff,'' his new work for saxophone and chamber ensemble, Gerry Mulligan appears with the Sea Cliff Chamber Players, who commissioned the piece. The jazz saxophonist and his first chamber music composition are on a program that also features Poulenc, Martinu and Schumann in the opening installment of the players' three-concert series for the Town of Hempstead. The concert is at 7:30 P.M. at Freeport High School on Brookside Avenue. For ticket information call 292-9000, extension 255. On Saturday, Herbie Mann, another jazz legend in his own time, but on the flute, appears at the Inter-Media Art Center in Huntington. He and his latest group, Jasil Brazz, which specializes in the fusion of jazz and Brazilian music, play twice, at 7:30 and 10 P.M., at the center, 370 New York Avenue. For tickets call 549-9666. ARTISTRY ON ICE Fresh from their New York performance, Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean, the elegant ice dancers who hold four World Ice Dance Championships, and who as 1984 Olympic gold medalists racked up the only nine perfect marks ever awarded in Olympic competition, glide into Uniondale and the Nassau Coliseum on Tuesday. They star in the Ice Capades' new show, ''Salute to Hollywood,'' which also features the Smurfs and the Smurflings; Steve Taylor, who jumps through hoops of fire, and Kirk Wise, comedian, and his dog, Scrapette, in a salute to Charlie Chaplin. Torvill and Dean will stay around in Uniondale through next Sunday. For ticket information call 587-9222. 'VALENTINE SOIREE' To fatten its coffers, the National Grand Opera has booked Alicia Zizzo, a pianist who recently completed a well-received tour of Europe, into the Otto Kahn Castle in Cold Spring Hills for a Valentine Soiree Friday. While the program Ms. Zizzo will play -Debussy, Chopin, Liszt and Beethoven - has no particular Valentine's Day significance, the refreshments fill the holiday bill; the champagne and dessert menu includes such delicacies as baba au rhum, Linzer torte and Black Forest cake. It all begins at 8:30 P.M. at the chateau in Huntington, where the financier, an opera buff, entertained Caruso and Toscanini. For reservations for the benefit, which costs $25 a person, call 248-6772. DECOY SHOW Fanciers of the art of decoy making get together Saturday and next Sunday for the 12th annual Decoy Collectors Show in East Setauket. Sponsored by the Museums at Stony Brook and the Long Island Decoy Collectors Association, the event, with its display, sale and swap of antique and ornamental decoys and other wildfowling items, also features a special exhibition of items from the collection of George Thompson of Cazenovia, N.Y. An early enthusiast, he is said to have assembled one of the premier private collections in the country. After the weekend show, 38 of the duck and geese decoys will be exhibited at the museums through April 10. The show is from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Saturday and 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. next Sunday, with an auction at 2 P.M. the final day, at Melville High School on Old Town Road. Admission, which benefits the museums' decoy collection, is $3, with children under 12 admitted free. ARTISTS TAKE STANDS In ''Artists Taking a Stand (Political/Sociological/Environmental Issues of Our Time),'' the latest Hempstead Harbor Artists Association show, which opens Saturday, 14 artists from diverse backgrounds and with dissimilar styles share one common thread: they all possess a passion that's been translated into a personal vision, said the show's curator, Vivian Alper Ostrow. In this exhibition, she said, exercising their social as well as artistic consciences, they explore subjects ranging from intimacy to global annihilation, all, with the goal of trying to ''compel the viewer to look, feel and, ultimately, to think.'' The opening reception is from 3 to 5 P.M., and at 4 P.M. it features ''At the Corner of Error and Perfection,'' a multimedia ''Hair Montage Work'' by Terry Niedzialek in collaboration with Julius Vitali, which is being given its Long Island premiere. The show runs through March 12 at the Discovery Gallery, 12 and 16 Village Square in Glen Cove. For hours call 676-9782. 'VERACRUZ CONNECTION' Preceded by a two-day scholarly symposium, an ambitious exhibition entitled ''Veracruz Connection: The Impact on Mesoamerican Civilization'' opens next Sunday at the Fine Arts Museum of Long Island in Hempstead. A successor to the recent ''Ceremonial Sculpture of Veracruz'' at the C. W. Post Campus of Long Island University, of which Dr. Marilyn Goldstein is also curator, the exhibition includes more than 300 works on loan from such institutions as the Smithsonian, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Princeton University, as well as important private collections. Along with the symposium, ''Veracruz: Crossroads of Mesoamerican Culture,'' the exhibition, which runs through March 27 at the museum, 295 Fulton Avenue, represents what is said to be the most comprehensive approach to the subject matter ever taken in a suburban museum. The opening reception is at 2 P.M. next Sunday. For regular hours, symposium registration and admission information, call 481-5700. $90BARBARA DELATINER

530-> Electronics Reshaping U.S. Public Libraries
Public libraries throughout the United States have dramatically expanded the range of their collections to include video cassettes, microcomputers, software, compact disks and books on tape. Although books remain the principal feature of the nation's 115,000 libraries, librarians report that new nonprint materials have attracted many new users and that their growing presence is likely to change the character of libraries. Indeed, while overall public library circulation increased about 11 percent from 1980 to 1986, circulation of nonbook materials soared. ''Libraries have gotten into these other formats because people are into them,'' said Mary Jo Lynch, director of the American Library Association's office for research. ''Libraries are information sources for communities, and these are all forms of information.'' 'Big Growth' in Recent Years ''Videos began appearing in public libraries around 1981, but the big growth has been in the last few years,'' added Sally Mason, coordinator of the association's video project. A 1987 survey by the association found that 62.5 percent of the nation's public library systems lend videos. Earlier statistics on library video collections are not available, she said, because videos are so new that they were not even included in previous surveys. The Chula Vista (Calif.) Public Library was virtually alone among libraries when it began circulating videotapes in 1979. Videos are now so popular that the library's 2,600 cassettes circulate at 15 times the rate of the average book in its collections. ''Video service was like letting a genie out of the bottle,'' said Nora McMartin, head of the library's audiovisual services. The New York Public Library has 11,000 video cassettes in two dozen branches in Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island. These tapes, which circulate at no charge for three days, range from classic movies to public-television shows and educational subjects. Since the system's first video was lent by the Jefferson Market branch in February 1981, video traffic has grown so rapidly that nearly 400,000 circulated last year, said Donald Walker, associate director of the New York Public Library's 81 branch libraries. Building Circulation At the Brooklyn Public Library, video loans began in October, and its central library already has about 2,000 titles. The six branches of the Brooklyn library each have 700. The Queens library system has 6,500 video cassettes and, according to Kenneth G. Sivulich, deputy director of the system, ''Video cassettes have drawn people who never had a library card.'' ''The initial idea behind introducing videos was that they are a tremendous circulation builder,'' Mr. Walker said. ''But now the emphasis is on getting more balanced collections.'' Indeed, many libraries that began their video collections with feature films are turning to ''kinds of videos you can't get in video stores, things like instructional tapes to learn French or build a patio,'' said Michael Madden, director of the Schaumburg (Ill.) Township Public Library. New Format, New Problems The video boom, however, has caused new problems for libraries. Theft, damage and concerns about borrowers copying tapes are often mentioned by librarians. Growing video collections also take up precious room, staff resources and an increasing share of many libraries' budgets. The New York Public Library has earmarked about 15 percent of its materials budget for nonbook purchases, according to Mimi Koren, a library spokeswoman. But the acquisition of books has not declined, she said, because the system's overall budget has increased during the 1980's and the library has turned to additional sources of financing, such as corporate and foundation grants, specifically to purchase new nonbook materials. In other parts of the country, however, high costs have forced about 30 percent of libraries with videos to charge for loans, according to the association, and the issue of whether or not to have fees is now hotly debated among librarians. Computers have probably revolutionized the library profession as much as any field during the last decade, but, until very recently, most changes have resulted from the introduction of computerized card catalogues and specialized databases for everything from newspaper articles to medical and social-scientific literature. However, many libraries are now taking the computer revolution one step further by making terminals and software available to users. Computers Come to Class According to the 1987 American Library Association survey, 49 percent of public libraries serving communities of more than 25,000 people had microcomputers for public use, and many colleges and schools have added personal computers to library media centers. The New York Public Library has 41 computers and 2,200 pieces of software for use by appointment. The system is spending $30,000 a year on software, and will soon add 15 new computers for children's rooms, Mr. Walker said. Although some libraries do loan public-domain software, many librarians are wary of lending copyrighted software because of the prohibitive cost of buying the many titles currently available and the fact that ''there isn't enough case law to clarify the legality of circulating software,'' said Rita Kane, associate director of library services at the University of California-Berkeley. Recorded Books Books on tape - designed for ''reading'' on personal stereos and cassette decks in cars - are another recent addition to public libraries, and are already loaned by 76 percent of those surveyed by the association. Compact disks are the newest items in libraries' expanding nonbook collections. Nationally, about one-fourth of public libraries have some CD's, according to Ms. Lynch. The New York and Queens library systems began introducing CD's in late 1986, with the Brooklyn system following in March 1987. The Lincoln Center and Donnell branches together have about 5,000 CD's for loan, and the Fordham branch will soon have 800 disks. The Queens library reports heavy demand for CD's and is now adding them in 10 additional branches. But the New York Public Library intends to build its collections more gradually, Mr. Walker said, because many recorded materials are still available only on LP's and audio tapes, and it is not yet clear whether compact disks will become the dominant recording format. The advent of new nonprint materials has broadened the base of library users, but it has also divided librarians about the future of their profession. Too Much Technology? ''There's no substitute for a beautifully written sentence,'' Ms. Mason said, ''but there are some forms of information - like how to repair a car - that are better transmitted visually.'' But Donald Walker of the New York Public Library has mixed feelings about what he believes is an exaggerated emphasis on new technology. ''People in library schools are now becoming 'information specialists,' not children's librarians or young-adult librarians,'' he said. ''And all you see at library conventions are exhibits of videos and software.'' Even though libraries are devoting increasing amounts of money, space and staff to these new nonbook materials, the printed word is unlikely to go the way of the hieroglyphic or pictogram. But Jean-Paul Michaud, coordinator of information and reference services for the New York Public Library, said that ''a lot of information in libraries in the future won't be printed.'' And, in the argot of the new technology, he added, ''It will come only in machine-readable format.''

532-> HISTORY CONVENTION REFLECTS CHANGE FROM TRADITIONAL TO 'GENDER' STUDIES
These are the spiritual descendants of Gibbon and Michelet, two of the world's greatest historians, one chronicling the end of the Roman Empire and the other the history of France. But if the historians who read papers at the annual convention of the American Historical Association in Washington Dec. 27-30 provide any indication, the subjects that make for the study of history have changed remarkably since Gibbon and Michelet, and the changes have come with increasing speed in recent years. A history convention is many things, not least a place where the holders of newly minted Ph.D.'s can be interviewed for college and university teaching posts. But at the intellectual center of the annual conventions are the numerous panel discussions, 135 of them this year, and it was here that the overall drift in historical studies became clear. Among the panel titles were ''Jazz in Society and Politics,'' ''Women's Definitions of Love Throughout Western History,'' ''Sex, Gender and the Constitution,'' ''Sodomy and Pederasty Among 19th-Century Seafarers,'' ''Science, Medicine and Gender,'' and ''Black Women in the Work Force.'' 'The Capaciousness of History' There also were panels on conventional history - the narrative studies and interpretations of such great events as wars, revolutions and social upheavals. But, in general, this year's convention, attended by 4,000 historians, reflected the move in historical studies toward what some have heralded and others have bemoaned as the ''new history,'' with its stress on women and minority groups, the lives of ordinary people in the past, and the experience of such groups as homosexuals, blacks and immigrants. ''It's what I called, in my presidential address, the capaciousness of history,'' said Prof. Natalie Z. Davis of Princeton, who is stepping down as president of the association. Professor Davis, who generally seemed to welcome the trend, said in an interview that the various panels marking the bicentennial of the Constitution served as an example of what she called the ''capacious'' approach to history. ''There was one traditional panel, on which Bernard Bailyn of Harvard gave a paper on the original meaning of the Constitution,'' she said. ''Then there was one on race in the Constitution. There was one on gender in the Constitution. So, again, it's the capaciousness of history. Not only are the old questions being asked, but they are being renewed by the addition of new perspectives.'' Current Trends Reflected Throughout most of the 104 years the association has been in existence, its members have studied such matters as the Civil War, major episodes in diplomacy and international relations, Presidential administrations, the development of law under the Constitution and other standard topics. But the writing of history reflects current trends. Twenty-one of the panels at last week's convention focused on the role of race, gender or sexual preference in history. One, for example, on the homosexual experience in modern Germany, sponsored by the Committee on Gay and Lesbian History, traced the growth of an antidiscrimination movement from before the start of the 20th century. Another panel examined the experience of women in the Civil War, World War II and the Vietnam War. A paper by LeeAnn Whites of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University argued that the defeat of the South had a ''feminizing'' influence on a culture that until that time had been dominated by authoritarian white male plantation masters. ''What basically is happening is the kind of splintering of major themes into a real diversity of special topics in areas that haven't been developed before,'' Professor Bailyn said. ''This is good when it is done well, but the problem is to get beyond the technical fields to the place where they can be useful to a general audience.'' A Concern Over Subjectivity The flowering of the new history has left some historians uneasy, and they cite several reasons. One is the fear that history's vocation of studying the major events of the past could be in danger of neglect. Another is the concern that new history stems from personal passions and therefore threatens to cast aside neutrality and intellectual rigor in its analysis of past events. ''Any one piece is fine, but it's the way it all comes together that's a problem,'' Gertrude Himmelfarb, a professor of history at the City University of New York who is a major opponent of the new history, said in an interview at the convention. ''It becomes a necessary aspect of any subject. You can't do anything now without making reference to gender. You can't talk about the Austro-Hungarian Empire without talking about gender.'' Referring to a previous vogue of Marxist history, she said: ''It used to be class. Now it's gender.'' In a book published last year criticizing the new vogue, Professor Himmelfarb called the trend ''history with the politics left out.'' Even such elements of personal behavior as sodomy and pederasty ''are treated as of equal importance,'' she said, adding, ''In fact, they are treated as of greater importance, as more real that the epic phenomena of history.'' Opponents in the Minority No polls on the new history were taken at the convention, but the overall mood indicated that opponents like Professor Himmelfarb were in the minority. The chairman of the panel on gender divisions in war, Linda Grant DePauw of George Washington University, proclaimed the new history to be almost the only interesting history. She also said that when she attended her first convention of the American Historical Association in 1964 the very idea of a woman's giving a paper seemed unusual and thrilling. Now it has become routine. ''It doesn't disturb me at all,'' she said when asked whether the new history had not all but knocked out conventional history. ''If you want to play Trivial Pursuit and get the dates right, that's one thing. If you want to be on the cutting edge, you've got to start with something quirky.'' At the December meeting, a panel on sodomy and pederasty among 19th-century seafarers was one of the most unusual of the new historical explorations. The panel heard two papers: one on the practice of homosexuality among pirates in 19th-century China, delivered by Dian Murray of the University of Notre Dame, and the other, titled ''Sex and the Single Seafarer,'' on the prevalence of homosexuality in the United States Navy in the mid-19th century, given by B. R. Burg of Arizona State University. ''I am certainly not an advocate of the new history,'' said Clifford L. Egan of the University of Houston, the chairman of the panel. ''But history as once defined is the record of mankind's past, and I think there is validity to investigating these topics.''

533-> Bush Talks Tough on Crime, Criticizing Prisoner Furlough Program
Continuing a series of speeches around the country on crime and drugs, Vice President Bush expressed contempt today for civil libertarians ''who show more compassion for the criminals than they do for the victims of crime.'' ''For too many years,'' the Vice President declared in a speech to the National Sheriffs' Association, ''we've been held hostage by well-meaning and misguided politicians and judges who get their legal views from the A.C.L.U.,'' a reference to the American Civil Liberties Union. ''The rights accorded criminals must never overshadow the wrongs done to the victims,'' he said. At the outset, the Mr. Bush billed his speech as nonpartisan, and he did not mention by name his Democratic rival for President, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts. Massachusetts Program Attacked But Mr. Bush stressed a favorite target of his stump speeches, the Massachusetts program, in effect until last spring, that allowed people serving life sentences for murder to take unsupervised weekend furloughs from prison. Moreover, for the first time in a speech, the Vice President recounted the story of Willie Horton, a convicted murderer who was released on such a furlough in 1986, fled to Maryland, took a suburban couple hostage, tortured the man and raped his fiancee. ''I'm opposed to these unsupervised weekend furloughs for first-degree murderers who are not eligible for parole,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Put me down as against that.'' The publicity surrounding the Horton case led the Massachusetts Legislature to end furloughs for convicted murderers, a policy that had been in effect for 16 years. Governor Dukakis originally opposed the repeal, but, under pressure from the Legislature and facing the possibility of a ballot measure on the issue, he signed the repeal in April. A Used Bulletproof Vest In substance, the Vice President's speech today broke little new ground. However, holding up a bulletproof vest that had taken three shots at close range from a revolver, he endorsed for the first time a position strongly held by the sheriffs that would guarantee that ''every law-enforcement officer in the nation who wants body armor has access to it.'' He did not say who should pay for such a program or how much it would cost. Mr. Bush also questioned policies based on civil liberties and emphasized his desire to ''change legal technicalities that set criminals free.'' He proposed limits on the ability of Federal courts to intervene in state criminal cases and a change in the rule that prohibits prosecutors from using evidence that is seized illegally. Out of the 'Kentucky Mainstream' ''Suppressing evidence obtained in an objectively reasonable and good-faith belief that the seizure was in compliance with the law serves no legitimate purpose and can result in truly dangerous offenders being released on an unsuspecting public,'' the Vice President said. Later, at a meeting with local newspaper and broadcast reporters, Mr. Bush was asked to describe some of the differences between himself and Mr. Dukakis. He pointed out that Mr. Dukakis was a member of the A.C.L.U., adding, ''That is not exactly in the mainstream of Kentucky politics.'' In his speech, Mr. Bush did not mention gun control, one issue on which he differs substantially from the position of the Sheriffs' Association. Like most law-enforcement groups, the organization of sheriffs favors strict controls on firearms. Mr. Bush is generally opposed to gun control laws. A Sheriff Defends Dukakis The sheriffs warmly applauded the Vice President's remarks on prison furloughs and civil liberties. But afterward, Robert C. Rufo, the sheriff of Suffolk County, Mass., and president of the Massachusetts Sheriffs' Association, approached reporters to defend Governor Dukakis. Wearing a Dukakis-for-President button, Mr. Rufo said that the furlough program was one Mr. Dukakis had inherited from a Republican predecessor and that only ''one-half of 1 percent'' of the participants had failed to return to prison on schedule without incident. Mr. Rufo, a lawyer, also disputed Mr. Bush's view that law enforcement was hampered by the rule excluding illegally seized evidence. Mr. Rufo said he had paid his own way to the convention and was not officially part of the Dukakis campaign.

534-> Boxing Notebook; Tyson Assumes A Historic Stance
When Mike Tyson knocked out Larry Holmes in January, his body language at the end of the fight was that of a conqueror: he stood across the ring, arms akimbo, staring at the fallen Holmes with a look that appeared to say, ''Well, that takes care of that.'' To the outsider, the bold pose might have seemed like a spontaneous reaction by the champion to his latest victory. In fact, it was no impromptu gesture at all. When Tyson arrived in Atlantic City in late December to begin training for the Holmes bout, his assistant manager, Steve Lott, taped black-and-white boxing photographs to the walls of the apartment in which Tyson was staying. Most of the photos, which Lott uses before each bout, were of the old-time fighters with whom Tyson feels an affinity. ''They are usually,'' said Lott, ''photos of Joe Gans, Jack Johnson, Sam Langford, John L. Sullivan, Joe Louis, Jack Dempsey and Floyd Patterson.'' Tyson, who has read extensively about the sport's history, has often taken his cues from boxing greats of the past. As the old-time fighters wore narrow trouser cuffs and the occasional whitewall haircut, so has Tyson, consciously linking himself to boxing tradition. Among the photos that ended up on the wall of the Atlantic City apartment was one of the lightweight champion Battling Nelson standing across the ring from a fallen opponent, Dick Hyland. Hyland had just been knocked out in the 23d round of a 1909 fight. Nelson had his arms akimbo and an expression that intrigued Tyson. ''I laughed, when I saw it,'' said Tyson. ''It was just such a great shot. There he was with an attitude like, 'Who's next?' I wanted to do this myself.''' And he did. Sparring Continues Bill Cayton, Tyson's manager, was scheduled to meet this morning in Newark with Bob Lee, president of the International Boxing Federation. Under discussion will be Cayton's preference for a 12-round Tyson-Spinks bout and Lee's insistence on 15. To support its position, the I.B.F. yesterday filed a civil action in Fed-eral District Court in Newark, seek-ing a preliminary injunction against the World Boxing Association. The pur-pose is to enjoin those groups from stripping Tyson of his title if he agrees to the I.B.F.'s 15-round dis-tance, said Sy Roseman, an I.B.F. spokesman. Cayton has promised legal action if the I.B.F. takes Tyson's title away. Roseman said that if Tyson-Spinks is a 12-rounder, the I.B.F. would be obliged to strip Tyson's title and stage an eight-man jelinination tour-nament to find a new champion. Awaiting Appeal On Saturday, Ken Adams, the head coach of the United States Olympic boxing team, was suspended for six months following a hearing before a committee of the United States Amateur Boxing Federation in Colorado Springs. This means that if Adams's appeal to the federation's board of directors is rejected, he will not be going to the Olympic Summer Games in Seoul, South Korea. No date has been set for a ruling on the appeal. The federation review of Adams stemmed from an argument that the coach had with Kerstan Dahl, the federation's controller - an argument that allegedly turned physical. In April, at a dual meet between United States and Cuba, Adams was criticized by the United States Olympic boxing consultant, Sugar Ray Leonard, for failing to get the most out of his fighters. The incident with Dahl may have been just the pretext the federation needed to ease Adams out of his position as coach. Tom Coulter, the assistant Olympic coach, and Roosevelt Sanders, an assistant coach on the 1984 Olympic team, are considered the likeliest successors to Adams, should the board of directors uphold Saturday's decision. Davis vs. Moore The undefeated welterweight Aaron Davis (16-0, 9 knockouts) will headline tomorrow's Felt Forum card against Tyrone Moore (30-5-1, 24 knockouts). . . . Michael Olajide Jr. won't be fighting again until September. Olajide, who suffered a knockout loss to Iran Barkley in his last fight back in March, took a hard look at his career after that bout and decided he was ''burned out.'' Following his defeat, he had a long vacation in Zurich, visiting a sister there, and in Vancouver, British Columbia, where he was raised. Now he is back in New York, undergoing a conditioning regimen to build upper-body strength. . . . Hector Camacho, who will fight Reyes Cruz in Atlantic City on June 25, is shooting for a junior welterweight title shot against either Roger Mayweather (World Boxing Council champion) or Juan Coggi (World Boxing Association champion) by this fall. . . . Mayweather, who beat Harold Brazier by decision earlier this month, is amenable to fighting Camacho. . . . Commercials promoting the Tyson-Spinks bout as part of a Diet Pepsi advertising campaign will feature Donald Trump, who bought the live rights to the bout for more than $11 million. . . . Evander Holyfield, who will step up to the heavyweight division July 16 against James (Quick) Tillis, has targeted the former heavyweight champion Michael Dokes as his opponent for an Oct. 27 fight on Showtime.

IN 1981 the Whirlpool Corporation started talking to its engineers about designing laundry appliances for older consumers. Their research turned up a truism known to almost anyone who has ever cursed a washing machine: most washers and dryers are in dimly lighted basements where instructions are difficult to read. So the company introduced a model with large black lettering on a non-reflective white background and enlarged dials and buttons. According to Jean Schrage, the manager of appliance information, the new model was a successful example of ''universal design.'' Though the improvements had originally been developed for people who have trouble seeing, ''if you design for the least able, everyone else can use it too.'' The company got such a positive response, she said, ''we decided to reproduce it throughout our entire line.'' ''The features were an advantage to all consumers,'' she added. ''It was really just good design.'' In Oxford, Miss., a different kind of effort is under way at Advanced Living Systems, a nonprofit company that designs for what the company calls the ''spectrum of human abilities.'' Using the residents of Oxford for models, the company is developing experimental products for the elderly. A bathtub, for instance, has a fiberglass insert that allows the bather to get into the tub without having to clamber over the side. Carmen Frazier, who is 83 years old and admits to being scared of slipping in the tub, has nothing but praise for the tub's designer, Jack Zellner. ''It's just grand,'' she said. ''I don't know why they haven't had this all the time.'' Lessons like these are being learned as American product designers and manufacturers confront the aging of America (not to mention the buying power that comes with it: according to Helen A. Harris, a market researcher, Americans over the age of 50 control more than $160 billion, or more than half, of the nation's discretionary income). In addition, a growing knowledge of the needs of people with physical disablities - 37 million Americans - is contributing both to specialized applications of technology and to a shift toward universal or ''transgenerational'' designs, which address present and future needs of all consumers. Some of the most exciting designs for people with disabilities have come from newly disabled people who were so dissatisfied with existing products that they came up with their own alternatives. Peter W. Axelson, 32, an industrial designer, mechanical engineer and champion member of the United States Disabled Ski Team, formed his company, Beneficial Designs Inc., in Santa Cruz, Calif., after he was injured in a mountain climbing accident 13 years ago. ''There weren't any devices or technologies around to meet my needs,'' he said. The alpine skis, hand-powered bicycle and other designs he has developed for those with impaired mobility ''allows me to do something with my friends and family we used to always do together,'' he said. ''Sensitivity in design affects everyone,'' he added. ''Lots of people are afraid of being identified as having some sort of disability. But look at the number of people with lower back pain whose needs aren't being met.'' Product designs for independent living are at the center of an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art through June 7. Among the 45 products on display, many of them from Europe, are lightweight wheelchairs, a nonslip cutting board with a knife guard, a button fastener, a portable electronic magnifying device and lightweight crutches of anodized aluminum. Some products in American households are already geared to people with and without disabilities, according to Patricia Moore, an industrial designer: recliners, whirlpool baths, contour beds, telephone volume controls, hand-held shower heads and television remote controls. The design of the ubiquitous Cuisinart food processor - oversize D-shaped handle and large paddle-shaped controls - evolved from studies of consumers with arthritis and other physical limitations that were done by Marc Harrison, an industrial designer. ''Designers have been designing products based on a mythical basis of the perfect human specimen,'' said Dr. Harrison, a professor of industrial design at the Rhode Island School of Design. ''People are living longer. Designers will have to start assuming that people will have difficulties, and develop products that will help them be independent.'' Little things taken for granted around the home can become major hurdles for people as they age. Fastening zippers, vacuuming and dusting, pulling clothes over ones' head, using the bathtub, moving around the house without slipping and tying shoelaces are among the many workaday routines that can frustrate people's ability to function independently in their own homes. A lack of awareness of the available devices seems to contribute to the problem. ''We all have a tendency to learn the ins and outs of our homes, and then adapt,'' said Dr. M. Powell Lawton, director of research for the Philadelphia Geriatric Center. ''There's a general failure to realize that assistive products or modifying the home environment can improve life for an elderly person.'' There are roughly 13,000 commercially available aids and devices for people with disabilities, but most are only available through occupational therapists, doctors, medical supply houses or specialized mail-order catalogues. ''The problem is that the user doesn't know these items exist,'' said Rolf Borneby, director of Lumex/ Swedish Rehab, whose products are on display at the Museum of Modern Art. His company represents five Swedish manufacturers whose designs were developed by the Swedish Institute for the Disabled, a nonprofit organization subsidized by the Swedish Government. Introduced in the United States in 1984, the designs have been marketed to occupational therapists and hospitals. As a consequence sales have been limited, and the company is hoping to attract a wider audience by making them available at pharmacies and medical-supply stores. Sweden is notable for its pioneering designs. According to Joseph A. Koncelik, chairman of the industrial design department at Ohio State University, government support in both Scandinavia and Great Britain dates back to the World War II era, partly because of war injuries and partly because of the aging of their populations. In America, however, the population of elderly people grew more gradually. ''Now it is a sizable population,'' he said. ''But we have no national network to develop such goods.'' American product designers and manufacturers also confront a cultural bias, according to Ms. Moore, the industrial designer: ''We are so afraid of the prospect of growing old that we close our eyes to the situation.'' If the history of the ultralight sport wheelchair is any indication, consumer demand - and spirit - may ultimately pave the way. The sport wheelchair was an outgrowth of users' desire for greater mobility. Individual efforts to adapt wheelchair technology to sport activities had been evolving steadily, particularly among wheelchair basketball players. The Quickie, a wheelchair produced by Motion Designs Inc. of Fresno, Calif., came about as a result of a hang-gliding accident 10 years ago that left the company's co-founder, Marilyn Hamilton, unable to use her legs. Dissatisfied with conventional wheelchairs, she asked friends in the hang-glider business to develop a high-performance wheelchair out of lightweight aircraft aluminum. The popular 24-pound Quickie 2, the second chair designed by Ms. Hamilton's company, has a collapsible modular frame for easy transport, removable wheels and bolt-on accessories. Lightweight wheelchairs are now a fixture in the industry, with 21 companies producing racing or lightweight models, according to a recent survey by Sports 'n Spokes magazine. The most recent product design for people with disabilities centers on ''assistive device technology,'' making sophisticated electronic aids, computers and other devices more widely available to the people who need them. Important breakthroughs include computer screens that enlarge images for those with impaired vision, or computers that can be activated by voice or even by eye muscles for people whose mobility is severely impaired. As with universal design in general, the ultimate goal of the hearings, according to Dr. Solarz, ''is to insure people can have access to the technology that will help them live their lives more in the mainstream.''

537-> 9 Seized on a Ship Off Beirut Reported Released by Militia
Eight seamen and a teen-age boy who were seized by Lebanon's main Christian militia seven weeks ago were freed today, militia figures and Lebanese officials said. The report that the seamen - four Poles, three Danes, and a Sri Lankan -had been set free came initially from a member of the Lebanese Forces, a Christian militia, and was confirmed by a spokesman for the Danish Embassy. The 15-year-old boy was reported to be the adopted son of the Sri Lankan. They were taken prisoner Dec. 27, after arriving at Beirut with a cargo of food. They were reportedly accused by the Christian militia of unloading arms for the Progressive Socialist Party militia, the main foe of the Christians in Lebanon's civil war.

538-> BASEBALL; Santana Comes Full Circle
Rafael Santana pointed casually toward a distant corner of the Yankee clubhouse today, and suddenly the memories returned. It was 1980. He was only 22 years old then, a shortstop from La Romana, a small village in the Dominican Republic, who spoke halting English and was simply trying to impress someone in the Yankee organization. He remembered seeing many of the same faces who are here now: Willie Randolph, Ron Guidry, Tommy John, Rick Cerone. He remembered meeting Reggie Jackson. In the eight years that have passed, Santana has been traded twice, released once and was an integral part of the Mets' World Series championship team of 1986. Now, he is back. The Yankees acquired Santana from the Mets on the final day of the winter meetings in December, marking the first time the two teams had made a trade involving a major league player. The Mets wanted to make room for Kevin Elster, their burgeoning star; the Yankees needed a shortstop to play every day, especially since Wayne Tolleson underwent surgery on his right shoulder and still cannot throw with much strength. A Steady Player So Santana is here. He is essentially the Yankees' regular shortstop, although Bobby Meacham and Jerry Royster are also in camp, and Tolleson eventually expects to return in the hope of reclaiming the job he held for most of 1987, until his shoulder finally gave out. But in Santana, the Yankees have a steady, if somewhat unspectacular, shortstop capable of playing every day and providing adequate offense. Santana sat in the clubhouse this morning, just before the Yankees began their fourth day of workouts -Gary Ward arrived at the start of the day, giving Manager Billy Martin a full squad - and said his new team might be better than his old one. ''This club has a little bit more than the Mets,'' he said. ''I'm not taking anything away from them, but this team has a lot of experience with winning. There are so many veterans here who have been on contenders before. They know how to handle everything, on and off the field. There's good hitting and pitching, good power and lot of experience. I'd put us a half-game ahead of the Mets.'' To get back to the Yankees, Santana look a long route that began when he was signed as an 18-year-old free agent in 1976. His first spring on the roster was 1980. ''My locker was there, in that corner,'' he said. ''I was just a kid, and it felt strange because it was my first time in a big-league camp. But I was happy to be here, to join all the guys and meet someone like Reggie Jackson.'' Santana never progressed above the Class A level, though. He was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals in 1981 for George Frazier, a pitcher, but it was clear from the outset that he was doomed. The Yankees didn't need him because they had Bucky Dent. The Cardinals couldn't use him because they had Garry Templeton, then Ozzie Smith. He was released in January 1984 before the Mets' Tidewater affiliate signed him. That same year, he made the team. ''They called me up in the middle of the season,'' he said. ''I was supposed to be a backup infielder and play behind Ron Gardenhire, who was the shortstop. But then he got hurt, and I took over. Ever since then, I've played every day.'' No Regrets The 30-year-old Santana, who lives on Long Island and will commute to the Bronx, said he had no regrets over leaving the Mets. He knew the club was grooming Elster to take over, and he realized it was probably time to try a new team. ''It made me happy when I got traded to the Yankees,'' he said. ''It meant not having to leave New York, but it also meant going to a contender.'' Santana has never been regarded as a superior hitter - he batted .218 on the World Series team - or a shortstop with exceptional range. But he could become the steadiest of the 30 shortstops Willie Randolph has teamed with on the Yankees. His .973 fielding percentage ranked second only to Smith among National League shortstops playing in at least 100 games last season, and he was hitting as high as .290 on July 10 before finishing at .255. He said he believes he can play in all 162 games this year. WARD IS SURPRISED Gary Ward, who was three days late because of problems involving his car registration in California, was surprised at the attention his absence from camp had caused. ''I don't understand why,'' he said. ''I'm not going to miss playing. I love playing.'' He said he was willing to accept a limited role on the team but would attempt to win a regular job and impress Martin. ''I'm not going to sit around and make it easy for him not to play me,'' he said. ''I'll give those guys a run for their money and let Billy make the decision.''

539-> Beyond White Rats and Rabbits
FOR years, an emotionally charged ethical debate over the morality and reliability of animal testing has bedeviled the cosmetics, chemical and pharmaceutical industries. Nevertheless, the tests have remained firmly entrenched as the underpinning of the nation's efforts to insure that new products work as intended and that consumers are not harmed by them. Now, however, many companies are gradually embracing a new generation of research methods that reduce and in some cases eliminate the need for animal testing. The change provides a classic example of how the often conflicting concerns of company policymakers, consumers, government regulators and pressure groups influence the pace that new technologies are adopted. The shift to the new research methods is partly a response to the relentless protests by animal rights activists against the maiming and destruction of millions of animals each year in the nation's corporate laboratories and independent testing facilities. But research executives say that the rising cost of animal tests and the gradual emergence of scientifically accepted alternatives are also crucial driving forces. Despite regulatory and legal barriers, a wide range of companies are turning to experiments with cell cultures, bacteria and living tissues in test tubes and to computer simulations. Some are also relying on shared data to avoid duplicating tests. The shift has opened up potentially lucrative niches for such tiny biotech companies as the Clonetics Corporation of San Diego and Organogenesis Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., rival producers of cloned human skin cultures, one of the new testing tools. ''We may never get to the point of eliminating animals in testing but there is room for improvement,'' said Dr. Charles F. Reinhardt, director of the Haskell Laboratory for Toxicology at E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company. ''We ought to be asking ourselves what exactly we need to know.'' That kind of questioning is allowing corporate toxicologists and at least some animal activists to find a common ground. ''An awful lot of the points made by the animal welfare movement are extreme but right,'' said Shayne G. Gad, a scientist at G. D. Searle & Company who is chairman of the Society of Toxicology's Animals in Research Committee. ''We are no longer regarded as zany,'' said Henry Spira, a former civil rights campaigner and union reformer who has emerged as the animal rights activist most respected in business circles because of his willingness to support reforms short of abolition of testing. ''It used to be almost macho to use animals and not think anything about it. Today, thinking about alternatives is considered the thing to do.'' Indeed, five scientific journals dealing with alternatives have sprung up in the past three years and seminars on the topic have multiplied. Animal tests are used to search for potentially useful medicines, to establish that new drugs, cosmetics and consumer products are safe and to set standards for the handling of potentially hazardous chemicals and pesticides. Others are used in basic research on diseases such as cancer and AIDS, the environment and a wide range of behavioral questions. Estimates of how many animals are used annually by researchers vary widely - from 10 million to 100 million or more. Based on reports filed with the Department of Agriculture in 1983, the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment estimated that the overall number was ''at least 17 million to 22 million'' that year, with rats and mice accounting for about two-thirds of the total. The rest included 180,000 dogs, 55,000 cats, 500,000 rabbits, a similar number of guinea pigs and 60,000 monkeys, chimpanzees and other primates. Most scientists say that animals will always be indispensable in some fields of research. Indeed, some say the development of new medicines will require increased animal testing. But animal usage has already declined dramatically at some of the giant consumer companies that have been among the biggest targets of the animal rights protesters. Avon Products Inc. said it has reduced animal usage by 72 percent since 1981, to just over 4,000 rodents and rabbits a year. The Colgate-Palmolive Company, a pioneer in testing substances on chicken egg membranes instead of rabbits, has cut the use of laboratory animals by 90 percent since 1982, to less than 500 a year at its Piscataway, N.J., research center. And the Procter & Gamble Company reduced animal usage in testing consumer products by 60 percent from 1984 to 1986 and cut overall usage by 22 percent despite its expansion into pharmaceuticals with the acquisition in 1985 of Richardson-Vicks Inc. But formidable obstacles remain. Government regulators have been extremely cautious about relying on the new methods, in part because of the lack of consensus among scientists about when an alternative test can be certified as more accurate than an animal test in predicting the impact of chemicals on humans. Moreover, many companies are reluctant to sharply restrict or abandon animal tests until everyone does, fearing that being a pioneer would make it harder to defend against product liability lawsuits. And it will take years to train research employees to master the new techniques. ''The general public is not very aware of how much effort has gone into developing the science of toxicology,'' said Thomas Sabourin, the principal resident scientist in environmental toxicology at the Battelle Institute, an independent consulting and research firm in Columbus, Ohio. ''There's been a huge investment of time and money in understanding rats, for instance. It isn't going to change to another system overnight.'' The leading alternatives to animal or ''in vivo'' tests are the ''in vitro'' experiments conducted in test tubes. Some of the tests can be partly automated so that results can be tabulated by computer. Computer simulations are also becoming increasingly attractive for their ability to screen out potentially hazardous substances early in the product development process. In addition, toxicologists have been working to reduce the killing and animal distress by refining such widely used methods as the Lethal Dose 50 and Draize tests. The Lethal Dose test provides a rough picture of how toxic a substance is by determining the dose needed to kill 50 percent of a test group of rodents, which can number up to 200. Some toxicologists believe the necessary information could be obtained by using fewer than 10 animals in many cases. The Draize test projects how hazardous a substance is to the human eye by putting drops of a sample solution on rabbits' eyes, usually at a concentration that a growing number of toxicologists say is so strong that it produces distorted results. It is that kind of argument that scores points with research executives, who are bothered less by criticism of animal testing on moral grounds than by charges that it is scientifically suspect. Animal testing critics argue that many tests with animals are so poorly designed, given the differences between humans and other animals, that the resulting data are unreliable. They say that data from alternative experiments, and more studies of human exposure to hazardous substances and diseases, could answer the same questions more accurately. And they say that animal testing has failed to flag some dangerous products, such as thalidomide, the drug that caused thousands of birth defects in the late 1950's and early 60's, while leading to overestimates of the danger posed to humans by other products. But scientists who support the animal tests say the tests are better predictors of effects on humans than the protesters believe and that the tests are improving all the time as the animals themselves are better understood. These scientists argue that the interaction of new drugs or chemicals with something as complicated as a human eye or digestive tract cannot be measured in test tubes using simple organisms. ''A lot of times when you look at something in a dish, it is a very different environment from an animal body that has complex mechanisms to protect itself,'' said Joseph E. LeBeau, director of health and environmental sciences at the Dow Chemical Company. ''There are many different layers of cells and once something gets in, there's a biochemistry lab that detoxifies, excretes and so forth.'' The experimenters also say that such widely cited examples of the shortcomings of animal testing as the thalidomide case typically point to the need for better animal testing rather than an end to it. ''Thalidomide was tested afterward on Rhesus monkeys, which showed the same effects as humans,'' said Dr. Peter J. Gerone, director of the Tulane University Medical Center's Delta Regional Primate Research Center in Covington, La. ''An experiment with 20 monkeys would have saved 20,000 children from their deformities.'' Nevertheless, the experimenters agree that new alternatives can sometimes reveal more vital information than standard animal tests. Frequently, in-vitro tests or computer simulations help scientists explore why products work instead of simply what they will do. ''If we can do that, we can use fewer animals,'' said Dr. Robert A. Scala, senior scientific adviser to Exxon Biomedical Sciences Inc. ONE alternative that Colgate-Palmolive believes to be promising involves removing part of the shell of a fertilized chicken egg and putting the test substance on the exposed membrane. Damage to the heavily veined membrane can be correlated to the potential for irritation to the human eye or skin. Another test, developed at Rockefeller University by Prof. Ellen Borenfreund with support from Revlon Inc., categorizes a substance's toxicity on the basis of the damage it causes cell membranes. The cell cultures are placed in rectangular slides with 96 depressions and exposed to varying concentrations of the test substance. Those that are damaged absorb a red dye. In contrast to tests in which a substance is placed on a rabbit's eye, the results can be read mechanically and precisely. Both of these alternatives are being studied as potential replacements for the Draize method, which has been a leading target of animal rights groups since 1980. That was when Mr. Spira organized demonstrations at Revlon's New York headquarters and put together an advertising campaign asking ''How many rabbits does Revlon blind for beauty's sake?'' Later that year, Revlon gave $750,000 to start the search for an alternative at Rockefeller, kicking off a string of major corporate contributions, mostly through such trade groups as the Soap and Detergent Association and the Cosmetics, Toiletry and Fragrance Association. Radical animal rights groups say that the alternatives are already superior to the Draize test, which involves subjective estimations that vary from laboratory to laboratory about how much irritation a substance has caused in the rabbit's eye. ''One reason the cosmetics companies like animal tests is that they are so bad it allows them to put anything they want on the market,'' said Susan Rich, a representative of the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, a Washington-based organization with 250,000 members. As is usual when established practices are challenged, scientists and regulators are holding out for exhaustive scrutiny of the new alternatives. Reflecting that cautious stance, the proposed change at the top of the agenda of the three Federal agencies most involved with testing - the Food and Drug Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency - does not involve an in-vitro test at all, but rather Procter & Gamble's refined version of the Draize test. The company has been arguing for years that solutions 10 times more diluted than those commonly used in the test - and thus far less painful for the rabbits - correlate better with the known impact of irritants on humans than the standard test. Regulators, however, have repeatedly demanded more evidence. The dispute has highlighted the lack of agreement among scientists over what constitutes proof that a new test is a valid alternative to using animals. ''It takes several years for a test to be developed to the point where it becomes a candidate for a validation study and then the validation stage itself is controversial,'' said Mr. Sabourin at the Battelle Institute. Battelle, for example, is using eggs extracted from the South African clawed frog to test chemicals known to produce birth defects. The idea is to see if the scientists can duplicate the results of similar tests on rats and rabbits. ''No one seems to agree on exactly how validation should be performed,'' Mr. Sabourin said. Making things even murkier is the fact that, in most cases, Government regulations do not specify that animal testing must be used to prove product safety. Nonetheless, Federal agencies have typically refused to endorse any alternatives. Thus, while companies are free to use in-vitro or computer screening systems to select which products they will develop, they are reluctant to rely on them completely. ''When you are past screening, the problem of regulatory acceptance of alternatives comes in,'' said Dr. Gad of Searle. ''If you do something that isn't accepted, you've lost a lot of time and money.'' The fear of product liability litigation is an even stronger barrier to change. There are cases where toxicologists would like to use in-vitro tests in the early stages of product development but top management has been ''aggressively not interested'' because of potential legal problems, according to Paul Wegner, director of marketing for Clonetics, the San Diego company that is selling cloned human skin cultures for testing applications. ''They don't want anything in the records that might contradict the animal tests. They want to make sure they stick to the one approved method and do nothing else.'' Nevertheless, as studies replicating earlier findings appear and the sensitivity of the in-vitro tests to more substances is demonstrated, the pressure for change is growing. ''In-vitro technology has already proved simpler, cheaper and more predictive in many cases,'' said Dr. Alan M. Goldberg, head of the Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. ''That's a hard combination to beat.'' Some of that thinking is beginning to translate into economic activity. Some 150 smaller cosmetics companies have carved out a market among animal rights backers with new products that use only ingredients already approved by the F.D.A., allowing them to be sold without more testing. PERHAPS the ultimate sign of the times is the decision of Charles River Laboratories Inc., the world's leading producer of laboratory animals for toxicology testing, to get a foothold in the developing in-vitro market. The Wilmington, Mass.-based subsidiary of Bausch & Lomb Inc. licensed the right to market frozen mouse embryos and hamster ovas from Rio Vista International Inc. of San Antonio last July. The embryos and ovas are used by clinics specializing in in-vitro fertilization for women who have trouble getting pregnant. The mouse embryos serve as a check on the quality of the fluids in which human eggs are stored and the hamster ova are used to test the ability of the human sperm to penetrate an egg. ''We are currently looking at some others as well,'' said Dr. Melvin Balk, Charles River's executive vice president. Less established companies have also begun to search for products that could help toxicologists cut back on animal usage. Health Designs Inc. of Rochester has taken the lead in commercial applications of computers for toxicity problems. Last fall, it began marketing Topkat, a software program that estimates a chemical's toxicity and its ability to cause cancer, mutations and irritation from its structure. The program is, in a sense, a kind of clearinghouse of past experience. Kurt Enslein, the company's president, said that because the results of so much animal testing are kept private for competitive reasons the effort to gather enough data to design Topkat took nearly a decade. Clonetics, a privately held company founded in 1984, began selling its Epipack skin cultures to toxicologists in 1986. It had developed its expertise for cloning cells while working on skin replacements for burn patients. Organogenesis, a leading rival, is developing a product called Testskin that is likely to be considerably more expensive than Epipack but will more closely mimic the structure and behavior of living skin, a complex three-layered organ. Still another company, the National Testing Corporation of Palm Springs, Calif., is seeking acceptance of it Eytex kits as an alternative to the Draize test for screening product developments. The kit includes a compound of 53 proteins that resembles the composition of the eye. A solution containing the compound will turn cloudy if exposed to a substance that would irritate the eye. National Testing claims that tests in the past two years have shown a 96 percent correlation with the Draize method. And it says it can test three concentrations of a chemical for $99.50, compared with more than $1,000 for a Draize test of similar scope. ''I am not a staunch animal rightist,'' said Dr. Christopher Kelly, the company's owner, ''but this seemed like a wide-open field.'' THE PROTESTERS SHIFT GEARS THE animal rights movement has long employed a variety of tactics to garner attention, from illegal raids on laboratories to advocacy of economic boycotts. Recently, following the lead of groups protesting corporate America's involvement in South Africa, activists have begun to introduce shareholder resolutions and urge investors to avoid companies that do animal testing. The first such resolution came up last October at Procter & Gamble's annual meeting. The Cincinnati-based consumer products giant faced a proposal calling for it to stop using animal tests except when required by law, to disclose which tests are performed without anesthetics and to phase out product lines that cannot be developed without animal testing. The introduction of the resolution, sponsored by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, was accompanied by a demonstration outside the meeting. The Washington-based group had targeted Procter & Gamble because the company is among the nation's largest users of animals - more than 100,000 a year, according to the animal group's estimate. The company will not say exactly how many animals its uses, but based on published information the number may be as little as half that estimate. In going down to defeat with just 2.2 percent of the shares voted in its favor, the resolution highlighted tactical splits within the animal rights movement. Henry Spira, coordinator of a number of New York-based protest groups, backed the resolution's goals but criticized the campaign to stir up anger against P.&G., a company that he described as a leader in developing and promoting alternatives to animal tests. ''It doesn't make sense to attack people who are responding to our efforts,'' Mr. Spira said recently. Indeed, Mr. Spira said that most of the consumer companies that were prominent targets during the 1980's should now be encouraged to continue research and reforms already under way. As for the protesters, they should focus on new areas of concern where the numbers of animals likely to be affected are far larger, he said. The treatment of the nation's 4 billion farm animals is one such area. Mr. Spira has already persuaded the Ralston Purina Company, an agribusiness and pet food giant, to provide Texas A&M University with $163,000 to study how farm animals are affected by confinement. The company said that it is negotiating with Mr. Spira over his requests for additional grants. Animal rights activists are also gearing up to press Congress to restrict the patentability of new animal forms created by genetic engineering. They fear that once new businesses have been established based on such animals, the argument that humans have no right to harm or exploit other species will face a host of new opponents.

540-> Business People; A Banking Star Moves To Societe Generale
Ever since he joined Chase Manhattan Bank 25 years ago, Herve de Carmoy seemed destined for the upper reaches of European business. On Tuesday, the stockholders of Societe Generale de Belgique chose Mr. de Carmoy as administrator of Belgium's largest company and gave him a seat on the executive committee. Whether Mr. de Carmoy, 51 years old, will eventually emerge as the top executive at the holding company depends on the negotiations between the two sides that are now deciding how to work together after a bitter takeover battle. The French-Belgian side, which holds a slight upper hand, would like Mr. de Carmoy in charge; Carlo de Benedetti, the chairman of Olivetti S.p.A., has not made his stand clear. In May, Mr. de Carmoy left Britain's Midland Bank P.L.C., where he headed the international division. He was born in France, and this poses some problems in Belgium, where 55 percent of the population speak Flemish and where there is increasing clamor for Flemish-speaking executives to receive important posts. Mr. de Carmoy, who is also fluent in English and German, made a bow to those concerns on Tuesday when he delivered part of his remarks to the press in Flemish, reading from a paper. His accent was so German, however, that many listeners winced. Mr. de Carmoy attended the prestigious Institute of Political Studies in Paris and has an M.B.A. from Cornell University. At Chase Manhattan he was a protege of David Rockefeller and rose to be director of the bank for Western Europe. He left in 1979 for Midland, where last year he was the bank's highest-paid executive, earning $1.3 million. He also heads the French branch of the Tripartite Commission, an informal but powerful group of financiers and politicians. Mr. de Carmoy would not disclose his salary at Societe Generale, but said it would depend heavily on productivity bonuses. At a news conference yesterday Mr. de Carmoy said his philosophy centered on his belief that the business of management is people.

542-> THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Tracy-Locke Fills A Dual Post at the Top
Phil Slott, 45, backed by years of creative experience in New York and even a little in London, has shifted his flag to Tracy-Locke, the Sun Belt agency, of which he will be chairman and chief creative officer. The main office is in Dallas, there is another office in Atlanta and a third in Los Angeles, where Mr. Slott will be found. Most recently chairman and chief executive of BBDO in London, Mr. Slott is making the shift to Tracy-Locke under the Omnicom Group umbrella. Before London he was second in command of the New York office of BBDO under Philip B. Dusenberry. He had also worked in New York for Ted Bates Worldwide; FooteCone & Belding; Grey Advertising; Needham, Harper & Steers, and J.Walter Thompson. Tracy-Locke bills $350 million. Howard W.

CHARLES (CHUCK) R. GUARIGLIA is a 45-year-old senior vice president at Ogilvy & Mather Direct who has said, ''I'll be an Ogilvy man until the day I die.'' But he's leaving. For a long time, Mr. Guariglia, a Brooklyn boy transplanted to Middletown, N.J., has had a profound desire to be part of campus life. To do something to help young people. He has been studying the help wanted ads in The New York Times. For three years he has subscribed to The Chronicle of Higher Education, a weekly trade paper, and all the while his own work in advertising was moving closer to the kind of work he was seeking amid ivied walls. First he was put in charge of personnel in addition to his duties in account management. Then it was personnel and training domestically, with training worldwide added before long. Finally recruiting was included. That meant visits to campuses. And, so he saw the ad placed by St. Bonaventure University, which was looking for a dean of enrollment management. That sounded right to him and apparently he sounded right to the Franciscan fathers who run the place because he'll be leaving 450 Park Avenue South at 30th Street on July 8 and heading for St. Bonaventure and a 600-acre campus that accommodates a student body of 2,600 men and women. It's in St. Bonaventure, N.Y., about an hour-and-a-half drive from Buffalo. Although it means quite a pay cut, and there have been quite a few tears over leaving friends of 18 years, Mr. Guariglia couldn't be more enthusiastic about his second career. He said, ''I don't want to suddenly be 65 saying: 'I should have. I could have. I should have done what I was made to do.' '' He has visited the school and has done some deep thinking on its behalf, having already told its leadership that their problem is that they are in a share war with certain other colleges just as his clients are in share wars with their competitors. Mr. Guariglia has formulated a three-point marketing position for the university to present to prospective students directly or through their parents: ''We will challenge your mind. We will be there for you when you need us. We will prepare you for life and a successful career.'' Slightly different than what he has been doing of late at O.&M. Direct. In his office at O. & M. yesterday he explained that the agency had been able to fill its bottom-level personnel needs adequately from college grads who came looking. This year, however, the decision was made that perhaps the agency wasn't getting the best people that way. So he went to Boston University, Dartmouth, Holy Cross, Smith and William and Mary, seeking out liberal arts students ''who can write, speak, think critically and who can learn.'' The schools were selected, incidently, because some particularly good people at the agency are alumni. (Ogilvy & Mather, the parent company, only recruits M.B.A.'s.) Mr. Guariglia graduated in 1964 from Seton Hall University in South Orange, N.J., and soon after married a fellow Brooklynite, Eileen O'Flynn, currently a teacher at St. Catherine's parochial school near Middletown. After working for Lever Brothers as a salesman, he landed a job in the traffic department of Young & Rubicam, then served a two-year tour in the Army. Later he worked for six months with Abercrombie & Fitch as advertising manager under the fabled Schuyler Van Vechten, a former Y.&R. man himself. ''Then,'' Mr. Guariglia said, ''I was hired by Ogilvy & Mather and my life changed forever.'' Now it is about to change again.

546-> Senate Struggle Splits New York G.O.P.
The battle over who will be the next majority leader of the State Senate has turned into a broader struggle for control of the state's Republican Party, setting off a feud among Republican leaders that includes Alfonse M. D'Amato, the United States Senator. So fierce is the battle, which has pitted upstate against Long Island, that some senators say they were threatened by the state's Republican chairman, Anthony J. Colavita, and accuse Mr. D'Amato of trying to play powerbroker. 'Italian-American Cabal' Mr. D'Amato maintains he has taken no role and accuses some senators of ''concocting the outrageous scenario of an Italian-American cabal'' involving himself, Mr. Colavita, and Ralph J. Marino, a Nassau County Republican who is running for the majority leadership. The battle is particularly intense because, except for the office of Comptroller, the Senate is the sole element of state government and state patronage still controlled by Republicans, who hold 35 Senate seats out of 61. Warren M. Anderson of Binghamton, who has been majority leader for 15 years, is not seeking re-election this year. The race has come down to two candidates - Jay P. Rolison Jr. of Poughkeepsie, who is the favorite of many upstate lawmakers eager to keep an upstater in the post and who is viewed as someone who would run things the way Mr. Anderson does, and Senator Marino, a friend of Mr. D'Amato and an advocate for change, including giving more power to committee chairmen and less to key staff aides. ''I am disturbed with what I believe is pressure on senators from some quarters,'' Mr. Rolison said. Asked if he meant Mr. D'Amato, he said: ''I don't know how you can say anything else. It's unfortunate. It raises the perception that there is another agenda, that the agenda is not just what is best for the Senate.'' Said Mr. D'Amato: ''I'm not going to play any part. Do I have friends in the State Senate? Yes. Have I discussed with my friends what's going to take place? Yes. Am I soliciting support for someone? No.'' He accused the Anderson forces, who are known to favor Mr. Rolison, of spreading rumors about Mr. D'Amato's involvement to create a backlash against Mr. Marino. ''The real story lies in how those people are desperately attempting to retain their power,'' he said, referring to the perception that, if Mr. Rolison won, much of the Anderson network might remain. Mr. D'Amato also accused the Anderson camp of implying there was an Italian-American cabal by pointing out quietly that many of the senators supporting Mr. Marino so far are Italian-American. ''They'll do anything,'' he said of Mr. Anderson's aides. Charles Dumas, a spokesman for Mr. Anderson, said the majority leader had vowed to take no role in the race and would therefore not comment. Some of the battle's roots go back to last February, when Mr. D'Amato was supporting Bob Dole for the Republican Presidential nomination and Mr. Anderson was supporting George Bush. Mr. D'Amato accused Mr. Anderson of taking steps as majority leader, including influencing the timing of the state primary, that would favor Mr. Bush over Mr. Dole. No Love for Anderson In an interview, Mr. D'Amato reaffirmed that he had no love for Mr. Anderson, attacking his administration of the State Senate. ''Let's be frank,'' he said. ''For a long time now, the Senate has been run by the staffers, with little regard given to the members, and everybody knows it.'' The battle began to heat up earlier this month when Mr. Colavita, the Republican chairman, met with three State Senators from Westchester County - Nicholas A. Spano, Mary B. Goodhue and Guy J. Velella. In an interview, two of the Senators, who asked not to be identified, confirmed reports that Mr. Colavita demanded at the meeting that they endorse Mr. Marino. When they declined, the Senators said, Mr. Colavita refused to circulate their nominating petitions for re-election. The reports set off a storm in the Senate, with senators outraged at the allegations of threats, suspicious that Mr. D'Amato was behind the Colavita meeting and annoyed that outsiders were taking a role in what they see as a decision to be made solely by them. Mr. Colavita acknowledged that both he and Mr. D'Amato looked favorably upon Mr. Marino. But he denied holding up the nominating petitions or threatening any senator. He said, however, he would at some point take a role in the majority leader race. ''In due time I will make my position known,'' he said. ''It's my duty as a party official.'' Mr. Marino, asked about the meeting, said, ''This was done without my knowledge.'' Of Senator D'Amato, he said, ''He is my friend but he has not interceded on my behalf that I know of.'' Fueling reports of Mr. D'Amato's intercession was a dinner earlier this month at a restaurant here, Cafe Italia, where a longtime associate of Mr. D'Amato, Robert J. Malito, brought together Mr. Marino and some upstate senators. But Mr. Malito, a lobbyist here, said it was merely a friendly dinner, not an effort to boost Mr. Marino.

547-> SPORTS PEOPLE; Bonilla Leads Schmidt
Bobby Bonilla, the Pirates' third baseman, who is trying to become the first Pittsburgh player since 1981 to win election as a National League starter in the All-Star Game, leads Mike Schmidt of Philadelphia in the latest fan balloting. Bonilla, among the National League leaders in eight offensive categories, including batting average, home runs and runs batted in, has 614,305 votes in the balloting, the league announced yesterday. He is about 23,000 votes ahead of Schmidt, a perennial All-Star. Meanwhile, Ozzie Smith, the St. Louis shortstop and the leading vote-getter last year, is again No. 1, with 1,491,600 votes. Darryl Strawberry, the Mets' outfielder, is second with 1,163,527 votes. Other National League leaders are Will Clark, first base, San Francisco; Ryne Sandberg, second base, Chicago; Gary Carter, catcher, Mets; and two outfielders, Andre Dawson of Chicago and Vince Coleman of St. Louis. The All-Star Game will be played July 12 in Cincinnati.(AP)

548-> Dining Out Guide: Alfresco
This is a summary of reviews of restaurants that have appeared in The New York Times. Stars are followed by the date of original publication; restaurants mentioned in Diner's Journal do not have stars. Prices are current, and only weekend hours are given. American Festival Cafe * (July 27, 1984), 20 West 50th Street (246-6699) - In summer, people-watching from umbrella-covered tables replaces ice-skating as the popular outdoor sport at this cafe on Rockefeller Center's Lower Plaza. This is the scene of one of the city's most visited tourist haunts, but even those who live here welcome the chance to dine outside among the palm trees and geraniums. The regional American theme is reflected in a changing menu that will feature, starting Monday, a ''Baltimore crab feast.'' In addition to soft-shell and hard-shell crab specialties, the cafe offers barbecued ribs, Texas gulf shrimp, salamagundi and charcoal-grilled steaks and hamburgers. Entrees are $10 to $19.50. Open 11 A.M. to 3:30 P.M. and 4 to 11:30 P.M. Friday and from 9 A.M. to 3 P.M. and 4 to 11 P.M. Saturday and Sunday. Boathouse Cafe Diner's Journal (March 28, 1986), Central Park, Fifth Avenue and 72d Street entrance (517-2233) - If dining outdoors on Central Park Lake is an appealing thought, the Loeb Boathouse has a full-service restaurant on a tent-covered deck. The Boathouse operates a shuttle bus every 15 minutes from 6 to 10 P.M. from Fifth Avenue and 72d Street, 79th Street, 90th Street and the Metropolitan Museum garage at 82d Street. Light Italian appetizers, pastas, salads, egg dishes and grilled and poached fish entrees shape the menu. Entrees are $10.95 to $16.95. Hours are 11:30 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. and 4:30 to 10 P.M. Friday, Saturday and Sunday. El Rio Grande * (April 20, 1984), 160 East 38th Street, with entrances on 37th and 38th Streets (867-0922) - An imaginary border cuts through the kitchen and separates two airy dining rooms, one called Mexico, the other Texas. The same Tex-Mex menu is offered in both, however, and also on the outdoor patios facing 37th and 38th Streets. Frozen margaritas and an order of nachos with steak on a bed of guacamole might be a good way to begin an alfresco midtown meal. Entrees include grilled shrimp, Mexican steak and swordfish grilled with garlic, lemon, butter and cilantro. Entrees from $8.95 to $19.50. Hours are noon to 3:30 P.M. and 4 P.M. to 1:30 A.M. Friday, brunch from noon to 3:30 P.M. Saturday and Sunday; 4 P.M. to 1:30 A.M. Saturday and 4 P.M. to 12:30 A.M. Sunday. Tavern on the Green * (Jan. 29, 1988), Central Park West at 67th Street (873-3200) - Here is dining on a formidable scale (500 seats, 1,500 meals a day) in a lavish, festive and glitzy setting. A leafy outdoor patio beneath the illuminated trees is a delight for dining in the warm months. Appetizers of seafood sausage (made with fish and shellfish) served with basil-scented potato salad, lobster-and-crab cakes and lobster bisque are recommended. Entrees include sauteed salmon steak with white peppercorn sauce; sauteed sea bass with fresh fennel, and a veal chop served with braised endive and roasted potatoes set in a veal broth. Entrees are $16.50 to $31. Hours are noon to 3:30 P.M. and 5:30 P.M. to 12:30 A.M. Friday, brunch from 10 A.M. to 3:30 P.M. Saturday and Sunday, 5 P.M. to 12:30 A.M. Saturday and 5:30 to 11:30 P.M. Sunday. What the stars mean, page C20

550-> Company News; Metromedia Wins Ruling
The Lin Broadcasting Corporation said yesterday that the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court had reversed a 1987 lower-court ruling that upheld its right to acquire interests held by the Metromedia Company in cellular telephone companies in New York and Philadelphia. Lin, a broadcasting and publishing company based in New York, said the court had granted Metromedia's motions to dismiss Lin's lawsuits seeking to purchase Metromedia's 45 percent stake in the New York Cellular Company and Metromedia's 49 percent stake in the Philadelphia Cellular Company. New York Cellular is a joint venture established by Lin and Metromedia three years ago. In the suits, Lin sought to acquire Metromedia's stake in New York Cellular for $273.5 million and Metromedia's stake in Philadelphia Cellular at a price to be determined by appraisal of its fair-market value as of July 1986. A Lin spokesman estimated the price of the Philadelphia company at less than $100 million. Lin said it would review the latest ruling and was considering whether to appeal. Lin owns five AM stations and five FM stations in Philadelphia, Houston, St. Louis, Milwaukee and other cities.

551-> Company News; CJI Will Acquire Triangle Industries
Triangle Industries, the world's largest consumer packaging concern, said its shareholders had approved the acquisition of Triangle by a subsidiary, CJI Industries. The company will still be called Triangle, officials said. The acquisition increases to 82 percent the combined voting shares of Nelson Peltz, Triangle's chairman, and Peter W. May, the president. The two already controlled a majority of the voting shares. Triangle provides packaging for a number of household products in addition to its copper-wire and cable businesses. Triangle acquired the National Can Corporation in 1985 and the American Can Company's packaging business a year later. It had $4.3 billion in sales in 1987.

553-> AROUND THE GARDEN; Fall Chrysanthemums Add Late-Season Color
TRANSPLANT broccoli, cabbage, kale and Brussels sprout seedlings to the vegetable garden; water in well and mulch to keep the soil moist. Resow a half row of beans. Keep up with squash and cucumber harvest. Allow tomatoes to ripen on the plant for best flavor. Chrysanthemums Although most of the chrysanthemum plants are just in bud, garden centers and nurseries abound with them. These plants are popular sales items at this time of year. The mums provide splashes of color when perennials have gone. Or if the flower border has vacant spots, mums can be tucked in to provide color accents well into September and possibly October. If such an emergency planting is needed and the mums are just in bud, be sure to inquire what color the flowers will be to avoid any surprises. Mum plants provide great color accents. A few tubs set by a pool patio, or a pair of pots by a front door, express welcome. Sometimes a few pots of mums in full bloom are set around a garden to dress it up for a party. A few pointers on selecting plants: Grow mums in full sun for the best bloom. The flower buds are well set when the plants are purchased and there will be no need to pinch them back to encourage branching. (This deed should have been completed for in-ground garden mums last month.) Also, never neglect mums. They will need to have moist, not soggy soil. Container plants always dry out faster than in-ground plants. When frosts and snows come, cut the plants back to four or five inches from the ground. Containers will have to be moved into a garage or shelter of some kind lest the freezing and thawing of winter storms crack them. If the plants are grown in ground, cut them back to a height of four to five inches and after the ground freezes hard, they can be protected with mulch. Mums may or may not come back the following year. Much will depend on the winter and condition of the plants. QUESTIONS/ANSWERS LAWN FUNGUS In June my lawn turns brown because of a fungus. I start treating it in May with a fungicide, but it does not help. Has the fungus developed an immunity? K.J.F., Bayside Hills, N.Y. Lawn diseases are difficult to diagnose and timing the applications of any fungicide is critical. Has the fungus identification and treatment been confirmed by lawn professionals? This is essential rather than using a layman's view and making random applications of lawn chemicals. It is possible that the lawn has been over-tended with too many chemical/fertilizer applications; or mowed too closely; or thatch has been allowed to accumulate; or the soil is too acidic or poorly drained. A visit with the local office of Cooperative Extension, which is allied with the state's agricultural university, may prove helpful. GOOSEBERRY BUSHES Some garden centers are selling both white pine and gooseberry bushes. Is it now safe to plant both on the same property? Would gooseberry bushes thrive in light shade? J.S., Ridgefield, Conn. The reason for the question is the fact that the genus Ribes (currants and gooseberries) is alternate host to white pine blister rust. Although black currant is considered the most virulent species, all Ribes are suspect, and states have varying restrictions on planting. For regulations, check with the state's agricultural school or local Cooperative Extension office. In Connecticut, for example, there are no current regulations, but discretionary planting is advised. Also, gooseberries grow and fruit best when grown in full sun, not light shade. Address questions to Garden News, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York, N. Y. 10036. Those of general interest are published.

554-> ANSWERING THE MAIL
Q. The kitchen floor in our 1832 farmhouse is covered with layers of linoleum that we are taking off. The wood floor under this appears to be of four-inch-wide pine boards that we want to stain and seal. What is the best way to refinish this floor? A. You can apply a wood stain, then finish with two coats of polyurethane. But on a pine floor it would be better to use a colored penetrating sealer, for appearance as well as easier maintenance. These finishes give a low-luster sheen. Of course, the floor can be waxed if you want more shine. Penetrating sealers come in wood tones that will act as a stain, as well as a sealer. Apply two coats. Q. Our 45-year-old house has a screened porch built over the garage. The floor of this porch is wood covered with canvas. It has been painted many times with deck enamel that is now chipping and cracking badly. Can you suggest a more durable covering? A. Remove the old paint, then inspect the canvas. If it is still in good condition you can paint again with deck paint. But if it is in poor condition, cover the wood with fiberglass cloth and resin instead of canvas. This will last a lot longer and hold paint better. Questions should be addressed to Bernard Gladstone, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York, N.Y. 10036.

555-> Washington Talk: Briefing; The Bureau's Battles
The Federal Bureau of Investigation, although part of the Justice Department, has often acted like an independent agency. The bureau simply does not like to be told what to do, and the relationship has grown particularly testy with the arrival of Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, who seems determined to bring it into line. The first salvo came a few weeks ago, when aides to Mr. Thornburgh criticized the F.B.I. publicly over its independent lobbying on a gun bill. Mr. Thornburgh himself issued a memo to Director William S. Sessions and the heads of other Justice agencies, ordering them to speak before Congress with one voice: the department's voice. Copies of the memo were provided to reporters. To some at the department, the F.B.I. appears to be fighting back. And Mr. Thornburgh is not pleased. Word is that the Attorney General was offended when the bureau did not notify all its employees that they were invited to Mr. Thornburgh's introductory speech to the department last Friday. The speech, which centered on government ethics, was given in the Great Hall at Justice Department headquarters, across the street from the F.B.I. Mr. Thornburgh was said to have been doubly upset when he learned that Mr. Sessions himself had not been present, instead sending a deputy. ''There's certainly no effort on the part of the F.B.I. to snub the Attorney General,'' said Milt Ahlerich, the bureau's chief spokesman, noting that ''the speech was well received at senior levels of the F.B.I.'' Mr. Sessions missed the speech, the spokesman said, because he was making a presentation to the Office of Management and Budget that could not be postponed. A senior aide to Mr. Thornburgh, Robin Ross, said yesterday that the Attoney General now understood Mr. Sessions's reason for missing the speech. Reports of differences between the agencies notwithstanding, Mr. Ross said, the Attorney General and Mr. Sessions ''enjoy a warm relationship.''

556-> CONSUMER'S WORLD; Keeping the Air Cool: An Expert's Advice
Air-conditioners have been working overtime this summer, one of the hottest of the century. While some cooler air has arrived in the Northeast, air-conditioners will still be a part of life for a while. John Bjorge, the director of the Apex Technical School in New York City, which trains air-conditioning and refrigeration repair specialists, offered answers to some frequently asked questions about how to keep window and through-the-wall air-conditioners running smoothly and safely. Q. Should I leave my air-conditioner running in very hot weather when I'm not at home? It will cost more and it will consume extra energy, but it is safe to do so. Q. Where should the thermostat be set if I leave it running? Never at the highest number; turn it to a medium-cool setting so the compressor will not run constantly. Q. Where should the thermostat be set when I turn the machine on? Put it at the coldest setting, close the fresh-air vent, and when the room is comfortable, turn it to your normal setting. Q. How do I know if my air-conditioner is working properly? Use a thermometer to test the difference in temperature between the cool air and the inlet air (the air entering the unit at the filter). The difference should be 18 to 22 degrees Fahrenheit. For example, if the inlet air is 78 degrees, the cool air should be 56 to 60 degrees. Q. Is my air-conditioner big enough? Most power companies provide free ''heat load'' calculation forms. In general, it is worse to have a greatly oversize unit than a slightly undersize one. More advice is available by sending a self-addressed, stamped envelope to Stay Cool, Apex Technical School, 635 Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10011.

557-> At Camp, on a Rany Dy, You Can See Four Walls
THE first of a string of rainy days received mixed greetings from the campers and counselors of the Elmwood Day Camp, on Dobbs Ferry Road in White Plains. Boys and girls enthusiastically played ''ga-ga,'' a kickball game suitable for indoors, energetically danced to ''Ballin' the Jack,'' made tile trivots as well as beaded bracelets and played bingo. Counselors stretched their ingenuity to keep the children happy and occupied - even if for some youngsters nothing was as much fun as getting soaked under a leaky rain gutter. Chaos was held at bay that first morning, even during the dreaded ''shift'' times - when the many groups busy under one large roof changed activities. ''We can take a day like this every two weeks or so,'' the camp's director, Jeffry Ackerman, said with equanimity. ''More than that, and it's rough on kids and counselors.''

558-> BLACKBOARD NOTES; A Dangerous Sports Edge
FOR EIGHT YEARS, Greg Hall was ''on the juice.'' Like thousands of athletes and body-builders, he was using anabolic steroids to gain a competitive edge. Now 30 years old, Mr. Hall, a fitness director for a major health and racquet club in Detroit, says that ''the drug nearly killed me.'' Before that could happen, however, he responded to warning posters put out in a campaign by the University of Minnesota men's athletic department, in conjunction with a Minneapolis-based advertising agency to stop steroid use. The ''Steroids Are Big Trouble'' campaign, which began in the spring, consists of television, radio, and print advertisements. These focus on the side effects of the strength- and muscle-building drug, which include sex-characteristic disorders, vascular disease and cancer. ''Athletes have been using steroids for the past 30 years,'' said Erik Meints, the campaign director. ''But during the last few years, more people have been using steroids than ever before.'' Steroids, which are synthetic variants of a male hormone, testosterone, were originally used by professional athletes, as well as by competitive body builders. The campaign's officials, however, now say that steroids have reached athletes at the high school and college levels. According to Mr. Hall, who began using steroids at age 22, ''Abscesses started to grow on my body, and I'd come down with terrible fevers.'' One campaign report said steroid use by men could result in testicular shrinking, abnormalities in sperm count, sterility and prostate cancer. Women who use the drug may experience excessive hair growth, deepening of the voice, baldness, menstrual irregularities and breast cancer. Both sexes, the report says, could suffer acne, high blood pressure, hardening of the arteries and liver cancer.

559-> COLLEGE FOOTBALL; Columbia Turns to Experience in Opener
Larry McElreavy, the Columbia coach, who described himself as ''pessimistically optimistic,'' was being careful about the Lions' opening game tomorrow against Harvard in Cambridge, Mass. He will not start either of his acclaimed sophomore running backs, Greg Abbruzzese or Solomon Johnson, but plans to slip them into the contest at a later time. Preferring to use players with varsity experience at the outset, McElreavy will start Durc Savini, a senior, at halfback. And the coach hopes Harvard's opening kickoff will go to Terry Brown, another senior, rather than Johnson, who will be playing on the special teams. The 'Mental Monkey' Burden In the contest against the defending Ivy League champions, who beat the Lions, 35-0, last season, Columbia will be burdened with what the coach describes as ''the mental monkey.'' That is Columbia's five-year-old, 41-game losing streak, the longest in college football history. After the first period, Savini will move to fullback and Abbruzzese and Johnson will alternate at tailback in the I-formation offense. Johnson, called Solo by his teammates, scored 12 touchdowns last season for the first undefeated freshman team in Columbia's history. ''We need to play well early,'' said McElreavy. What the coaching staff fears are mistakes - turnovers -more likely to be committed by sophomores than seniors. In last year's game, Columbia made four fumbles, threw two passes that were intercepted and suffered a blocked punt. And Harvard went ahead, 28-0, in the second period. What little confidence the Lions had mustered in preseason was destroyed and the season continued downhill. More Speed and Depth This year's team is potentially better, McElreavy insisted, with plenty of speed and some depth. But it must prove itself and a 34-14 decision over Hofstra last Thursday in a scrimmage counts for nothing. Mike Seidewand, at quarterback, will be one of nine seniors starting on offense. The other two starters juniors: Matt Less, the opening-game quarterback last year, at tight end, and Chris Konovalchik, a fullback. Another Konovalchik, Chris's brother Alex, will be the Harvard fullback. Since defensive players seldom have the chance to make turnovers, McElreavy will be less choosy and start three sophomores on a raw unit. Harvard, too, has an inexperienced defense, but has a fine offense led by two aces: Tom Yohe at quarterback and Tony Hinz at halfback. ''The ball should be going up and down the field,'' said Joe Restic, the Harvard coach. ''Columbia will be a tough opponent for us.'' Elsewhere in the Ivy League, Yale will play at Brown in the first of six league games to be televised this season by ESPN; Penn will be at Dartmouth and Princeton at Cornell. Yale, which has beaten Brown only once in the last six seasons, will have the only proven defense in the league with eight starters returning. Brown's new quarterback is Danny Clark and Yale will start Bob Verduzco, both juniors. Army Goes to Seattle Cornell and Princeton, both contenders for the title, met at Princeton in the final game last season and the Tigers won, 23-6, as Judd Garrett ran for two touchdowns. Garrett is back, as is his brother, Jason, the star quarterback. Army is a three-touchdown underdog against Washington at Seattle in the first meeting between the two. Boston College will count on the pass-catch duo of Mark Kamphaus and Tom Waddle against Penn State, which had an impressive 42-14 opening victory over Virginia. Rutgers and Vanderbilt In the Colonial League, Lafayette may have a chance at home against Holy Cross, whose touted offense failed in a 23-3 loss to Army. The Leopards have an able quarterback in Frank Baur. Another key league game is Colgate at Bucknell. Connecticut, now the Yankee Conference favorite after routing Richmond, 35-12, will play New Hampshire in a contest featuring the league's two best quarterbacks: Matt DeGennaro for the Huskies, and Bob Jean for the Wildcats. Among metropolitan Division III teams, Wagner will try to rebound against St. John's after the Seahawks' stunning 40-13 loss to Ferrum. ''We'll see the real Wagner team,'' said Bob Ricca, the St. John's coach. With its new playing surface still incomplete, Brooklyn College will play Gallaudet at Midwood High School tomorrow afternoon instead of tonight.

563-> THE SEOUL OLYMPICS: NOTEBOOK; Yom Kippur Affects Contests
It does not seem fair, but because the ultimate responsibility for the rules in the Olympic Games rests with each international sports federation, athletes with identical problems can be treated very differently. Today was Yom Kippur, the most solemn Jewish holy day, and observant Jews could not participate in competition until after sundown. For Yehuda Ben-Haim of Israel, that meant being disqualified from the boxing tournament. The 106-pound boxer was scheduled to fight Wednesday and did not show up. But in gymnastics, a special allowance was made for Revital Sharon, an Israeli who was scheduled for the morning session in the women's team optional competition. The South Korean team had three members instead of four, so Sharon was allowed to join them and participate in the evening session. In Pusan, the two Israelis sailing in the men's 470 Class ignored the team ban on competing and sailed to a ninth-place finish. Israeli officials were planning to meet to decide what action to take against the sailors. Field Hockey Fan Watching the United States play the Netherlands in the stands at Songnam Stadium on Wednesday were United States Field Hockey Association officials, parents of the players, even the husband of one, who kept yelling ''Go, Eight!'' whenever his wife, Marcy Place von Schottenstein, was scrapping for the ball. Among the fans was 68-year-old Lilyann Wright, a professor of physical education at Trenton State College who has no connection to the Olympic field hockey team. ''I've been to every Olympics since 1972 to watch hockey, including the first time women's hockey was added to the Games, in Moscow,'' said Mrs. Wright, who started playing field hockey in 1938 and still plays in a recreational league. The hobby is expensive, though. For Moscow in 1980, she spent about $7,000 for two people, she and her oldest grandson, for a 21-day package that included seven days at the Games. Staying Afloat Manuela Carosi of Italy may win no medals in Olympic swimming, but she should get one for perserverance. In today's women's 100-meter backstroke trials, she and Karen Lord of Australia, swimming in different heats, tied for 16th place in 1 minute 4.69 seconds. That meant that an hour later they had to swim off for the eighth and final berth in the consolation final. The swim off resulted in a dead heat in 1:05.05. They swam off again 35 minutes later, and after the first 50 meters they were tied.The 23-year-old Carosi finally inched ahead and won, 1:04.62 to 1:04.75, a 9-inch margin. No Disappointment Most athletes who finish lower than they had expected or, after four years of training, fail to qualify for the final in their event express tremendous disappointment. But Bruce Davidson, 41 years old, is a little different. Twice a world champion in the equestrian three-day event, and the leader of the United States Olympic three-day team that won the gold medal in 1984, he and his horse, Dr. Peaches, had a bad fall on the rugged terrain of the cross-country endurance test Wednesday. Neither he nor Dr. Peaches was hurt, but the penalty points and lost time caused him to fall to 18th place. Davidson's reaction? ''I'm not disappointed,'' he said. ''I love horses. It's been fun training him and fun competing with him.'' Cool Reception Jens-Peter Berndt, a former world record-holder who defected from East Germany in 1985, is swimming here for West Germany. His relationship with the East German officials and swimmers no longer exists. ''It's like ice,'' he said. ''They consider me a traitor. They don't like me. They don't talk to me. It bothers them because they tried to keep it quiet, and now they're televising the Olympics and their people can see I'm alive and well and here swimming for the other Germany.''

564-> U.S. Will Study Corporate Payments of Taxes to Panama
The Treasury Department will investigate American companies that are said to be violating a Presidential directive to pay taxes owed in Panama into special United States escrow accounts, senior Administration officials said today. The investigation, which is expected to begin next week, will seek to determine how much the American companies owe the escrow accounts and whether the Administration should take punitive action. The inquiry will also look into unsubstantiated accusations from Capitol Hill that some companies may be paying the Panamanian regime of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to keep their operations running smoothly. ''We're going to ask major American companies to report to us what their accumulated payments are,'' a senior Treasury official said. Ban on Transferring Funds In February and March, at the height of the Administration's efforts to oust General Noriega, the Reagan Administration imposed several punitive financial measures against Panama, including banning American banks from transferring money to the Noriega regime and withholding fees owed for using the Panama Canal. Then on April 8, President Reagan invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, prohibiting all payments to Panama by American citizens and companies in Panama. Included was an order to American companies to withhold the taxes they owed and pay them instead into the escrow accounts. The money was to be turned over to Panama as soon as General Noriega was forced out of power. Instead, most companies are simply withholding payments from the accounts and are presumed to be using the money for their operating costs, senior Treasury officials said. The officials said they had no evidence that American companies were making payments directly to Panama. A Fine and Jail Time One senior Treasury official, who asked not to be named, said that most American companies doing business in Panama had ignored the Presidential directive, an offense punishable by a $10,000 fine and 10 years in jail. But the official said he was unaware of anyone having been punished for failing to pay into the accounts. Several American companies doing business in Panama said they believed they did not have to pay into the accounts to comply with the Presidential order. ''We are certainly in compliance with United States regulations and laws in that we are not paying the Noriega Government,'' said K. Peter Maneri, a spokesman for Texaco Inc., one of the largest American companies operating in Panama. He added that, while Texaco had not paid taxes into the accounts, the company's lawyers had concluded that it had not violated the directive. $3.9 Million Said to Be Deposited At a hearing of two Foreign Affairs subcommittees last week, Representative Sam Gejdenson, Democrat of Connecticut, said that according to estimates by the State Department, about $69 million should be in the accounts. Only $3.9 million has been deposited in the last six months, he said. Senior Administration officials did not dispute the $3.9 million figure. Many American companies contend that the economic sanctions have hurt their Panamanian operations, even though they have failed to force General Noriega out of power. But American officials said the sanctions were not intended as a long-term measure. ''A lot of people thought Noriega wouldn't last more than a couple of weeks without American support,'' the Treasury official said. ''I don't think there was any bad will on the part of American companies, which are in a terrible bind.''

565-> Jerry Rubin Is 50 (Yes, 50) Years Old
Jerry Rubin, the man famous for saying never to trust anyone over 30, just turned 50. ''It scares the hell out of me,'' said Mr. Rubin, who as a young radical in 1967 dropped dollar bills onto the floor of the New York Stock Exchange and campaigned to elect a pig as President of the United States. In recent years, he has generated nearly as much publicity by running a business that promotes a pastime called networking -through which people pay hefty fees to go to parties where they might or might not meet someone who can advance their careers. Tens of thousands have gone to the parties, and only the October stock market crash kept Mr. Rubin from selling $3 million of shares in Network America to the public. Uptown Celebration Thus, it seemed appropriate that some 70 friends from all over the country and from different chapters in Mr. Rubin's colorful life gathered for a party Thursday evening, his birthday, in his balloon-bedecked Upper East Side apartment. There were radicals and former radicals, investment bankers, rock-and-rollers, lawyers and Mr. Rubin's personal nutritionist. There was a former co-conspirator who was jailed for 60 days with Mr. Rubin in the Cook County Jail in Illinois, and a woman who discovered she and he had ''no chemistry'' when they met at Elaine's on a blind date 11 years ago but became friends anyway. Staring at the varied assemblage as if it had arrived from another planet was Mr. Rubin's mother-in-law, who begged not to be identified, claiming never to have told friends the identity of daughter Mimi's husband. ''He just is not the man I would have picked for my daughter,'' she explained. Then, she commented on the celebration: ''I'm shocked that he's so old.'' Remembrance of Cake The essence of the evening seemed to be people of a certain age pondering the notion that some things may be forever - but that others are more like the rapidly melting ice-cream birthday cake a friend had made Mr. Rubin a quarter-century ago. She brought pictures to show it off. Ambivalence was in order. ''I was 50 for awhile, but now I'm 49 again,'' Dan Greenburg, the writer, said. Rona Elliot, music correspondent for NBC's ''Today Show,'' recalled the time she and Mr. Rubin were roommates in 1973 in San Francisco. She talked of when a radio sex show she had produced was thrown off a local station, and when Mr. Rubin lent her money for Est training. ''The truth is, our generation is going to be rocking and rolling until we're 90,'' she said. ''We'll break all the rules.'' ''It's nice to reconfirm that we've survived,'' was the judgment of Lee Weiner. He, like Mr. Rubin, was among the ''Chicago Seven'' who were tried for conspiracy to disrupt the Democratic National Convention in 1968. He now works as a political consultant. 'The Same Person' ''Jerry seems to sort of be the same person,'' said Stewart Albert, an editor and writer from Portland, Ore., who marched with Mr. Rubin in Berkeley, Miami and Washington and was an unindicted co-conspirator in Chicago. The seven defendants were acquitted of conspiracy but five, including Mr. Rubin, were convicted of crossing state lines with the intent of inciting a riot. The convictions were later overturned. For Mr. Rubin, the day provided a chance to reflect on how things have worked out. His joy is his 11-month-old daughter, Juliet, who came to the party in a blue dress. His worry that he would follow his father to an early death (at 49) has been stilled by his regimen: no meat, no drugs, and exercise. Mr. Rubin, the yippie-turned-conspicuous-yuppie, is still capable of strong, sometimes inexplicable statements. ''This is a terrible way to put it, but I'm kind of a Gary Hart Democrat,'' he said at one point. Later, he clarified the remark, saying he was really a ''Bill Bradley Democrat.'' ''People would snicker,'' he explained. Screaming About Money Another time, he observed: ''Until me, nobody had really taken off their clothes and screamed out loud, 'It's O.K. to make money!' '' Gary Null, a nutritionist who has made Mr. Rubin a personal project, said he has been trying to make the case that ''there is life beyond Rolexes, BMW's and a second home in the country.'' Mr. Null thinks the lesson just could be taking. ''I see that he does a lot of things now without publicity,'' Mr. Null marvelled. ''He is developing what Montaigne called the austere mind.'' Indeed, Mr. Rubin insisted that he had first wanted to celebrate his birthday privately, but was talked into a party by his wife. He seemed profoundly happy, however, as he blew out the candles on his cake, the center of attention as always. ''I used to say don't trust anyone over 30,'' he said. ''Now I say don't trust anyone under 50.'' Then, he invited everyone back on July 14, 2038, to celebrate his 100th.

566-> Danish Chief Resigns Amid Complex Maneuvering
Prime Minister Poul Schluter resigned today after failing to win a clear mandate for his pro-NATO defense policies in the general election on Tuesday. The resignation, originally regarded as pro forma, set off unexpectedly intense parliamentary maneuvering that cast doubt on Mr. Shluter's future and boded further confusion over Denmark's troubled relationship with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Mr. Schluter, a Conservative who called the election as a referendum on Denmark's willingness to support NATO by allowing American and British ships carrying nuclear weapons into its ports, initially said he had tendered a ''temporary resignation'' in preparation for forming a new government. But in an unexpected development, Queen Margrethe invited a legislative leader from the rival Social Democrats to lead discussions about who should lead the new government. #8 Parties in Parliament The Queen's action underscored the complications of parliamentary politics in a country where eight parties are represented in the 179-seat Parliament, the Folketing. Experts here said it could be a day, a week or longer before it was clear whether Mr. Schluter or one of his rivals would form a government. Mr. Schluter is in trouble because a longtime ally, Niels Helweg Petersen, leader of the Radical Liberals, today joined with Svend Auken, leader of the Social Democrats, in advising the Queen to name Svend Jakobsen, chairman of Parliament, to lead the first round of talks on a new government. Mr. Jakobsen is to confer on Thursday with party leaders and advise the Queen as to their choice of a prospective prime minister. Many experts feel Mr. Schluter, Prime Minister since 1982, will hang on to the office. But these developments also raised the prospect that Mr. Helweg Petersen, whose 10-member party holds the balance of power between the big blocs in Parliament, could support either Mr. Jakobsen or Mr. Auken as the next prime minister. The appointment of the 44-year-old Mr. Auken, in particular, would have an unsettling effect on NATO allies. Crisis Over Nuclear Issue On April 14, Mr. Auken engineered passage of the resolution that provoked the current crisis. The resolution called on the Government to remind NATO vessels of Denmark's 31-year-old ban on nuclear weapons. American and British officials said the questioning of incoming ships about their weapons would undermine NATO unity and violate longstanding policies of secrecy. Before today's developments, Western diplomats and pro-NATO politicians were relieved over the election results, which cut into the strength of a shifting, Socialist-led ''security-policy majority'' that had pulled votes from the Schluter Government on military issues. These anti-NATO forces, led by the Social Democrats, actually lost ground on Tuesday. They went into the election with 95 seats. They came out with 90, still a bare majority, but one so small that it would be less able to frustrate Mr. Schluter's governing center-right coalition, which has been able to remain in power because it commands a dependable majority on non-military issues. This tilt against the Socialists was largely the result of a surge by the right-wing Progress Party to 16 seats from 9. ''The vote demonstrates a significant shift from left to right in support of pro-NATO parties,'' Defense Minister Bernt Jona Collet said today. At the same time, Mr. Schluter said that if chosen by the Queen to form a new government, he would move immediately to reassure NATO allies that their ships were welcome in Danish ports on a no-questions-asked basis. NATO Is Relieved These initial signals prompted relieved comments from NATO headquarters in Brussels. Reuters quoted an unnamed diplomat as saying ''the fact that Schluter is coming back takes the heat out of things'' between Denmark and the other allies. Mr. Auken, 44, also sought to reassure NATO today. Noting that 53 percent of the popular vote went to parties that supported the anti-nuclear resolution, he said: ''There is a vast majority in the Danish people that wants us to be in NATO. There is also a clear majority that wants us to underline the non-nuclear policy that we have. But the people really look for a compromise to this question.'' He suggested a compromise by which Denmark would simply inform other governments about its nuclear weapons ban, but would not press for inspections of visting ships or seek guarantees from captains that no nuclear weapons were aboard.

567-> BASEBALL: AMERICAN LEAGUE; Tigers Top Red Sox And Widen Lead to 4
Doyle Alexander showed again today there's nobody better when the money's on the table. Matt Nokes hit a two-run home run that backed Alexander's seven-hit pitching as the Detroit Tigers beat the Boston Red Sox for the fourth straight time, 4-2, matching Boston's longest losing streak of the season. ''I always want to finish strong,'' said Alexander, who went 9-0 after coming to Detroit late last season. ''You check my record from about the end of August on. It's probably as good as any in baseball.'' The victory increased the Tigers' lead over Boston to four games. The Red Sox entered the five-game series riding the crest of a 19-1 streak under Manager Joe Morgan, who took over after the All-Star Game break. Boston is 19-5 under Morgan. Alexander (11-6), who struck out six and didn't walk a batter, is unbeaten in his last seven outings at Tiger Stadium, going 5-0 over that stretch. He is 7-2 in 11 starts at home this season and 12-2 in 17 lifetime starts here as a Tiger. ''Alexander is effective because he spots the ball well, has a lot of different arm angles and he's smart out there,'' said Marty Barrett, Boston's second baseman. ''He never throws the ball down the middle of the plate. He makes you hit his pitch. ''You think, 'I'm going to get a couple of hits off this guy today' and the next thing you know you're taking a shower and wondering what happened.'' Wes Gardner, making his eighth start since being forced into the Boston rotation by an injury to Jeff Sellers, allowed four runs on nine hits in six and two-thirds innings. Gardner walked five and struck out six. ''We've been fighting an uphill battle the whole time we've been here,'' Barrett said. ''The Tigers are a great team. They're not in first place by accident. ''But, who knows? Maybe by having this hot streak at home they'll go out on the road and lose a few next week.'' The Tigers play three in Texas and three in Boston next week. The Tigers led, 4-0, before Todd Benzinger's two-run homer in the seventh. Luis Salazar singled in the third, moved up on a sacrifice by Jim Walewander and scored on Dave Bergman's two-out double. Pat Sheridan hit a two-out single in the Detroit fifth, went to third on Alan Trammell's single and scored on a single by Bergman. Gardner walked Dwayne Murphy to load the bases but, after a visit to the mound by Morgan, got Chet Lemon to pop-up on the first pitch. Evans led off the sixth with a walk and rode home on Nokes's 14th home run, a towering shot off the facing of the third deck in right field. Mike Greenwell tripled in the seventh and scored when Benzinger hit the first pitch into the right-field seats for his 10th home run and third of the series. Athletics 5, Mariners 4 OAKLAND (AP) - Jose Canseco became the 11th player in major-league history to steal 30 bases and hit 30 homers in the same season and he also scored the winning run in the ninth inning. Four players stole 30 bases and hit 30 homers last season: Howard Johnson, Darryl Strawberry, Joe Carter and Eric Davis. Dave Henderson led off the ninth with a single against Mike Jackson (6-3). Canseco forced Henderson and later stole his 30th base. Canseco took third on Jackson's wild throw on a pickoff attempt and scored on a sacrifice fly by Mark McGwire, who had three hits. McGwire leads the majors with 16 game-winning runs batted in. Terry Steinbach drove in three runs for the A's. Gene Nelson (7-3) pitched two perfect innings in relief. Steve Balboni's three-run homer off the Oakland starter, Todd Burns, in the sixth tied the game. Bruce Fields led off with a single, Alvin Davis walked one out later and Balboni followed with his 16th homer of the season and 14th since joining the Mariners on June 1 after being released by Kansas City. Royals 11, Blue Jays 1 TORONTO (AP) - Mark Gubicza allowed three hits over eight innings, striking out a season-high 10, and four Royals hit bases-empty home runs for Kansas City. Kurt Stillwell, Jamie Quirk, Danny Tartabull and George Brett each had home runs for the Royals. Brett's was the 250th of his career. Gubicza (14-6) allowed only Fred McGriff's 27th homer of the season in the second inning before giving way to Steve Farr, who pitched a hitless ninth. Quirk led off the third against Dave Stieb (11-8) with his fourth homer. One out later, Stillwell hit his 10th homer. Tartabull hit his 17th homer in the fourth inning. Indians 5, Rangers 3 ARLINGTON, Tex. (AP) - Brook Jacoby hit a two-run homer off the top of the left-field wall to snap a fourth-inning tie as the Indians ended a six-game losing streak. John Farrell (12-7) allowed eight hits, struck out three and walked two in seven-plus innings. Farrell has pitched into the sixth inning in each of his 32 career starts. Doug Jones pitched two innings for his 25th save. Charlie Hough (9-13) pitched his eighth complete game but gave up 12 hits, the most he has allowed in 673 career appearances.

568-> U.S. TRADE DEFICIT SURGED IN AUGUST TO $12.2 BILLION
The nation's trade deficit climbed sharply in August, to $12.2 billion, as both imports and exports reached record levels, the Commerce Department reported today. The deficit had been expected to grow from the $9.5 billion of July but came in even higher than analysts had predicted. The report, the last one on trade before Election Day, came on the day of the Presidential debate between Michael S. Dukakis and Vice President Bush and prompted a fresh exchange of charges by Democrats and Republicans over one of their most divisive economic issues. ''While imports flood America, George Bush and Dan Quayle sit back and let the damage accumulate, telling Americans, 'Don't worry; be happy,' '' said Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Democratic Vice Presidential candidate and a leading promoter of the comprehensive trade legislation enacted this year. The legislation was aimed at forcing trading partners to open their markets wider to American exports. A $2.7 Billion Rise A spokesman for Mr. Bush called the $2.7 billion August rise in the deficit a normal fluctuation. He said that over the first eight months of the year the deficit had been reduced by $32 billion and that this ''firmly demonstrates that the attack on the trade deficit is working.'' The subject is so important because a growing trade deficit implies that domestic industries are less competitive and more workers' jobs are in danger. And the dollars accumulated overseas from United States purchases of imports can be used to buy American companies, real estate and Government bonds. The trade report sent the dollar tumbling on world currency markets. A worsening trade picture often implies that a country's currency needs to decline to make the price of the nation's goods more attractive and help restore the country's competitive position. [ Page D1. ] Markets Make Comeback The stock and bond markets also fell on the news that the deficit had expanded, but both later steadied. Wall Street analysts, many of whom had expected a deficit of $11 billion to $12 billion, suggested that the stock market had absorbed the trade deficit fears on Wednesday, when there was a significant selloff. [ Pages D4 and D12. ] The markets had been jittery in recent days on the prospect of a poor trade report. Last year, dismal August trade figures were reported a few days before the Oct. 19 stock market crash. Although many economists said they were disappointed by the latest figures, they stressed that one month's report is an unreliable indicator of trade trends even with the recent restoration by the Commerce Department of adjustments for seasonal variations. The latest report seemed to support the contention of many, however, that the boom in exports - and improvement in the trade deficit - is slowing. Despite today's gain in exports, the August advance put total exports only slightly above the level of May. But the figures also indicated that the economy as a whole remains quite vigorous. ''It suggests production isn't suffering all that much, and domestic spending doesn't seem to be slowing down all that dramatically,'' said John D. Paulus, chief economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. Exports climbed by $1 billion, or 3.9 percent, in August to a record $27.5 billion, with automotive products providing the bulk of the increase, the department said. The increase was the biggest gain since May and came at a time when some had begun to express fears that various export-oriented industries were running up against capacity limits. Unemployment Claims Fall Another sign of a buoyant economy was that initial claims for state unemployment insurance were at their lowest level for a nonholiday week since late 1973. The economy ''is more ebullient than it's given credit for,'' observed Lacy H. Hunt, chief economist for Carroll McEntee & McGinley Inc., a major dealer in Government securities. Imports, meanwhile, leaped $3.7 billion, or 10.4 percent, to $39.7 billion, as Americans bought heavily a wide range of foreign goods. Capital goods, many of which find their way into new or modernized factories that raise the country's long-range productive capacity, rose a hefty $1.1 billion. Consumer goods other than automotive products also rose $1.1 billion. Analysts expressed disappointment about the import surge, which compared with a $3.5 billion decline in July, but said they would not become alarmed unless it was repeated in September. Nonetheless, they remained uneasy about the relatively poor position on imports, which because of their level -at almost 50 percent above exports -must bear a bigger burden in improving the deficit. ''We're going to have to get some import substitution,'' said Michael P. Daly, an economist for the Cigna Corporation, referring to a shift to domestic producers from foreign ones in meeting American demand. ''It hasn't happened yet.'' 'Still Coming Down' Several economists, agreeing with the Republican candidates, said they still thought the trade deficit to be in a declining trend, albeit at a slower pace. ''The trade deficit's still coming down,'' said John O. Wilson, chief economist for the Bank of America, pointing to quarterly figures showing a $150 billion annual rate in the first quarter, $133 billion in the second quarter and $130 billion in the first two months of the third quarter. One product not susceptible to sizable substitution, however, is oil. The country's bill for imported oil climbed to $3.7 billion in August, from $3.4 billion, as the effect of 27 million additional barrels, to 244 million, more than offset a 62-cent decline in the average price of a barrel. Over all, based on figures that are not seasonally adjusted, the nation's deficit in manufactured goods eased to $12.6 billion, from $12.8 billion, while the surplus in agricultural commodities slipped to $813 million, from $884 million. By country, the United States saw its deficit rise with Japan and the newly industrialized countries of Asia; the deficit improved sharply with Western Europe and Canada, also not adjusted for seasonality. The imbalance with Japan swelled to $4.7 billion, from $4.4 billion, while that with the newly industrialized countries advanced to $3.3 billion, from $2.7 billion. With Canada, the country's biggest trading partner, the deficit fell to $500 million, from $1.1 billion. The United States had a $1.4 billion deficit with the countries of Western Europe, down from $2.3 billion in July. As calculated without including the cost of insurance and transportation for imports - the only way the figures will be reported after this year - the August deficit was $10.6 billion, up $2.6 billion from the July level.

571-> Auto Safety in a Cul-de-Sac
Search the speeches of Vice President Bush and Gov. Michael D. Dukakis for evidence that they think safer motor vehicles are a matter of national concern. You'll wind up in a dead-end street. This is astonishing, for injuries related to the use of motor vehicles are the leading cause of death to most age groups - starting with newborns. Today, there are more than 45,000 deaths and 10 times that many severe injuries annually from motor vehicle accidents. Substantial increases in these statistics can be expected in the next few years. Why? The Administration's malign neglect has brought about virtually the total collapse of the Federal program to regulate vehicle safety. In nearly eight years, this once vigorous program has issued only one new vehicle safety rule: the requirement for a third, high-mounted brake light on new cars. The disintegration of the program has demoralized career members of the technical staff of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, an arm of the Transportation Department. It has in effect granted the auto companies nearly total authority over motor vehicle safety features, standards and the timing of their introduction - authority vested in the Government by law but ignored by Reagan appointees. Only shambles are left of the promising program projected in the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966. Sooner or later - probably sooner, since vehicle deaths are increasing -the next Administration will face a crucial policy choice: It will have to let the program die or make a concentrated effort to revitalize it. The 1966 act directs the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to set and maintain minimum standards to improve safety. It was enacted because auto companies refused to provide safely designed products voluntarily or, when they did, to maintain those levels of safety. Air bags, for example, were first offered by some companies in the early 70's, but because no Federal standard required them, they were withdrawn a few years later. The result has been hundreds of thousands of deaths and very severe injuries. In impressive full-page ads this week, Lee Iacocca, Chrysler's chairman, says car buyers have ''the right to a safe vehicle.'' So Chrysler, the ad boasts, is putting airbags in some of them. (Ford began putting such safety equipment in its new cars more than a year ago.) It's great -pretentious - theater, especially for Mr. Iacocca, who until recently opposed air bags, which he said could kill people in crashes. Today, if the companies can be trusted to build adequate, minimum levels of safety into new cars without Federal standards, Congress and the public should see the proof. Only then might the 1966 act be safely repealed and the regulatory program allowed to die. Vitalizing the program means re-educating Congress and the public. Both need to be reminded that new cars still are not required to have back-seat shoulder belts, laceration reducing windshields and side windows, adequate protection against ejection, built-in resistance to rollovers and side impacts and, of course, airbags - features that have been technologically feasible for years. A decade ago, the program's slogan was ''20,000 by 2000'' - shorthand for the goal of cutting the car crash death toll in half by the year 2000. Today, holding the line at 50,000 deaths per year until 2000 will be hard to accomplish even if the program can be rebuilt by 1990, for it takes a decade for a new-car safety standard to affect every car on the road. People seem to think the auto safety problem is ''solved'' - or, at least, that Washington has it under control. Mr. Bush and Mr. Dukakis, at least, should show they know this isn't the case.

572-> Baseball Notebook; Slow-Motion Race in East
Is this any way to run a pennant race? In the past month, since Aug. 7, the Detroit Tigers had a 9-20 record (before last night's games), the Yankees were 10-19 and the Boston Red Sox 15-14. Yet they have been the three primary contenders for the American League East championship. Had been. The Milwaukee Brewers have joined the race; maybe the Toronto Blue Jays, too. The Brewers and the Blue Jays, at least, have compiled records befitting a pennant race in the past month: the Brewers 19-11, the Blue Jays 17-11. The combination of contenders and recent records injects a touch of irony into the division. Considered not long ago the toughest and most competitive division in the major leagues, the American League East should be won this season not by the team that soars the highest in the remaining 25 days but the one that stumbles the least. Additional irony: the division has more contenders now than in the years in which it was legitimately the best of the four divisions. The Red Sox are the leaders now after a 77-day stay in first by the Tigers, which followed a 48-day residence there by the Yankees. But the Red Sox are no juggernaut. From the day they moved to two games behind Detroit, Aug. 23, until they tied for first last Sunday, only twice did the Red Sox take advantage of Tiger losses by winning. On six other days they matched the Tigers' losses. The Yankees matched the Tigers loss for loss five times in that span. The Brewers, meanwhile, won six times on days the Tigers lost in that period. Of course, five of those times the Tigers lost to the Brewers. A month ago the Brewers were 12 games from first; entering last night's games, they were 4 1/2 out. ''I get a crazy hunch on this Milwaukee club,'' said Sparky Anderson, whose Tigers lost six of seven recent games to the Brewers. ''Their pitching is so good now and when they need a big hit, they're getting it. I don't have any idea if I'm right, but I kind of smell something.'' What Anderson should smell is the rotten way his team has been playing. The Tigers rode their pitching to first place, but it's the rare pitching staff that can withstand the seasonlong pressure created by the lack of hitting that has plagued the Tigers. On Aug. 6, the Tigers' team earned run average was 3.48. In the month since, the e.r.a. has been 4.75. ''I don't know if our pitching can carry us the rest of the way,'' Anderson said, his voice indicating more doubt - reality? - than at any other time this season. The Tigers and the Yankees, beginning tonight, play the first major series of the rest of the race. A member of the Tigers' front office was talking to a Yankees follower the other day and was lamenting Detroit's hitting. The Yankees follower lamented the Yankees' pitching. ''You haven't seen the Tigers' hitting,'' the Detroit man said, ''and I haven't seen the Yankees' pitching.'' Both are in for a shock. The Yankees and the Tigers play seven times. The Yankees and the Red Sox play seven times. The Tigers and the Red Sox are finished playing. The Blue Jays play the Red Sox six times and the Tigers three times. All four teams also play Cleveland and Baltimore: the Tigers and the Blue Jays 13 times each, the Yankees and the Red Sox 10 each. The Brewers play none of those teams. They are the swing team and play out the schedule with Western Division teams: Oakland and Seattle six times each, California five and Chicago three. Such a schedule can have advantages and disadvantages, but as Joe Carter of Cleveland said, ''If they win 20 in a row, they got to like their chances.'' Not Giving Up The Orioles took themselves out of the American League East race by losing their first 21 games. The Indians, like the Orioles, were never considered serious contenders, but they were in first place for much of April and were only three games from first late in June. In the next seven weeks, though, they suffered three six-game losing streaks and a five-game skid. Still, considering the way the contenders are stumbling, Carter thinks the Indians retain an outside shot at rejoining the race. ''We have 25 games left and they're all with the contenders,'' the Indians' center fielder said. ''If you get hot, you can win a lot of games. It's been a frustrating year, but we looked up a couple days ago and said, 'We're in a race.' Then we lost those two games like we did. We could've been eight games out. That's why losing those two games hurt.'' After losing the first game of a doubleheader, the Chicago White Sox beat the Indians, 5-2, Sunday by scoring five runs in the last two innings, and the Yankees beat them, 7-2, Monday by scoring six runs in the eighth. Doug Jones, the Indians' No. 1 reliever, gave up four runs Sunday and wasn't available Monday. ''He's had such a great year we expect too much from him,'' Carter said of Jones, who has 30 saves in 36 save opportunities. ''We've got to get some middle relief, guys who can get us to the ninth for Doug. You can't have your short man getting five or six outs for a save every time. That's too early.'' East vs. West Besides becoming involved in the American League East race, the Brewers hold the fate of their division's honor in their hands. Entering the Brewers' game against the White Sox last night, the Western Division held a 283-282 lead in interdivision games this season. In the previous 19 years of division play, West teams have held a season edge only twice, in 1971 (215-214) and 1977 (257-247). Excluding the strike-split season of 1981, Eastern teams have won more than 300 games against Western teams for eight successive seasons.

574-> A K.G.B. Aide Attacks Secrecy, His Agency's Stock in Trade
A K.G.B. official, in an article published this week, says that excessive secrecy in the Soviet Union has produced abuses of power, crippled scholarship and left citizens ignorant of basic information about their own country. The official, Vladimir A. Rubanov, a department head at a K.G.B. institute, wrote in the September edition of the journal Kommunist that a cult of secrecy had dominated and damaged the country for decades. ''The preservation of the secrecy cult in political practice and political thinking is a way of supporting faith in the infallibility of bureaucratic thinking and a chance for power to be used irresponsibly and uncontrollably in the narrow interests of small groups of people,'' the article said. The blunt attack on secrecy, unusual even by the more open standards of discourse under Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, is particularly striking coming from the K.G.B., long the feared guardian of Soviet secrets. A Symbol of Repression The agency has been associated with abuses of power in the past, particularly under Stalin, and its enforcement of secrecy laws has often been seen in the West as a symbol of repressive Soviet policies. Soviet dissidents who questioned the intense secrecy here in years past were dealt with severely, often imprisoned or subject to harassment by the K.G.B. In an interview published in Pravda last week, the head of the K.G.B., Viktor M. Chebrikov, said that secrecy in some cases should be reduced, although his statement fell well short of Mr. Rubanov's indictment of prevailing standards and pointedly noted that the safeguarding of secrets remained essential. The two articles suggest that the intelligence and internal security agency is trying to modify its image somewhat and associate itself publicly with Mr. Gorbachev's policy of increased openness. The articles represent an unusual degree of visibility for the agency, and have been viewed by some Western diplomats as part of a continuing effort by key Government institutions to adjust to new realities under Mr. Gorbachev. Much Information Classified The military, under Mr. Gorbachev's guidance, has set aside it's customary emphasis on secrecy to permit the inspection of military installations by American officials under the treaty eliminating intermediate range missiles. Last month, Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci visited several Soviet military bases and was given a firsthand look at the latest long-range strategic bomber, known in the West as the Blackjack. The role of the K.G.B. under Mr. Gorbachev - and its support for his programs - have been difficult for outsiders to determine with any precision, but, in general, the agency appears not to be an obstacle to his policies. Under the stringent secrecy laws, a key component of the Soviet system, a wide variety of economic and scientific information, as well as more sensitive military data, has been classified, often depriving scholars of material essential to research. The country's chief cartographer acknowledged last week that for the last 50 years the Soviet Union has deliberately falsified virtually all public maps of the country on orders of the K.G.B. A number of leading economists and scientists have complained in recent months that the obsession with secrecy has hindered their work, preventing the country from keeping pace with technological advances in the West. Because much economic data have either been classified or altered to mask failures, Soviet economists have lacked key information about the performance of industry and agriculture, making it difficult to develop effective policies. Standards Called Outdated Mr. Rubanov, echoing this criticism, said in his article that secrecy standards were outdated, shielding innocuous information that was often widely available in the West and that would be useful to citizens and scholars. The article did not identify the institute beyond calling it a scientific research institute of the K.G.B. Mr. Rubanov was identified only as head of an unspecified department at the institute. The writer did not deal with the question of whether he was writing for himself, the institute or the agency. Soviet officials rarely make this distinction when writing, and the general assumption is that authors who are officials are not expressing merely their personal opinions. Calling for an overhaul of the Government's entire information policy, he said: ''People's trust and support can be obtained only in exchange for trust to the people. ''Yet how can we talk about confidence when classified military-political and military-economic information disclosed at negotiations which is then broadly publicized in the foreign press is not always made accessible to the Soviet public.'' He added, ''It seems some 'state interests' are protected not from the foreign threat, but rather from Soviet citizens.'' A Change Is Suggested He contended that the classification of information, including scholarly work, had been used to hide inferior papers and reports. Unless the elaborate system of secrecy is modified, Mr. Rubanov said, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve the kind of change Mr. Gorbachev has proposed, including increased democracy and reduced Government control over nearly all aspects of Soviet life. To change the situation, Mr. Rubanov suggested that information be considered open until a clear need to classify it is established. Currently, he said, there is ''a presumption of secrecy.'' Mr. Chebrikov reported in the Pravda interview that the K.G.B. had worked recently with other Government organizations to declassify materials, particularly economic and scientific data, and said that further steps in this direction would be taken. He added that the declassification process should ''by no means imply a lack of vigilance and effort to insure the safeguarding of state secrets.'' ''There must be no misunderstanding on this question.''

578-> IF YOU'RE THINKING OF LIVING IN: Nyack
''NYACK is a place that's growing up and coming out of adolescence,'' said Bunny Crumpacker, the author of The Guide to the Nyacks. A few decades ago, this Rockland County village overlooking the Hudson River had few specialty shops and almost no cultural life. The opening of the Tappan Zee Bridge in 1955 provided a major connection with metropolitan New York, but some old-timers say this only resulted in more traffic and crime. But an infusion of Federal subsidies beginning in the 60's spurred commercial growth and today the community bustles with restaurants, small businesses and a flourishing trade in antiques. ''It's all those young people that are turning it around,'' said the actress Helen Hayes, a 56-year resident. ''A lot of those turn-of-the-century houses are unwieldy. Young people are turning them into two- and three-family houses. The place looks prosperous now.'' A large part of the revival can be attributed to an infusion of about $7 million in Federal urban-renewal and Community Development grants. These funds resulted not only in new construction such as the 83-unit moderate-income Tallman Towers and Nyack Plaza, a 173-unit housing complex with 96 units reserved for the elderly, but also in private developments, refurbished buildings and tree plantings. Residents say that the best things in Nyack are free. Among them are the one-day Septemberfest, on Sept. 18 this year, and the three antiques fairs sponsored each year by the 68-member Art, Craft and Antiques Dealers Association. Art lovers can also visit the Hopper House, Edward Hopper's childhood home at 82 North Broadway, which is now a New York historic landmark and an exhibition site. Dining out is diverse, with choices like the Middle Eastern Habebe, a sushi bar called Toshiko and a Thai restaurant called King and I. And night life thrives in a plethora of bars and restaurants, nine music and dance clubs, two community theaters, the Elmwood Playhouse and the Belfry Repertory Theater, and Cinema East, which shows first-run movies. The choice parkland in or near the village is one of Nyack's many amenities. In Memorial Park, looking out to the Tappan Zee Bridge, there is the only public boat launching ramp in Rockland County and a fishing pier. At Hook Mountain Park, residents can picnic by the beach near Rockland Lake where Indians once camped. The private Nyack Boat Club, at the foot of South Main Street, has 300 moorings and Petersen's has a complete service marina and 70 slips. Named after the Indians who first settled there, Nyack became a Dutch settlement in 1684, a shipbuilding center in the 1700's, and a factory town in the 1880's with the arrival of the Erie Railroad. Since the Civil War, when Nyack was a stop on the underground railroad, the village has had a black community. Like many other cities in the late 1960's, Nyack had racial disturbances. Today, its population is one-third minority, including a large Haitian population, and by all accounts race relations are harmonious. ''You can walk down the street and hear somebody speaking Russian, Creole, French,'' Ms. Crumpacker said. ''It's the fact that you can't classify a typical Nyacker that makes it so enjoyable,'' said Ken Kral, who refers to his rare-book shop, the Pickwick Book Store, one of two in Nyack, as ''the last gas station on the end of the desert where everything else is a mall.'' The architecture, too, is diverse, although Victorian reigns. There are the grand houses - three-story mansions with turrets, octagonal windows and fairy-tale vines - and smaller homes with porches, classical columns and two chimneys. At one end of Broadway, Nyack's main thoroughfare, there are stores with shingled roofs and small canopies that sell everything from drum lessons to ice cream. The commercial center, with its painted brick facades and decorative shutters, has 32 antique stores, 22 clothing and jewelry boutiques and 26 restaurants. Some residents believe that gentrification and inflation have forced some people with fixed incomes to move away. Two years ago this phenomenon reached its peak when there was a glut of overpriced houses on the market. Prices have since leveled off and a good number of houses are now up for resale. Houses on the river start at $495,000 and go as high as $1.7 million. Elsewhere in the village, smaller houses range from $135,000 to $200,000 and larger ones from the high $300,000's to the high $800,000's. Real estate agents say rental apartments are hard to find, but when available one-bedrooms go for $600 to $800 a month. The co-op market is tight. The rare one-bedrooms up for resale are priced at $115,000 to $145,000. The available one-bedroom condominiums range in price from $120,000 to $180,000. There are 2,750 students in the Nyack school district. The attend three K-4 elementary schools, a middle school for the fifth and sixth grades, a junior high school and a senior high school. The Nyack High School has a highly regarded music department, and its jazz band has just returned from a two-week tour of the Soviet Union. In November 1986, a $36 million bond issue was approved for the construction of new high school that is expected to be completed by September 1989. The voters were informed on the referendum ballot that approval would mean a 3.5 percent increase in property taxes. ANOTHER current project is the rebuilding of the Tappan Zee Playhouse, which was heavily damaged in a fire in 1972. It will be renamed The Helen Hayes. Riverfront development flows less smoothly. When a 20-story, 225-unit condominium project called the Clermont was proposed in 1983 for the riverfront at the foot of Main Street, fears of an onset of out-of-character high-rises led to a compromise in 1985 on an eight-story, 150-unit building. The first phase, with 47 units, was completed this year, but the controversy persists. Many residents find the Clermont out of place, with its pink stucco walls, its salmon and blue window trim and its marina with 37 boat slips. ''It looks like it belongs on the Riviera,'' said one resident, Joan Allemon. Some contend it is divisive. ''It's a wall that separates the affluent from the rest of the citizens,'' said Oscar Cohen, a member of Citizens for Responsible Riverfront Development. Some say that the Clermont blocks their river view, but others disagree, saying its downhill location makes it unobtrusive. Meanwhile, Clermont residents contend that the project is not exactly what they were promised and are suing the Village of Nyack and the project's developer, Nyack Waterfront Associates. The village Board of Trustees that approved the Clermont has since been replaced and a new Mayor, Kieran Quinn, who is active in the riverfront development group, has been elected. The new board has passed a resolution protesting the state's proposal last month to build an eight-lane freeway and another bridge next to the Tappan Zee. Most say that development and zoning changes will not overwhelm the town. ''It's still very much a village,'' said Jean Gardner, the Village Clerk. ''You can still call the Mayor up and complain, and you can walk around at night.'' And Miss Hayes said: ''I don't want to see any more change. It's almost perfection to me.''

579-> HOME VIDEO/NEW RELEASES; A Neurotic House Party
SEPTEMBER Starring Mia Farrow (in photo), Denholm Elliott, Dianne Wiest (in photo), Elaine Stritch, Sam Waterston, Jack Warden. Directed by Woody Allen. 1987. Orion Home Video. 82 minutes. $89.98. Rated PG. Some mildly vulgar language. Set entirely within a Vermont cottage at the end of the summer season, Woody Allen's drama of family and friendship is the story of a day in the lives of six people who seem to love one another at cross-purposes. There are Lane (Mia Farrow), who has attempted suicide some months earlier; her visiting mother (Elaine Stritch); the mother's new husband (Jack Warden); Peter (Sam Waterston), who rents a guest house from Lane; Lane's best friend, Stephanie (Dianne Wiest), and Howard (Denholm Elliott), Lane's widowed, older neighbor. This is a ''tightly disciplined'' film that nevertheless has ''big problems'' and is ''difficult to like initially,'' Vincent Canby wrote in The Times. Stripped to its narrative bones, he said, it's ''less like Mr. Allen's austere 'Interiors' than like the diaphanous and lyric 'Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy,' but in a hair shirt.'' The characters, he said, ''come on the scene bearing very little baggage that one immediately believes, and nothing that suggests there is a world outside.'' But Mr. Allen's admirers, Mr. Canby said, ''will note the virtuosity of the director's use of the camera here. The film has been photographed in a series of long, fluid takes (with spare use of close-ups) that might serve as a guide to anyone contemplating the screen adaptation of a stage play.''

580-> F.A.A. Orders Test of Takeoff Alarms
The takeoff warning systems on almost 2,000 jetliners were ordered yesterday to be subjected to repeated tests after a survey prompted by a Boeing 727 crash in Texas last August showed that ''a significant number'' of the systems on 727's were not working properly. The tests of the systems on Boeing 727 and 737 jetliners were ordered by the Federal Aviation Administration as a result of questions raised in the investigation of the crash of a Delta Air Lines flight that killed 14 of the 108 people aboard. The the warning systems on 727's are similar to those on 737's. Evidence in the investigation indicates that the flaps, which provide extra lift needed at the slower speeds of takeoffs and landings, were not extended when the plane faltered on takeoff, according to officials close to ther inquiry. It also indicates that the warning alarms, which go off if the flaps or any of six other devices are not set properly, did not sound. The three-engine jet began shaking wildly and then fell back to the runway moments after takeoff from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. Complete Checkups Ordered The aviation agency's action yesterday requires that the entire takeoff warning system be checked within 200 hours of the Nov. 10 date the order goes into effect, and at subsequent intervals within 200 flight hours. Any component that is not working properly must be repaired before further flights. Some safety experts contend that, for maximum safety, the takeoff warning system should be checked before every takeoff. Since the accident, major airlines that were not previously doing this have widely adopted the practice. The new F.A.A. order does not require this, and agency officials give two reasons. One is that it is not practical with the type of warning system on many planes because it would mean running engines at high power near boarding gates. The jet blast could dangerously disrupt ramp operations. The other reason is that a mere test of flap positions would not test whether warnings would be sounded if other items covered by the system were not properly positioned. These include the plane's elevators and the speed brakes, which are devices on the top of the wing that are raised sharply to help slow a plane after it lands. Move Called an Interim Action One highly placed official characterized yesterday's directive as an interim action. He said that it was hoped the directive would induce the airlines and manufacturers to install more modern warning systems and thereby avoid the considerable expense of periodic inspection and maintenance. In peforming this maintenance, airline mechanics will have to inspect and repair all the items covered by the warnings system, not just the circuit for the flaps. The National Transportation Safety Board's inquiry into the Aug. 31 crash in Texas will not be completed for several months. But the thrust of the evidence so far has stunned many experts, who find it hard to believe that two circumstances doomed the takeoff. One was that the flaps were apparently in the up position when the plane left the ground. The other was that the system that should have warned the crew did not sound. Detroit Crash Recalled The odds against such a double failure are enormous. But it happened at Detroit Metropolitan Airport just 12 months earlier, when a Northwest Airlines McDonnell Douglas MD-80 crashed seconds after takeoff, killing 156 people. Two weeks after the crash in Texas, the F.A.A. asked airlines operating the nation's 1,200 Boeing 727's to check the takeoff warning systems. The agency, careful not to prejudge the safety board's inquiry, called the action a ''purely precautionary'' step. The survey found that the warnings systems were either working unacceptably or not working at all on 35 aircraft. The agency said that 17 of the planes were operated by Continental Air Lines, eight by Eastern Airlines, four by Delta, two by Federal Express, two by United Airlines, one by Orion Air and one by American Airlines. The F.A.A. order, called an airworthiness directive, was issued by the agency's Northwest Mountain Region in Seattle, where the Boeing Company, which builds the 727's and the 737's, has its headquarters. The order was signed by Darrell M. Pederson, acting manager for airliner certification.

582-> Amnesty Rock Tour Performs in Budapest
A capacity crowd of 81,000 that included Prime Minister Karoly Grosz and other Hungarian Communist officials attended an all-star concert Tuesday night at Nep Stadium, the only Eastern European stop on the rock tour organized by Amnesty International to promote human rights. Bruce Springsteen, dressed in black, played for nearly two hours. Spectators, many traveling from other countries across the Soviet bloc, sang along with the performer on his opening number, ''Born in the U.S.A.'' Sting, Peter Gabriel, Tracy Chapman and Youssou N'Dour also performed in the eight-hour concert, a rare event in Eastern Europe. Mr. Gabriel at one point spoke in Hungarian to the crowd and urged Rumania to respect the rights of ethnic Hungarians. Mr. Grosz met last month with Nicolae Ceausescu, the Rumanian leader, to discuss the issue of the 1.7 million Hungarian minority living in Rumania. Some spectators held up banners pleading the cause of the Hungarian minority in Rumania and calling for the United Nations to take up the issue. The six-week rock tour, which is to cross five continents, opened Friday in London.

583-> NBC Rules Out TBS Stake As Talks With Turner Fail
NBC and Turner Broadcasting System Inc. have halted negotiations that would have given NBC a minority interest in Ted Turner's cash-hungry television enterprise, officials of the two companies said yesterday. The end of the talks, which have been going on since October, was announced at Turner Broadcasting's quarterly board meeting in Atlanta. Representatives of both NBC and Turner said the sides were too far apart on the price to make further discussions worthwhile. ''The price that TBS has sought for its shares has not made it possible to find an acceptable basis upon which a deal structure could be based at this time,'' said M. S. (Bud) Rukeyser, executive vice president of communications for NBC. A senior NBC executive recently said that Robert C. Wright, the network's president, had become extremely frustrated by the negotiations because Mr. Turner kept raising his asking price. An executive at Turner Broadcasting, who also asked not to be identified, said NBC had offered about $12 a share, while Mr. Turner was asking about $20 a share. Although Mr. Turner is said to be reluctant to yield even a portion of control over the company he built, he was forced to seek NBC's investment because of a deadline he faces on repaying some of the $1.4 billion in debt incurred from the purchase of the MGM/UA Entertainment Company in 1986. The discussions with NBC were held in the shadow cast by a consortium of cable operators that invested $500 million in Turner Broadcasting last spring. That group controls 37 percent of Turner's stock. Mr. Turner remains the majority stockholder, with 51 percent of the voting stock. Time Inc., the largest investor in the cable group, with a 10.1 percent stake, has an option to buy control of the Cable News Network if Mr. Turner decides to sell it. That presented a potential complication to NBC's involvement, because the 24-hour all-news network was part of what attracted NBC to Turner Broadcasting. NBC, which is searching for new avenues of investment in the face of an uncertain future for network broadcasting, will continue to talk with other cable operators about possible deals, Mr. Rukeyser said. As of April 30, Turner Broadcasting has six months to restructure its debt or face the appointment by the cable consortium of an additional two members to its board. The cable operators currently have seven members on the 15-person board.

585-> George Dukakis, Michael S. Bush
The prime reason Vice President Bush is running ahead of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis in the polls is that he has taken stands on a wide range of national issues that a majority of the American people support and believe in. It's that simple. If you don't believe this, let's try a game of ''what if.'' What if we swapped issues and candidates? What if we left everything else the same - the candidates' personality, their height, their campaign staffs, the professionalism of their television ads, their debating skills -and gave George Bush the party registration and policy positions of Michael Dukakis, and Michael Dukakis the party registration and policy positions of George Bush? Imagine that George Bush is a Democrat. He refuses to rule out a tax increase and we know he secretly believes we must and will raise tax rates, especially on the rich, as soon as we can. He is against a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. He wants national health insurance and is willing to force most employers to pay for it. He thinks the idea of a protective missile defense system is silly and wants to sharply cut its funding. He is opposed to the MX missile. He thinks we are spending too much on national defense. While he approves of nuclear arms reduction, he sees no connection between the Soviet Union's agreement to destroy nuclear missiles and our increasing spending on defense and Star Wars. He is against the death penalty, even for extremely violent, cruel crimes. He has always been for gun control. Every since his college days at Swarthmore when he wrote a piece for the college newspaper titled ''Fuzzy-Head Liberal Crashes National Rally for McCarthy,'' he has been a sincere left-wing liberal Democrat, a true believer. He is a member of American Civil Liberties Union. Now imagine that Michael S. Dukakis is a Republican. He has strongly and repeatedly ruled out any tax rate increase (''read my lips''), and has even gone so far as to propose a major cut in the capital gains tax rate. He supports a balanced budget amendment. He is opposed to having the Federal Government mandate compulsory health insurance for most private businesses. He strongly supports Star Wars and is pledged to begin deploying it as soon as even part of it is ready and working. He wants to build the MX nuclear missile. He believes we must continue to increase spending for national defense. He believes that bilateral nuclear disarmament between the United States and the Soviet Union is dependent on a strong defense and Star Wars. For certain brutal crimes he believes the death penalty is just and that it helps deter crime. He is a conservative Republican, especially on national security and economic policy and was once the national chairman of his party. He believes the A.C.L.U. has a left-wing political agenda, and would never think of joining the organization. He is a life member of the National Rifle Association and opposes any more gun control. If we could pull off such a policy switch and communicate it to every potential voter, it is a virtual certainly that the national public opinion polls would turn around within 48 hours. Instead of George Bush leading Michael Dukakis by 10 to 15 points, Michael Dukakis, the ''Republican,'' would be leading George Bush, the ''Democrat,'' by 10 to 15 points. The 1988 Presidential campaign will be determined, as always, by the big policy issues - national security and economic policy. If the Democrats, with two smart, very competent, articulate, even likable men such as Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen, get trounced by George Bush and Dan Quayle, then with whom do they expect to win? The problem the Democrats are having this year is not with their Presidential candidate but with their message. The left-liberal policy agenda is a lead sinker in modern American politics. Until and unless the Democrats jettison that lead sinker, the Republicans will continue to win the Presidency.

586-> How Murdoch Makes It Work
RUPERT MURDOCH has not lost his ability to astound. Mr. Murdoch, who has gobbled up publishing and entertainment properties in remarkably large bites, announced his biggest deal yet last week: an agreement to buy Triangle Publications, publisher of TV Guide, from Walter H. Annenberg for $3 billion. The deal was the largest takeover ever on the print side of the communications industry - and it immediately set off a new round of speculation about Mr. Murdoch, whose fearlessness and speed have made him a near-legend on three continents. The fuss about Mr. Murdoch can be boiled down to two basic questions: How does he do it? And where does he go from here? The answers to the ''how'' may be simpler than one would expect, and the answers to the ''where'' may come sooner than anyone outside the Murdoch organization imagined. One confidant hinted that the next big acquisition may be announced early this week. ''Stay by your phone over the weekend,'' he advised. To run the maze of corporations, joint ventures and partnerships Mr. Murdoch has created, he relies on a handful of close advisers who trace their association with him to his arrival in the United States in 1974. That was the year he bought the San Antonio Express News and created The National Star, a weekly tabloid newspaper sold at supermarkets. ''If you can claim affiliation with The Star, it is like having come over on the Mayflower,'' said John B. Evans, the British-born president of Murdoch Magazines who does not count himself among the pilgrims. He found his way into the company as a classified ad salesman for the Village Voice in the days before Mr. Murdoch bought that paper. Mr. Murdoch's methods for financing his expansion - regularly revaluing his properties in a rising market so that he can increase his borrowings against them - are unusual for the publishing industry in the United States, but the techniques have become common in real estate and are widely used in British Commonwealth countries. As for intentions, Mr. Murdoch has less of a global vision than a zest for deals. Unlike his American rivals, who tend to favor monopoly situations, he has no fear of competition. ''He is more an impresario than an emperor,'' said Carolyn Wall, general manager of WNYW in New York, the largest of Mr. Murdoch's six television stations. He does not set out to purchase a missing piece of a grand design for a global network. Rather, he seeks to develop connections among different parts of the company after he acquires a new property. When Ansett Transport Industries Limited, an Australian airline company, refused to sell him a television station he wanted, he bought Ansett and its related trucking business. The transportation connection later helped him create a distribution system for his British newspapers that broke the hold of the Fleet Street unions over the industry. The properties involved in the Triangle deal were TV Guide (the largest-circulation magazine in the United States) and three other magazines, as well as the Daily Racing Form and a magazine distribution business. The acquisition, when completed later this year, will make Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation a colossus by any measure. In terms of assets, the company will be six times the size it was three years ago, ''something over $13 billion after the Triangle deal,'' according to Richard A. Sarazen, the News Corporation's chief financial officer. With Triangle's revenues added in, the News Corporation expects to report sales this year of $4.8 billion, not far behind Bertelsmann AG of West Germany, the largest media conglomerate in the world. Managers Who Work Without a Net Mr. Murdoch has kept the organization under control by keeping it simple. He runs the News Corporation as if it were a small family business, embracing a handful of close associates to whom he delegates vast authority. His aides say that he seeks their ideas and listens to them carefully but that he relies on his own intuition when deciding what to buy and whom to put in charge of it. Mr. Evans, who is developing an electronic publishing business as part of Murdoch Magazines, said Mr. Murdoch called to discuss the idea of buying Triangle. ''He didn't want to talk about TV Guide and what we might do with it,'' Mr. Evans said. ''He wanted to talk about the future of television.'' ''You can't build a strong corporation with a lot of committees and a board that has to be consulted at every turn,'' Mr. Murdoch said last week in his temporary headquarters on the 16th floor of the Harper & Row building in midtown Manhattan. ''You have to be able to make decisions on your own.'' He expects his managers to be equally independent. He installs them with no more than a few sentences of guidance. Then he employs an elegantly simple financial reporting system to keep track of performance. ''He gives you great freedom, but he lets you know from the beginning that you have no safety net under you,'' said Ms. Wall, who took over WNYW last year. She had never set foot in a television station before Mr. Murdoch appointed her to the job of running WNYW, a business with $150 million in annual sales and a staff of 450. ''Working for Murdoch is like being thrown into the water without knowing how to swim,'' she said. Ms. Wall, 46 years old, joined the Murdoch organization in 1984 as the publisher of New York magazine after a 13-year career in advertising sales. It has been an unorthodox career path, a result of an intuitive decision on the part of Mr. Murdoch. ''He hires people who would not be thought qualified in other corporate environments,'' Ms. Wall said. Ms. Wall is also unusual in that Mr. Murdoch prefers to promote people who have been with his organization from an early age. ''We are trying to grow our own,'' Mr. Murdoch said. ''After people pass their mid-30's it is hard to bring them into a company. It's as if they were a foreign body being rejected by the host.'' He hired as his circulation manager for The Sun, Britain's largest daily newspaper, a 31-year-old former comics salesman, John Townley. His advertising manager there is Jane Wroe, 30. At the News of the World, a tabloid with a daily circulation of 5 million, he installed Wendy Henry, 34 years old, as editor. While those executives are providing creative spark, other executives have the job of maintaining order in a corporate structure that changes shape almost every day. Chief among them are Martin Singerman, the 62-year-old president, and Mr. Sarazen, 55 years old, the chief financial officer. Mr. Singerman, 62, joined the company in 1973 as the Star's first circulation manager. He had spent 17 years at TV Guide, where he had helped create the strategy of placing the magazine at supermarket checkout stands to entice housewives to pick it up every week. Mr. Singerman, who grew up in the Bronx and went to college at New York University, serves as the quiet uncle in the family, congratulating others on their successes. He also serves as a talent scout and gate keeper, helping Mr. Murdoch identify promising young managers and working to move them forward. Mr. Singerman is modest about his contributions, but Mr. Murdoch would not settle a major issue without consulting him. ''We talk all the time,'' Mr. Singerman said. ''But then Rupert talks all the time to all of us.'' Financial controls are the province of Mr. Sarazen, an accountant who serves as the chief financial officer of the News Corporation. They consist of a 50-page book, assembled each week, that provides a one-sheet summary of the week's performance for each of the dozens of companies in the group. Every Friday morning by 11 o'clock, Mr. Sarazen's tan-covered book hits Mr. Murdoch's desk. The Australian and British operations produce the same kind of report, with copies arriving in New York each Monday. The book contains revenues and expenses for the week for each property, with comparisons to the previous year and the current budget. Mr. Murdoch says that if something is out of line, he can spot it and demand additional information to sort out the problem. Borrowing Against An Expanding Empire The books portray an enormous operation. The assets of the News Corporation are spread across three continents - Australia (where the company was founded and is still headquartered), Europe and North America. They include newspapers, television stations, magazines, movies and printing plants. Since 1974, the United States has come to occupy almost all of Mr. Murdoch's attention, as far as new ventures are concerned. With the Triangle deal, his American properties will account for the majority of his total revenues for the first time, $2.9 billion of a total of $4.7 billion, based on analysts' estimates for the fiscal year ended June 30. To insure that his properties are always ready to help support the next acquisition, Mr. Murdoch has them reappraised every three years so that he can increase his borrowings against them. ''American companies have to carry their assets on their books at either the cost of acquisition or market value, whichever is lower,'' said Mr. Sarazen. ''The British and Australian rules require that you show them at whichever is higher.'' As an Australian organization, News Corporation can carry New York Magazine as a $120 million asset. American rules would allow the company to show it as less than $17 million, the price Mr. Murdoch paid in 1977 when he bought it as part of a package that included the Village Voice. As inflation, growth and new products increase the flow of cash into the pockets of the News Corporation, Mr. Murdoch can reduce his debt and prepare for the next acquisition. The system seems to work. ''We've had bankers on the phone from all over the world offering to put up the money,'' said a senior Murdoch executive. ''It's just a matter of choosing how we want to structure it.'' Even so, because the Triangle deal is so large, Mr. Murdoch plans to sell some of his holdings - some real estate, his stake in the Reuters news service, and other properties - to raise about half the money. The rest will come from borrowings. As a result of Mr. Murdoch's expansion strategy, the assets of News Corporation have increased twelvefold since 1983. Debt has risen even faster, from $237 million to more than $4 billion by the time the Triangle deal is complete. Mr. Murdoch's family owns the controlling interest in the company, so he has little concern about answering to stockholders. Without a multitude of committees and senior managers to sign off on his deals, he can reach an agreement far faster than most of his competitors, as he has proved again and again with major acquisitions in the last three years. Just a year ago, he spent $300 million to buy Harper & Row Publishers Inc. and another $300 million for a 20 percent interest in the British conglomerate Pearson PLC. Pearson owns the Financial Times, Britain's most respected business newspaper, and a half-interest in The Economist, an international newsweekly with very fancy demographics. But the senior staff at News Corporation dismisses the idea that Mr. Murdoch had a grand scheme in mind to build a link between TV Guide and the Fox television organization. ''We don't plan that far ahead,'' said Martin Singerman, president of the company. ''We have a budget for the current year, but nobody here does any long-range projections. We don't even write memos. We don't have time for that, and nobody can get Rupert to let us hire assistants.'' Facing the Future One Deal at a Time The lack of a long-term strategy produces surprising successes and spectacular failures. The News Corporation lost $150 million at The New York Post during the 10 years it owned the paper. Try as he might, Mr. Murdoch could never turn the Post around the way he had many other newspapers in Australia and Britain. But he more than made up his losses on the Post in 1986 when he outflanked the British press unions and opened a new printing plant in Wapping outside of London. The new plant employed the kind of automated printing and typesetting equipment that had become common in the United States but which the unions had blocked in Britain. The new plant allowed him to eliminate 3,000 union jobs at his five national newspapers there. The savings in labor costs - $180 million in the first two years - went straight to the bottom line. As a result of his coup at Wapping, the British portion of the group has been gushing profits, accounting for some 40 percent of the company's earnings with only 25 percent of the revenues. To take advantage of the momentum, the company plans to expand both circulation and the number of pages quickly to satisfy a demand that had been artificially limited by the unions' workrules. Opportunities to expand the Triangle magazines internationally or to use them to complement Murdoch publications elsewhere may be limited. ''We may find ways to sell advertising in several different mediums on several continents, but there is very little interest in that except among a few multi-national companies,'' Mr. Murdoch said. The closest thing Mr. Murdoch has to a long range plan is the idea of creating an electronic data base. He has allowed Mr. Evans, the president of his American magazines, to explore possibilities in electronic publishing. Mr. Evans has transformed the biggest of the publications News Corporation bought from Ziff-Davis in 1985 - the Official Meeting Facility Guide - into an electronic data base and supplemented it with maps, room plans and other material. The system will provide travelers with a wide array of travel information. Mr. Evans was meeting with Mr. Murdoch and other senior members of the News Corporation staff last week to propose a joint venture with major airlines to put the electronic system into operation next year. ''This system alone has the potential of doubling the value of the magazine division to about $1.6 billion,'' Mr. Evans said last week. ''And we are accumulating many other sources of information to build an electronic publishing company.'' Some analysts saw the huge amount of information gathered routinely by two of the Triangle publications - TV Guide and the Daily Racing Form - as the hidden value in last week's deal. The Racing Form ''should be a very safe investment, particularly if Mr. Evans can find a way to repackage the information electronically and market it to new customers,'' said Robert Picard, a professor of communications at Emerson College in Boston who has tracked Mr. Murdoch's performance. Some critics suggested last week that Mr. Murdoch might use TV Guide to sway readers to his Fox Television Network. ''That would be self-destructive,'' Mr. Murdoch said. He added: ''In Australia and Britain, everyone expects you to use your newspapers to promote your political opinions. But you don't use your editorial force to promote your commercial interests. That would make your readers distrust you, and if they distrust you they will stop buying your publication.'' Mr. Picard sees little danger in Mr. Murdoch's cross ownership of many mediums in different parts of the world. ''He has a lot of pieces, but he hasn't found a way to link them all in a global network,'' he said. ''And his attention span is not that long.'' Only six months ago, stock analysts were predicting that Mr. Murdoch would seek to expand his stake in Reuters to give him a method for beaming the contents of the Financial Times around the world. But he owned only 20 percent of the company that owned the Financial Times. Last week he said he intended to sell his Reuters stock to help pay for the Triangle deal. Part of his unpredictability comes from his readiness to take on competition, a product of his experience in the newspaper industries in Australia and Britain. Only a handful of American cities have competing newspapers. Mr. Murdoch at one point owned the papers in four of those cities. His competitive spirit has led to his attempt to create a fourth television network. He is losing millions of dollars a month on the Fox system, but his weekly book shows him that things are improving rapidly. Mr. Murdoch sees himself as an explorer, not a colonizer. What worries his critics most is that he knows few bounds. He will quickly convert a staid old left-wing newspaper into a right-leaning tabloid if he decides nude photographs will boost its circulation. The only sure thing is his unpredictability, and he will no doubt have another surprising announcement to make soon - perhaps as early as tomorrow.

587-> At Compounce, Sellout Crowds
FOR Joseph Balestrieri, the new co-owner of the Lake Compounce Festival Park in Bristol, it was a bittersweet experience. Thousands of cars were trying to get into the amusement park, but for the most part, they were unable to move because of a huge traffic tieup. Mr. Balestrieri had not envisioned a situation in which people would be thwarted from entering what he calls ''one of the state's best-kept secrets.'' The occasion was a Crosby, Stills and Nash concert at the 70-acre amusement park on Aug. 5, which, to Mr. Balestrieri's surprise, drew an overflow crowd of more than 15,000 to the outdoor bandshell at Lake Compounce. Making traffic matters worse, practically everyone arrived at the same time, resulting in two-mile back-ups on Route 229 and access roads leading to the park, which prompted some concertgoers to park their cars on highway shoulders and walk. 'It Was a Learning Experience' ''It was a learning experience, and a painful one, at that,'' said Michael Blanco, the director of sales and marketing for the park, which is near Interstate 84 near the Southington border. ''But we learned from it, and we don't expect it to happen again.'' To make sure, Mr. Balestrieri, the president of Joseph Entertainment Group Inc., which bought the 142-year-old amusement park, the nation's oldest, in May, has brought in 50 members of the company's staff from the Alpine Valley Music Theater in East Troy, Wis., to direct traffic and parking. ''We had sellout crowds for the Beach Boys and Sting within the space of a week, and everything went just fine,'' he said. Thanks mainly to a series of concerts featuring a diverse group of big-name entertainers, the Lake Compounce amusement park - now named Lake Compounce Festival Park - has succeeded in drawing thousands of new customers. In the process, it has given new life to the venerable park, which appeared on the verge of going out of business last spring after the Hershey Entertainment and Resort Company decided to sell its stake as the majority owner after operating the park for two years. ''This place was one of the best-kept secrets in Connecticut,'' said Mr. Balestrieri, whose company, while highly successful in concert promotion, had never owned an amusement park. ''Now, it seems that everyone knows about us.'' Concerts and Amusement Rides In the past, the amusement park, which had been owned by the same Bristol family for almost 140 years, drew customers primarily from the Bristol and Waterbury areas. But its attendance declined, and a major renovation project by the Hershey Company failed to produce any substantial increase. After months of uncertainty about the park's fate, Joseph Entertainment bought a majority interest in Lake Compounce for $13.2 million on May 27, the day it was scheduled to open for the new season. While the park's rides, including the country's oldest roller-coaster, are ostensibly its major attractions, the concerts have turned out to be its biggest lures. ''We knew we would draw more people by offering outstanding entertainment, but we want the new people not only to come for the concerts, but to enjoy the rides too,'' Mr. Balestrieri said. To that end, the concerts, admission to the park, parking and all of the rides are included in the admission price, which has ranged from $11.75 to $17.75, depending on the acts. The concerts have featured leading rock groups as well as such popular singers as Tony Bennett, Sergio Franchi, Al Martino, Bobby Vinton and Barry Manilow, who is scheduled to appear tonight, along with such longtime bands as the Count Basie and Cab Calloway Orchestras. Size of Crowds Surprising Joseph Entertainment is able to line up so many big-name acts for the park on such short notice is attributable to its past dealings with the entertainers and their agents. Practically all of the acts have appeared at the 35,000-seat Alpine Valley Musical Theater and at the Riverside Theater in Milwaukee, which is also owned by the company. ''We've spent 15 years creating good relationships with many of these acts, and that made it easier for us to book them at Lake Compounce,'' Mr. Balestrieri said. ''And considering how we took over too late to have arranged for group sales, which are usually done during the winter and spring months, we feel we're doing remarkably well. Hershey drew 450,000 last year, and at the rate we're going, I think we'll do more more than 500,000 in attendance.'' Even Mr. Balestrieri has been surprised at the size of some of the concert crowds. ''I was very surprised that we would draw more than 16,000 for Crosby, Stills and Nash, for example,'' he said. ''By comparison, we drew only 10,000 for the same group at Alpine Valley later this month. New Ampitheater Is Planned ''For a lot of the people coming to the park it's been a new experience,'' Mr. Balestrieri continued. ''And when they see what a lovely setting this is, and what an outstanding entertainment value we offer, we're sure they'll come back.'' Construction on a new ampitheater for concerts will begin in October after the park closes for the season. The amphitheater will include 8,300 seats along with ample space for lawn sitting. In addition, Mr. Balestrieri said, 18 more acres of parkland will be developed for water slide-type rides. Both Mr. Balestrieri and Mr. Blanco, the park's sales and marketing director, said that traffic and parking problems have been resolved. ''We've increased the capacity of access roads by opening up three lanes to incoming traffic, rather than having two lanes in both directions,'' Mr. Blanco said. ''We've also made arrangements to have policemen posted at all nearby traffic lights. And using the expertise of our parking people from Alpine Valley, we've trained our parking attendants to get cars in an out of our parking lots much quicker.'' Starting Aug. 21, shuttle buses began carrying customers from a parking lot along Route 229 to the park's main entrance a half-mile away, without charge. ''One of the biggest problems has been that, on concert nights, most people arrive about 7:45 for an 8 o'clock show,'' Mr. Blanco said. ''When that happens, you're bound to have problems. That's why we're trying to encourage people to get here early and enjoy the rides before the show starts.''

588-> ART; Three New and Different Galleries
GALLERIES come and go, but it seems that in the last few years in Connecticut, more have come than have gone. And of these, the majority are private, which is remarkable, considering how unpredictable the business can be even in an ideal setting - that is to say, a city with a large audience for art. Here are three such galleries, all new or newish and all very different: The PMW Gallery, founded by Patricia Murphy Whitman, is at 530 zoxbury Road, Stamford, and business may not be the right word for this enterprise, since distinguishing the gallery from the rest of the House and Garden-style interior is as hard as finding the building, which is itself a problem in two parts. The first problem is spotting the cleverly hidden sign for Roxbury Road, which runs off Long Ridge Road; the second is realizing that one's destination is in fact the large white clapboard structure on the other side of the road from its mailbox and with its gallery sign all but concealed by shrubbery. Still, the impression of dilettantism that all of this conveys is erased by the professionalism of ''The Art of Summer,'' the current show at the gallery, which is now in its third year. It consists of works by 19 artists, some with New York reputations. Notable among them is Joel Perlman, who is represented by steel constructions in the manner of David Smith, and by small, chunky bronzes that look as if they were cast from constructions. Mr. Perlman has an affinity with Robert Heinrich, who offers similar welded pieces and bronzes that arouse associations with armor. Most of the show's sculpture, including Cynthia Karasek's upturned dinghy supported by logs and stones, is displayed in the garden. The paintings, which are distributed over four rooms and a small passage, are generally nonobjective. The most eye-catching of them are Glen Heim's small Surrealist images of mysterious constructions standing in a smoothly painted landscape. Other noteworthy efforts are Renato Miceli's temperas - some of them landscape-like visions painted in earth colors and one an image of an opening into a subterranean passage. This stands up in relief because the thyme-green paint has been thickened with wild rice, of all things. Robert McBride is also conspicuous with his abstractions that, despite their bright, decoratorish colors, recall Kandinsky, and with constructions made of twigs and other farm materials painted in the same hues. Michiel Gloeckner, a former student of Paul Klee's, and Meredith Lund are other artists to look out for, but there is little that is not worthy of attention in this lineup. On view to Sept. 21, the show is open Wednesday to Sunday from 11 A.M. to 3 P.M. Colonial Cornere, a small shopping enclave in South Windsor, houses the Edward Dean Gallery, run by Edward Holmes. Though a relative newcomer to the business, Mr. Holmes is in many ways more typical of the breed. That is, he is concerned - as are most dealers - with exposing people to art but is in no position to be a philanthropist. The economic problem is solved by the framing business that he operates in the same premises, but there remains the knotty question of how to satisfy the collective taste of his clientele without compromising his own. According to the present show, ''Three Connecticut Women Artists,'' the answer is bright, noncommittal paintings. Jill Disque's abstractions involve long jagged forms that suggest shattered geological formations; Ellen Pliskin's images are multicolored mists applied with long strokes of the palette knife, and Pat Rosoff, working in watercolor and gouache, offers landscapes and interiors that evoke the Southwest. The impression overall is of artists trying to please. This is not an unworthy ambition - Matisse wanted to make art that was a comfortable ''armchair'' for the viewer but then his audience was at least willing to meet him halfway. If this show is a guide, it would seem that South Windsor, a town close to Hartford, has yet to develop a need for art that is more than space-filler. Those who believe that education is the answer to all problems would impose it here, but art is a delicate plant that does not flourish in every soil. The Dean Gallery is at 1720 Ellington Road. It is open 11 A.M. to 6 P.M. Tuesday to Friday, and noon to 4 P.M. Saturday and Sunday. Up in Kent, art is doing nicely in ground that was broken some time ago by Jacques Kaplan with his Paris-New York-Kent Gallery. Since then, Mr. Kaplan has taken a new wife, Violaine Bachelier, who came to Connecticut from France to open the Bachelier-Cardonsky Gallery in partnership with Darby Cardonsky. Ms. Cardonsky has worked for various dealers in New York and for the Pollock-Krasner Foundation, while Ms. Bachelier brings to bear the unexpected but not altogether irrelevant skills of a doctor of labor psychology. The gallery is above the House of Books, on Main Street, in a splendid, all-wood interior that previously belonged to Masons. The gallery's present show is a solo by Jane Wilson that has 21 still lifes. Ms. Wilson has been well known on the New York scene for almost four decades. But in this view, it is only in the last two decades or so that she has come into her own and, give or take a few years, that is the period covered by the show. Arrangements of onions, apples, fish studio clutter, or similar canvases have appeared in the artist's New York shows but never to better effect. The bare plank walls make a perfect foil for the colors, which run from opaque grays and browns to opalescent pinks, yellows and greens and they enhance, the melancholy atmosphere that runs throughout. Some seem to be remembrances of things past - art historical things as well as personal things. For instance, the objects in two large pictures of a mantel -books, a fan, a brilliant blue paperweight, a piece of pink ribbon - could have come from a Whistler still life, and so could the furniture. Then there is the soft light that enters from the right in many of the works - it is the kind of light that people enduring solitude become so aware of. Through Sept. 18, Ms. Wilson's show is the main attraction but not the only one. Also on view are 15 richly colored acrylics on paper by Ronald Sloan and a handful of assemblages by Werner Pfeiffer. Mr. Sloan, who is new to this observer, practices an Expressionism that recalls James Ensor, particularly in the image of three baboon-like white figures suspended in a kind of cage. But there are times, notably in a picture of a figure scratched onto a black ground between two palm trees, when the artist becomes a sinister version of David Hockney. Those familiar with the pristine cut-paper collages and constructions of Werner Pfeiffer may be confounded by his new work. The artist has not gone overboard for automatism - his finish is still immaculate - but he is employing found objects. A characteristic piece involves a bright white book opened to support a sardine can, a long steel bolt and a spring rusty with age. With characteristic humor, Mr. Pfeiffer adds a single line of type to the composition that reads: ''For footnotes see next page.'' He also includes in the show a box of white books, each of which is labeled ''Book.'' The gallery is open weekends from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M.

589-> Far From Typical
To the Editor: As the editor of Working Mother magazine, I was shocked to see the myth perpetuated that women who work are more concerned with status and material goods than with the welfare of their children (''Parents in Absentia,'' Jan. 20). I can assure you that the vast majority of these mothers work because they must - in order to feed, clothe and house their families! For most young American couples, a single income no longer covers the bare necessities. And single mothers, an increasingly large segment of our society, are often the sole support of their families. Sally Abrahms worries that two professional couples who employ full-time baby sitters Mondays through Saturdays - days and evenings -are neglecting their children. She may be right. She is wrong, however, to conclude that they are representative of the two-paycheck-couple population. OLIVIA BUEHL New York, Jan. 26, 1988

594-> Four Sites Are Chosen For Needle Exchange
New York City's Health Commissioner, Dr. Stephen C. Joseph, said yesterday that four sites have been selected for his pilot plan to have drug users exchange used needles for clean ones to reduce the spread of AIDS. He said that at two of the sites, participants will receive counseling and exchange used needles and syringes for clean ones. Those sites are the Lower Manhattan District Health Center, at 303 Ninth Avenue and the Bushwick District Health Center at 335 Central Avenue in Brooklyn. The other two will be ''control'' sites where a second group of participants will receive the same counseling, but no exchange of needles. They are the Riverside Health Center, 160 West 100th Street, and the Crown Heights Health Center at 1218 Prospect Place in Brooklyn. ''AIDS continues its ferocious attack upon the people of this city and its future course, we know, lies with the intravenous drug user,'' Dr. Joseph said. He said half of the 200,000 intravenous drug users in the city are already infected with the AIDS virus and many spread the disease by sharing dirty needles. Critics of the program, which is to start early next month and include 200 needle exchangers and 200 in the control group, charge it will encourage drug use. Joseph Lisa, chairman of the City Council's Health Committee, said the program ''flies in the face of the city's efforts to combat drug abuse and drug-related crime.''

595-> A Jerseyan's Mission: To Russia With Pizza
The New Jersey man who introduced a slice of America to Muscovites with a mobile pizza truck last spring said today that he wants to build the Soviet Union's first full-fledged pizza parlor. The executive, Louis Piancone Sr., who is president of Roma Food Enterprises of Piscataway, said he planned to meet next week with Soviet officials in Moscow and to inspect several potential sites for a pizza restaurant in Moscow and two other cities, Riga and Tula. Mr. Piancone and his Ukrainian-born partner, Shelley M. Zeiger of Moorestown, entered into a joint venture with Soviet officials last year to bring the company's Astro Pizza concession truck to Moscow. The truck began selling slices of the American delicacy to tourists and Soviet customers in April. ''Our sales so far have been extremely lucrative,'' Mr. Piancone said. ''This is just the next logical step.'' So far, the pizza truck has been using ingredients bought in Europe and the United States because Soviet tomatoes, cheese and other products needed were not readily available. Mr. Piancone said his trip would include discussions with Soviet Agriculture Ministry officials on the feasibility of using products grown locally.

596-> Greenspan Hints of Need To Curb Debt
Citing ''massive increases'' in borrowing to finance multibillion-dollar corporate takeovers, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, asked the Senate today to consider changing the tax laws to discourage such borrowing. Mr. Greenspan's comments, contained in a letter to members of the Senate Banking Committee as a response to questions they had raised, reflected a concern for the overall economy arising from such takeovers as this week's proposed $20.3 billion leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc. by Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company. Economic Difficulties Seen Extensive corporate borrowing, much of it incurred to pay for such transactions, poses problems for the economy, especially in the event of a recession. Like consumers who borrow heavily, businesses could face bankruptcy should their incomes decline, making debt payments increasingly difficult. In suggesting that Congress re-examine tax provisions that encourage corporate borrowing, Mr. Greenspan, who was appointed by President Reagan, departed from the prevailing Administration view that mergers and acquisitions should be unimpeded by the tax system. ''This is certainly breaking new ground, however mild that may be,'' said Robert J. Leonard, the chief counsel of the House Ways and Means Committee, which writes the tax laws with the Senate Finance Committee. ''And to that extent, his comments are welcome.'' Michael J. Moran, a former senior economist at the Federal Reserve who is now an economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc. in New York, said, ''He seems to be signaling a desire for a pretty fundamental rethinking of the tax system.'' A Treasury spokeswoman said officials there had not seen Mr. Greenspan's letter. ''We're not going to comment,'' she said. 'A Dangerous Precedent' In his letter, Mr. Greenspan said that, while the insolvencies of many savings and loan associations pose problems that ''are going to be with us for some time to come,'' the Fed could help by permitting the industry to borrow from the Fed under some circumstances, but not for bailouts. It ''would set a dangerous precedent for the future,'' he said, for the central bank to give the institutions bailout funds. And he was more equivocal than the Treasury was this week in contending that the nation's trade deficit could decline much further without a further drop in the dollar. Like the Treasury in its analysis this week, he cited the so-called economic models that showed a need for a lower dollar. But rather than flatly refute the models' conclusions, he said, ''We simply do not know enough to predict when, if ever, the ongoing improvement in our current account will be reversed, even at current exchange rates.'' Mr. Greenspan said that, while Congress altered the tax law two years ago to discourage some consumer borrowing, ''the laws still provide substantial incentive to borrow, and the continuing massive increases in household and corporate indebtedness suggest that we should be looking for ways to bring greater balance to the financial decision-making process.'' At another point, he wrote, ''We do not fully understand why there has been such a large increase in the use of debt finance in the current decade, but I think it is widely recognized that the tax system provides some incentives toward leverage, and it would be appropriate for the Congress to continue looking at the problem.'' Borrowing at $170.3 Billion Excluding the debt that has been fully repaid, annual borrowing by business has climbed from $43.4 billion in 1982, to $170.3 billion in 1984, where it has since hovered. Meanwhile, the sales of stock, the other means through which companies raise money, have been plunging. Five years ago, said Mr. Moran of Daiwa Securities America, companies sold $23.5 billion more in stock than they bought back, but they have since been retiring more than they have sold. The retirements exceeded sales by $74.5 billion in 1984, and through the first half of this year, the figure reached an annual rate of $117 billion. Mr. Greenspan's misgivings about the tax laws come down to a single provision - one that allows companies to deduct the interest that they pay to bondholders. They are not permitted to deduct the dividends paid to stockholders, so the law gives them an incentive to borrow. ''If I pay a dollar in dividends to shareholders, I don't get a deduction,'' said Henry J. Aaron, an economist at the Brookings Institution. ''If I pay a dollar in interest to a bondholder, the Federal Government gives me back 34 cents.'' An Instant Value Echoing Mr. Greenspan, Mr. Aaron added, ''The mystery is why this is soaring.'' He speculated that buyout specialists and other acquirers found that companies relying on common and preferred stock for most of their financing became instantly more valuable, because of the tax advantages they gained when taking on a lot of debt. So in borrowing to take over the companies, and then selling all or a part of them, the acquirers stand to make a handsome profit. Ostensibly, the tax laws put a very low limit - $5 million - on borrowing for takeovers. ''But there are all sorts of exemptions and exceptions, so it's easy to get around it,'' said Mr. Leonard, the chief counsel of the House committee. While Mr. Greenspan also cited an increase in consumer borrowing, he noted that the Tax Reform Act of 1986 was phasing out the amount of interest consumers could deduct on installment loans, while the law as it applied to businesses remained unchanged.

600-> Growth Slowest in Nearly 2 Years For Drought-Hampered Economy
Restrained by the drought and a worsening trade situation, economic growth slackened in the third quarter to an annual rate of 2.2 percent, the Commerce Department said today. That was the slowest rate of growth in almost two years and was considerably less than anticipated. It compares with an annualized growth rate of 3 percent in the second quarter and 3.4 percent in the first. The results encouraged those, however, who have been hoping for a ''soft landing'' in which the economy settles into a sustainable rate of expansion while inflation risks abate. G.N.P. Above $4 Trillion The rise pushed the gross national product - the country's total output of goods and services - above $4 trillion for the first time. It also would have been a stronger 2.8 percent except for the drought that devastated the Middle West this summer. And in a somewhat reassuring report on inflation, the price measurements tied to the G.N.P. rose at slower rates than in the spring quarter. The combination of slower growth and moderating inflation prompted Reagan Administration and some private analysts to view the report as relatively favorable news. They said it suggested that the economy might no longer be in danger of overly rapid expansion and that the Federal Reserve, therefore, might find it unnecessary to raise interest rates further. ''Recent signs of a slowdown have eased concerns that the economy is overheating,'' said Robert Ortner, Under Secretary of Commerce. ''Inflation is not worsening, and may be lessening.'' Other economists, however, fretted that consumers continued to spend vigorously on foreign as well as domestic goods and suggested that the Fed might have to tighten credit before long, not to cool the economy but to defend the dollar. The United States is presumed not to want the dollar to fall too far or too fast because currency volatility damages trade flows and can lead to inflation pressures by raising the cost of imported goods. The dollar declined sharply against major currencies today in quick response to the G.N.P. report. Export Sector Cited ''The driving force behind the braking of the economy is the export sector,'' where deterioration is unsettling to overseas investors needed to help finance the Government's budget deficit, said Wayne D. Gantt, an economist at Atlanta-based Suntrust Banks. Today's report showed growth about a percentage point below expectations. The 2.2 percent rate was the slowest pace since a 1.4 percent increase in the fourth quarter of 1986. Except for job figures for October to be published Nov. 4, today's report was the last major indicator of economic performance to be announced before Election Day. Neither Presidential candidate, Vice President Bush or Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, was thought likely to achieve significant political benefit from it. The shortfalls in the report seemed to reflect a larger drought effect than had been fully appreciated at first, as well as lower-than-expected estimates for September trade results. The drought and exceptionally hot weather took a heavy toll on the G.N.P. Lower farm output cut an estimated six-tenths of a percentage point from the third-quarter growth rate. The Commerce Department had already reduced its second-quarter growth estimate to 3 percent, from 3.9 percent, because of the adverse weather. Mr. Ortner said today that the biggest impact of the drought on G.N.P. growth would be a reduction of 1.2 precentage points in the fourth quarter growth rate. This sets up a situation for early 1989 when the subtractions because of the drought in the final three quarters of 1988 come to an end and, in effect, are added back in the first quarter of 1989. This, economists said, would allow the G.N.P. to expand at a 2.7 percent rate in the first quarter next year, even if the entire nonfarm economy shows no growth at all. The heavy drag from the trade sector in the latest quarter was reflected in a decline of $2.3 billion, compared with an increase of $16.4 billion in the April-June period. Exports rose at an annual rate of $10.1 billion, compared with $10.7 billion, while imports swung to an increase of $12.4 billion, from a decline of $5.6 billion. This, said Paul L. Kasriel, economist for Chicago's Northern Trust Company, ''is unsettling for the immediate outlook for the dollar,'' especially with a rise this year in the price of American exports that tends to undermine American competitiveness. Also restraining G.N.P. growth in the third quarter was a decline in Government spending, mainly reflecting an accelerated decline in military purchases to a annual rate of $6.9 billion. Personal Spending Strong The bulk of the third-quarter growth, the report showed, was provided by an increase in the already-high rate of personal spending, which advanced at a $22.3 billion rate, compared with a $19.2 billion increase in the spring quarter. Spending for nondurables and services climbed rapidly, while it slowed sharply for durable goods. ''If it weren't for the consumer,'' said Ivan A. Marcotte, financial economist at the NCNB Corporation in Charlotte, N.C., ''things would have been flat.'' Business inventories rose at a $33.8 billion rate in the third quarter, down from $35.3 billion in the second quarter and from $66 billion in the first three months of the year when it was feared that the stock-market crash might be toppling the economy. Inflation, as measured by the G.N.P.'s fixed-weighted price index - in which the goods and services produced held constant since 1982 -edged down slightly to a 4.9 percent rate in the summer quarter, from 5 percent in the spring. Another price index, in which the components of output are the same only for the two quarters being compared, eased to 4.3 percent from 4.8 percent. An even larger decline, to a 4.4 percent rate from 5.5, was posted by the G.N.P. price deflator, which is a less reliable inflation gauge because it includes both price changes and quarter-to-quarter changes in the components of output. Some Ground for Concern Seen Despite these improvements, some analysts said there were still ground for some concern about inflation, which the Federal Reserve was no doubt still monitoring closely. They added that this, combined with setbacks on trade, meant the Federal Reserve could find it extremely difficult to make a normal response to ease credit if the economy slows further. The central bank, whose main policy-making arm is scheduled to meet next Tuesday to determine monetary strategy for the next few months, is the main source of Government influence on the economy because fiscal policy - changes in taxing and spending - remains politically deadlocked. ''Their path,'' Mr. Gantt said, ''becomes very narrow.''. Today's report also showed that the savings rate - which measures personal saving as a percentage of disposable personal income - edged up to 4 percent in the third quarter, from 3.7 percent in the second. Data included in the preliminary estimate of the gross national product for the third quarter of 1988 follow, with all dollar amounts in billions at seasonally adjusted annual rates.

601-> Concert: McKinley Pieces By American Symphony
While William Thomas McKinley cannot strictly be called a Minimalist, the four concertos by the composer that the American Symphony Orchestra performed Thursday evening in Carnegie Hall showed him to rival certain members of that school in his capacity to write seemingly endless stretches of unvaried, uninteresting music. Mr. McKinley, who teaches composition and jazz at the New England Conservatory, takes a catholic approach to the issue of style. It is not surprising that a program note quotes praise from Gunther Schuller, for Mr. McKinley aims in some of his compositions - including ''American Blues,'' a concerto for vibraphone and clarinet that received its local premiere on Thursday - to pursue the elusive third stream, that amalgam of jazz and classical elements advocated for many years by Mr. Schuller. Yet judging from these recent compositions, Mr. McKinley now concentrates primarily on a neo-Romantic language that is mostly tonal but is nonetheless seriously impoverished harmonically and melodically. His music almost never rises to the level of genuine tunefulness except when it seems to be quoting Gershwin or some other composer. He relies heavily on repeated phrases, on simple gestures played over and over, and his soloists are kept on constant duty, tirelessly playing often nothing more than filigree. With the exception of brief moments during the Piano Concerto No. 2, the music pulsed along one basically unchanging, soporific beat. There was something of New Age music about much of it. Occasionally, Mr. McKinley created the impression that a climax was on the horizon, but then he didn't follow through: either the idea simply petered out or the big moment - as with the loud, alternating two-note passage for the clarinet during the second movement of ''American Blues'' - was so bereft of interest as to be something of an anticlimax. And in general, the large musical structures sagged from excess: when pieces seemed to have run their course and reached a reasonable end, chances were that only half the work was through. Presumably, Mr. McKinley was trying to evoke a mellowing, contemplative mood with these large, melancholic concertos and, within them, to suggest emotional shifts by use of subtle means. There were, in fact, a few lovely moments in his ''Poem'' for flute and orchestra, and a few exciting passages gave life to the piano concerto. But these were brief and fleeting in the context of so much unexciting music. David Buechner served as the untiring piano soloist. Robert Stallman played the flute with unusual grace during ''Poem.'' Gary Burton, vibraphonist, and Richard Stoltzman, clarinetist, were able partners for ''American Blues.'' Sol Greitzer tackled the Viola Concerto No. 2. Robert Black and JoAnn Falletta shared conducting duties, and the Eroica Brass appeared just after intermission to play from a balcony a meandering fanfare by Mr. McKinley that was written for this occasion.

602-> Answering The Mail
Q. Some of the floorboards in our house have raised slightly at the edges, and they often break when stepped upon. As a result, we now have spaces between the boards. This condition seems to have developed after the floors were stained. Can you help us solve this problem? A. I doubt if staining could have caused this, unless a water-based stain were used (in which case the water might have caused the boards to warp). It could be that the flooring used was not properly nailed down in the first place, or that boards that are too wide were used. Either way, it sounds as though the only way to correct your problem is to remove the damaged boards and replace them with new ones, or cover the entire floor with new flooring. If you decide on the latter course, make sure all of the existing boards are solidly nailed down first, after which you may have to put down a hardboard underlayment before you can put down the new flooring. Q. The vinyl floor in my kitchen has four orange-colored stains that I think are rust stains from a metal table that the previous owners had. I have tried many cleaners, but cannot get these stains off. Any suggestions? A. If they are rust stains, you may be able to remove them with a commercial rust remover, the kind sold in most hardware stores. If this doesn't work, try scrubbing with Zud, a cleanser and bleach that often works on rust stains. If even this doesn't work, you can try a bleach, but this may also take the color out of the vinyl, so test on a small corner first. Questions should be addressed to Bernard Gladstone, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York, N.Y. 10036.

603-> Final 3 People Picked for Jury For Steinberg
The final three members of the jury for the murder trial of Joel B. Steinberg were chosen late yesterday, and opening statements are to start Tuesday. Acting Justice Harold J. Rothwax of State Supreme Court in Manhattan said that six alternate jurors would be selected Monday to back up the panel of six women and six men chosen from a pool of more than 700 prospective jurors. The selection was faster than expected. The case, in which Mr. Steinberg is accused of beating to death a 6-year-old girl he and his companion were raising, generated widespread publicity and caused many prospective jurors to be excused on the ground that they were prejudiced against the defendant. Justice Rothwax had said he expected the selection to take another week. No Witnesses to Slaying Prosecutors contend that Mr. Steinberg beat the girl, Lisa, to death with a blow to the head last Nov. 1. In court papers, the two assistant district attorneys in the case, John McCusker and Peter Casolaro, said their evidence would contend that Mr. Steinberg acted alone in killing Lisa, whom he and Hedda Nussbaum were raising in their apartment in Greenwich Village. The prosecutors have also said that there are no witnesses to the death and that their case would be entirely based on circumstantial evidence. The prosecution's statements were seen as a strong indication that District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau would ultimately drop second-degree murder charges against Ms. Nussbaum, who has not been indicted. Mr. Morgenthau has said he was considering that move on the ground that Mr. Steinberg repeatedly beat Ms. Nussbaum and that she, too, was a victim. Ms. Nussbaum, who is recovering from injuries that the prosecution says Mr. Steinberg inflicted, has been named as a possible witness against him.

604-> Blast Kills 2 in Punjab
A powerful bomb strapped to a motor scooter exploded in a crowded market in Punjab state today, killing 2 people and wounding 30, 10 of them seriously, the police said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but the police said they suspected Sikh militants who are fighting for a separate homeland in the northern border state. The explosion occurred at 10:30 A.M. in Ajanala, about 20 miles south of Amritsar.

605-> DOLLAR FALLS AS STOCKS PLUMMET
The dollar fell yesterday, ending a tumultuous week on an uncertain note. In contrast to the first four days of the week, when the dollar moved sharply higher in heavy trading, the selloff yesterday took place on light volume. Even though the dollar had begun to dip during overnight trading in Tokyo and later in Europe, the bulk of the day's decline took place between 3:30 and 4 P.M., New York time, when stock prices collapsed. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 6.9 percent of its value, dropping 140.59, to 1,911.30. A Parallel Performance ''The selloff in the dollar got a lot more aggressive as the Dow Jones industrial average broke 100 points on the downside,'' said Ian M. Spence, chief foreign-exchange dealer at the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company. In late New York trading, the dollar was at 128.30 yen, near its lowest level of the day and well below Thursday's 130.25 yen. Even with its decline, the dollar ended the week 6.5 percent higher in relation to the yen than it was at its lowest point on Monday, when central banks around the world began an aggressive campaign to raise the American currency's value. The dollar also fell yesterday against the West German mark, to 1.6375 marks, down from 1.6575 marks on Thursday. For the week, the dollar had a gain of more than 4.5 percent against the mark. Immediate Picture Unclear Currency traders tended to shrug off a strong employment report released yesterday, but the sudden drop in stock prices sent shivers through the currency markets, leaving the dollar's short-term prospects in doubt. ''If the stock market is stable next week, the dollar will trade in a tight range in advance of next Friday's trade figures,'' said Garrett Glass, a vice president in the foreign-exchange department at the First National Bank of Chicago. ''But what happened at the end of the day has made people extremely nervous.'' As the dollar's value declined, gold prices rose. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold futures closed at $483.70 an ounce, up $2.50 from Thursday. And the Republic National Bank of New York quoted bullion at $483.75 an ounce late in the day, up $3.45 from the day before. Outlook for Intervention Silver prices were basically unchanged, closing at $6.985 an ounce on the Comex. Although traders said the dollar could move slightly lower in advance of next Friday's trade report, several said they expected to see the Federal Reserve and other central banks enter the market again to shore up the currency if the decline became too pronounced. ''If we got down to around 1.62 marks, I think there will be central bank support for the dollar,'' Mr. Spence said. For many traders, the dollar's weakness yesterday and the uncertainties about the trade report have not been enough to erase the lessons learned earlier in the week, when central banks aggressively pushed the dollar higher and monetary officials warned against betting that the dollar's value would continue to decline. Assessing Traders' Mood ''Most of our traders still seem to think that the central banks can buy dollars with such potency that there is no profit to be made in selling the dollar,'' Mr. Glass said. A dealer at a bank in New York said that by the end of the week the market had a ''conservatively bullish tone.'' That attitude could change dramatically if next Friday's trade report is a bad one. Indeed, some dealers said they had sold dollars on rumors circulating in the market yesterday that the November trade deficit figure could be as high as $20 billion. ''The knee-jerk reaction right now is to get out of the way of the Fed and other central banks,'' the trader said. ''But a cataclysmic number like that could push the market into ignoring them completely. Until we see improvement in the trade figures, there are not many people who are going to go out and aggressively buy dollars.''

606-> COMPANY NEWS; Gain for Texas Instruments
Texas Instruments Inc., the nation's largest maker of computer chips, said today that it had posted the most profitable quarter in its history. Texas Instruments said its net income more than tripled in the fourth quarter, to $93.7 million, or $1.05 a share, from $26.6 million, or 30 cents a share, in the comparable 1986 period. Sales rose 17.7 percent, to $1.53 billion from $1.3 billion. The year was the most profitable for Texas Instruments since it established a company record of $316 million in net income in 1984. For 1987, the company earned $308.5 million, or $3.59 a share, compared with $29.1 million, or 24 cents a share, in 1986. Sales increased 12.5 percent, to $5.59 billion, from $4.97 billion last year. More than half the company's pretax profit in its chip-making unit last year came from $191 million in royalty payments by one Korean and eight Japanese chip makers. In the fourth quarter, the company said it earned $74 million from operations, compared with $35.7 million in the 1986 period. For the full year, the figures were $217 million in operating profit in 1987, compared with $102 million in 1986.

607-> Home-Repair Services Assist Elderly
A retired costume-jewelry salesman, Michael M. Katz, 76 years old, is so inept with tools ''he can't knock a nail in the wall,'' his wife, Rose, says. Mrs. Katz, 74, is not much handier. So what is she to do when the bathroom faucet starts leaking and the fluorescent light in the kitchen will not go on? She calls the Home Repairs for Senior Citizens program, the largest of several private organizations that offer free or low-cost ''minor repair'' services to city homeowners and tenants age 60 or older. And the program - run by the New York Foundation for Senior Citizens - sends over one of its six repairmen. The Katzes know their repairman well, so well that they have no qualms about leaving him to lock up the house if they need to go out while he is working. In the last three years, ever since the Katzes learned of the repair service, he has made more than 50 trips to the Katzes' home in the Midwood section of Brooklyn. Among other things, he has installed a double-cylinder dead bolt on the front door, put up curtain rods in the living room, replaced a rusted water hose on the washing machine, and removed a ''gooey mess'' of soap scum and hair that was clogging the bathtub drain. The Katzes ''haven't paid a dime,'' except for parts. 'Let the House Fall Apart' Without the free labor, ''we would just have to let the house fall apart,'' said Mrs. Katz. The last time they used a professional plumber, she said, they paid $159 to have a few washers in their bathtub faucet replaced. But with an annual income of about $16,000 and high medical expenses, the Katzes cannot afford to pay so much for every minor repair. Sometimes ''minor repair'' means nothing more than sending a person to replace the burned-out light bulbs on the living room ceiling of a person too frail to climb a stepladder. Sometimes it means installing shatterproof windows or a new lock in a house that has been robbed. And sometimes it means persuading a reluctant landlord to fix a broken toilet or heating system for an elderly tenant. The repair programs vary greatly in size, area covered and level of service. The foundation's citywide program has a $250,000 annual budget and contracts with independent repair people to make repairs for more than 2,000 homeowners a year. 'Safe and Secure' The Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine has a much more modest program that does nothing more complicated than repair chairs and that relies on volunteers to serve its 50 clients on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Regardless of size, all of the programs have a common goal, said Dorothy Peters, director of the Citizens Advice Bureau's repair program for elderly people in the Bronx: ''To help seniors stay in their homes in as comfortable a life style as possible'' and ''to make their houses safe and secure.'' Many of the programs' clients are too frail or arthritic to do such simple things as use a screwdriver or open stuck windows. Others, like the Katzes, never learned how to change washers or repair fluorescent-bulb sockets. Single women make up 90 percent of the clientele of Geri-Pare, Inc., a Brooklyn-based program that also assists the elderly, said its director, Edward H. Kramer. Most of the clients are from generations that did not approve of women learning how to unclog an elbow pipe, he added. And the people served are overwhelmingly poor. Because many elderly people, particularly homeowners, are property-rich and cash-poor, they have little money to spend on home repairs. Mr. Kramer said. Expensive special items like grab bars in the bathroom, second railings on staircases and extra-loud doorbells add to the maintenance burden. Even in a program such as the Citizens Advice Bureau, which has no income restrictions, ''most of the clients are at poverty level or below,'' Ms. Peters said. The Katzes say they have come to depend on the foundation. Says Mr. Katz, ''It's saving money and being able to get it done.''

608-> For Congress From New York
Here are our recommendations in four contested races for Congressional seats. 15th District (Manhattan East Side): This ''silk stocking'' district has had the good fortune to be represented since 1978 by Bill Green, a moderate Republican. Well placed on the House Appropriations Committee, he has repeatedly delivered for his district and New York, fighting successfully to preserve Federal housing funds. Neither the Democratic opponent, Peter Doukas, nor the energetic Liberal Party challenger, John Levitt, can match the record of Mr. Green, whom we are pleased to endorse. 14th District (Staten Island, southwest Brooklyn): The Republican incumbent, Guy Molinari, has in four terms demonstrated an ability to get things done. He was instrumental in persuading the Navy to install a base on Staten Island, and has emerged as a champion of aviation safety. He deserves criticism for promoting an end to two-way toll collections on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, thus exacerbating traffic and air pollution problems. But his otherwise positive record outweighs that mistake. The Democratic challenger, Jerome O'Donovan, ably heads the City Council's economic development committee. But he offers no reason to replace Mr. Molinari, who merits endorsement. First District (Suffolk County): In a sharply contested race, the freshman Democratic incumbent, George Hochbrueckner, faces a Republican county legislator, Edward Romaine. Mr. Romaine shows keen knowledge of environmental and housing issues. Mr. Hochbrueckner, a former aerospace engineer and state Assemblyman, stresses his ability to help Suffolk's struggling defense industry from his berth on the House Armed Services Committee. Little separates the candidates on two major issues: closing the Shoreham nuclear power plant and a ban on ocean dumping of sewer sludge. Though both are qualified, we endorse Mr. Hochbrueckner on the basis of his promising first term. 20th District (central and southern Westchester): Joseph DioGuardi, the Republican incumbent, is an accountant who earned the appreciation of his colleagues by identifying a loophole allowing them to extract extra retirement benefits. But he can cite few real achievements and shows little capacity for leadership. He has kept a low profile on the volatile Yonkers housing crisis, and though he co-sponsored legislation to strengthen the House Ethics Committee, he has yet to return allegedly coerced contributions collected on his behalf. His Democratic challenger, Nita Lowey, is a former New York Assistant Secretary of State with broad knowledge of environmental issues and has been a strong promoter of programs that insure poor children a fair chance. We endorse her. Five incumbents do not face serious challenge but do merit special mention: Thomas Downey of Suffolk for championing welfare reform; Robert Mrazek of Nassau for leading the fight against Federal subsidies for harvesting the irreplaceable Tongass rain forest; Charles Rangel of Manhattan for his contributions to the war on drugs; Charles Schumer of Brooklyn for his activities in banking and trade legislation, and Stephen Solarz of Brooklyn for his continuing leadership in foreign affairs.

609-> Sounds Around Town
Recalling Mingus The Mingus Dynasty and O.T.B. (Out of the Blue), Village Gate, Bleecker at Thompson Streets (475-5120). When the bassist and composer Charles Mingus died in 1979, his widow, Susan, organized a group of musicians who had played with Mingus to perpetuate his music. The Mingus Dynasty, now in its ninth year, still includes one of the original members of the 1979 group, the trombonist Jimmy Knepper. The present sextet continues the original all-star quality with Jack Walrath, trumpeter; Craig Handy, tenor saxophonist; Kenny Barron, pianist; Buster Williams, bassist, and Billy Hart, drummer, as well as Mr. Knepper. The flutist James Newton will be a special guest at the Dynasty's performances tonight and tomorrow at 9:30 and 11:30 when the Dynasty shares the bandstand with O.T.B., a young sextet with bop inspirations and an ear to the future. Admission is $12.50 and a two-drink minimum. Schneider Sings Helen Schneider, the Ballroom, 253 West 28th Street (244-3005). Some of the flavor of ''A Flapper's Folly,'' Helen Schneider's triumphant one-woman revue based on songs of the 1920's that she performed at the Ballroom almost two years ago, floats through her program of Stephen Sondheim songs tonight and tomorrow. But Mr. Sondheim's songs, which include some from ''Company'' and ''Follies'' that echo the 20's, along with others that don't from other Sondheim scores, give Ms. Schneider opportunities to mix her talents as a singer and actress even more effectively than she did in '' A Flapper's Folly.'' Shows both nights are at 9 and 11 with a $15 cover charge and a two-drink minimum. Grand Opening ''Grand Slam,'' Don't Tell Mama, 343 West 46th Street (757-0788). The singer, pianist and songwriter Murray Grand, who has been observing Manhattan night life from behind a piano keyboard for more than three decades, has brought together songs he has written during those years, including ''Guess Who I Saw Today,'' in a lively three-person revue with the help of Claiborne Cary and Nancy Timpanaro. They are three distinct personalities - Ms. Timpanaro is large and boisterous, Ms. Cary is small and twinkling while Mr. Grand has a quiet but knowing air. It's a good mix and they make the most of Mr. Grand's frequently witty and always rhythmic songs. Tonight at 11 with a $15 cover charge and a two-drink minimum. A Django Successor Jazz Album of the Week: Birell Lagrene, ''Inferno'' (Blue Note). When the gypsy guitarist Bireli Lagrene was 13 years old, he made a record that suggested he might be the inheritor of the style and talents of the dazzling gypsy jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt. He was, it turned out, a remarkable replica, but being a replica has its limitations. Now Mr. Lagrene is 21 and is finding his own talent and direction. Shifting from acoustic to electric guitar, his playing on this disk still carries occasional suggestions of Reinhardt, although it is now on Mr. Lagrene's own terms. Beyond that, there is a reaching out to contemporary styles, which the young guitarist transforms with an enriching personal approach in a way that parallels Reinhardt's treatment of the pop music of his day. This is an exciting coming-of-age album.

611-> Bridge; The Gerber convention: so good, it was invented in two places.
Calculus was devised by two geniuses in different countries at about the same time. The same has often been true of good bridge ideas: The Gerber four-club convention, the Stayman two-club response and the Jacoby transfer bid were developed independently on opposite sides of the Atlantic. Half a century ago, while John Gerber was propagating his idea in the Midwest, Dr. William Konigsberger of Geneva and his partner, W. Nye, were already using it under a different name. It was an all-purpose alternative to Blackwood, but the passage of time has restricted its use to situations in which, as after a one no-trump opening, four no-trump is needed as a natural bid. Konigsberger is still a fertile theorist, for he and Derrick Deane have recently suggested, under the name Geneva convention, some extensions of the unusual no-trump. A Transfer Effect The use of Gerber often has a transfer effect, and the trump length appears in the dummy. In the diagramed example, South had an eccentric weak no-trump because his bidding methods bar him from bidding either one club, which would be strong and artificial, or one heart, which would promise five cards. In response to Gerber, he shows two aces, and becomes the declarer in six spades. West leads a trump, and a look at the dummy suggests that the partnership has not bid enough. With a normal diamond split, 3-3 or 4-2, South can take one ruff in his hand and make all the tricks. But if he is obsessed with that thought, South will go down in six spades. He should try to guard against the possibility that West is very short in diamonds, and lead the suit from his hand. So the first trick should be won in dummy, preserving the king, and the closed hand should be entered with one of the aces. A diamond is led, and if West ruffs, the contract is safe because West does not have another trump to lead. If West follows suit or refuses to ruff, South wins in dummy, leads to his remaining ace and plays his remaining diamond. Again the slam is safe whether or not West ruffs. The principle is clear: If an opponent might ruff, offer him the chance to ruff a loser, not a winner.

612-> SENATE, TO OVERRIDE COURT, VOTES A BILL EXTENDING ANTI-BIAS LAWS
The Senate tonight passed a civil rights bill that would reverse the impact of a 1984 Supreme Court decision that significantly limited the reach of Federal laws against discrimination. Proponents called it one of the most important pieces of civil rights legislation to come before Congress in many years. The Supreme Court decision, in a case brought by Grove City College in Pennsylvania, held that the Federal law banning sex discrimination in colleges and universities that receive Federal aid applied only to the specific program receiving such aid, not to the entire institution. Thus, if a college discriminated against women in a program that did not receive Federal aid, it could not face the loss of Federal assistance in other programs. White House Cites 'Veto Signal' The Reagan Administration interpreted the ruling to extend to three other areas covered by discrimination laws: age, race and handicap. The vote in the Senate to apply Federal laws against discrimination to the entire institution rather than just the parts receiving Federal aid was 75 to 14. All the votes against the bill were cast by Republicans, most of them from the party's conservative wing. The senators from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut all voted in favor. The bill now goes to the House of Representatives, which is expected to approve it by at least as lopsided a vote. However, a White House spokesman, Leslye Arsht, said tonight: ''We oppose the bill in its current form. There's a veto signal out there.'' Opponents of the measure have charged that it would give the Government an excessive role in fighting discrimination. Amendment on Abortion Senator John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri, said he expected that an abortion amendment he sponsored, which won approval earlier in the day, would encourage President Reagan to sign the bill. The amendment states that colleges, universities or hospitals would not risk losing all Federal funds if they declined to provide abortions or abortion-related services to women. The concern was that denial of abortion or related services would be perceived as discrimination against women. The amendment permitted many senators who had been opposed to vote for the civil rights measure. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who was the bill's floor manager, said he hoped the Danforth amendment would be removed by the House. Asked about the conflicting signals about whether Mr. Reagan would sign the bill, Senator Kennedy indicated that Congress could override any veto, saying, ''The suggestion that he might not sign it was addressed by the overwhelming vote.'' The Massachusetts Democrat also said Mr. Reagan had a history of threatening vetoes but finally signing bills. 'Big Day for Civil Rights' ''This is a big day for civil rights in the United States of America,'' Mr. Kennedy said. ''The Senate, by an overwhelming vote, demonstrated that the cause of civil rights is alive.'' He noted that the bill, the Civil Rights Restoration Act, was co-sponsored by 58 senators and had bipartisan support. ''This has been long overdue,'' he said. ''I think the members understood very well that there is a heightened sensitivity to issues in a political year,'' Mr. Kennedy said. ''People pay attention to what is happening.'' He said the bill was also helped by its scheduling as the first order of business in the new year, ''not wedged between contra aid and Star Wars.'' After the vote, Ralph G. Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, which lobbied heavily for the bill, said: ''The Restoration Act would prohibit the Federal funding of discrimination against women, minorities, disabled persons and older Americans. The Grove City College case permitted the Federal funding of discrimination. ''Under this bill, if Federal money comes anywhere into the college, the entire college is covered.'' He said the bill was ''an overwhelming bipartisan rejection of the Reagan Administration's efforts to weaken'' the nation's civil rights laws. Candidates Fly In The vote on the full bill came suddenly tonight after a day in which the only significant action appeared to be the vote on the Danforth amendment. And for a time, it appeared that the vote on that amendment would be so close that a call went out for Senators who are Presidential candidates to fly to Washington. Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, broke off a campaign trip in New Hampshire to vote for the amendment. Senator Paul Simon, Democrat of Illinois, detoured from Texas to vote against it. And Vice President Bush, after flying from New Hampshire, was driven to the Capitol in a four-car motorcade to stand by in case his tie-breaking vote in favor was needed. Senator Albert Gore, Democrat of Tennessee, did not come in from the campaign trail for the vote. As it turned out, the amendment passed easily, 56 to 39.

613-> Magazine Is Suspended
Fairchild Publications, a subsidiary of Capital Cities/ ABC Inc., has suspended its weekly consumer publication Travel Today because of poor sales at the 26,000 East Coast newsstands where it was available. The publication was judged to have had a good response from its readers, however, so its staff is now seeking to reorganize the distribution system and is planning to redesign the magazine with the hope of resuming publication. The magazine was available only at newsstands. Patricia Evert, a spokeswoman for the company, said 380,000 copies a week were distributed, but sales failed to reach the projection of 100,000. The last issue, dated May 2, was distributed on Monday.

615-> Rights Monitors at a Protest By Group of Jews in Moscow
More than 100 Soviet Jews seeking exit visas demonstrated in Moscow today in a large and peaceful protest attended by members of an international human rights group. Uniformed and plainclothes police stood by but did not intervene as men, women and children unfurled banners and chanted ''Let my people go!'' Some demonstrators in the crowd, which gathered on the steps of the Lenin Library in biting cold for nearly an hour, attributed the police officers' low-key attitude to the presence of the foreign human rights monitors. ''The real test is not what happens while our group is here, but whether when we are gone the Soviet Union will live up to its obligations,'' said Erwin Cotler, a Canadian member of the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights. A federation delegation has been here since Sunday at the invitation of the Soviet Human Rights Commission, an official body founded last year as the Kremlin moved to deflect criticism of its rights record. The visit, by delegates from eight countries, marks the first time a group openly critical of the Soviet human rights record has been allowed to enter the country and meet senior officials.

616-> About Cars; Newsletter Helps Drivers Adjust to Speed Limits
All right, the name is silly, but the organization does serve a purpose. It is called the Radio Association Defending Airwave Rights, the acronym being RADAR, and it is headed by Janice Lee, who used to work for Electrolert, the company that makes Fuzzbuster radar detectors. Ms. Lee now publishes a newsletter of interest to people who keep meeting policemen on the road, and it is full of nuggets that deserve wider dissemination, even allowing for the nonprofit organization's obvious bias. There is, for instance, the item in the January issue that quotes Thomas Constantine, the New York state police superintendent, on an experiment in concentrated antispeed enforcement in the Syracuse and Albany areas. Constantine called the decision by other states to raise their speed limits a ''serious mistake,'' and noted that the new effort resulted in 761 tickets in one eight-hour period, with the troopers using ''mock stranded motorists equipped with radar,'' among other things. What he'd like, Constantine said, is for New York to be known as one of the tougher states in the nation, when it comes to speeders. Now that speed limits have been increased to 65 miles an hour on rural interstate highways in 37 states, one might once again have pleasant ideas about the open road, our radar lady says. But she cautions that the threat of a speeding ticket is as high or higher than it was when the Federal limit was 55. The police are less tolerant of slight infractions now, she cautions, and many states have instructed troopers to ticket all drivers traveling above the limit. ''Transition areas'' are particularly hazardous to your license, Ms. Lee says, noting that sections of road with drastic changes in the limit are the areas most likely to put a revolving red light in your mirror. One such stretch is the only street entering Point Lookout, an 11-block-long village on Long Island. The limit drops from 45 to 15 m.p.h., the lowest limit in New York, and the police do a brisk business, although even one of their own conceded that ''you can't get much slower than 15 miles an hour and still be moving forward.'' A similar speed trap, this one in Splendora, Tex., recently fell prey to a concerned attorney, who had defended a surfeit of angry drivers, according to the newsletter. The lawyer, Eugene McElyea, wrote to Representative Billy Clemons and the letter resulted in Federal legislation that limits the amount of money that towns of 5,000 population or less can keep from speeding fines. Previously, municipalities were allowed to keep the entire fine, except for $10. Now, the towns can keep only $2 for every mile per hour that a speeder was exceeding the limit. Splendora, which has no property tax and gleaned 80 percent of its budget from traffic fines, has since abolished its municipal court, laid off eight police officers and cut library hours. As always, of course, the car that you drive has an effect on the way you are treated by the local law. In Florida, a highway patrol lieutenant who has been scrutinizing violators in traffic schools has worked up a profile on the personalities of drivers and their automobiles. Max Shell, as quoted by the newsletter, says the biggest offenders are ''young white males driving a Camaro, Firebird or Trans-Am.'' In descending order of vulnerability, the troopers also watch for older trucks and cars, BMW's and Mercedes-Benzes driven by men, compact cars and retirees in big American cars. The safest driver on the road, according to Lieutenant Shell, is a woman in a Mercedes. No matter who you are or where you drive, though, most tickets are issued on the interstates, and at least one police department is using something called ''photo radar,'' which presumes the camera doesn't lie. The latest issue of Ms. Lee's newsletter (which is available from R.A.D.A.R., 4949 South 25A, Tipp City, Ohio 45371) notes that Paradise Valley, Ariz., has operated the device for 30 hours each week, nailing as many as 20 drivers per hour. As a result, the town has had to set aside Thursday mornings for special sessions of photo radar court, and the operation has created a storm of protest. In one recent month, 63 drivers received notices and 31 of those simply failed to respond. Of the remainder, 21 chose to attend driving courses in lieu of fines, 6 paid tickets, 2 proved they were not driving the vehicles in the pictures, and 3 pleaded not guilty. According to the newsletter, ''Occasionally, though, an individual chooses to express his displeasure in a more forceful manner.'' There was, for instance, the driver who removed his license plates, then blew past the Paradise Valley photo radar setup at 135 miles an hour.

617-> '88 WINTER OLYMPICS; U.S.A. MAKES FAST START
The game was a shooting spree, a scenario that fit the offense-obsessed United States hockey team and enabled it to race to a 10-6 victory over Austria in its opening game at the XV Olympic Winter Games. The Americans assumed an early lead, then improved on it, precisely the strategy they had hoped to use against Austria, a team they felt obligated to outdo in every category of play. They led, 6-1, after two periods, and although momentary defensive distractions led to five goals by Austria in the final period, they were nullified by four more goals by the Americans. Corey Millen scored his second goal of the night, and Dave Snuggerud, Scott Young and Jim Johannson completed the frenetic third-period barrage in a game where nine American players scored. Mike Richter, who was selected late Friday night to start in goal against the Austrians, was stalwart until the third. ''If you can't get up for this, forget it,'' Richter said when asked if he was bothered by the prolonged indecision over tonight's starter. When Richter was replaced by Chris Terreri with the score 9-3, the United States began to slip, not an encouraging sign. began to slip, not an encouraging sign. West Germany's 2-1 defeat of Czechoslovakia showed its determination to advance from this round, and the Soviet Union efficiently demolished Norway, 5-0, so there was pressure on the Americans to win their first game. ''Logically, we have to win those games where we're not out-talented,'' Coach Dave Peterson said. ''If we lose the first game, we'll be put into a corner, which is exactly what happened in 1984 and exactly what we can't afford this time around. In this pool, the games you even think you can win, you just about have to.'' Quick Start Needed The players knew they were bigger and younger than the Austrians and were expected to prevail tonight. They also knew that, given their occasional defensive lapses, they had to start aggressively, while suppressing any opening-night jitters. ''They're a good skating team,'' said Brian Leetch, the 19-year-old captain of the American squad, ''so we have to jump on them early. We can't be timid right from the start, and if we play hard at our offense, the defense should take care of itself.'' The Americans stuck to their game plan in the first period, where hard skating and physical dominance in the Austrian zone helped them take a 2-0 lead. Even when they were killing penalties, they looked to attack, especially Leetch, who sidestepped the opposing skaters as if they were locked in the ice. The United States took a 1-0 lead on Lane MacDonald's goal at 8:32 after Leetch sprinted the puck up the side and then slid a centering pass to MacDonald. It was only the second shot faced by Brian Stankiewicz, Austria's starting goalie. The team took a 2-0 lead after a swift passing play between Jeff Norton, Tony Granato and Corey Millen, who darted to the left post in time to collect Granato's pass across the slot and dump it past the bewildered Stankiewicz at 14:42. The Austrians trimmed the lead to 2-1 when Kurt Harand beat Richter with a low wrist shot just inside the post at 19:25. A Worrisome Deficit But the second period belonged to the United States players, who escalated their forays, kept the Austrians on the retreat and scored four more goals to increase their lead to 6-1 through two periods. That slowed the Austrians, who grew concerned about prevention rather than their scoring. After Leetch hit the post, Craig Janney plucked the rebound and made the score 3-1 at 3:48, and Allen Bourbeau gave the United States a 4-1 lead at 5:12 when he broke in from the blue line and slipped the puck behind Stankiewicz. Bourbeau had enough momentum to shrug off Johann Sulzer, the defenseman trying to stop him. Scott Fusco drilled a shot from the slot into the net on a power play at 12:06, and then Leetch threaded his shot between two Austrian players and through the goalie's legs at 15:08. The Americans had worried about letting the Austrians play an emotional game, but by the close of the second period, it was obvious that they were in control.

619-> SPORTS PEOPLE; Gretzky Expected Back
Wayne Gretzky says he is ready to play again and expects to be in the Edmonton Oiler lineup for the game tonight against the first-place Calgary Flames. Gretzky, who hasn't played since suffering a severely strained ligament in his right knee Dec. 30, said the knee was greatly improved. ''The knee feels strong, the range of motion is solid,'' he said. ''But until I get hit, we won't know where it's at.'' This is the longest stretch Gretzky has missed in his career, and during it the Oilers have a 5-4-4 record.

620-> AMERICA'S CUP; Round 1 to Stars & Stripes
Dennis Conner sailed his first race in defense of the America's Cup today like a doctor afraid of a malpractice suit. Stars & Stripes, the catamaran sailing on behalf of the San Diego Yacht Club, beat New Zealand by 18 minutes 15 seconds, covering the 40-mile course in 4 hours 53 minutes 54 seconds. The race, the first in a two-of-three-race series, left little doubt about which boat is faster, the American multihull or the New Zealand monohull. The second race is scheduled for noon Friday local time on a 39-mile triangular course. Given the legal battle riding on the series outcome, it might not have have been to Conner's advantage to sail Stars & Stripes to its potential today. 'Cat' vs. 'Dog' Conner dodged accusations by the New Zealanders after the race that he had deliberately kept a slow pace. ''I'm sailing a cat,'' he said. ''Someone else was sailing a dog.'' Michael Fay, the New Zealand financier who forced San Diego into a regatta earlier than it wanted, has vowed to go back to court after the regatta should he lose. He says the series is a mismatch, that the defense of the cup is illegal under the deed of gift - the 101-year-old document that governs America's Cup racing - because multihulls are typically faster than monohulls. If successful, Fay could win the America's Cup in court if he ultimately fails to win it here. Given the circumstances, it appeared today that Conner either was sailing a conservative race or was sandbagging, a tactical maneuver to keep a yacht from showing its true potential. ''I would be embarrassed to be on their boat,'' said David Barnes, the 30-year-old skipper of New Zealand. ''They could have won by more than an hour.'' This is Conner's fourth America's Cup campaign as skipper. In 1983, he lost the America's Cup to Australia, but regained it in the next match, sailed in Australia last year. Conner said before the start today that his aim was to ''control'' his opponent. From the time the starting gun was fired at noon, and during the 10 minutes of maneuvering beforehand, Conner's plan was never in doubt. ''Dennis was perfect,'' said Marc Pajot, skipper of the 12-Meter French Kiss in the 1987 Cup series in Australia. ''It is exactly as we thought it would be in the way of speed difference.'' Obvious Superiority Although Conner kept a tight rein on his lightning-quick catamaran, the boat's superiority against New Zealand's 132-foot monohull showed itself every step of the way. At times, it seemed that Stars & Stripes was waiting for New Zealand to catch up. The 45-year-old Conner chose to keep a safe distance from the mightier New Zealand. At 60 feet, Conner's multihull is half the length of New Zealand and a fraction of its weight. At the 10-minute warning gun, both boats entered the America's Cup arena, an offshore site 3 miles from Point Loma. Barnes swung his boat around on a port tack about a quarter-mile behind the starting line. Stars & Stripes edged in also, but stayed several hundred yards from New Zealand. About 1,000 spectator boats were corraled a mile away by the Coast Guard. Skies were hazy as the early-morning fog began to lift. Both racing boats stalled for time. Like two cars waiting in a gas line, the yachts moved slowly forward in a luffing standoff. New Zealand made the first move, sailing down toward Stars & Stripes like a prowling lion. But Stars & Stripes held firm, refusing to be scared off. Barnes tried to force Conner to tack behind the race committee boat, and jibe back around. But as if frightened by its prey, New Zealand sailed by and went for the starting line ahead. Barnes inched his boat over the line 10 seconds ahead of Stars & Stripes. But at the same time, Conner powered up the rigid winged mainsail. The catamaran charged forward with the acceleration characteristic of a multihull. Tacking Duel Stars & Stripes moved ahead in the favored windward position. The two yachts, moving at twice the speed of their 12-Meter predecessors, engaged in a feisty tacking duel. It was as if Conner was testing his adversary, matching New Zealand wit for wit, tack for tack. Within five minutes, Conner had its number. He let up, spacing the tacks with increasingly longer sweeps from port to starboard, but always ahead. Halfway up the first leg, a 20-mile sprint to the windward mark, Conner stretched his lead to more than five minutes. The wind, 7 knots from the south at the race start, piped up close to 10 knots, then dwindled to 6 knots at the windward mark. Stars & Stripes continued to stretch her lead, despite expectations that lighter air would favor New Zealand. Stars & Stripes rarely popped her windward hull out of the water, a sign that the spritely catamaran is sailing as it should.

622-> Pyongyang as Outlaw
North Korea, a political and economic failure, hates and envies successful South Korea. Recently that envy has grown as Seoul reaches for new prestige by playing host to the 1988 Summer Olympics. Now it appears that despite the new and positive foreign policy signals Pyongyang has been emitting in recent months, its policy still comes down to nastiness, terror and murder. Yesterday Kim Hyon Hui confessed that she was a North Korean agent who planted a bomb last November on a South Korean airliner that later exploded over Burma, killing all 115 people aboard. Her professed motive: to derail Seoul's Olympic hopes by creating an atmosphere of danger. South Korea is considering retaliation. North Korea's behavior has alienated even many of Pyongyang's fellow Communist states, who are lining up to participate in Seoul despite the International Olympic Committee's denial of the North's demand to play co-host. That is because North Korea, while demanding recognition from civilized nations, continues to set itself apart. It has repeatedly sponsored acts of international terrorism and last year became the only country formally to default on its external debts. Some may wonder if yesterday's confession was coerced, a reasonable suspicion given Seoul's recent police practices. But circumstantial evidence supports Ms. Kim's testimony. She and a companion had been arrested during a stopover in Abu Dhabi. Both attempted to kill themselves by swallowing poison; her companion succeeded. The plane bombing recalled 1983, when North Korean agents used bombs to attack the entourage of President Chun Doo Hwan of South Korea during a state visit to Burma. Seventeen South Koreans were killed. The suspects in that incident also swallowed poison. A state with such contempt for the international community deserves no host's role in the Olympic Games, and no credibility for its supposedly new foreign policy.

623-> '88 WINTER OLYMPICS; Sports of The Times; 'No Jokers on This Team'
FLYING Huey helicopters for the Jamaica Defense Forces might best be described as ''hours of tedium, moments of sheer terror,'' Dudley Stokes says, but steering a bobsled down a hillside lives up to his innermost need to ''let go.'' Stokes is the driver of the Jamaican bobsledding team at the Winter Games. Don't make jokes about men from Caribbean islands playing in the snow because Captain Stokes will not be amused. ''The underlying attitude is that we are rubbing shoulders with world-class athletes,'' he said about the questions. ''We are serious athletes. There are no jokers on this team.'' Among the athletes who took part in the opening ceremony yesterday, there were some who qualified as man-bite-dog anomalies - the Quatro Amigos, as The Calgary Herald called the four bobsledding Perea brothers from Mexico; a luger from the Philippines; Albert, the bobsledding Prince of Monaco, and warm-weather people pursuing cold-weather sports. In their hearts and in their demeanor, the Jamaicans have more in common with Willie Gault, wide receiver for the Chicago Bears, a world-class sprinter and alternate pusher on the American bobsled team than they do with the American stereotype of Caribbean people gaping at snow for the first time. ''The U.S. is the only nation to win more gold medals than us in the sprint,'' Stokes said. ''There is a lot of ability in Jamaica but they are frustrated because only four men can represent us in the sprint. This is another chance for great athletes.'' This officer and gentleman says people should ''get past the hangups about snow and ice and wind'' and think about the power and speed and reflexes needed in the bobsled. Stokes says Canada has tried to recruit Jamaican-born Ben Johnson, who set the world record in the 100-meter dash last August, to push a Canadian bobsled. And Stokes nominates his younger brother, Chris, a world-level sprinter, as a future Jamaican sledder. A former soccer player and sprinter, Stokes has put in eight years in the Defense Forces. Few athletes at these Games have made a more tangible sacrifice than the 25-year-old officer from Kingston. He has given up perhaps 500 hours of flying time in the last year - hours that will cost him seniority, and pay, and perhaps a shot at a helicopter job when he leaves the service. But the first time he felt his body rushing down the course, he knew this was a sport, a pursuit, that could satisfy his need to live on the edge. ''My mother says she spent nine months creating me,'' he said, ''and I have spent the last 25 years trying to undo it.'' The five-man team is sponsored by a Jamaican rum company and also raises money by selling T-shirts and a recording of its theme song, ''Hobbin & A Bobbin,'' most recently at a Calgary restaurant the other night - people lined up into the street to pay $10 to meet Jamaican bobsledders. ''I'm a very private person,'' Stokes said. ''I'm not comfortable in the limelight.'' But he can justify being put on public display because he is representing his island nation. The Jamaican team was the idea of George Fitch, an American who says he once was assigned to Jamaica on a diplomatic mission. When he went into private business, Fitch put up $55,000 of his own money because he thought Jamaican athletes could compete on a world level. ''Actually, bobsledding is a lot like a sport they have in Jamaica, a pushcart with wooden wheels,'' Fitch explained. Once the Jamaica Bobsled Federation was organized, five athletes passed a test that would have qualified them for training for the United States national team. The other four are Devon Harris, an army lieutenant; Michael White, an infantry signalman and sprinter; Caswell Allen, a student and sprinter, and Freddie Powell, a reggae musician and electrician. A mystic, like most reggae musicians, Powell was asked what his first trip down the mountain was like. ''Nice,'' he said. Stokes, who can quote the Bible and Ian Fleming with equal passion, did the elaborating. ''At first I was skeptical because I did not know you steered it,'' he said. ''It was something like piloting a helicopter, the eyes seeing and the hands touching, but after that they go in divergent directions. The bobsled is nonstop action. That one minute on the run outweighs anything in a helicopter. ''You are not even aware of thinking. It's just sheer reaction. Once that bob gets going, there's no conscious thought. Some people say they do, but I say their concentration is so intense they have no time to think.'' He says the bobsled met his vision of the way to live: ''It's only after you let go that you can live. You realize you can die at any time. When I was younger, I heard about a British auto racer who retired because the machines were getting too fast, and after he was retired, a horse and carriage ran over him and he died. I never forgot that. ''It's like Ian Fleming said in one of his James Bond books, 'I'll not waste one day of my life trying to prolong it.' That pretty much sums up my philosophy. ''I'm not saying I'm a daredevil. I don't throw myself in front of a car to see how many bones I can break. As a pilot, I take all the precautions and then I go out and do it. ''But in a helicopter, if something goes wrong, you might have two or three minutes to do something. In bobsledding, you have a minute fraction of time. When it's gone, well, it's one of the sweetest feelings, a real high.'' In their first winter as bobsledders, they have trained in Canada and Austria, seeing enough black bobsledders from the Commonwealth that they are bored with the subject. Their goal is to finish somewhere in the middle of the competition here. Their second goal is to not be greeted as an oddity the next time around.

625-> Guides to the Bible
To the Editor: Elizabeth Struthers Malbon's review of ''The Literary Guide to the Bible'' (Dec. 20) shares with the book itself at least one major flaw. Missing from the book and ignored in the review are the conservative, evangelical scholars from many countries, churches and theological nuances. They cannot be discounted as unworthy of an audience on the basis of ideology, since the same universities have granted doctorates to these as to scholars who appear in the book. The same publishers have released their work. They read papers at the same scholarly societies. There is no more distance between the positions of some evangelical scholars and some of those who wrote for the book than there is between the writers themselves. The editors are not wrong for not including at least one evangelical scholar, but they are incorrect for failing to acknowledge that choice. Your reviewer is wrong for not noting and commenting on this, as she does so competently on other factors. WALLACE ALCORN Austin, Minn.

626-> Gastineau Tells the Jets He Is Quitting
Mark Gastineau of the Jets, one of the National Football League's top pass rushers, suddenly quit football today, apparently distraught because his fiancee has cancer. Earlier today, Gastineau's fiancee, the actress Brigitte Nielsen, said her medical problem had recently been detected. ''I have cancer of the uterus,'' she said in a telephone interview. ''I'm trying to handle this in a positive way. We're going to decide how we'll deal with this.'' As recently as Saturday night, the couple spoke excitedly about the possibility of having children, and how important it was to both of them. If a hysterectomy is required, Nielsen would be unable to bear children. A close friend of the couple, who did not want to be identified, was asked if Gastineau's decision to quit was based on Nielsen's illness. ''That's the reason,'' the friend said. Leader in Sacks Gastineau, the American Conference's sack leader with seven, had missed practice Wednesday because of what the club described as an illness in the family but was expected back today. Instead, he called Coach Joe Walton shortly after noon to tell him he had decided to retire. The president of the Jets, Steve Gutman, was glum as he told a news conference after practice today that Gastineau had quit for ''personal reasons, and they're his.'' ''He no longer wants to play football,'' Gutman said. Gastineau, who is 31 years old, could not be reached for comment, but another friend said tonight that the player would issue a statement soon. The friend would not disclose the couple's whereabouts. Walton said today that Gastineau had come to see him Tuesday night. ''He was thinking about quitting,'' said Walton. ''I said it's a big step and he ought to think about it.'' Walton sounded distressed over the fact that Gastineau had decided to leave in midseason. The Jets are 3-3-1 but have not won in their last three games. Tried to Change His Mind When asked whether he had tried to persuade Gastineau to stay, Walton replied with a wry smile, ''There's nine games remaining and I said all the things a coach would say.'' Walton hedged on whether he would take Gastineau back if he decided to return, saying it would depend on how the rest of the team felt. When asked why the team's feelings would be a factor, since personnel decisions are never left to the players, Walton said, ''I think it would be the right thing to do.'' Gastineau has been a controversial figure on and off the field. He is involved in a highly publicized divorce from his wife, Lisa. He was also one of the principals along with Ken O'Brien, the quarterback, in a fight at Studio 54 in 1984. He was found guilty of assault after what is believed to have been the longest misdemeanor trial in New York City history. He served his sentence by peforming sports-related community service at Rikers Island. A year ago, he was the first Jet to cross the strikers' picket line, which led to a fight with one of his teammates. He was going to earn $825,000 this season playing football. The salary is a legacy from his great years, when he was virtually single-handedly responsible for making the quarterback sack an official league statistic. In 1984, he set the league mark for sacks in a season with 22. The record still stands. The Sack Dance As a younger player, he annoyed Joe Klecko, the conservative spiritual leader of the defense, with the Sack Dance, which he performed after throwing a quarterback for a loss. Marty Lyons, another member of the defensive line, also objected to Gastineau's theatrics. Eventually, the league outlawed such celebrations. Gastineau is 6 feet 5 inches tall and weighs 270 pounds, but he was nevertheless one of the fastest defensive linemen in league history before suffering injuries. He was selected for the Pro Bowl five times. The club has paid him for the seven games he did play, games in which he often appeared to have returned to his old form. He had 7 sacks this season, the most since he had 13 1/2 in 1985. In the last two seasons, though, he was bothered by knee surgery, his divorce, and weight fluctuations caused by an adherence to fad diets. He had a total of only six and one-half sacks in those seasons. His decline and today's decision were not related to drug use, a team source said. The source said Gastineau had not tested positive for either illegal substances or steroids. The N.F.L. does not officially comment on drug questions involving individual players. Filling the Void In leaving, he has created controversy and more alienation. His departure leaves the young, injured Jets with a rookie sixth-round draft pick from Syracuse, Paul Frase, as the starting defensive left end for a key game against the Miami Dolphins on Sunday. Lyons, who has been Gastineau's teammate since the two were chosen as the club's top draft picks of 1979, said he would question whether he would want Gastineau back on the team if asked. ''Would he rededicate himself or pull this again on us?'' said Lyons, the right defensive end. At dinner the other night, Gastineau described Nielsen as the reason he had decided to stay in football another year. ''After last season I was ready to quit,'' he said. ''But she convinced me that I belonged in football.'' And in a recent interview, Gastineau added, ''If she told me to give it up tomorrow, that's what I'd do.'' Nielsen Passes Up Films The pair met last February. The Danish-born Nielsen is best known to American audiences for her roles in ''Beverly Hills Cop II'' with Eddie Murphy, and ''Rocky IV,'' which starred her second husband, Sylvester Stallone. Nielsen said she passed up two film offers to spend the season with Gastineau. She even attended a Jet scrimmage against the Redskins at Lafayette College in Easton, Pa., this summer. She brought a Hollywood touch to the scrimmage by showing up on the sidelines after getting out of a stretch limousine. His teammates took that with the same ''that's Mark'' resignation that had marked their attitude toward him. ''He was just starting to get the game's respect back and now he walks away,'' said Lyons.

628-> '88 WINTER OLYMPICS; Czechoslovakia Upset in Opener
Peter Schiller's backhand goal with 7 minutes 1 second left to play lifted West Germany to a 2-1 upset over Czechoslovakia at the Saddledome today in the first athletic competition of the Winter Olympics. Helmut Steiger also scored and the former National Hockey League goalie, Karl Friesen, made 30 saves for the sixth-seeded West Germans. Third-seeded Czechoslovakia, the silver-medal winner in 1984, was considered a favorite to reach the medal round in the B pool, which includes the United States and the Soviet Union. They lost despite superb goaltending from Jaromir Sindel, who was playing in place of injured Dominik Hasek. Sindel made 31 saves and did not have much of a chance on either German goal. Czechoslovakia took a 1-0 lead with 3:59 left in the opening period on a power-play goal by Jiri Hrdina, who is expected to join the Calgary Flames after the Olympics. David Volek worked himself free in front of the net, drew Friesen's attention and seemed ready to shoot. Instead, he wheeled round to his backhand and fed Hrdina, who wristed the puck into the wide-open net. West Germany tied the score 5:39 into the second period when Gerd Truntschka won a face-off back to Steiger at the top of the right circle. Sindel did not even have time to flinch before Steiger's blazing slap shot went into the upper right corner of the net. The winning goal came when Roy Roedger skated down the left side and fed Schiller, who held off a defenseman and shot the puck between Sindel and the left post. Soviet Union 5, Norway 0 The Soviet Union, stymied on the undersized rink in the first period, got goals from Alexei Gusarov and Alexander Mogilny early in the second and went on to beat Norway by 5-0. Playing in the Corral, where seats close to the ice prevented expansion of the rink to international dimensions, the second-seeded Soviets could not exploit their superior skating ability and wide-open style in the opening period. Most of the Olympic hockey games, however, are being played in the newer Saddledome. But the Russians scored twice within a minute in the second period to begin their domination of 10th-seeded Norway and their quest for a second straight hockey gold medal and seventh in nine Olympics. Gusarov scored a power-play goal on a blast from the left point that went over the goalie, Vernon Mott, with 2:34 gone in the period. At 3:30, Alexander Chernykh fed Mogilny, who was alone on the right side. Mogilny shot the puck from 10 feet and scored.

629-> Executives Shifted at William Morrow and Little, Brown
James D. Landis, who heads his own imprint at William Morrow & Company, was named publisher and editor in chief of Morrow yesterday. He replaces Sherry W. Arden, who was named head of a new Morrow imprint, Silver Arrow Books. In another development, Little, Brown & Company has appointed Roger Donald, its executive editor, as publisher of adult trade books. It also appointed William D. Phillips and Fredrica S. Friedman as associate publishers, the president and chief executive officer of Little, Brown, Kevin L. Dolan, announced. The changes at Morrow follow by less than three weeks the appointment of Howard Kaminsky as president of the Hearst Trade Book Group, which includes Morrow and Avon Books. But Allen A. Marchioni, chairman and chief executive officer of William Morrow, said yesterday's changes had been under way before the appointment of Mr. Kaminsky. ''Sherry has wanted her own imprint for some time,'' Mr. Marchioni print for some time,'' Mr. Marchioni said, ''and I felt that in order to use her a chance to acquire some best sellers for us.'' Other Imprint Affected Mr. Landis has been publisher and editor in chief of Beech Tree Books since its inception at Morrow in 1985. That imprint will continue, ''if we can find someone to run it,'' Mr. Marchioni said. Arbor House, which had been a separate subsidiary of Hearst, was made an imprint of Morrow last year. At Little, Brown, all trade-book publishing reported to a general manager, and there was an overall marketing director. But Mr. Dolan recently appointed publishers of juvenile books and of New York Graphic Society Books, the art book division, and he said yesterday that the position of marketing director would be eliminated. ''Until now the structure has been diffuse,'' Mr. Dolan said. ''This new arrangement will allow each publisher to have more control of marketing, publicity and setting budgets.''

630-> A Museum Taking Shape To Tell the Holocaust Story
One of the museum's designers once described their task as the creation of an institution ''charged with telling what cannot be told, showing what cannot be shown, sharing what cannot be shared.'' Paradoxical as it was, the design team for A Living Memorial to the Holocaust-Museum of Jewish Heritage has spent the last 18 months working on the problem, and has now proposed a solution. Construction of the six-story, $70 million museum is to begin in Battery Park City in lower Manhattan as early as this June, with completion set for late 1990. 'Values of Human Life' In a series of recent interviews, the museum's officials said the thrust of its programs and exhibits would be not only to document the horror of the Holocaust but also to portray the vitality and variety of Jewish life that the Holocaust nearly extinguished, as well as the renewal of Jewish faith and traditions in other lands. ''This is not a museum about Nazis and genocide, murder and persecution,'' said David Altshuler, the museum's 38-year-old director. ''It's about life and the values of human life and the continuities of Jewish traditions and faith. The collection of artifacts, photographs, documents and films is significant, but of far greater importance is what they convey. This is a museum where ideas count, where history counts, where stories count.'' In practical terms, this breadth of presentation will be achieved by bracketing the museum's extensive exhibits on the Holocaust with major exhibits on the world of European Jewry before World War II, on the aftermath of the Holocaust in Europe, on the immigration of survivors to Israel and the United States and on the renewal of European Jewish culture in America from 1654 to today. While the museum's exterior architecture, by James Stewart Polshek & Partners, was unveiled in 1986, the content of its exhibits and programs has not been revealed in detail until now. A freestanding memorial building, connected by an indoor walkway to the museum, was also designed by Mr. Polshek. It is to contain a skylighted room with a 60-foot-high ceiling and six eternal flames to commemorate the approximately 6 million Jewish victims of the Holocaust. Another commemorative room is to display photographs of the faces of 20,000 Holocaust victims, symbolizing the approximate number of people killed each day when the Auschwitz death camp was at full capacity. A learning center will contain computer and video systems on which visitors will be able to retrieve articles from a computerized enyclopedia of the Holocaust, biographical information on about 2.5 million victims and genealogical information on Jewish families from ancient times to the present. The museum will also run an education program for both students and adults on the Holocaust and related topics. It will include a 400-seat auditorium and a restaurant overlooking the Hudson River with a view of Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty. The museum will be financed with privately raised funds and the proceeds of an adjacent residential condominium. The museum's governing board will either raise funds as the developer for the condominium or through the sale of rights to build the apartments. Under an agreement with the Battery Park City Authority, the authority will receive both a land rent and payment in lieu of taxes for that part of the site on which the residential tower is built. The authority will receive a $1-a-year ground rent for the part of the site used for the museum. Governing Board to Meet These plans will be a prime subject at a meeting of the museum's governing board March 15, when the starting construction date and projected completion date will be made final. The idea for the museum dates to 1981, when Mayor Koch appointed a task force to study the possibility of building such an institution in Manhattan. A permanent commission was formed, headed by a New York real-estate developer, George Klein, and the Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, to guide the project, and in September 1986 its site at Battery Park City was dedicated. In the museum - as envisioned by Mr. Altshuler, Mr. Polshek and the New York design firm of Chermayeff & Geismar Associates - visitors will begin their journey through the exhibits by facing a huge, 60-foot-high interior stone wall in the museum's lobby. After passing through an opening in the wall and into another small room, visitors will enter a small auditorium, where Jewish life in Europe before the war will be described in a 15-minute film, with much of it narrated by Holocaust survivors. After the film, visitors will enter an exhibit entitled ''The World Before,'' where artifacts, photographs, films and other materials will document the richness and variety of pre-war Jewish life, from Polish shtetls to Viennese town houses, and in settings ranging from homes to Yiddish theaters, yeshiva study halls, newspaper newsrooms and scientific laboratories. The core exhibit of the museum will then follow: a chronology of the Holocaust, situated in a curving, 412-foot-long hallway, one wall of which will contain photographs, videotapes and headline-like captions marking key historical moments from 1933 to 1945. Branching from the hallway's opposite wall will be 11 galleries for thematic exhibitions on topics such as ''In the Ghettos'' and ''The Jews Resist.'' At the end of the chronology, another series of galleries will document the aftermath of the Holocaust, including displaced-person camps in Europe, the illegal immigration of Jews through Europe and ultimately to Palestine, and the rebuilding of Jewish communities in what became Israel, in Europe and in North and South America. Another gallery in this section will describe the worldwide effort to pursue Nazi war criminals. Adjoining this last gallery will be the commemorative room containing the photographs of 20,000 Holocaust victims. ''The room is meant to give visitors some way of confronting the enormity of the human loss without, at the same time, depersonalizing the victims,'' Mr. Altshuler said. To Record Their Memories A section of the museum's main floor and a mezzanine above will be devoted to its Learning Center. Holocaust survivors or their children may record their own memories of the Holocaust and its aftermath in a special videotaping studio next to the Learning Center. Altogether, the museum will contain 180,000 square feet of space, of which 57,500 square feet will be used for the exhibitions and 7,500 for the Learning Center. By comparison, the Whitney Museum of American Art has 26,700 square feet of exhibition space, and the Museum of Modern Art has 90,588 square feet. Its seemingly exhaustive approach notwithstanding, the New York Holocaust museum and memorial is only one of several such museums that either have been built or are currently planned for construction in major cities around the United States. Most notable among these is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, in Washington, on which construction began on Friday. It is expected to cost $90 million to build. Earlier this year in Los Angeles, the Simon Wiesenthal Center broke ground for a $30 million museum that, besides extensive exhibits on the Holocaust, will contain major displays devoted to the history of racism and prejudice of mankind. In 1984, in West Bloomfield, Mich., a Holocaust Memorial Center was built with museum exhibits, a memorial and a library.

631-> Subway Group Protests Removal of Newsstands
The Straphangers Campaign criticized the Metropolitan Transportation Authority yesterday for demolishing newsstands at 14 subway stations. ''A newsstand is an oasis to subway riders,'' said Gene Russianoff, attorney for the transit advocacy group. ''We're angry about the way it's been done. There's never been a public debate.'' The group held a news conference near the Times Square shuttle, outside a newsstand that it said had been prepared for demolition. The newsstand was among 43 that were closed last summer after a dispute with the company that ran them, Mr. Russianoff said. On Jan. 27, the M.T.A., parent agency of the New York City Transit Authority, notified the Straphangers Campaign that 19 of the closed newsstands were to be removed. An M.T.A. spokesman, Tito Davila, said transit police had determined that the newsstands impeded crowd movement and blocked the vision of officers patrolling the stations. Mr. Davila said 18 of the original 43 newsstands would be reopened eventually.

633-> 4 Are Convicted of Selling Heroin To an Organized-Crime Informer
A jury convicted four men yesterday of selling heroin to a major mob informer who later refused to cooperate with the prosecution. After a two-month trial in Federal District Court in Manhattan and three days of deliberations, the jury convicted the defendants of all the charges against them. The prosecution portrayed the main defendant, Ralph Tutino, as an associate of the Lucchese crime family. Besides Mr. Tutino, 60 years old, the other defendants are Leoluca Guarino, 53, Salvatore Larca, 43, and Laborio Bellomo, 33, all of the Bronx. Mr. Tutino's lawyer, Bruce Cutler, said the defendants would appeal their convictions. All the defendants except Mr. Bellomo could face a maximum sentence of life in prison, for the sale of more than four pounds of heroin, and he could face up to 40 years on each of two lesser charges. Judge Pierre N. Leval set April 27 for sentencing. $400,000 to Buy Heroin The main evidence included discussions about drugs that the informer, Vincent (Fish) Cafaro, taped a year ago while cooperating with the Government after he was indicted as a leader of the Genovese crime family. In the drug investigation, the Government gave him more than $400,000 to buy heroin, and it recovered only $27,000. The prosecution said Mr. Bellomo got away with almost $200,000 of the money by eluding Federal agents in a high-speed car chase in the Bronx. Defense lawyers acknowledged in the trial that Mr. Tutino and Mr. Guarino had sold the heroin, but contended that they had been illegally entrapped by the informer. The lawyers sought to overcome the fact that Mr. Tutino and Mr. Guarino appeared in the taped drug discussions that the prosecution presented to the jury. The defense denied that the two other defendants, Mr. Larca and Mr. Bellomo, were involved at all. They were not on any of the tapes. The prosecutor, Adam S. Hoffinger, said in his summation that the heroin operation had been infiltrated ''because Vincent Cafaro was cooperating with the Government.'' 'Caught Red-Handed' Noting that Mr. Cafaro later refused to testify for the Government, Mr. Hoffinger told the jury that the informer had stopped cooperating because ''his family received threats.'' The prosecutor stressed that Mr. Cafaro had taped several drug discussions with Mr. Tutino and Mr. Guarino, providing key evidence. He urged the jury not to be ''distracted'' by the defense's entrapment argument. ''They were caught red-handed,'' the prosecutor said of Mr. Tutino and Mr. Guarino. He called them greedy drug dealers who sold heroin that he said was supplied by Mr. Larca and Mr. Bellomo. ''This is what the case is about,'' he said, holding up two plastic bags, each containing a kilogram, 2.2 pounds, of high-purity heroin. In the final defense summation, Mr. Cutler argued to the jury that by using Mr. Cafaro, the Government had gone into the business of ''creating crime.'' Mr. Cafaro ensnared and entrapped ''two old-timers who were down on their luck,'' the lawyer said in a dramatic tone, pointing to Mr. Tutino and Mr. Guarino. To overcome the entrapment defense, Mr. Cutler said, the prosecution was required to prove that Mr. Tutino and Mr. Guarino had been ''ready, willing and able to do these deals'' before the Government sent Mr. Cafaro to them. ''The inducement, the initiation and the intimidation came from Fish,'' Mr. Cutler argued, as he depicted Mr. Cafaro as ''the Devil himself.'' Mr. Guarino's lawyer, George L. Santangelo, also stressed in his summation that the ''critical question'' was whether his client and Mr. Tutino had been prepared to deal in heroin before Mr. Cafaro came to them. ''The only reason this happened was because of Cafaro and his persuasion,'' Mr. Santangelo said. He said Mr. Guarino and Mr. Tutino had feared Mr. Cafaro because of his reputation as a powerful and violent figure in organized crime. Another lawyer, Murray Richman, told the jury that the Government lacked evidence on his client, Mr. Larca, and could not convict him with ''suppositions'' and ''guesses.'' At the end of his summation, which was sprinkled with jokes designed to deflate the prosecution, Mr. Richman displayed a large placard that said, ''Not Guilty.'' John L. Pollok, the lawyer for Mr. Bellomo, stressed in his summation that the defendants were entitled to the presumption of innocence, which he likened to ''a brick wall.''

634-> D'Amato Criticizes G.O.P. Rules Governing Primary in New York
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato has attacked the Republican Presidential primary voting system in New York as ''onerous'' and ''a stain on the party.'' The New York Republican said onerous rules requring candidates to collect hundreds of signatures in each of 34 Congressional districts would mean that in many districts only Vice President Bush, the candidate favored by the party heirarchy in New York, would appear on the primary ballot on April 19. ''This is not the Soviet Union where you just keep people out of the contest because you don't like them or where party bosses can just tell people who to vote for,'' he said in interviews Thursday and Friday. ''But the fact is, that's exactly the kind of system we have right now.'' ''It's an onerous system and a stain on the party,'' he said. Rules Are Defended Mr. D'Amato said he was issuing ''a challenge'' to Warren M. Anderson, the Senate majority leader, and other Republicans in Albany to change the system so that it ''enfranchises people rather than disenfranchises them.'' Charles Dumas, a spokesman for Mr. Anderson, today rejected Mr. D'Amato's charges, arguing that under the current Republican system ''everyone has the same opportunity but sometimes when the job hasn't been done properly, people look for someone else to blame other than themslevess.'' Mr. D'Amato said his complaint was ''not just sour grapes'' because the candidate he supported, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, failed to get on the ballot in only 13 of the state's 34 Congressional districts. Mr. D'Amato's own district on Long Island is one of those where Mr. Dole's name will not appear. Under current rules, a Republican candidate must collect 1,250 signatures or 5 percent of registered Republicans in each Congressional district in order for his name to appear on the ballot in that district. In practice, he added, this means collecting considerably more names than that in each district in order to compensate for signatures that might be declared invalid for a variety of reasons. He said this has frequently proved impossible for candidates to accomplish without the backing of the state Republican organization. All the signatures, he said, must be filed by Feb. 11, before the New Hampshire primary. Many New Yorkers, he said, do not have a clear idea of who most of the candidates are and what they represent until after the New Hampshire primary. The Senator said that the Democratic party last year changed its system to make it easier for candidates to run in primaries. In order to qualify in all districts, Democratic candidates, he said, have to file a total of 10,000 signatures, with 100 signatures from each of at least half the Congressional districts in the state. The Democrats also give themselves more time, until Feb. 22, to collect signatures. ''That's a system that meets some kind of reasonable standards and we could have a similar system if the Republican organization genuinely wanted to give people a choice.''

635-> BUSINESS PEOPLE; AGS Founder Is Closer To Billion-Dollar Goal
The goal of Lawrence J. Schoenberg, chairman and chief executive of AGS Computers Inc., is to make his company a $1 billion enterprise by the beginning of the 1990's. ''When you first set the goal you don't worry about it, but then you have to start making good on it,'' Mr. Schoenberg said in an interview. AGS Computers is not far off the mark. Its sales hit $500 million last year, and they are expected to come close to $700 million this year. Much of this growth has resulted from acquisitions. Mr. Schoenberg said AGS had bought 18 companies, all but one of them in 1981. The latest purchase came last week with an agreement to buy C3 Inc., a designer of computer services for the Federal Government, for about $155 million. AGS, based in Mountainside, N.J., concentrates on tailor-made computer solutions, including equipment, training and service, which gives it a long relationship with customers and stretches out the stream of revenue. AGS has been able to grow ''without the trauma you often get in high-tech companies,'' Mr. Schoenberg said. He said that some 10 years ago he removed himself from operations to think about the industry. In doing so, he realized that ''no one out there was offering a broad and comprehensive solution to customers' problems.'' For example, he said, the Delaware River and Bay Authority wanted to automate the toll collection on its bridges, and ''we're doing a complete system for that.'' Mr. Schoenberg, 55, calls himself one of the older executives in the computer industry. He founded the company in 1967 with Joseph Abrams, 51, who is the president and chief operating officer. Both attended the University of Pennsylvania but did not meet until later. Mr. Schoenberg went on to the university's Wharton School and Mr. Abrams to New York University's business school. Mr. Schoenberg worked for the International Business Machines Corporation for three years before starting a company, Automation Sciences, which did not survive after he left. He met Mr. Abrams in the 1960's, when they had neighboring apartments in New Jersey. Mr. Schoenberg is from the Bronx and Mr. Abrams is from Brooklyn. Mr. Schoenberg said AGS had no trouble raising the money for its C3 acquisition. ''I gather the banks have a lot of money to lend out,'' he said. ''Maybe they got it back from Brazil and we don't know it.''

644-> NATIONAL NOTEBOOK: Kansas City, Mo.; Luster Returns To a Boulevard
REDEVELOPMENT has begun to restore Armour Boulevard, one of Kansas City's major east-west thoroughfares, which had been tarnished by years of neglect. Although a lot of work remains, especially in the deteriorated eastern section of the boulevard, government involvement and community backing have brought some new life to this eclectic mix of corporate office buildings, Art Deco apartments and former mansions. In February, the City Council approved a long-term plan for Armour Boulevard that seeks to preserve and rehabilitate buildings and discourage fast-food restaurants and convenience stores. The Council also agreed to 10-year property tax abatements for developers involved in new construction and rehabilitation on the boulevard. The Armour Boulevard Community Development Corporation, a local redevelopment agency, is seeking to have 59 boulevard buildings landmarked. This would allow the Landmarks Commission of Greater Kansas City to implement its only major power - to delay demolition of designated landmarks for up to 18 months so alternatives can be considered. Some of the old buildings have been torn down, but Armour Boulevard, which was developed in the 1890's, retains an important place in Kansas City history. Many of the city's most prominent families lived on the avenue, which is named after a former resident and member of the Armour meat company family. At the turn of the century, a streetcar system transformed what had been a residential street into a major traffic artery. From 1911 to 1934, some of the city's leading architects designed luxury apartment buildings and residential hotels along the boulevard. But the buildings were neglected during World War II when housing shortages forced large apartments and former mansions to be divided into smaller housing units. And in the 1950's, the boulevard suffered because many residents moved to the suburbs. Interest in the street, which is just south of the downtown business district, grew during the 1980's as downtown and some nearby neighborhoods experienced a resurgence. The new activity has brought a return of young professionals to the western section of the boulevard. They are attracted by the proximity to downtown and shopping and entertainment districts. In addition, the rents - $500 for a 1,200-square-foot one-bedroom apartment, for example - are at least $100 lower than for comparable apartments in the suburbs.

646-> Connecticut Income Tops U.S.
Connecticut residents had the highest average income in the nation last year, more than double the per capita income of Mississippi residents, who had the lowest, the Government said today. The Commerce Department said that residents of Connecticut earned $20,980 for every adult and child in 1987, an increase of 6.9 percent over 1986. Mississippi ranked last with a per capita income of $10,204, a 5.2 pcece increase over the previous year. New Jersey, with income of $20,067, ranked second; Massachussetts, with $18,926, ranked third, and New York, with $18,055, ranked fourth. Alaska, which took over the No. 1 spot from Connecticut at the start of the oil boom in 1973 and held it until 1985, fell to fifth in 1987. Its average income actually fell 0.7 percent last year, to $17,886. Seven of the 10 states with the lowest per capita income were in the South. In addition to Mississippi, they were West Virginia, Arkansas, Louisiana, Alabama, South Carolina and Kentucky. Utah, New Mexico and Idaho, energy and mining states, were also in the lowest 10. For the nation, per capita income averaged $15,340, a 4.8 percent increase over a year earlier. That was slower than the 5.2 percent growth rate during the previous year and the 6.1 percent rate in 1985. When adjusted for inflation, which was 4.4 percent, 1987 income growth was the smallest since the recession year of 1982.

649-> CURRENTS; A Decorating Style to Die For
THEY call it post-mortemism. This aptly describes the decorating style on view in ''Beetlejuice,'' the new horror-comedy film that borrows its inspiration, in the words of the production designer Bo Terry, ''from the trendiest architecture money can buy.'' ''Beetlejuice'' may also be the first horror film to feature a clash of tastes and an interior decorator. Why a decorator? Like unfriendly ghosts, decorators ''use bully tactics,'' explained Tim Burton, the director. ''They sweep into a house and take over,'' he said. In the movie, a rather hateful couple from New York City take over a quaint whitewashed house in Connecticut owned by a young couple whose tastes run to knotty pine. The urban wife, played by Winona Ryder, proceeds to redecorate the house a la Manhattan. Amid various gory goings-on, the house turns into a surrealistic tomb of contemporary design. There are spiky steel chairs, Italian bar stools, a jagged-edge granite dining room table, squiggly dressers and faux granite everything else. The idea was to create an interior that would be ''cold, dangerous and unstable, a mix of art and furniture,'' Mr. Terry said. Outside, the lovely white house is transformed into a unrecognizable Hamptons-esque version of the Addams family estate, with suspended gridwork, a yellow keystone and running decks (inspiration: Richard Meier, Gwathmey/Siegel, Frank Gehry and Memphis). But for every scary piece of decor, according to Mr. Burton, ''we've seen worse in real life.''

Julio Tanjeloff, an importer of gems and minerals who had a meteoric career in New York retailing in the 1970's before most of his ventures collapsed, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 72 years old. Mr. Tanjeloff, who was born in Buenos Aires, at one time owned two of the city's most prestigious stores -Georg Jensen Silverware and Rosenthal Studio-Haus, which sold fine chinaware and glass. He also tried unsuccessfully in 1975 to revive S. Klein On-the-Square, the bargain fashion store that had closed after 65 years on 14th Street. Through it all, however, Mr. Tanjeloff maintained his original venture, Astro Minerals Ltd., at 155 East 34th Street, where he sold precious stones. He was credited with being among the first merchants to import and help to make popular unusual mineral stones for a mass market. His stock in the basement of Astro at times reached 150 tons. While he had an exclusive clientele who bought expensive gems, he also periodically cleaned out his basement, selling rare mineral pieces at bargain prices. Though Mr. Tanjeloff held a law degree, he entered the construction field in Argentina. Within a few years, he had made nearly $10 million and had bought several mines. When the Peron regime expropriated some of his properties, he left for New York in 1961, where he made his home. In 1975, Mr. Tanjeloff acquired Georg Jensen and Rosenthal Studio-Haus and bought the lease on the S. Klein property, but despite his wealth, he became overextended, and before long, the stores were closed and the Klein revival was abandoned. He then returned to the precious-minerals business full time. Mr. Tanjeloff is survived by his wife, the former Anna Cuomo; two sons, Edgar, of Great Neck, L.I., and Jorge, of Sarasota, Fla.; a sister, Dr. Aida Tanjeloff de Herran of Buenos Aires, and five grandchildren.

652-> COMPANY NEWS; Westin to Quit South Africa
Westin Hotel and Resorts, the United States hotel chain, said today that it was leaving South Africa by ending a contract to manage Johannesburg's best-known hotel, the Carlton. The hotel's general manager, Patrick Kelly, said Westin had decided to quit South Africa because of rising pressure from the anti-apartheid lobby in the United States. Under a contract with the Carlton's South African owners, Anglo American Properties Ltd, Westin has managed the hotel since it opened in 1972. It also owned an 11 percent stake of the hotel until 1986 when Anglo American bought it out. The 670-room Carlton will stay open, Gerald Leissner of Anglo American said, although it has suffered losses for the last three years and the 1987 room occupancy rate was only 47 percent.

654-> By Design: Hot Looks for Hot Weather
A sure-fire look this summer will continue to be a long, billowy skirt worn with a waist-cinching belt and a loose shirty top. This season's touch of newness will be the addition of rather sturdy platform-sole sandals. A big brimmed hat might be nice, too. The hot new costume for cool types, though, will be stovepipe-legged pants. Made of cotton jersey with a bit of Lycra, the legs can stretch to the ankle, or for the racier, to midcalf. But the pants must always be black, and they should have a bit of fullness through the hips, as well as a high waistline that accentuates the long, curvy silhouette. This style is chic and sexy on women with superb bodies. Interestingly, it also works for those with slightly chunky thighs and chubby knees. Like the long, full skirts, these tube-legged pants are at their best with a loose shirt tucked in. But please, wear them with flats, preferably in the style of ballet slippers. High heels give this look the wrong slant.

655-> Business and the Law; In-House Use Of Economists
MOST of Carolyn Brancato's colleagues at Weil, Gotshal & Manges mark their time by poring over legal briefs, writing merger agreements and putting clients into Chapter 11 bankruptcies. But in her office 28 floors above Fifth Avenue, Ms. Brancato spends her days analyzing statistics, dissecting industry trends and figuring out whether certain business combinations are so inefficient as to violate antitrust laws. Ms. Brancato is an economist, the latest profession to be part of a trend in which people holding doctorates have been hired full time for their expertise by law firms. One would think it only natural for larger law firms to have economists on staff. Investment banks, which work hand in hand with law firms on mergers and acquisitions, have had them for decades. Economic analysis of legal problems has become a legacy of regulatory agencies under the Reagan Administration, enjoying a heyday never seen before by the profession. Some of the nation's leading Federal judges, appointed by President Reagan, have relied heavily on economic principles to decide important environmental, antitrust and corporate issues. And no law school can call itself a major one without offering studies in economic principles. Yet law firms have by and large steered clear of maintaining staffs of economists. Fewer than a dozen partnerships have them. The vast majority find it cheaper to seek consultants as the needs of clients dictate. ''It's much more efficient for us to go outside when we need such experts,'' said Gordon B. Spivack, a leading antitrust lawyer who now heads that department at Coudert Brothers. ''Most places look outside for their economic work.'' Mr. Spivack said in-house economists served little purpose at trials. ''If you put your own economist from your firm on the stand, the judge and jury won't listen to him,'' he said. ''It's much more impressive to get an economist from Harvard or Princeton or the local school who is independent.'' Still, a few firms, including Washington's Arnold & Porter, have found enough specialized work to make hiring an economist worthwhile. Ira M. Millstein, a senior partner at Weil, acknowledges that Ms. Brancato is not likely to testify at trials, but serves a function at the firm similar to an in-house lawyer at a company. ''She is able to find the experts for us, much the way a corporation's lawyers manage its business among law firms,'' he said. Ms. Brancato, who is 42 years old, left Washington last fall where she had been the senior economist in charge of merger and acquisition work at the Congressional Research Service, the arm of the Library of Congress that does much of the homework for members of the Senate and House of Representatives. ''We were not exactly sure what I'd be doing once I got to New York, but I've been phenomenally busy,'' she said the other day. ''I've been doing everything.'' She received a doctorate in economics from New York University in 1975 and has been specializing at Weil in international trade work, analyzing the effects of what she called Japanese dumping of products on the American market. She has been involved in antitrust cases, defining the market share of businesses. And she has been putting values on securities in trust and estate cases for tax purposes. In a relatively new field for economists, Ms. Brancato has been used in asbestos cases to figure out the markets for certain asbestos products that are now the subject of increasing litigation. One client, which she would not identify, has been named as a defendant in a series of asbestos cases and lawyers are seeking to prove that there was little likelihood that the plaintiffs had used its asbestos products. A few blocks from Ms. Brancato's office, three economists are kept busy at New York's largest law firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. Much of their work comes from problems posed by clients who rely on the firm's mergers and acquisitions department, the largest of its kind in the nation, but the three also do a fair amount of other regulatory work. ''It became apparent with the new Administration that there was going to be a tremendous emphasis on microeconomics in legal problems,'' said Stephen M. Axinn, head of the antitrust department at Skadden, explaining why the firm hired its first staff economist in the early 1980's. ''When you go before the Federal Trade Commission or the antitrust department at the Justice Department, you're always greeted by a Government economist,'' he added. ''Between that and our steady diet of merger deals, having an in-house staff of economists seems only natural.'' Will a change in Washington mean that the economists at the firms will be out of business next winter? Not likely, Mr. Axinn said. ''The policies and emphasis may change, but the influence of economics on our profession is here to stay.''

656-> Top Wright Critic Declines to Meet Publisher
Representative Newt Gingrich has turned down an invitation to meet the publisher of a book by House Speaker Jim Wright, a lawyer advising Mr. Gingrich said today. The publisher, William Carlos Moore of Fort Worth, whose arrangement to publish a book by Mr. Wright is being examined by the House ethics committee, contacted Mr. Gingrich on Thursday about meeting with him privately here this week. But Daniel J. Swillinger, a lawyer advising Mr. Gingrich, a Georgia Republican, said that the Congressman decided today ''not to meet with Moore in light of the investigation.'' He said Mr. Gingrich would send a letter to Mr. Moore, notifying him of the decision. Mr. Carlos said last week that comments about him by Mr. Gingrich were ''having an affect on me.'' Mr. Gingrich has been the strongest Congressional critic of Mr. Wright's financial practices.

657-> Length of Average Hospital Stay Drops 22%
The average number of days spent by patients in hospitals fell 22 percent over a recent five-year period, the Department of Health and Human Services said today. The decline reduced health costs for individuals and cut revenue for the nation's hospitals, many of which are financially troubled. The average hospital stay declined to 5.71 days in 1985 from 7.35 days in 1980, according to a study conducted by the department's National Center for Health Services Research and Health Care Technology Assessment, based on the latest data available. Preliminary data indicate that the decline halted in 1986, Dean E. Farley, the agency health economist who directed the study, said in an interview. Competition a Factor The study attributed the decline to several factors. These included advances in technology, growing acceptance of outpatient treatment, greater scrutiny of the need to hospitalize patients by government and insurers, changes in reimbursement systems, price competition among hospitals and the growth of health maintenance organizations, which have incentives to reduce the use of hospital services. The average daily cost of an individual's hospitalization in the United States was $697 last year, according to Blue Cross/Blue Shield, the insurer. Hospital admissions totaled 33.6 million, according to preliminary figures from the American Hospital Association. Reducing hospital costs has been a major priority of the Reagan Administration. Dr. Farley credited the Government's reimbursement policies with reducing the hospital stays of Medicare and Medicaid patients. The patients insured under these Government plans for the aged and the poor account for about 40 percent of all hospital patients. The reimbursement policies call for paying hospitals based on predetermined amounts a for 475 categories of related illnesses and not the length of stay. But Dr. Farley said in an interview, ''The surprising finding was that privately insured patients also had a sharp decline in their hospital stays.'' He had no estimate of the amount saved by the shorter hospital stays. But Dr. Farley noted that some inpatient costs had been shifted to outpatient services while others, such as nursing care, had been shifted to families caring for patients at home. 'Profound Implications' The declines in hospital stays since 1980 ''have potentially profound implications for the hospital industry,'' the study said. ''Unless these trends are reversed, hospital beds will either be closed or converted to other uses.'' ''There was a lot of fat in this industry,'' Dr. Farley said. ''We may have reached the point where we're getting down to the bone and muscle.'' The American Hospital Association reported that its preliminary data suggested that the decline had begun to reverse slightly in 1986 and 1987. But Dr. Farley discounted the effect that AIDS might have had on the end of the decline of hospital stays, noting that hospitals that treated large numbers of AIDS patients were concentrated in a small number of areas. 'Financial Impact on Hospitals' ''The decline certainly had a financial impact on hospitals,'' said Alexander Williams, a senior vice president of the American Hospital Association. ''Anytime you get as sharp a change as we had, in as short a time, one would expect it to bottom out.'' Mr. Williams praised the trend toward declining hospital stays. and Michael Bromberg, executive director of the Federation of American Health Systems, a group of private hospitals and health care organizations, said, ''We haven't seen any decline in quality.'' But ''the trend is over,'' Mr. Bromberg added. ''Patients in hospitals are more intensely ill than before, and the length of stay is starting to go up again.'' Occupancy Rate Drops The report found an ''extraordinarily large, sustained and broadly based'' decline in hospital occupancy rates, to 56.6 percent in 1985, from 69.7 percent in 1980. Similarly, the mean number of beds for each hospital declined to 204.1 in 1985, from 216 in 1980. The report said this decline raised policy questions concerning who should pay for the renovations needed to eliminate hospital beds. ''One possible position is that this is a governmental responsibility since many public programs now provide incentives to reduce lengths of stay and unncessary hospitalization,'' the report said. ''Alternatively, it can be argued that these financial burdens should be shared more broadly, since private sector initiatives have contributed to the problem. A third option is for hospitals to bear the primary responsibility for dealing with excess capacity.'' The report found that the average length of stay declined for patients regardless of who was paying their bills, disputing some critics who have charged that new Federal procedures were placing Medicare and Medicaid patients at a disadvantage. The average length of stay declined 20 percent for privately insured patients, 22 percent for for Medicaid patients and 26 percent for patients on Medicare, according to the study. The study arrived at those figures by adjusting its data to allow for differences in the patient population and the resulting mix of diseases. Privately Insured Are Down Privately insured patients dominated hospital caseloads with 52 percent of all admissions in 1980, but their share dropped to 45 percent by 1985. In the same period, Medicare patients increased from 26 to 31 percent of hospital admissions, while Medicaid admissions increased slightly. According to the raw data, the overall average length of stay declined by 13.5 percent, but the patients were sicker and this suggested that the average length of stay should have increased by 10.7 percent, the study said. Further adjustments produced an an overall average decline of 22.3 percent. The report said that changing practice patterns, or ''medical technology,'' explained several of the changes in the mix of patients. For example, the growth of arthroscopic surgery appeared to have had a major impact on discharge rates for knee procedures, which showed a 50 percent decline in the average number of hospital days.

658-> Cancer Victim's Lawyer Sees Tobacco Conspiracy
An attorney for Rose Cipollone, who died of lung cancer in 1984 after smoking cigarettes for 40 years, castigated three tobacco companies today as part of an ''evil-minded conspiracy'' dedicated to profits at the expense of the lives of their customers. The lawyer, Marc Z. Edell, represents the cancer victim's husband, Antonio Cipollone, in a suit for unspecified damages against the Liggett Group, Philip Morris and Lorillard, whose cigarettes Mrs. Cipollone smoked. The companies are accused of fraudulently misrepresenting the safety of their cigarettes and of conspiracy to misrepresent or conceal information on health risks. A Four-Month Trial Mr. Edell said in a five-hour summation of the four-month trial in Federal District Court that confidential documents found in company files and introduced in evidence showed that the companies knew of the cancer hazards but hid or glossed over the data. He called this ''outrageous misconduct'' accompanied by a ''callous'' lack of remorse over the ''sacrifice of the lives of their loyal customers for dollars.'' Not only did the conspirators fail to warn Mrs. Cipollone of the health hazards of smoking, he said, but they also entered into a sophisticated public-relations and advertising program to mislead her and the public into believing that smoking was safe when they knew it was not. The tobacco industry has never lost a damage suit, but this is the biggest and costliest one ever brought and the only one to offer the confidential company documents. Litigation analysts estimate that the companies have spent $50 million since the suit was filed five years ago to prepare and present a defense. 'A Horrible Disease' In asking the jury to assess damages, Mr. Edell said Mrs. Cipollone was ''eaten up very slowly over a long period of time by a horrible disease, a disease caused by cigarette smoking, a disease she was never warned about by the defendants.'' He said the defendant companies, in their closing arguments, had sought to reverse roles and put Mrs. Cipollone on trial, contending that she had freely chosen to smoke. ''They said it was her fault,'' he said. ''But if you don't have the correct information, you don't know what your options are. The defendants were the ones who had an informed choice. They chose to keep their corporate lifeblood flowing at all costs.'' He noted that Mrs. Cipollone said in a deposition before she died that she was addicted and could not stop smoking. He added that the United States Surgeon General, Dr. C. Everett Koop, reported last month that nicotine was as addicting as cocaine and heroin. He said Mrs. Cipollone was misled by advertising such as that by Liggett saying, ''Play Safe, Smoke Chesterfields,'' and by comments by popular personalities, such as Arthur Godfrey saying he smoked more than two packs a day and ''they never did me any harm.'' Mr. Edell recalled that the defense contended in this trial that advertising has no effect on the buying public. ''Why,'' he asked, ''are they spending $250,000 an hour every day of every week if the advertising has no effect?'' The industry spent an estimated $2.5 billion on cigarette advertising and promotion last year. 'Creating Doubt' Mr. Edell noted that one of the confidential documents entered in evidence was a 1972 memorandum by Frederick R. Panzer, a vice president of the Tobacco Institute, the defendants' trade organization, describing industry strategy as ''creating doubt about the health charge without actually denying it.'' Mr. Edell said part of the conspiracy was to hide industry research findings if they linked smoking to cancer. For example, he said, Dr. James A. Mold testified that when he was assistant director of research for Liggett, his company refused to allow publication of findings that cigarette smoke included carcinogens. ''I requested it,'' he said. ''It was not allowed.'' Mr. Edell said that in a 1968 memo Helmut Wakeham, research director for Philip Morris, said the industry had a ''gentlemen's agreement'' barring cigarette companies from doing their own biological research on health risks of smoking. Aware of Hazards A lawyer for Liggett, Donald J. Cohn, responded in rebuttal that Mrs. Cipollone was aware of ''significant health hazards'' through warnings from her family and her reading and, since 1966, notices on each cigarette pack. He said no warning would have caused her to stop smoking. Ignoring the Surgeon General's warning that smoking causes lung cancer proves that, he said. The defendants, who made their closing arguments last week, were given rebuttal time today by Judge H. Lee Sarokin because Mr. Edell was not prepared to sum up Friday, and the companies said that created too much of a time gap between their final arguments and the start of jury deliberations Tuesday. Mr. Cohn and his colleagues said it was not fraud but opinion for the tobacco industry to hold the view that there was no scientific proof that smoking causes cancer. Loewsd

659-> CONGRESS CAN TAX MUNICIPAL BONDS, HIGH COURT RULES
In a decision of potentially major importance to state and local governments and many taxpayers, the Supreme Court ruled today that Congress is free to tax all interest on state and local government bonds. Overruling a major 1895 precedent, the Court held that the Constitution does not protect state and local governments against Federal taxation of the interest received by holders of their bonds or other Federal actions affecting their interests. The immediate effect of the ruling was to uphold a relatively minor tax provision Congress passed in 1982. The chairmen of the Senate and House tax-writing committees said today that they did not expect the decision to prompt Congress to impose new taxes on such bonds. Response in Marketplace In the credit markets, prices of municipal bonds fell immediately after word of the Court decision. But they recovered as market experts pointed out that the ruling did nothing to alter statutes already on the books. [ Page D16. ] Some people expressed concern that the decision would ''cast a pall'' over the ability of state and local governments to raise capital, in the words of Randolph C. Arndt, a spokesman for the National League of Cities. Reaffirming and extending a 1985 ruling, Justice William J. Brennan Jr. wrote the majority opinion, joined by Justices Byron R. White, Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens. Other Opinions Written The Brennan opinion held that states must look to the ''national political process,'' and not to judicial enforcement of federalism principles long thought to be embedded in the 10th Amendment and other parts of the Constitution, for protection from the Federal Government. [ Excerpts from majority and dissenting opinions, page D17. ] Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, Justice Antonin Scalia and Justice Stevens wrote opinions concurring in the Court's resolution of the immediate issue in the case without embracing Justice Brennan's broad reasoning. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor dissented, saying the decision invites further ''erosion of state sovereignty'' by Congress. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy did not participate in the decision. ''If Congress may tax the interest paid on state and local bonds, it may strike at the very heart of state and local government activities,'' Justice O'Connor said, adding that this would force states to increase by 28 to 35 percent the interest rates they pay on bonds issued to finance education, road construction, utilities and other projects. If Congress were to use to the fullest the power that the Court has made clear it now has, it would disrupt the $100 billion-a-year market in state and local bonds and could raise billions in new revenues for the deficit-ridden Federal Government, experts said. It is doubtful that the decision will prompt Congress to impose new taxes on state and local bonds, which it has already taxed in some indirect ways over the past few years. The Court's ruling today had been clearly foreshadowed by previous decisions eroding the doctrine of ''intergovernmental tax immunity'' and the 10th Amendment's protection of state autonomy. Many in Congress have assumed they had the power that the Court has now made explicit, but they hacutive director of the National League of Cities, said: ''Today's ruling by the Supreme Court is tantamount to a decree of unconstitutional surrender imposed on state and local governments by the national Government they created 200 years ago. We do not accept this butchery of the Constitution, and we are prepared to respond with drastic remedies if necessary.'' Apparently the decision would have no direct effect on the complex constitutional and statutory rules that define when interest on obligations of the Federal Government and its quasi-governmental entities are exempt from state and local taxation. The doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity originally restricted state taxation of contracts with the Federal Government as well as Federal taxation of contracts with the states, and its shrinkage in past decades has opened the way for state taxation of Federal obligations. But Justice Brennan said that ''states can never tax the United States directly'' and that ''the Federal tax immunity has always been greater than the states' immunity.'' The immediate issue in the case decided today was the rather minor one of whether Congress violated the Constitution in a section of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act, a 1982 law that removed the Federal tax exemption for interest on publicly offered long-term bonds isued by state and local governments unless they are issued in registered form, as distinguished from bearer bonds. Seven members of the Court said the provision was valid in the case of South Carolina v. Baker, No. 94 Original, but they splintered into four separate opinions. It was undisputed that the purpose of the 1982 limitation of tax-exempt status to registered bonds was to provide ''powerful incentives to issue bonds in registered form,'' as Justice Brennan put it, because of concern that use of unregistered or bearer bonds, which can be transferred without any public record-keeping, ''facilitated tax evasion.'' South Carolina challenged the 1982 provision as a violation both of federalism principles embodied in the 10th Amendment, which reserves ''to the states respectively or to the people'' the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, and of the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity. In rejecting the 10th Amendment argument, Justice Brennan said that even if the 1982 provision were viewed as an effective ban on state and local issuance of bearer bonds, the 10th Amendment gave the courts no mandate to strike it down. He said the Court's 1985 decision in Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority had made it clear ''that states must find their protection from Congressional regulation through the national political process, not through judicially defined spheres of unregulated state activity.'' Justice Brennan noted that there was no evidence that South Carolina had been denied participation in the national political process or had been ''singled out in a way that left it politically isolated and powerless.'' On the intergovernmental tax immunity issue, Justice Brennan said the 1982 provision would be invalid under the Court's decision in 1895 in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan and Trust Company, which held that any interest earned on a state bond was immune from Federal taxation. But he said that ''the rationale underlying Pollock and the general immunity for government contract income has been thoroughly repudiated'' by a series of decisions over the past 50 years. In his brief concurrence, Justice Stevens stressed that the decision ''expresses no opinion about the wisdom of taxing the interest on bonds issued by state or local governments.'' Justice Scalia joined in overruling the Pollock decision but wrote in a separate opinion that he did not agree with Justice Brennan's view that the Garcia decision meant that the ''national political process'' was the states' only constitutional protection under the 10th Amendment. Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote a separate opinion, concurring only in the decision to uphold the 1982 tax provision.

660-> Woman and 3 Children Found Dead in Bronx
A woman and her three children were found dead in their basement apartment in the Williamsbridge section of the Bronx last night. Officials said the cause of the deaths was not immediately known. A police spokesman, Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell, said there were no signs of violence and no marks or wounds on the bodies of the woman and the three children. The bodies were discovered at 7:21 P.M. by Carlton Watson, a printer, returning home from his job in Queens, He found Yvonne Richards, 30 years old, on the bathroom floor of their apartment at 4059 Lowerre Place. Their children, Tiffanie Watson, 6, and Carlton Watson Jr., 5, and Natasha Reid, 8, Ms. Richard's daughter by a former marriage, were found lying in a living room alcove. All of the dead were fully clothed. Sergeant O'Donnell said the exact cause of death would be determined by the Medical Examiner's office. He said that Yvonne Richards had called her mother yesterday morning and said that they were all sick and that she was going to call a doctor. It was not known if the call was ever made, the police said. Neighbors told the police that they heard no noises coming from the basement apartment yesterday. They also said no one else in the building was ill.

661-> Turk Visits Greece in Effort to End Years of Hostility
The Prime Ministers of Greece and Turkey began a three-day meeting today at this seaside resort, seeking to overcome decades of hostility and resentment that have sometimes brought their nations to the brink of war. Both leaders, Andreas Papandreou of Greece and Turgut Ozal of Turkey, warned against overblown expectations for the meeting, and emphasized instead that it is part of a long, complex reconciliation not given to dramatic breakthroughs. The meeting is extraordinary in itself, however, because no Turkish Prime Minister has visited Greece in 36 years even though the nations are allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Speaking at a state dinner tonight, Mr. Ozal warned, ''Unless a process of peaceful settlement is initiated, a dangerous escalation might arise, in view of the fact that our relations are saturated with protracted disputes.'' Security Force of 5,000 Mr. Papandreou, in his toast to the Turkish delegation, cited ''the unquestionable establishment of a climate of detente, following the reduction of tensions which used to prevail in the relations of the two countries as late as just a few months ago.'' A security force of more than 5,000 men has been mobilized for the meeting because bombings and violent street demonstrations accompanied the visits of lower-ranking Turkish officials who came here this spring for preparatory meetings. A group of about 100 Cypriot women sealed off entrances to the Acropolis for about two hours this morning to protest Turkey's 1974 invasion of Cyprus and its subsequent occupation of the northern third of the island. Police officers eventually forced the women to leave and then tonight put on a show of force when a crowd of about 4,000 Cypriots, Greek students, Armenians, Kurds and others with grievances against Turkey marched through downtown Athens shouting slogans like, ''No talks with murdering Turks!'' Mr. Papandreou said in a statement today that peaceful demonstrations on the Cyprus question were ''perfectly comprehensible.'' No Formal Agenda Set Virtually all the leaders' activities are taking place at a resort complex in this seaside town on the Attic coast about 15 miles south of downtown Athens. Mr. Ozal will only go into the Greek capital for two brief ceremonial occasions. No agenda has been set for the talks, but Mr. Papandreou said at the state dinner tonight, ''It is evident that progress in Greek-Turkish relations is directly affected by the solution of the Cyprus problem, and the solution of this problem is directly linked with the withdrawal of troops from the island.'' Mr. Papandreou added that today he had again pressed a long-standing Greek proposal for the demilitarization of Cyprus and the establishment of a joint Greek-Turkish police force under United Nations auspices. Mr. Ozal last week dismissed the possibility of an early withdrawal of the estimated 30,000 Turkish troops on Cyprus, declaring, ''We cannot pull out even one soldier as long as we are pressured.''

666-> Despite Praise, 'Turner' May Be Forced to Close
Joe Turner may have come and gone faster than anyone ever thought he would. Barring a surge at the box office in the next few days, ''Joe Turner's Come and Gone'' will close this weekend, after running less than a month at the Ethel Barrymore Theater. No serious drama has an easy time surviving in these glitter days of Broadway, but the failure of ''Joe Turner'' to find an audience has stunned even some hardened veterans of the commercial theater. The August Wilson play opened on March 27. Mr. Wilson's ''Fences,'' which won a Pulitzer Prize last year, was still drawing audiences around the corner at the 46th Street Theater, making him part of an elite club of playwrights with two shows running on Broadway at the same time. The reviews for ''Joe Turner'' were almost universally enthusiastic. The producers immediately spent $106,000 on advertising, an extraordinarily high figure that reflected their confidence in the show. But few came. 'It Was a Shock to Me' ''I read the notices on opening night and I presumed there'd be a line the next day around the block,'' said Elliot Martin, who produced the show with Vy Higginsen, Ken Wydro and the Yale Repertory Theater. ''But it didn't happen. It was a shock to me.'' Lloyd Richards, who directed both ''Joe Turner'' and ''Fences.'' said in a telephone interview yesterday from New Haven: ''I don't know what happened. All over the country this play has been wonderfully received, and it was wonderfully received here. I leave it to the experts to explain.'' The box office took in about $20,000 in each of the first two days after the opening, Mr. Martin said yesterday; by the third day, the figure was down to $16,000. Despite a potential weekly gross of more then $265,000, the production last week did less than $60,000 worth of business; it costs $96,000 a week to run. Only about 400 people were showing up for performances in the 1,100-seat Barrymore. Unlike ''Fences,'' which starred James Earl Jones (who has since been replaced by Billy Dee Williams), ''Joe Turner'' boasts no major stars. That situation is almost unheard of on Broadway nowadays: this season, Lanford Wilson's ''Burn This'' opened with John Malkovich in a starring role, and even it has had to struggle to build an audience; ''Breaking the Code'' closed when its well-reviewed star, Derek Jacobi, left the show after a fairly brief run. Hurt by Good Reviews? With its themes of redemption and rebirth, ''Joe Turner'' is somewhat more abstract than ''Fences''; the low attendance figures suggest that the word of mouth on the show is not uniformly favorable. And in an odd way, Mr. Martin said, the rave reviews may actually have worked against it. ''People say to me, 'Congratulations on your huge success,' '' the producer said. ''The perception is that it's a hit, and so they don't feel the pressure to rush out and see it.'' Most of the show's $300,000 reserve budget has now been spent, Mr. Martin added, and he cannot justify keeping it open - unless those theatergoers who thought they had plenty of time to see it realize otherwise. ''We're depending on the public, now,'' Mr. Martin said.

667-> Defendants Accuse Judge of Bias in Suit On Smoker's Death
Three tobacco companies charged today that Judge H. Lee Sarokin of Federal District Court had become an advocate for a plaintiff who is suing them and should declare a mistrial. They said the judge ''took over the cross-examination'' of a defense witness with a series of questions that conveyed to the jury his ''incredulity'' over the testimony. ''The jury could come to no other conclusion than that the court was on the side of plaintiff's counsel and opposed to the defendants,'' the companies said in a memorandum in support of their mistrial motion. An Advocate's Role Seen The companies - Liggett Group, Philip Morris - and Lorillard, said a judge might question a witness appropriately but ''should not abandon his proper role and assume that of an advocate.'' ''The Court should not take over the cross-examination for a party so as to emphasize one party's proof or question the credibility of a witness,'' the companies asserted. The companies are being sued for damages by Antonio Cipollone of Lakehurst, N.J., who charges that his wife, Rose, died of lung cancer in 1984 at the age of 58 after smoking cigarettes made by them for 40 years. Role of Advertising Questioned Mrs. Cipollone testified in a deposition taken the year in which she died that advertising by cigarette companies had persuaded her that smoking was safe. Prof. Claude R. Martin, testifying as an advertising expert for the defense, said advertising had little or no effect on smoking decisions, regardless of content. While Professor Martin was being cross-examined Friday by Marc Z. Edell, Mr. Cipollone's attorney, Judge Sarokin took up the questioning. Defense attorneys objected at the time to the questions as prejudicial and asked for a mistrial, which was denied. Today's memorandum renewed the motion.

668-> A Time for Letting Go Grips a Teaching Staff
This is a bittersweet time of the year for the teachers of River Dell Junior High School as it is for teachers everywhere. The school year's work is almost over and the reward of a summer-long vacation is near. But it is also a time for parting, for saying goodbye to children whose minds they have struggled to shape, who have kept them up at night with worry, whose antics have made them laugh. ''It's always sad,'' said James Kelly, who has been a social studies teacher for 27 years. ''It's like a parent whose kids have gone off to college and gotten married and have moved out of the house and you've got to begin again.'' This subdued side of a teacher's year is often not thought about by the public. The focus is on the general euphoria of students at graduation time. Parents assume that fine teachers merely take satisfaction in a job well done. A Difficult Time ''Parting is very difficult,'' said Judy Seddon, who has taught English for 26 years. ''There are times in kids' lives that are so terrific you wish you could freeze the moment and have it wrapped up.'' Mrs. Seddon, Mr. Kelly and two other ninth grade teachers in this suburban town near the George Washington Bridge spoke of melancholy and letdown as well as the more familiar feelings of accomplishment and relief as the school year draws to a close. ''You can't say it in so many words,'' Mr. Kelly said, ''but there's a bond that develops and when school ends there's an emptiness you feel. You feel drained.'' Seasoned teachers like Mrs. Seddon say that even if they see a former student in the local supermarket or on a visit to the area high school, the relationship will not be the same. ''We're not part of each other's daily lives anymore,'' she said. ''And the familiarity changes. They've experienced new things and so conversation isn't as easy as when you had them every day in class.'' ''I think of how I'll feel when my son David goes off to college at the University of Vermont,'' she said. ''He will not come back to the household in the same way, and that's the way it is with students.'' But she believes that this is as it should be. ''They have moved ahead and they should do that,'' she said. ''What makes me uncomfortable is when a student hangs on. A couple of kids send letters to you a year later and there's the boy that's had a crush and never loses it.'' Impact on Lives Mr. Kelly, whose brogue resonates with the Dublin he left as a young man, said he is often surprised to learn long after graduation about the impact he has had in steering someone toward a career or lifelong interest. ''I'll get a letter out of the blue,'' he said. ''Something has clicked in college or on the job, and they'll contact you. But you have to go back to the yearbook to see who it was.'' Mr. Kelly's farewells will be particularly difficult this year because he will retire when school ends June 24. Along with the sadness of parting is a feeling of a job not yet completed, the teachers said. They have taken students only so far, and in most cases will never know how they turned out. Ray Morrison, who has taught French for 19 years, said he watches his students grasp fundamentals like verb tenses but never gets to see them converse comfortably as many do by the time they finish high school. Sometimes he learns of a once troublesome student who has made a promising turn in life. ''You wish you had been able to see that part of their lives,'' he said. Mr. Kelly compares that frustrating sense of incompleteness to the feelings assembly line workers may have. ''You have worked on a small portion of their minds and you wish you could see the whole assembly at the end,'' he said. Sometimes, the teachers said, parting is most difficult, not with the brightest, most charming children, but the most nettlesome ones who have managed to ensnare themselves in their teachers' psyches. Peg Talbot, a mathematics teacher for 22 years, says she is surprised to find that a class she had very little rapport with early in the year because of an uneven blend of personalities, turns out in June to be her favorite class. On the last day of school, Mr. Morrison finds himself in an unaccustomed place at the doorway wishing his students good luck and a nice summer. And when the last one has left, he said, there is sometimes a feeling of something longed for that did not quite happen. ''The kids are young,'' said Mr. Morrison, ''and they haven't attained the poise to say what you would like them to say. You don't teach them because you want them to say 'Thank you,' but it's nice to be told thank you or, even more important, to be told 'I learned a lot.' ''

669-> Amid Death and Darkness, A Turning Point in Salvador
In the lobby salon of the Camino Real Hotel, several survivors of the democratic left in El Salvador gathered here over the weekend to discuss the prospects for peace and increased democracy in their country. They met in the eighth year of a civil war that has killed 70,000 Salvadorans. In the evening, as their discussion came to a close, the lights flickered out from rebel sabotage, bombs thudded in in the distance and army helicopters equipped with night-vision scopes flew overhead in the dark, scanning city streets for rebel saboteurs. The Government here is struggling. President Jose Napoleon Duarte is suffering from stomach cancer that has also affected his liver, and he is to undergo exploratory surgery in Washington on Tuesday. Mr. Duarte's Christian Democratic Party is split into two factions, the rightist opposition is strengthening, political killings are rising and the civil war waged by Marxist rebels remains in full swing. Mr. Duarte's illness is only the most dramatic sign that El Salvador may again be entering a period of transition. Its course will be affected by a new American President, a new Salvadoran leader, and the political participation of some leftist parties. The key question will be whether the Government and the rebels decide to negotiate or to keep fighting. 'A Period of Definition' ''I sense that all the actors feel this is a period of definition,'' said Ruben Zamora, a civilian rebel official who has returned here. ''We will find out what is possible and what is not.'' The war here is a 15-year-old social struggle that the Reagan Administration has addressed by heavily backing the army and Government, while contending that the future of El Salvador is vital to the future of the United States. With more than $3 billion of American aid spent here, El Salvador today is among the few places in the world where the United States still is actively trying to create a particular model of society, a kind of third-world capitalist democracy closely allied to American interests. But there is no certainty that that model will work here, where there seems to be a vacuum of political power and little vision for new programs to lead the country into the future. Some of the speakers at last weekend's conference had returned home for the first time after eight years of exile. All appeared uncertain of the political meaning of their presence. That they were able to return and organize a public forum to sharply attack the Government and American policy was a sign of change, several acknowledged. But no one was sure what that change means. 'River Full of Crocodiles' ''Working in politics again in El Salvador is like swimming in a river full of crocodiles,'' said Hector Oqueli, a senior rebel civilian official who spoke at the meeting. ''Since there's water, you're able to swim, but you never know when one of the crocodiles is going to come and chop you up.'' Such fear is part of the ambiguity and mortal risk of political life here. El Salvador has the formal trappings of democracy, but is not far advanced in its practice. Most Salvadorans have little say in the political decisions that affect their lives. Fear and poverty are part of daily life for many, if not most, of them. The cause is not hard to find. Killing of civilians by the rebels and the army is rising sharply. The rebels have shot to death two mayors and at least 15 other civilians in recent months. They have also placed car bombs in the capital, machine-gunned civilian vehicles and used land mines that are believed to have killed most of the 28 other recent victims of bombs and explosive devices. The army and perhaps private rightist killers are also newly active. As the returning leftist politicians debated the prospects for peace over the weekend, the families and friends of the three latest victims of a death squad mourned in the grimy suburb of Apopa. Their bodies were found last Wednesday, some of the more than 40 civilians whose bullet-riddled bodies have suddenly begun turning up again. In one incident in Morazan Province, witnesses say, soldiers forced two men to run through a burning field, then chopped off their noses, fingers and ears before shooting them. Failure of Ruling Party That such official and semi-official brutality is on the rise is one of the strongest indications that political tension is growing in El Salvador and that homicide remains a favored method to treat differences that would be debated and peacefully resolved in a less broken, less violent society. After winning control of the Government four years ago, the Christian Democratic Party is widely seen as having failed to live up to its reformist promise. The party is accused of being a perhaps well-meaning, but corrupt and inefficient group incapable of changing the status quo. Mr. Duarte's opponents, the rightist Nationalist Republican Alliance, known as Arena, is newly ascendant and may well win the presidency next year, having defeated the Christian Democrats to take control of the legislature in elections two months ago. Arena may be a party in transition from an extreme anti-Communist group, with close ties to the death squads, to a more moderate party with strong backing from conservative peasants and slum dwellers. But it is divided and extremists remain influential. Arena promises to form a more efficient and honest government. But it may be difficult for a party founded by businessmen and retired army officers with a legacy of political killing to offer programs that will attract the active support of the majority of Salvadorans. Power of the Army The army, buoyed by its importance in the war and by American aid, is bigger, more politically sophisticated and more influential than ever. Senior army officers seem unsure of what to do. They acknowledge privately that the war is stalemated and that the Government is paralyzed. But they say they do not want to take power directly in a coup. American officials are divided. The optimists say this is a testing, but unavoidable, passage in a decade-long transition to a more democratic society in a country that has previously known only dictatorship. The pessimists say the American effort to defeat the rebels while backing a working pact between the army and the Christian Democrats is failing. Totally dependent on American aid, El Salvador's future will be deeply affected by any policy change made by the next American President. This year, the United States is giving $391 million in economic and military aid, most of the national budget. The guerrillas have shown a remarkable capacity to survive everything that more than 100 American military advisers and a large Central Intelligence Agency operation have devised for the army to defeat them. Leftist civilian politicians in contact with the Marxist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front say the group will make a crucial choice in the months ahead that will help determine the direction of the war. Rebels Fail to Attract Support For the last year and a half the rebels have been reorganizing political fronts in the cities while also pressing the war and extensive sabotage. Despite their efforts, the rebels have shown little capacity to attract new widespread support and there is scant prospect of a mass insurrection. Because of that, the rebels may decide to moderate their proposals to negotiate an end to the war. Or they may decide to press for an all-out military campaign at a time of perceived weakness. Diplomats and army officers say it is possible that the rebels will offer to negotiate while mounting big attacks to demonstrate strength. There is little doubt that the pressure of the guerrillas has been the chief stimulus for positive political change here and for American interest in El Salvador. But so long as the war goes on, economic recovery and a lasting political consensus appear unlikely. Some American officials refer to the war as a ''low-intensity conflict,'' to distinguish it from the heavy firepower used in a major war. ''It's not low-intensity for Salvadorans,'' one American official said. ''It's a high-intensity conflict and they're suffering.''

670-> WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING; What's in a Name?
Edmund Morris, the authorized biographer of President Reagan, has a concern. In a capital where the chief of state is commonly referred to as Ron, or even Dutch, where the Speaker of the House goes by Jim and the Senate minority leader Bob, Mr. Morris has raised his voice against ''the unasked-for abbreviation of our proper names.'' In a recent column in The New York Times, William Safire referred to Mr. Morris as Ed. This prompted Mr. Morris to write ''an open letter'' to Mr. Safire remonstrating that, in his case, such usage ''grates like sand in salad.'' The author of a biography of Theodore Roosevelt, Mr. Morris pointed out that the 26th President had complained bitterly about being called Teddy by a stanger. Mr. Morris apparently believes nicknames become inoffensive when used posthumously. While his book is titled ''The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt,'' he referred to his subject in his letter as ''Poor TR.''

671-> Where Are the Fathers?
To The Living Section: Ms. Richardson's article is so full of unstated negative assumptions about working mothers that I feel obligated to respond, though I work full time as an attorney, have a husband and a 2-year-old daughter and a grandmother who lives with us, and therefore don't normally have time to engage in debate about how society does - and should - view women like me. There were also unstated assumptions about mothers who work. One got the feeling that working mothers are not raising their chldren, somebody else is. This is insulting. Choosing to work is integrally related to my decisions on raising my child. Perhaps most disturbing in the article is the complete absence of the fathers. Do Ms. Brown's children ever call their father at work? Does he ever pick them up after school? If Ms. Brown was trying to do it all, it's no wonder she couldn't do it to her satisfaction. It is disturbing to see (yet again) a discussion of family without any discussion of fathers, as though only women must balance work and family. That assumption is dangerous because it limits the debate and therefore any creative solutions to it. It is also dangerous as a matter of social health. Studies show that women who stay home with children are more prone to depression and stress-related illnesses than working mothers; other studies show that boys raised predominantly by women tend to value separation and control over relatinships, and that these values are reflected in everything from men's inability to really become part of the family to foreign policy. It is time that we include the men in these discussions, for everyone's sake. ANNE CICERO WEISBERG Brooklyn

673-> Airlines Improve On-Time Rates
The airlines had their best on-time performance and least number of consumer complaints to the Government in the latest aviation consumer statistics, the Transportation Department announced today. The department said it had received 36 percent fewer complaints from passengers in May than in the same month in 1987. For the first time in 15 months, the complaints were fewer than 2,000; they were at 1,820. The department said that in April, the latest month for on-time information, the 14 largest airlines had 82.6 percent of their flights arrive within 15 minutes of schedule, as against 78.8 percent in March. The figures were the best since the department began monitoring on-time performance last September and in part reflected good weather in April, the agency officials said. The airlines also misplaced fewer bags in April with 6.53 baggage complaints for every 1,000 passengers flown, compared with 7.48 reports the previous month and 11.83 in January. The number of passengers bumped from flights because of overbooking also declined. There were 3.71 passenger for every 10,000 boardings involuntarily bumped in the first three months of this year, compared with 5.46 passengers in the same period of 1987, the department said. Continental Airlines and Eastern Airlines, both owned by Texas Air Corporation, were the subject of the most complaints to the department.

674-> Addiction's Hidden Toll: Poor Families in Turmoil
As crack causes crime rates to soar and drug bazaars to infect street corners in New York and other major cities, the smokable form of cocaine is taking a hidden but far more devastating toll, experts say, by tearing apart what remains of the fragile ghetto family. In New York's poorest neighborhoods, where households are mostly headed by women, the switch from heroin to crack as the choice drug of the inner city has had a strikingly destructive impact. For reasons not yet clear, women seem more disposed to become crack addicts than heroin addicts, statistics indicate. With frightening speed, city officials say, the use of crack by such women has led to a more than tripling of child neglect and abuse cases involving drugs in two years. Officials have also noted a dramatic rise in the number of infants abandoned in city hospitals, born addicted or with syphilis as well as a surge in children beaten and killed by drug-addicted parents. Disintegrating Families As a result, many poor and some working-class families are simply disintegrating, experts say, with mothers who once maintained homes and jobs disappearing onto the street or into city shelters, while their children flood an already overwhelmed foster-care system. Meanwhile, in the same neighborhoods where the relatively stable heroin industry thrived for decades, crack has suddenly created drug organizations and gangs that vie for control of a volatile new market with a level of violence unknown even to veterans of the drug trade. With the shift from heroin to crack, addicts now are more likely to commit crimes against people than against property. And the move from heroin to crack has generated vastly higher profits and employment in the drug business, economists say. To young people in the ghetto, who have faced declining prospects of legitimate employment as the city's economy has shifted from manufacturing, crack has elevated a career in the drug trade to a sometimes irresistible lure. Impact on Millions These are just some aspects of a phenomenon that has transformed the multibillion-dollar drug industry and its impact on millions of urban residents: the transition from the age of heroin in the inner city to the age of crack. In recent interviews, city officials, sociologists, economists, health professionals, lawyers and advocates for the homeless said that unlike heroin, crack appears to have an almost eerie ability to afflict the healthiest survivors in the city's already vanquished neighborhoods, and to steal from their children whatever hopes they once had of eventual escape. So far, it appears that the social damage of crack has been most severe in the poorest black and Hispanic areas, where single-parent households are most common. But some crack addiction has also struck families in both black and white working-class neighborhoods. ''The impact of crack is like a nuclear explosion on a family,'' said Kevin McEneaney, the director of clinical services at Phoenix House, the largest operator of residential drug-treatment centers in New York. ''We are starting to see the total corrosiveness of this thing. The 20-year-old woman with two children is a much different victim than the 17-year-old male - and the matriarchal situation often is just evaporating.'' Often, the powerful craving for the drug leads users to spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars a week on crack purchases. For the poor, the sole source for such income is crime, be it drug sales, robberies and thefts by men, and, more likely, prostitution for women. How One Family Was Destroyed by Crack Perhaps crack's impact on the family is best illustrated through the histories of some of the women who, with different degrees of success, had been struggling to keep their families intact before they used crack. Two years ago, Teresa Johnson was far better off than many single mothers. As a 27-year-old aide in a Staten Island nursing home, she recalled that her life was filled with the modest pleasures and promises of a working-class existence. ''I used to get out of work at 5, pick up my daughter from the baby sitter, cook dinner, check her homework and get her ready for the next day,'' Ms. Johnson said. ''I didn't have time to hang out. I was too tired for anything else.'' With a paycheck of $720 every two weeks, Mrs. Johnson said there was just enough to maintain a tidy, well-furnished one-bedroom apartment on Staten Island, plus a little left over to deposit in a bank account for her daughter. But in December 1986, both of Ms. Johnson's parents died. One night a few weeks later, a friend offered her crack to lift her spirits. Soon Ms. Johnson was buying crack on her own and taking part in all-night binges. Ms. Johnson's daughter started noticing that life was changing. In the morning, the girl would wake up to find her dresses were no longer crisply ironed. Her mother was still asleep. The child's savings account disappeared, and Ms. Johnson's relatives, friends and employer noticed she was losing weight. In April she lost her job and the following month she was evicted from her apartment. Ms. Johnson asked her sister to keep her daughter for a week. ''I didn't come back for two months,'' Ms. Johnson said. ''I sold my car. I sold my daughter's bedroom set. The living room set. The rugs. The refrigerator. The washing machine.'' Ms. Johnson moved in with her brother and started selling crack from his apartment. They hired two men with pistols to guard their home, and used their daily profit of $3,000 to support their drug habits. Often, she smoked crack 24 hours a day. In August she was arrested when the police raided the apartment. After spending a month in jail at Rikers Island, Ms. Johnson was sent by a judge to Phoenix House for drug treatment. Her brother, her sister-in-law and a sister are still crack addicts, she said. And the one remaining sibling, her sister who is not a crack addict, now cares for the family's nine children. Explosive Growth Over Three Years Such stories have become increasingly common as the drug's widespread use has grown from its explosive beginings in New York, Miami and Los Angeles in 1985 to all but a handful of states this year, experts say. The data gathered is nowhere near as extensive in Miami and Southern California, but experts there, too, say the drug is having a destructive effect on poor women and their children. Crack arrived in force in the New York metropolitan region between mid-1985 and 1986, a short time after it first appeared in Miami and Southern California. Since then, its sale and blatant use have generally remained in poor and working-class neighborhoods, according to the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration. Although streams of cars driven by suburbanites flow into major crack sales areas like the Washington Heights section of Manhattan and southeastern Queens, there is no data to indicate just how widespread crack use is among members of the middle class. A survey of crack buyers whose cars were seized in Washington Heights showed that most were lower-middle-class working people from New Jersey. At the very least, experts say, crack's damage to the more affluent is far less visible. Arrest and drug treatment statistics indicate that the spectacular rise in crack use in the New York area slowed considerably in mid-1987. Yet the drug, like a glowing ember, has continued to burn through the social fabric of the areas where it has remained. Despite early hopes by some experts that crack might fade like other drug fads, it now appears to have become a profound and lasting affliction of the city's poor. In the poorest neighborhoods of the city, heroin was the main addictive drug since its boom in popularity in the late 1960's. Today, there are still an estimated 250,000 heroin addicts in the city, but they are generally an aging group who began their habits more than a decade ago. No one knows how many crack users there are, but most experts agree that the drug is now far more popular than heroin and is used by people of a wider age range. Rise in Addiction Among Women In part, the use of crack has altered life in the ghetto because the drug differs so dramatically from heroin in its effects: in the speed of addiction, the proportion of users who become addicts and in the behavior of users. But another key difference between crack and heroin in the inner city went largely unnoticed in the early stages of the epidemic - the rise in the proportion of women becoming addicts. With the arrival of crack, the number of women seeking treatment at Phoenix House, which admits more than 1,000 addicts a year, suddenly jumped by half, from about 20 percent in 1985 to 31 percent in 1986 and 32 percent this year. Another recent study conducted by the New York State Division of Substance Abuse Services, showed that of people seeking drug treatment in publicly financed programs, 24 percent of those addicted to drugs other than cocaine were women, while 34 percent of crack addicts were women. No one is certain why women are more likely to use crack than heroin, treatment experts say. Some experts theorize that women are statistically less likely to engage in extreme deviant behavior and that using a hypodermic needle is less socially acceptable than smoking a drug. Yet no studies have been conducted to verify such an explanation. In any case, the shift to greater drug addiction among women is especially frightening in the 1980's, experts say, for women have fast become the linchpin of society in poor neighborhoods. Between 1970 and 1984 the number of black and Hispanic families headed by women has more than doubled. By 1980, the Census Bureau reported, among the poorest third of black families, more than 70 percent were headed by women. Abuse and Neglect Of Children Rise Sharply William Grinker, the Commissioner of the city's Human Resources Administration, and other officials point to a wide range of statistics that they say paint a stark picture of family life crumbling under the weight of crack. Reports to the city of child abuse and neglect where parents were involved with drugs more than tripled - to 8,521 from 2,627 - over the past two years. Mr. Grinker blames crack for driving up the number of abuse and neglect cases to 52,568 this year from 41,454 in 1986. During the same period, the number of babies born in New York City with drugs in their urine more than tripled -from 1,325 to 5,088. Most of the babies tested positive for cocaine. And a review by the city of cases of children who were killed as a result of neglect and abuse last year showed that 73 percent of the deaths resulted from drug abuse, up from 11 percent in 1985. At Harlem Hospital, Dr. Margaret C. Heagerty, director of pediatrics, said that for the first time several toddlers had been admitted with neurological damage from inhaling the crack fumes in homes where mothers were smoking heavily. And suddenly a disease that was rarely been seen at the hospital, babies born infected with syphilis, appeared in 160 cases last year. Doctors blame the rampant sexual activity of crack-addicted mothers. ''You are now seeing whole sections of society that are just not functioning,'' said Lenore Gittis, a lawyer in charge of the juvenile-rights division of the Legal Aid Society. ''Some of these families have been assaulted for generations, by problems of the economy, housing, crime and drugs. These were the people that were just hanging on. When crack hits them, they are knocked off the bottom rung.'' Into the Street, Then to the Morgue Yvonne Weeks, now 31, lived in a public housing project on 122d Street in Harlem with four children, supported by welfare checks and odd jobs, when she first tried crack. In the middle of 1986, she accepted the invitation of a man to go to a crack house, and within months her life dissolved into a swirl of smoking crack and raising money to buy more. To obtain crack, she let other addicts come to her apartment to smoke. In the middle of 1987, when city social workers arrived at her apartment to investigate a complaint that her children were being neglected, they found an apartment in which the electricity had been turned off and the rooms were stripped of furniture and occupied by more than a dozen men and women smoking crack. The refrigerator door was open, she recalled, and the stench of rotting food wafted through the air. The city placed her children with relatives. Ms. Weeks was evicted, went to live in a public shelter in Brooklyn and later entered a drug-treatment program. Others never try to save themselves at all. In one recent case, described by Joseph DeGenova, a social worker with Community Impact, a nonprofit agency in Morningside Heights, a Harlem woman had managed to care for her children for years although she was a heroin addict. After she became a crack addict last year, she disappeared onto the street where she obtained the drug in exchange for sex. ''I went to identify her at the morgue,'' Mr. DeGenova said. ''She died in a seizure. Her lips were bitten up. There was dried blood over her mouth. The woman weighed maybe 50 pounds.'' ''With heroin you would see a decline for five, six, eight years,'' Mr. DeGenova said. ''Crack is a crash-and-burn kind of thing.''

Beazer extended their $1.7 billion hostile bid for the Koppers Company until April 15, when a Federal court ruling is due on whether the offer violates securities laws. Mr. Beazer criticized the Koppers board of directors for not yet giving shareholders any advice on the $60-a-share offer, which has been on the table for two weeks. The board declared as inadequate Beazer's previous offers of $45 a share and $56 a share. As of Tuesday, 137,154 common shares out of the 28.5 million outstanding shares of Koppers had been tendered under the Beazer offer. In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Koppers shares rose 75 cents to close at $56.125. United States District Judge Maurice B. Cohill Jr. on Wednesday barred the Beazer group from proceeding with its offer until April 15, when he plans to rule on the defensive lawsuit filed by Koppers in Pittsburgh.

678-> MUSIC; Bach Chamber Soloists Offer a Birthday Salute
PIANO recitals and offbeat chamber programs help bring March to an intriguing musical close, starting today at 3 P.M., when the Bach Chamber Soloists offer a slightly late 303d birthday salute to their namesake composer. On the program at the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers are the G major Flute Sonata, two sinfonias, and the C major Trio Sonata of Bach, along with a Sonata for flute, violin and continuo by Bach's son, Carl Philipp Emanuel. The Bach Soloists - otherwise known as the flutist Susan Palma, the violinist Benjamin Hudson, the cellist Adriana Contino and the harpsichordist Spencer Carroll - have also chosen other works by Purcell, Biber and Telemann (963-4550). At the other end of the tonal spectrum from that Baroque lineup is the ''New Music Event,'' presented by the Neuberger Museum and also at 3 P.M. today, at Theatre B in the Performing Arts Center of the State University of New York at Purchase. The sponsors say that we may expect ''a collaboration between electric guitar sound sculptures, played by computer-controlled robotic arms, and human musicians'' (253-5133). The Uilleann Pipes of Ireland produce a more intimate, flexible sound than the more familiar Scottish bagpipes, and one of the masters of the instrument, Bill Ochs, is presenting a one-man show called ''The Ace and Deuce of Pipering.'' The free program at the White Plains Public Library, scheduled for today at 3 P.M., combines ''pipe music, songs, tin-whistle playing, stories and piping lore'' (682-4480). Returning to more frequently encountered instruments, we find flute, violin and French horn as the component parts of the Doansburg Chamber Ensemble, whose 4 P.M. recital at Saint James Episcopal Church in North Salem lists such oddities as an arrangement of the Andante from Mendelssohn's ''Reformation'' Symphony, and a Trio by Charles Ives, for which the performers have to station themselves at different positions in the church (669-5563). Two recitals featuring faculty artists of the Hoff-Barthelson School have been scheduled at overlapping times today. At 2:30 P.M., a ''community-outreach concert'' at Yonkers's South Presbyterian Church is presenting the flutists Eleanor Ball, Michelle Licea-Nover and Joseph Piscitelli in solo and ensemble pieces by Devienne, Hoffmeister, Purcell and Casterede; while at 4 o'clock, the pianist David Volckhausen plays Sonatas of Schubert and Prokofiev, plus shorter works by Liszt and Debussy at the School in Scarsdale (723-1169). Commuters are out of luck when it comes to attending Hudson Valley Music Club events, because they are scheduled for Mondays at 2 P.M. Other music lovers, however, should welcome the opportunity to hear the Casa Verde Trio performing tomorrow in the club's intimate chamber-music room at 54 Clinton Avenue in Dobbs Ferry. The members of this superb ensemble are the violinist Sarah Kwak, the cellist David Bakamjian and the pianist Gwendolyn Mok; their program features trios by Haydn, Mendelssohn and Joaquin Turina (693-1489). Another fine young pianist, the Jamaica-born Paul Shaw, makes his solo Westchester debut at the Emelin Theater Thursday at 8:30 P.M., his program ranging from Bach's Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue in D minor to Aaron Copland's 1930 Piano Variations. In between, come Schubert's B flat major Sonata and the Chopin B flat minor Scherzo (698-0098). The arrival of the Easter and Passover holidays effectively puts the concert season on hold for the next week or so, but a number of children's programs provide possibilities. At the Tarrytown Music Hall, for instance, the Paper Bag Players are moving in for a five-day stand, presenting ''Any Friend of Yours Is a Friend of Mine'' at 2 P.M. today; 10:30 A.M. tomorrow; 10:30 A.M. and noon on Tuesday; and 10:30 A.M. Wednesday and Thursday (631-3390). Meanwhile, the Emelin Theater is planning several children's programs for the following week: the life-size marionettes of Puppetworks will act out two delightful stories - ''The Frog Prince,'' to music of Kabalevsky, and Prokofiev's ''Peter and the Wolf'' - at 11 A.M. and 2 P.M. shows April 5 and 6. Then on April 9, again at 11 A.M. and 2 P.M., it is ''magic, chalk drawings, animal puppets and lots of fun'' with Edd Patterson's Magic Show (698-0098).

681-> T.V.A. Defends Layoff Plans
Top officials of the Tennessee Valley Authority sought to assure the Nuclear Regulatory Commission today that a major manpower reduction would not affect the struggling T.V.A. nuclear power program, although it is still plagued by technical problems. The appearance of the three-man T.V.A. board of directors before the Federal nuclear safety commission was intended to allay concern over the announced layoff of up to 7,000 of of the 34,000 employees of the government-owned electric power agency on July 1. The layoffs are a result of the cost of restoring the authority's crippled nuclear system. To verify their safe operating condition, all five T.V.A. nuclear reactors were shut down in 1985. Marvin T. Runyon, the T.V.A. board chairman named by President Reagan in January, said the layoffs were designed to cut costs and prevent another in a succession of steep consumer rate increases. Mr. Runyon said the layoffs were part of ''the terrible price'' still being paid by the T.V.A. and its residential and industrial customers for the agency's ''failure to devote adequate attention to its nuclear program.''

682-> Review/Jazz; An Avant-Garde Merger
The Knitting Factory's jazz festival encourages collaborations between musical schools that might not get together otherwise, and that is a good thing. The duet on last Saturday night by Elliott Sharp, a guitarist, saxophonist and composer, and Deidre Murray, a cellist and composer, represented the merging of the jazz avant-garde. Ms. Murray is a member of Henry Threadgill's Sextett and Mr. harp is one of the major downtown improvisors. At their second set, Mr. Sharp and Ms. Murray played four gritty, urban compositions that rarely gave an audience the benefit of more than a glimpse of a melody or a constant rhythm. Even on Ms. Murray's ''Calypso 3,'' an elegiac, soft-spoken composition, an edge appeared that wouldn't let the audience rest. Highly amplified - a listener could hear even the slightest movements of Ms. Murray's fingers on her strings, and the clapping of Mr. Sharp's pads on his bass clarinet. It was music without metaphor and it was the sound of New York: extreme, irritating, unsettled and hard to do without.

683-> Tandy Net Up 28.8% in Period
The Tandy Corporation reported today that its earnings rose by 28.8 percent in the final quarter of its fiscal year from the period a year earlier. The computer and consumer electronics company had net income of $57.2 million, or 64 cents a share, in the quarter, up from $44.4 million, or 49 cents a share, a year ago. Sales and operating revenues were up 10.4 percent, to $813.5 million, from $736.7 million a year earlier. For the year, Tandy reported net income of $316.4 million, or $3.54 a share, up 30.6 percent from $242.3 million, or $2.70 a share, in the fiscal year 1987. Sales and operating revenues were up 9.8 percent, to $3.79 billion, in the fiscal year ending June 30, from $3.45 billion the previous year.

684-> 3 Hurt as a Highway Chase Ends in Shootouts in Conn.
A Connecticut state trooper, a West Haven police officer and the man they were pursuing were wounded yesterday in two shootouts that ended a brief chase on Interstate 95 and through nearby woods in West Haven, the state police said. The trooper, John Kuncan, was shot at 5 P.M about half a mile from Exit 42, where the driver of a dark Camaro -fleeing the cars of two state troopers -left the highway. The second trooper, Robert Dinacola, found the wounded Trooper Kuncan at a West Haven intersection and then joined a local police officer, Keith Sweeney, in chasing the suspect on foot half a mile through the woods into town. In another shootout there, the suspect shot Officer Sweeney, and either Officer Sweeney or Trooper Dinacola shot the suspect, the state police said.

685-> You Could Look It Up, but You'd Be Wrong
If the Encyclopaedia Britannica says there's a dam on the Rappahannock River that's 194 feet high and 8,850 feet long, it must be true, right? Wrong. The Salem Church Dam has existed since 1944 - but only on paper, as a proposal by the Army Corps of Engineers. That tidbit somehow escaped editors of the Chicago-based encyclopaedia. The current edition, in its entry on the Rappahannock, describes how the dam impounds the river just upstream from Fredericksburg to help make hydroelectric power and control floods. ''The whole reason for the encyclopaedia is accuracy,'' said Larry Grinnell, a spokesman for the Britannica, ''but we are dealing with 44 million words, and we sometimes do make mistakes.'' Mr. Grinnell said the error would be corrected ''in the next update possible, which will not be earlier than 1990.''

687-> Cocoa Panel Will Meet
A panel of industry experts has scheduled a meeting next week to try to resolve a dispute between world cocoa producers and consumers over support prices, International Cocoa Organization officials said today. The dispute over support prices has paralyzed the group's operations since March. The organization, which tries to stabilize prices by buying and selling from a buffer stock, cannot intervene in the cocoa market until the two sides agree on what price range the pact should defend. A world cocoa surplus, aggravated by rising output by nonmembers, including Malaysia and Indonesia, meant this year's purchases failed to prevent prices from falling to their lowest level in nearly six years, commodity dealers said. The panel is scheduled to meet Wednesday through Friday next week.

688-> Big Drought Package for Farmers Clears Congress in Differing Bills
The Senate and the House of Representatives today approved differing versions of costly legislation that would provide direct payments to farmers hurt by this year's drought. The Department of Agriculture and the Congressional Budget Office estimate the cost of the House bill at roughly $4 billion and that of the Senate bill at up to $7 billion. In either case, the program would be by far the most expensive ever undertaken to aid Americans suffering financially from a natural calamity. But the drought that prompted the expense might pay for all of it. Because of rising grain prices resulting from the drought, Government income support payments to farmers will be less than projected this year, and the savings could total as much as $7 billion, according to preliminary estimates by the Agriculture Department. And it is these savings that would finance the various provisions approved by Congress today. White House Concern The vote in favor of the House bill was 368 to 29. Two hours later the Senate passed its version by 94 to 0. A conference committee is expected to meet early next week to resolve the differences. President Reagan has expressed support for the program, although he said earlier this week, without being specific, that he was worried about the cost of some provisions being considered in Congress. Today James C. Miller 3d, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, reiterated Mr. Reagan's concern. ''The President is firmly behind the drought legislation,'' Mr. Miller said. ''He wants to keep it pared down. Don't use the plight of the farmer as an opportunity to make a Christmas tree out of that bill.'' Reservations in Congress Like the President, Mr. Miller did not address specific provisions. But in debate in both chambers today, some lawmakers said they were concerned about how particular elements of the legislation would be perceived by the public. The House, for instance, eliminated a provision approved by the Agriculture Committee on Tuesday that would have raised the support price of milk by four cents a gallon for an indefinite period starting in October. Instead, the full House reached a compromise that would temporarily pay dairy farmers the extra four cents for only a three-month period, starting next April and ending in June. On the Senate side, there were reservations about the level of assistance contained in a provision dealing with livestock, poultry and fish farmers and also about a measure providing manufacturers of ethanol as much as 16 million bushels of low-priced Government corn every month until October 1989 to offset higher grain prices afflicting that industry. Both these provisions, however, ultimately passed. Key Provision In the key provision of both bills, farmers who had lost 35 percent or more of their crops to the drought would be eligible to receive as much as $100,000, the exact amount depending on the value of their loss. And both bills, for the first time in the 55 years that Congress has considered farm policy legislation, would exclude the largest and richest farms from participation. Crop farmers with $2 million or more in gross revenue this year would not be eligible for the aid, and the Senate bill would also exclude livestock farmers with gross revenue of $2.5 million or more. The most important distinction between the two bills - the one that accounts for almost all the difference in their price tags - concerns livestock, poultry and fish farmers. The Senate version would allow such a farmer in an eligible county to receive low-cost Government grain, or subsidies with which to buy grain on the open market, whether or not his farm produces its own grain. According to an estimate by the Agriculture Department, this Senate provision would cost $2 billion to $3 billion more than its counterpart House provision, which would give aid to livestock, poultry and fish farmers only if they grew their own grain. The cost of this House provision is estimated at far less than $1 billion. Farm industry experts from the House and the Senate, who are dealing only with estimates on the total size of the national harvest, do not know precisely how many individual farmers would be eligible for assistance under the relief bills. But virtually every livestock, poultry and fish farmer across the South, the Middle West and the Great Plains would be eligible for aid under the Senate bill. And hundreds of thousands of crop farmers would be eligible under both bills. Speedy Movement The relief bills' movement through Congress was rapid. Today's approval came only a month after they had first been proposed by Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont and Representative E. (Kika) de la Garza of Texas, Democrats who head their respective houses' agriculture committees. Lawmakers said privately that the speedy approval had been abetted not only by the severity of the drought but also by the political pressure of an election year. Reservations about some provisions notwithstanding, neither party wanted to be seen as impeding the flow of aid to the nation's parched farmlands, regions that have enough votes to be vital in November. The bills themselves are extremely rare in their nature. Although the Agriculture Department has offered programs of low-interest loans to farmers hurt financially by natural disasters ever since the 1930's, the only earlier direct-payment program in response to such a calamity was one authorized by Congress in 1986. And that program, to pay farmers for losses incurred in a Southern drought, cost only $633.9 million, a small fraction of the total that would be provided by either current bill. The activity on Capitol Hill today came as the number of counties designated by the Agriculture Department as drought disaster areas grew to 2,168, in 42 states. In 10 states, all counties have been so designated: North Dakota, Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio and Wisconsin.

689-> THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Hewlett-Packard Consolidates at Saatchi
The Hewlett-Packard Company, which last week ended its four-year relationship with Leo Burnett USA, Chicago, on good terms, has decided to consolidate its advertising for computing products at its other main agency, Saatchi & Saatchi DFS/ Compton, San Francisco. The new business amounts to about $20 million; the amount of the entire account was not disclosed. ''We've had an extensive relationship with Saatchi dating back to 1986,'' said Roy Verley, manager of corporate relations at Hewlett-Packard. ''And San Francisco is pretty much down the street from us.'' Hewlett-Packard is based in Palo Alto, about 40 miles away from the agency. The company makes computer products and electronic instruments. The segment that Saatchi will handle has annual sales of about $5 billion, and the company's total revenues are expected to reach $10 billion by year-end. The company says that the agency will handle advertising for about a third of its 50 divisions. In addition, Hewlett-Packard has announced the consolidation of its test and measurement account at Tallant/Yates Advertising, Denver, which had previously shared it with Saatchi & Saatchi DFS/Compton.

690-> Sports People; Round 4 for Leonard
In a news conference in Manhattan to confirm Nov. 7 as the date for his return to the ring, Sugar Ray Leonard said yesterday that he had something in common with Jason, the masked murderer in the ''Friday the 13th'' movies. ''We both keep coming back,'' he said. Leonard hopes his third comeback since 1984 will make him the first fighter to win titles in five weight classes. When he meets Donny Lalonde, the World Boxing Council light heavyweight champion, in Las Vegas, Nev., he will be seeking not only Lalonde's belt, but also the new W.B.C. super middleweight crown. Leonard has held titles in the welterweight, junior middleweight and middleweight divisions. ''People keep asking me why I continue to fight,'' Leonard said. ''It's quite simple. I enjoy it. I enjoy the challenge.'' Leonard is 32 years old, 5 feet 10 inches and 157 pounds ''after a good breakfast.'' Lalonde is 28, 6-2, and weighed the light heavyweight limit of 175 pounds for his last fight. The weight limit for the Nov. 7 bout is 168 pounds, the cutoff for the supermiddleweight division. Leonard said he will not try to bulk up for the 12-round fight. (AP)

691-> Boxing; Leonard Eager to Fight in Fall
Ray Leonard, who has not fought since winning the middleweight title from Marvelous Marvin Hagler in April 1987, expects to return to the ring before the end of the year. He will probably fight Don Lalonde, the World Boxing Council light-heavyweight champion. ''Lalonde is being seriously considered,'' Leonard said here today. ''I haven't seen a contract and I don't know what the procrastination is about. But I've told Mike Trainer I want to fight this year.'' Speaking from his office in Bethesda, Md., Trainer, who is Leonard's attorney, called speculation that a Lalonde-Leonard match would take place ''a reasonable assumption.'' In fact, sources said, the fight has been offered to casinos here and in Las Vegas, Nev. ''But first we have to have a contract that will be acceptable to Ray Leonard,'' said Trainer. One Fight, Two Titles If a deal for a Lalonde-Leonard bout can be struck, the fight would be staged for two titles: Lalonde's light-heavyweight (175-pound limit) crown and a newly created W.B.C. supermiddleweight (168-pound limit) division. Lalonde would reportedly agree to weigh no more than 168 pounds. Leonard said today he weighed 154 pounds. If Leonard were to beat Lalonde, he would become the first fighter in boxing history to win five titles. Leonard's rival, Thomas Hearns, became the first man to win four world titles when he beat Juan Roldan last October. Before beating Hagler, Leonard won welterweight and junior-middleweight titles. If Leonard were to fight Lalonde this year - Nov. 9 has been suggested as the date - Trainer said he expected to announce the match by next week. He and Leonard said there had been offers to fight opponents besides Lalonde. ''Opponents ranging from welterweight to light heavyweight,'' said Leonard. He did not name them. A Change of Plans In May 1987, less than two months after coming out of retirement to beat Hagler, Leonard announced he was retiring from boxing - for the third time. He retired in 1982 after surgery for a detached retina, and retired again in 1984 after a disappointing return victory over Kevin Howard. What brought about the latest change of heart? ''I want to do it because I can do it,'' said Leonard. ''If I wasn't physically or mentally able to, I wouldn't.'' Leonard was here to do the commentary for Home Box Office on the welterweight boxing doubleheader Friday. There will be title defenses by Lloyd Honeyghan, the W.B.C. champion, against Youngkil Chung of South Korea, and by the World Boxing Association champion, Marlon Starling, against Tomas Molinares of Colombia. Those fights are not the only title bouts scheduled for this weekend. On Saturday, Julian Jackson, the W.B.A. junior-middleweight champion, will face Buster Drayton here. On Sunday, James (Buddy) McGirt defends his International Boxing Federation junior-welterweight title against Howard Davis at the Felt Forum in New York. Waiting for Tyson Mickey Duff, co-promoter with Jarvis Astaire of the British heavyweight, Frank Bruno, said that even if Mike Tyson were to reconsider and agree to make his mandatory defense against Bruno in London on Sept. 3, it was probably too late for the fight to come off. ''At this point, Bruno feels he hasn't enough time to get in shape,'' said Duff. ''He's not taking the fight for just the money. He thinks he has a chance. Tyson kept him waiting too long.''

692-> 69 More Opponents Of Abortion Jailed In Atlanta Protests
Demonstrations by opponents of abortion led to the arrest of 69 more protesters today. Those arrested joined more than 120 other people in jail from anti-abortion demonstrations that began July 19 at the time of the Democratic National Convention. Fifty-three members of the group leading the demonstations, Operation Rescue, were arrested at Midtown Hospital, 12 at the Atlanta Women's Medical Center on the northside and four at the Atlanta SurgiCenter in midtown, said Tom Pocock, deputy director of the Atlanta Bureau of Corrections. In Florida, 133 anti-abortion demonstrators were arrested today at the conclusion of a three-day rally protesting the imprisonment of a colleague, Joan Andrews. The demonstrators blocked the entrance to one of the city's two abortion clinics. On Friday, about 300 demonstrators marched on the Florida Capitol seeking a clemency hearing for Ms. Andrews, who is serving a five-year sentence after being convicted of burglary in connection interfering with operations at a Pensacola abortion clinic in 1986. In Atlanta, the clinics where the demonstrations occurred are three of seven in the area that are licensed to perform abortions. Those arrested were charged with criminal trespass and giving a false name to the police. A total of 276 demonstrators have gone to jail since the protests began. Many Refuse to Give Names Many have refuse to give their names. Other arrested protesters have been released by disclosing their names and posting $500 bond or being released on their own recognizance. The group will continue pressing for the release of the jailed demonstrators under the names ''Baby Jane Doe'' and ''Baby John Doe,'' the names that many of those arrested have given, said a spokeswoman for the group, Dawn Stover. The jailed demonstrators have said they are willing to plead guilty to criminal trespass charges under their aliases. Prosecutors said this would compromise the criminal justice system. The leader of Operation Rescue, Randall Terry, was among those arrested. He was charged with being a party to a crime, Mr. Pocock said. Mr. Terry has said his group would fill the jails as hundreds of supporters would arrive in Atlanta in the next few weeks. One minister who was arrested and released said Friday that he and other ministers would return with members of their congregations. ''We'll most likely be back with 200 to 300 others if that's what it takes,'' said the Rev. David Diamond of Baton Rouge, La.

693-> Tests Show Shroud of Turin To Be Fraud, Scientist Hints
A scientist associated with the Vatican-sponsored analysis of the Shroud of Turin hinted broadly yesterday that the reputed burial cloth of Jesus has been proved to be a medieval forgery. A spokesman for the three laboratories that recently analyzed samples of the relic is expected to make an announcement regarding the shroud's authenticity about a week from today, according to the scientist, the Rev. Robert Dinegar. Dr. Dinegar, an Episcopal priest who is also a professor of chemistry at the University of New Mexico at Los Alamos, was one of the main organizers of the recent scientific effort to determine the shroud's authenticity. Although Dr. Dinegar refused to say directly in a telephone interview what the results of the analyses had been, he said he knew what they were. He took note of recent press reports in Britain that scientists at Oxford University had determined that the linen shroud was about 1,300 years too new to have been used to wrap the body of Jesus. No Denial of Report ''The Times of London reported on Aug. 27 that Oxford scientists had leaked that result,'' Dr. Dinegar said. ''If that report had been false, the scientists named in it would have denied it, but they did not. You must understand that all of us involved in the project are bound by signed undertakings that we will not reveal the results of the analysis until they are announced by the Archbishop of Turin or his scientific adviser, Luigi Gonella.'' Dr. Gonella and the scientists involved in the shroud project will meet Oct. 22 to discuss future work on the relic, ''by which time, of course, the public announcement will have been made,'' Dr. Dinegar said. Dr. Dinegar gave his first hints about the laboratory findings in an interview with The Los Angeles Times published yesterday. The Shroud of Turin is a yellow strip of linen about 14 feet long by 3 feet wide, on which is imprinted the brownish negative image of a scourged and crucified man. Since the cloth first came to light at a new church in Lirey, France, in the mid-1350's, it has been a source of controversy. Devotees have insisted that the scorched image was created by some kind of holy fire when Jesus' body miraculously disappeared from the Holy Sepulcher. As early as 1389, however, Bishop Pierre D'Arcis reported to Pope Clement VII that the shroud was a fraud, the perpetrator of which had confessed. Agreement on Dating In the 1970's forensic scientists representing many institutions and academic disciplines proposed various ways by which the controversy might be settled. There was general agreement that if the cloth in the shroud could be positively dated as having been made in medieval times, the relic could be declared a forgery. If, on the other hand, the cloth dated from the time of Jesus, the shroud might still be a forgery, but at least its authenticity could not be ruled out. The best method for determining the age of the linen appeared to be based on a measurement of the amount of radioactive carbon 14 in the material compared with the amount of ordinary carbon 12. In living animals and plants, the ratio of carbon 12 to carbon 14 remains more or less constant, but once an organism dies, the carbon 14 decays over time at a constant rate. From this rate, scientists can calculate the approximate time since the death of the organism, in this case, the flax plants from which the linen of the shroud was made. In 1984, scientists participating in the Shroud of Turin Research Project agreed on a procedure to remove and analyze a few postage-stamp-sized samples from the edges of the shroud. The procedure called for analysis by six independent laboratories using two methods of carbon-dating. Number of Samples Reduced After much negotiation, the Vatican authorities agreed to permit sampling and analysis of the shroud, but this January, they reduced the proposed number of shroud samples from six to three. In so doing, one method of carbon-dating that uses radiation counters was ruled out. All three samples, the Vatican decreed, were to be tested using nuclear accelerators to measure carbon 14 ratios. This decision prompted strong criticism from some scientists, on the ground that two analytical techniques would have afforded a cross-check of the accuracy of results. The institutions selected to make independent accelerator determinations were Oxford University, the University of Arizona and the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, Switzerland. ''This kind of analysis,'' Dr. Dinegar said, ''can be expected to produce results within 100 years of the correct age of the sample.'' According to The Times of London report, the dates determined by all three laboratories were close enough together to confirm each other and to establish the date of the shroud as about 1350.

694-> Alter the Catholic Church's Tax Status?
In 1979, lawyers working with the National Abortion Rights Action League began presenting the Internal Revenue Service with scores of anti-abortion documents that had been distributed by groups connected with the Roman Catholic Church. The lawyers contended that these newsletters, leaflets, questionnaires, reports and articles proved that the church had systematically violated the law forbidding tax exempt institutions from participating in campaigns for elective office or devoting a substantial amount of their activities to influencing legislation. Almost 25 years ago, the I.R.S. revoked the tax exempt status of Christian Echoes, a nonprofit religious organization, on the very same grounds. Eight years later, the United States Court of Appeals in Denver agreed, ruling that the I.R.S.'s action had not violated the provision of the First Amendment protecting the free exercise of religion. The court said the tax agency's revocation was constitutional because, while the exercise of religion was indeed a right that is fully protected by the First Amendment, tax exemption is a privilege that is granted by the Federal Government under a set of rules established by law. The court found that Christian Echoes had sought to influence Congress on dozens of issues, among them a nuclear test ban treaty, civil rights legislation, Medicare and proposals to withdraw the United States from the United Nations. In addition, the Court of Appeals said Christian Echoes had intervened in political campaigns by attacking John F. Kennedy and J. W. Fulbright, and supporting Barry Goldwater and Strom Thurmond. Essentially, then, the I.R.S. must confront again the question: does the Catholic Church's fight against legal abortion put it at variance with its tax exempt status? One of the submitted newsletters, printed by a Catholic church in Pennsylvania, listed political candidates for state and national elections who ''favor life.'' There were articles written by a Minnesota priest, the ''diocesan pro-life director,'' endorsing specific candidates. There was a Missouri news report about the official newspaper of the local archdiocese that had refused to sell advertising space to a Congressional candidate whose position on abortion was unacceptable to the church. In 1981, a large group of organizations favoring abortion rights sued the Roman Catholic Church, the I.R.S., the agency's head and the Secretary of the Treasury. The organizations charged that the church was violating the law of tax exemption by repeatedly using tax exempt contributions to intervene in political campaigns. They also charged that the Treasury Department and the I.R.S. had ''consistently overlooked these violations and failed and refused to perform their statutory duty to enforce the Code and the Constitution.'' To buttress their case, the abortion groups quoted extensively from ''A Pastoral Plan for Pro-Life Activities,'' adopted by both the United States Catholic Conference and the National Conference of Catholic Bishops in November 1975. One section of the plan called for the creation of Congressional ''pro-life'' action groups that would ''work for qualified candidates who will vote for a constitutional amendment and other pro-life issues.'' They also cited many specific instances of the church's direct involvement in political campaigns. In September 1980, for example, Humberto Cardinal Medeiros, as Roman Catholic Archbishop of Boston, attacked two Congressional candidates in a letter sent to 410 parishes a few days before a primary election. The letter was read from many pulpits and published in the official archdiocese paper. This case has been bogged down by some legal technicalities. More the shame since the extraordinarily sensitive questions raised by the plaintiffs deserve to be answered. Allowing them to go unanswered damages the rule of law, public respect for the tax system and the reputation of the I.R.S. Three questions stand out: Doesn't the evidence in this and a fair number of other cases involving tax exemption suggest that the nation's laws granting such exemptions are especially difficult to administer in an even-handed way? Do we not know from other areas of law enforcement that when agencies are asked to enforce murky, hard-to-understand, ambiguous laws, it damages the agencies' overall effectiveness? The time is long overdue for a serious attempt by all concerned groups to devise a straightforward way to regulate tax exempt organizations that can be understood by all interested parties: the public, the I.R.S. and those who are tax exempt. Because the case is pending, the I.R.S. declined comment. But in Congressional testimony in 1987, Commissioner Lawrence B. Gibbs said that current laws governing tax exemptions include so many ambiguities and nuances that they had become a ''seedbed for taxpayer controversy.'' He added that some recent changes in the basic legal problems, a situation that ''adversely affects our ability to administer the law evenhandedly.'' This is hardly a new problem. In 1934, Senator Bob La Follette, a leading Progressive of his age, was so pessimistic about the fair application of tax exempt laws that he said, ''It is my judgment that we never shall get away from mistakes in administration and from decisions which seem like favoritism until all contributions to organizations of this kind are made subject to the income tax.'' Senator La Follette's solution probably would strike most church leaders and foundation executives as equivalent to the notion of burning down the village in order to save it. But if all the concerned parties would abandon piecemeal reform and come together in a good faith effort to develop new ways to regulate tax exempt dollars, I am convinced that less drastic and more effective remedies could be developed.

697-> AT THE MOVIES
Off to a Fast Start When Harry Hook looks back over his 29 years, he finds nothing that points clearly to what he has become now - a film maker with one movie, ''The Kitchen Toto,'' opening today, and another, ''Lord of the Flies,'' scheduled to go before the cameras on the island of Jamaica in August. As a child growing up in Kenya, where he lived off and on from the age of 4 until he went back to England to attend college, he was interested in zoology. ''I kind of slid into photography and further into film making,'' Mr. Hook said. ''It was no childhood ambition to make films. I hardly ever saw films when I was a kid.'' While he was studying photography in London, he said, ''it just seemed more interesting to put all the pictures together to tell a story.'' The producer Lewis Allen, who owns the rights to ''Lord of the Flies'' and whose wife, Jay Presson Allen, wrote the screenplay based on the William Golding novel, backed Mr. Hook's graduate film - about an English boy's conflict with his father - at Britain's National Film School. And Mr. Allen chose Mr. Hook to direct ''Lord of the Flies'' on the basis of ''The Kitchen Toto.'' By the time Mr. Hook was 23, he had written the screenplay for ''The Kitchen Toto,'' which is about two boys, one black, one white, and their relationship during the 1950's at the beginning of the political unrest that was to lead to the end of British colonial rule in Kenya. Mr. Hook said that as a boy, he worked for people who had been involved in the events of that time, and he listened to their stories. ''It seemed to be the most potent time of Kenya's history,'' he said. ''So I sort of got carried away with it and wrote the screenplay.'' But it took several more years before financial backing could be found to enable Mr. Hook to direct the film. ''Essentially it's about children in a conflict,'' he said. ''but it's not about the conflict. It's about how, really, innocence gets drawn into a conflict, how it involves children and how they're the first to get hurt.'' As for ''Lord of the Flies,'' a tale of children creating their own society, Mr. Hook said: ''I think it's a very potent piece of literature. I do think it has enormous scope for new interpretation.'' He is well aware that the British director Peter Brook made a film version in 1963. ''I hate to think of it as a remake,'' Mr. Hook said of his own endeavor. ''Rather it's a new stab at it. I really do respect Peter Brook's film.'' He said of the story: ''It's about people really on their own, seen in conflict, creating a microcosm of society away from the trappings of mechanical things. That's just what I'm interested in, people in an element where they can't rely on machinery and things, and the conflict comes from their nature.'' In the new version, he said, the children will be American, not English: ''When the book was written, England had a huge global responsibility, I suppose, in the sense that the way it behaved had an impact on the world.'' Now, he said, ''the way America behaves in world politics is important.'' Plans call for ''Lord of the Flies,'' financed by Rob Reiner's Castle Rock company, to be distributed by Columbia Pictures next summer, Mr. Hook said. A New Kazan Project While Mr. Hook is making his debut as a director, Elia Kazan - whose screen credits include no less than ''A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,'' ''Viva Zapata!,'' ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' and ''On the Waterfront'' - is preparing to direct his first film since ''The Last Tycoon,'' which opened in 1976. Mr. Kazan, who has been making news these days with his autobiography, ''A Life,'' said his new movie -''Beyond the Aegean'' - would be based on a work of fiction. ''A while ago,'' he said, ''I wrote a novel that I didn't revise or work further on. My son Chris got hold of it and made a screenplay out of it, which I liked.'' Mr. Kazan said the producers Gene Kirkwood and Anatole Daumon liked it, too, so once the casting is finished - and right now, Mr. Kazan said, the casting is ''nowhere'' - filming of ''Beyond the Aegean'' will begin. ''I wrote it about four or five years ago,'' Mr. Kazan said of the story. ''It relates generally to my family, but it's not about me at all. It's about the old people in my family, the ones way back in the early part of the century'' - a tale of immigration to America from the Middle East that is akin to his novels ''America, America'' and ''The Anatolian.'' Another Career at 50? By rights, Will Mackenzie should be having a couple of parties this month. On July 20, if all goes according to schedule, he can celebrate wrapping up the filming of his first feature -''Worth Winning,'' a 20th Century-Fox production starring Mark Harmon. And on July 24, he can clelebrate his 50th birthday. In both cases, Mr. Mackenzie's outlook should stand him in good stead. ''Basically, I look at life with a comic eye,'' he said. ''It makes life a lot easier to tolerate.'' Mr. Mackenzie acted in musicals and Joseph Papp productions in New York, began his career as a director in summer stock and New Jersey productions and then, about a dozen years ago, moved to California. There, he appeared on Bob Newhart's series as an actor, directed some episodes and went on to direct episodes of ''WKRP in Cincinnati,'' ''Bosom Buddies,'' ''Family Ties'' and ''Moonlighting,'' picking up some Emmy nominations and Directors Guild awards along the way. Mr. Mackenzie said he knew Mark Harmon both professionally and socially. ''We'd always sort of made a pact we'd work together some day,'' Mr. Mackenzie said. And one day a few months back, Mr. Mackenzie was having lunch with an executive on the Paramount Pictures lot, when Mr. Harmon, who was finishing work on ''The Presidio,'' came by and asked if he'd like to look at a script. ''I read it and absolutely loved it,'' Mr. Mackenzie said. ''Worth Winning,'' the work of Josann McGibbon and Sara Parriott, should be in the theaters next spring. It is a comedy about a bachelor (Mr. Harmon) who likes to gamble and bets his best friend that within the next three months he can become engaged to any three women his friend names. ''Then the women find out about it,'' Mr. Mackenzie said. ''They seek total revenge. Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.'' ''This is the kind of thing I love to do,'' he said. ''I love romantic comedies.''

698-> State by State; Pennsylvanians Search For Lesser of Two Evils
The young waiter said he would probably vote for Vice President Bush in November because of Mr. Bush's knowledge of the ways of Washington. But he added, ''To tell you the absolute truth, I'm not so much leaning toward anyone as leaning away from someone.'' Frank Lucchino, who had asked the waiter whom he liked, noddded his head. That lesser-of-two-evils approach, he said, ''is typical of the way people in this state are reacting.'' Mr. Lucchino, the Allegheny County Controller, is a Democrat. He will be one of the favorites in next year's mayoral race in Pittsburgh. He would like to see his party's Presidential candidate, Michael S. Dukakis, carry Pennsylvania and win the White House. But so far, he said, ''Dukakis hasn't managed to recapture the fire and commitment he showed at the convention.'' ''The public expects passion and responds well to it,'' Mr. Lucchino said. ''But it doesn't much like the kind of petulance it's getting. I have the sense that we're watching a pair of computer campaigns. If the computer says 'pay attention to Pennsylvania,' they do, but only for a few minutes. If its says 'talk about weapons,' they work up some one-liners to cover that.'' Momentum is Clear It is not at all clear who will carry the Keystone State, with its 25 electoral votes - one Dukakis staff member says it will be decided by 1 percent, one way or the other - but it is clear who has the momentum. The Vice President's own polls showed Mr. Dukakis well ahead six weeks ago. But a new survey for the Pennsylvania State Education Association, which is backing Mr. Dukakis, shows the Massachusetts Governor with only a three-point lead, according to a report in The Philadelphia Inquirer that was confirmed by association officials. Pennsylvania is closely balanced in partisan terms, with a Democratic Governor, two Republican Senators and a Congressional delegation of 12 Democrats and 11 Republicans. The Republicans have carried the state in three of the last five Presidential contests, losing it to Hubert H. Humphrey in 1968 and Jimmy Carter in 1976. This is a large and rather complex state, with two large metropolitan areas centered on Pittsburgh and Philadelphia; a lovely, underpopulated mountain hinterland and a lot of small cities, like Harrisburg and Altoona and Williamsport, site of the annual Little League World Series. A Historical Split Pittsburgh and the rest of southwestern Pennsylvania usually goes Democratic, and the rusting mills and unemployment lines in gritty towns like Donora, which produced Stan Musial, and Beaver Falls, which produced Joe Namath, all but guarantee that it will do so this time. Southeastern Pennsylvania is another story; the Democrats customarily carry Philadelphia, but that city's sprawling suburbs usually tip the region to the Republicans. Both of the Vice President's campaign visits to Pennsylvania so far have taken him into the vote-rich area immediately west, northwest and north of Philadelphia. He was in York last week, and Monday he was in southern Bucks County at Bensalem. Senator Arlen Specter, who introduced Mr. Bush at Bensalem, said beforehand that ''he had expected trouble in Pennsylvania, but now he's finding clover here.'' Some Democrats argue that the contest in Pennsylvania was always close, no matter what the early polls showed. State Senator H. Craig Lewis of Bucks County, who is active in the Dukakis campaign, said ''the professionals looking at those numbers knew you couldn't take them seriously.'' An Unsettled Situation But the impression persists that the Democrats' edge in registration and Mr. Dukakis's moderate approach should have given him the edge in a state full of ethnic voters who, as a character in a Democratic commercial here puts it, are not real Republicans even though they voted for President Reagan. ''This should be a Democratic state,'' said Elsie Hillman, a member of the Republican National Committee who is a distant relative of Mr. Bush. ''But we usually pull it out. It's still very volatile this time, with a big bloc of undecided votes. Even a lot of people who think they've made up their minds really haven't, and the debate on Sunday may convince them to change. ''We have a shot at the state, which suprises me. George has finally gotten out from under his commitment to be the perfect Vice President, and now he can try to put across his own dreams instead of someone else's. The person I see in public these days is the one that I used to see within the family.'' If Mr. Bush could do as well in the debates as he did in his acceptance speech in New Orleans, Mrs. Hillman thinks he would be ''most of the way home.'' But she fears that Mr. Dukakis's debating skills make that kind of outcome highly unlikely. 'Call Me on Monday' Another political figure who is eagerly awaiting the first debate, which will take place in Winston-Salem, N.C., is Meyer Berger, a longtime Democratic activist and money-raiser. At the moment, ''the thing is in a state of suspended animation,'' he said. ''When I called a guy for a check the other day, he told me, 'Call me back on Monday, and we'll see about it.' '' John Craig, editor of The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, said that his paper had received surprisingly little mail about the Bush-Dukakis contest. His guess, he said, is that the statewide poll the paper will take next week with The Philadelphia Daily News ''will show the thing more or less even here.'' ''Bush did amazingly well, at the convention,'' Mr. Craig said. ''But I'm inclined to think people are disposed to vote for a change with Dukakis if he said anything. Trouble is, he isn't saying much about dealing with the deficit or about handling the new situation in the Soviet Union. I think a lot of people were misled during the primary season into thinking that there was a lot more to the Dukakis campaign than there really is.''

699-> THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Point-of-Purchase Magazine Sets Debut
P-O-P Times, a magazine devoted to the point-of-purchase industry, will bring out its first issue next month. The magazine, from Hoyt Publishing of Chicago, will be sent free to 15,000 people in marketing. Beginning in January, it will be issued bimonthly. POPAI News, a magazine of the point-of-purchase trade association, is believed to be the only other publication in the field. The first issue of P-O-P Times, which is already completed, has 56 pages, with 50 pages of advertising. Peter W. Hoyt, the 29-year-old president of Hoyt Publishing, is the magazine's publisher. ''We exceeded our highest goal,'' said Mr. Hoyt, who said he had expected 48 ad pages at most. A black-and-white tabloid page will cost $2,915, and a four-color page is $3,900.

700-> About New York Extra! Extra! Get Yer L'Equipe On 42d Street
A young West African businessman, recently arrived from Paris, hurriedly leafed through the pages of L'Equipe, the daily bible of French sports fanatics. After a minute's search, furtively executed to avoid the inevitable cry, ''Please don't open the papers,'' he located the craved soccer scores. Grabbing a copy of a weekly on Africa, Jeune Afrique, the businessman joined a line of customers who had come in search of other hard-to-find publications, say, Polish Engineering, or Enigma from Yugoslavia, Accessori, the Italian fashion magazine, or VSD, a Parisian entertainment paper. They say you can't go home again. Perhaps, but for out-of-towners from Georgia to Guyana, from Singapore to Seattle, Hotalings News Agency, a Times Square institution since 1926 that struggles to carry whatever paper or magazine you might want - as long as it is not from New York - is the next best thing. On 42d Street, between Broadway and the Avenue of the Americas, tucked between an ''adult entertainment'' emporium and a nondescript deli, Hotalings, while not quite a home, is an umbilical cord to hordes of new and converted New Yorkers. Since its founding in 1905 by Arthur Hotaling (pronounced HO-taling), the store has often moved, but since it came to Times Square in 1926, specializing in out-of-town newspapers, it has retained a grip on its clientele. ''We've had customers coming in for years and years and years,'' said Arthur G. Hotaling, the 38-year-old grandson of the founder, who now runs the store with two sisters. ''Some of them even knew my grandfather,'' who died in 1941. Since he began working in the store 11 years ago, Mr. Hotaling said the clientele has gradually changed. ''It used to be mostly Western Europeans'' or people interested in Europe, he said. ''Now we get a lot more people from Latin America and the third world.'' Paris Match, a perennial favorite, among more than 600 foreign publications, is now usually outsold by West Africa, a London weekly. As the demographics of the city have changed and as Times Square has gone to seed, Mr. Hotaling said, the client mix has become more working-class. ''We don't get the crowds from the theater district anymore,'' Mr. Hotaling said. ''People don't roam in Times Square like they used to.'' Celebrities like Joanne Woodward and Cyd Charisse, who Mr. Hotaling said once haunted the bulging racks of the store to keep up on fashion or cinema news from Europe or Hollywood gossip, have given way to people like the Rev. Al Sharpton, who buys The Poughkeepsie Journal (one of 220 American newspapers sold) to monitor the Tawana Brawley story, and the popular rap music group Run-DMC, whose members sometimes come in to buy photo or music magazines. Aspiring glitterati, stunning young fashion models who come in search of their own pictures in magazines like Uomo or French Vogue, and designers from the nearby garment district are also common. Whatever they come searching for, clients are nothing if not constant, arriving faithfully on Mondays for Sunday papers from San Francisco or Chicago, or on Tuesdays, when most foreign weeklies are restocked. Jorge Chacon, a Roman Catholic priest from Colombia, found browsing recently through the enormous selection of Spanish language publications, is typical in his devotion to the foreign press. ''I found out about this place by accident, years ago, when I happened to walk by,'' said Mr. Chacon, who lives and works in New Jersey. ''I've been coming back ever since. I drive in on my days off and pick up the papers.'' Explaining his expensive taste for Colombian papers, Mr. Chacon said, ''Like anyone else, I like to know what is happening back home.'' ''Even during a recession we do well,'' Mr. Hotaling said. ''People come in looking for jobs around the country.'' ''We make money on people's disasters too,'' he explained somewhat apologetically. ''A plane crashes in Detroit, everybody wants the Detroit papers.'' On the lighter side, Mr. Hotaling said, the store also does well during the World Series, political conventions or after a marathon, the Tour de France or the World Cup soccer championship. Marvelling at the quietude that descends over his diverse clientele when they begin their compulsive browsing, Mr. Hotaling said, ''one thing that has always surprised me is that they have always managed to get along well.'' ''Considering that means Arabs and Jews, Greeks and Turks,'' and others not known for getting along, Mr. Hotaling said, ''that's no small accomplishment.''

701-> Review/Dance; Jose Greco and Family
The Jose Greco Company, which opened a two-week engagement Tuesday night at the Joyce Theater, could just as easily have been called Jose Greco and Family. It is headed by Mr. Greco, the Italian-born, Brooklyn-raised dancer whose name was virtually synonymous with Spanish dance for American audiences of the 1950's and 60's. Featured dancers include three of his children: Lola Greco, Carmela Greco and Jose Greco 2d. Lola and Carmela Greco are also responsible for some of the choreography and the troupe's musical director is Jose Luis Greco, another of Jose Greco's sons. The great Spanish dancer turns 70 this December. But he has not lost his authority. That was evident at the very start of the program in ''Barroco Espanol,'' which he choreographed in collaboration with Nana Lorca, who is also his wife. Wearing a costume designed by Freddy Wittop that included red boots and a red-and-black cape, he did not simply enter the space, he commanded it. And he was soon joined by his dancing children, who revealed that they are maintaining the family tradition of showmanship. Later, the entire company gave a rousing account of ''El Jaleo,'' staged by Goyo Montero, the troupe's artistic director, and Carmela Greco was impressive in ''Solea,'' which she choreographed to music for voice and guitars performed live by Jesus Heredia, Jose Cortes and Jose de Salinas. She was certainly a stormy presence in this solo. However, she also gave the impression of straining for some of her effects. Indeed, the company at present tends to dance with more enthusiasm than subtlety, and although its presentations are varied in nature and ambitious in their intentions, they are choreographically uneven. Because of its casting, the most unusual offering was Lola Greco's ''Honra (Bitter Pride),'' based upon ''The House of Bernarda Alba,'' Federico Garcia Lorca's classic Spanish play about the way a strong-minded woman dominates her daughters. That play has served as inspiration for innumerable choreographic works in many dance idioms. What made this one out of the ordinary was the fact that, just as grotesque female roles in classical ballet are sometimes interpreted by men, so the role of the tyrannical mother was danced in the Spanish style by Jose Greco. A fearsome matriarch he was, and the choreography ingeniously used stamping rhythms to indicate both the mother's determination and the daughters' rage and frustration. Unfortunately, because plot development remained cloudy, the protracted stamping grew monotonous rather than dramatically expressive. Felipe Sanchez based ''Times of Goya'' on images from the paintings of the Spanish artist. Like ''Honra,'' it got off to a strong start, but failed to surpass some of its initial choreographic images. Mr. Montero's ''Torero'' suffered from a similar weakness. In this character study, Jose Greco 2d was a young matador preparing for a bullfight, and the choreography showed him saying farewell to his friends and his beloved (Lola Greco) and finally entering the arena. That entrance should have been a memorable image of fear, courage and resolution. The fact that, in reality, it was not as striking as one hoped it would be suggests both that the choreographer may have faltered here and that the cast was so forceful at the outset that no one could build to the dramatic climax the piece required. Mr. Montero's ''Madrid 1890'' depicted flirts and dandies strolling through a park. Although Fausto Rios was ebullient as a vendor, some of the dancers overpunched the choreographic jokes so that the work's comedy seemed labored. This company has no problem with energy. But it will be even more satisfying when its members devote more attention to fine dynamic shadings.

702-> Charges Stand in Arms Case
A Federal judge refused today to dismiss criminal charges against a former C.I.A. agent accused of conspiring to illegally ship arms to the rebels in Nicaragua and of concealing the covert operation. District Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr. denied a motion to dismiss the charges against Joseph F. Fernandez, who contended that the Congressional testimony he gave under a limited grant of immunity from prosecution was improperly used against him by prosecutors. But the judge directed Lawrence E. Walsh, the independent prosecutor, to submit by Sept. 23 detailed documentation to show that his evidence against Mr. Fernandez was obtained independently of testimony the former agent gave to the House-Senate committees investigating the Iran-contra affair. Mr. Fernandez, 51 years old, who operated under the pseudonym Tomas Castillo when he was the Central Intelligence Agency's station chief in Costa Rica, is accused of conspiring to ship arms to the rebels in defiance of a Congressional ban on such aid. He is also charged with lying to the C.I.A. and the Presidential commission headed by former Senator John Tower that investigated the Iran-contra affair. The judge also ordered Mr. Fernandez to comply with the provisions of the Classified Information Procedures Act, refusing to declare unconstitutional the statute that requires defendants to notify the court of any plans to reveal Government secrets at trial. Thomas E. Wilson, the defense lawyer, contended at a hearing earlier this week that because Mr. Fernandez operated under the cloak of C.I.A. secrecy, there would be a wealth of documents he would be entitled to use to defend himself against the charges. The requirement that specific notice be given for secrets that the defense wants to disclose would unfairly tip prosecutors to defense strategy, he said. But the judge said the court had authority to modify the Classified Information Procedures Act's requirements if necessary.

703-> Review/Music; Steve Forbert's Folk-Rock
When Steve Forbert arrived on the New York folk-music scene more than a decade ago, the singer and songwriter from Meridian, Miss., was greeted by a tide of critical enthusiasm that painted him as a real-life Huckleberry Finn transplanted into the contemporary pop world. Great things were predicted for a young performer who quipped in his musical self-introduction ''What Kinda Guy?'': I might be leavin' but the door ain't shut I'm here for lovin' but I ain't no slut. Ten years after releasing his debut album, ''Alive on Arrival,'' Mr. Forbert is pretty much the same artistic creature that he was then. Although he didn't grow into a star comparable to Elvis Presley or Bob Dylan, he has continued to write and record easygoing songs that hover on the borders of folk, country and rock, singing them in an affably conversational voice embedded in which is an appealing croak. The essence of Mr. Forbert's sensibility hasn't changed notably over the years. At heart he has always been an introspective, homespun philosopher who muses out loud in folksy vignettes that show him to be at once ingenuous and canny. His best recent songs, like ''Search Your Heart,'' one of the high points of his Bottom Line show on Monday, talk simply and unpretentiously about life's ups and downs. If Mr. Forbert hasn't become a major folk-pop hero, neither has he lost his freshness on the stage. Accompanied by a strong four-man band, he threw himself into the music with a good-natured delight that the years haven't quelled. Cindy Lee Berryhill, the San Diego-based folk singer who opened for Mr. Forbert, writes and sings amusingly direct songs about contemporary life.

705-> SPORTS PEOPLE; Williams Stricken
Doug Williams, the Washington Redskins quarterback, was hopsitalized after practice yesterday for tests after having experienced abdominal pains and later underwent surgery for acute appendicitis. He is expected to be out at least for weeks, the team said. In his place, the starter for Sunday's game against the Cardinals in Phoenix will be Mike Rypien, a second-year player from Washington State who has never taken a snap in a regular-season game. The club also said it was trying to sign David Archer, the former Falcon. . . . Coach Mike Shanahan of the Los Angeles Raiders made official Wednesday what he had implied two days earlier: Jay Schroeder will be his team's starting quarterback against Denver next Monday night. ''He does have experience,'' Shanahan said. ''He's 24-7 as a starter. We would not trade Jim Lachey to get a backup.'' Schroeder, 27 years old, was traded by the Washington Redskins for Lachey and two draft choices Sept. 5. Schroeder replaces Steve Beuerlein, 23, who had gone all the way at quarterback in the Raiders' three games, completing 42 of 91 passes for 675 yards and 5 touchdowns with 2 interceptions and 14 sacks.(AP)

706-> Studs Terkel's Busy Year
In China, 1988 is the Year of the Dragon; in literary America, it's the Year of the Terkel. Studs. ''Everything's happening at once,'' Studs Terkel said the other day. ''And at my age, too. Figure it out, I was born in 1912.'' In the Year of the Terkel, the 1985 Pulitzer Prize-winning author (for '' 'The Good War,' '' his study of World War II in the voices of its participants) has a new oral history coming out early next month from Pantheon Books called ''The Great Divide: Second Thoughts on the American Dream.'' Moviegoers are also seeing the Chicagoan as an actor in ''Eight Men Out,'' playing the wisecracking Hugh Fullerton, the Chicago reporter who helped break the story of the 1919 Black Sox scandal. In the movie Hugh Fullerton looks and sounds a lot like Studs Terkel playing Hugh Fullerton. Radio, TV and a Full-Time Job His familiar voice - throaty, high-spirited and conversational - can also be heard narrating ''The Good Fight,'' the current PBS documentary about the activities of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade in the Spanish Civil War. A play based on Mr. Terkel's autobiography, ''Talking to Myself,'' is now being staged at the Northlight Theater in Evanston, Ill., in an adaptation by Paul Sills. And then, of course, he holds down a full-time job: a daily hourlong radio program of interviews, commentary and music on WFMT, Chicago's fine-arts station, a program syndicated nationally. As Chicago As the Water Tower Louis Terkel, who was born in New York City, is nicknamed after another colorful Chicagoan, James T. Farrell's fictional Studs Lonigan. He has become as permanent a symbol of Chicago as the Water Tower. With his plaid shirts and breezy manner, he gives the impression that he's a gentleman-roughneck, a character; but looks are deceiving. Hidden behind the Studs facade is an intellectual - he has a philosophy degree and a law degree from the University of Chicago. In his spacious house on a neighborly street in Chicago, where he lives with his wife, Ida, Mr. Terkel recently talked to a visitor about baseball, his method of writing oral history, and the divisions in American life today. ''As Fats Waller used to say,'' he said, '' 'Give me another drink and I'll tell you all you want to know.' '' What 'Second Thoughts'? What did he mean by ''second thoughts'' in the subtitle of his new book? ''In the last three years I've met young guys whose idea of the American dream is so different from the people who came over from the Old World,'' he said. ''The immigrants wanted their kids to have a better life than they had. Now, kids say that they're not going to be as well off as their folks. ''People who thought they were middle class began to accept middle-class values as their values. They accepted someone else's ideas about what they are. In my book, you find steel workers and farmers out of work, but still liking Ronald Reagan. During the Depression, people who lived in shacks called them Hoovervilles, but I never heard anyone call them Reaganvilles.'' 'A Great Divide' in America One universal attitude he found was that young people did not have a sense of history about the American past. ''There's a great divide in the country today,'' he said. ''Gaps between the haves and have-nots. Gaps of the past and present. People saying things outwardly that they may not feel deep down. But it's not all bland. I found this grandmother who goes to a missile site and protests and lands in jail for her beliefs. ''There are even divisions in the same family - fundamentalists who read the same Bible differently. Parents read it like Jerry Falwell. Their kids read it like campesinos and join the Sanctuary movement and say that they're for the guerrillas in Salvador.'' 'People Are Waiting' Judged by his tape-recorded voices, did he hear any American sounds that gave reason for cheer? ''There's something inchoate out there,'' Mr. Terkel said. ''Compassion and hope aren't fashionable now. People are waiting for a real voice. There are more grassroots groups than at any time in the history of the country - environmental groups, peace groups, all waiting to coalesce. They're part of the great divide. But they never make it on the 6 o'clock news.'' Talk turned to oral history. ''I used to do my interviews with a big tape recorder, a German Uher, that I'd hang around my shoulder. Now I use a small one I hold in my hand, a Japanese Sony. In my equipment, I've gone from one defeated enemy in World War II to another. Ironically, I'm terrible mechanically - never sat behind the wheel of a car,'' he said. The 'Prospector' at Work ''What I do is I hear about a certain person and go to him and take down what he has to say. The cassettes are transcribed by Cathy Zmuda, who I call the empress of transcribers. Every word, even a pause, can be revealing. Then I take this rough, unexpurgated material and go over it -that's when the real work begins. ''I call myself a gold prospector. Out comes this ore from the transcripts. Now in that ore, I've got to get to the gold dust, by sifting and cutting. Every word in it is the person talking to me - his truth, highlighted. It's not just putting down what people say. My own words serve as the introductory material. ''Olof Palme, the Swedish Prime Minister who was assassinated in 1986, wrote the introduction for the Swedish edition of one of my books. He said that I had imitators - he called them epigones - who tried hard but just didn't know how to do it. I learned the meaning of epigones in Stockholm from the Prime Minister himself. A nice word, from the Greek.'' Root, Root, Root for the Underdog Toward the end of a long afternoon, Mr. Terkel tuned in the end of an extra-innings game at Wrigley Field. ''I don't like the Cubs,'' he said, sounding as outspoken as the character he plays in ''Eight Men Out.'' ''No genuine baseball fan is a Cubs fan. They make you think of ivy-colored walls. Yuppies today would be Cubs fans. I don't believe in them any more than I think a Yankee fan is a real fan. I could understand a Brooklyn Dodgers fan until they moved to Los Angeles. I'm sort of a White Sox fan now. The Giants and the Sox have a certain dirty-uniform quality.'' Then he added something that summed up his underdog philosophy: ''I generally root for the losing team.''

707-> Afghan President's Brother Says Kabul Rulers Will Fall
The brother of the Afghan President said here today that the Soviet-backed Government in Kabul had little support from the Afghan people and would collapse soon after the last Soviet troops pulled out of the country. The speaker, Sediqullah Rahi, denounced his brother, President Najibullah, as a sadist, a liar and ''an obedient servant'' of the Soviet Union who assiduously followed Soviet orders. Mr. Rahi fled his homeland and entered Pakistan last month under the protection of an Afghan guerrilla group. He and his wife and their two children were given refugee status by the United States this week, and he spoke to journalists today at the State Department. ''The current regime cannot last very long after the Soviet forces are all withdrawn,'' Mr. Rahi said. The Soviets have removed about half of their 115,000 troops from Afghanistan and say they will have the remainder out by Feb. 15, as required by the accords signed in Geneva in April. Speaks Through Interpreter Mr. Rahi, who is 37 years old, spoke in Dari, one of the main languages of Afghanistan, with an interpreter provided by the State Department. He said that most current leaders of Afghanistan ''have nothing else in mind but to protect and preserve their own interests and do not care about the national interest'' of Afghanistan. He predicted that Mr. Najibullah and some of his ''criminal co-workers'' might go the Soviet Union or other Communist countries if the guerrillas took control. He said Mr. Najibullah and two other brothers ''work for the K.G.B.'' He predicted that the Soviets would do everything they could to save the regime in Kabul, perhaps even encouraging the rulers to form ''a wide coalition with other forces in the country.'' Mr. Rahi said the Government had hardly any support among the people of Afghanistan. ''The only supporter of that infamous regime is the Soviet Union,'' he said. ''The morale of the Afghan regime is very low. On the other side, the mujahedeen forces enjoy very high morale.'' He did not answer directly when asked if the guerrillas were ready to govern Afghanistan. But he said their sense of unity was ''flowering and blooming.'' The diverse guerrilla groups can govern Afghanistan only if they form ''a unified, strengthened, solidified institution,'' he said. A State Department official said that Mr. Rahi was given only one name at birth, Sediqullah, just as his brother was given the name Najibullah. The younger brother later decided to use Rahi as a surname. Made Contact With Guerrillas Mr. Rahi said he had defected by making contact with one Afghan guerrilla commander, Ahmed Shah Massoud, who controls most of the strategic Panjshir Valley, northeast of Kabul. Mr. Massoud is a member of Jamiat-i-Islami, the Islamic Society, which provided protection for Mr. Rahi and his family. Before fleeing, Mr. Rahi worked at a bank in Kabul. His disagreements with his brother date at least to 1981. In that year, he said, he was kidnapped and drugged while working in Hamburg, West Germany. He said he was taken to East Germany, then to the Soviet Union and back to Afghanistan.

709-> Playing on Words From Plays, Or, Writing 'Forbidden Broadway'
So who is this guy, this guy who writes all those clever, biting lyrics for ''Forbidden Broadway''? His name's Gerard Alessandrini, he's 34 years old, he created the funny, irreverent spoof of Broadway seven years ago - but what's he really like? Must be pretty quick and flip; witty, with just a touch of viciousness. After all, this guy wrote a parody of Patti LuPone in ''Anything Goes,'' singing ''I Get a Kick Out of Me'' with lyrics like ''flashing some guy with my Stubby Kaye thigh.'' And had David Mamet, as 'Enry 'Iggins, singing (about a play called ''Speed-the-Lines''), ''I strain in vain to train Madonna's brain.'' Must be pretty evil. Better watch out for the razor. ''Actually, they say I'm not a very funny person in person,'' the guy says, sitting down to talk about the show's latest edition, which opened last week at Theater East to critical praise. ''Most of my friends tell me, 'Gee, I never would have thought you wrote 'Forbidden Broadway.' '' Is he for real? He's gotta be kidding. This is the guy who wrote, to the tune of ''I Dreamed a Dream'' from ''Les Miserables'': I dreamed a show in days gone by When all the scenery looked so pretty I didn't sing one song and die And all the costumes weren't so gritty.'' And who turned Stephen Sondheim's ''Into the Woods'' into: ''Into the words, the metaphors, the synonyms, the perfect scans . . . Into the words, your content always comes before your form and style.'' And who noted the corpulence of the ''Ain't Misbehavin' '' cast in his ''Ain't Missed a Dinner.'' And who wrote of ''Romance Romance'': ''Act I's light as air/Act II isn't there.'' How can the director and author of such below-the-belt repartee (to use the show's own words) be such an open and aboveboard guy? 'I Like Everything I See' ''One of my friends said that he thought, before he had met me, that some bitchy person wrote the show,'' Mr. Alessandrini says. ''And when he met me, he realized I wasn't very bitchy about the theater. Pretty much, I like everything I see. Usually the material I use in the show is things I pick up from other people: gossip, scuttlebutt around town, sometimes from the critics. Another person said, 'Oh, Gerard isn't mean; he just said that about so and so because it rhymed.' '' Come on, guy. ''Well,'' he says, ''maybe what it is is that I do see what is lacking in a show, what's off about a performer. But it doesn't necessarily bother me personally. And I add an idea about how some other people see it. Take 'Romance Romance.' There's a parody of that in the show. After they see the parody, some people say: 'That's such a nice parody. I loved 'Romance Romance.' ' So they think I liked it, too. And then somebody else will come and say: 'Oh, I hated 'Romance Romance.' I'm so glad you gave it to them.' So it's their own point of view more than mine. I think that happens, too. People see what they want to see.'' O.K. So he behaves like a nice guy. He's relaxed and easygoing, he smiles a lot, and the smile seems natural. But if he's such a nice guy, how did he get involved in something like this? ''It's something I've been doing for a very long time,'' he says. ''Since I was a boy. I was always performing - and writing too - when I was young, but I never did it thinking seriously I'd make a living out of it. I always did it for fun. My friends and I would satirize films or stage musicals or TV. I used to make satirical posters, satirizing things like Liz Taylor-Richard Burton movies. And I used to like Mad magazine. Eventually, in college, I was usually doing pretty much what you see.'' Wanted to Be a Performer He was born and grew up in the Boston area, and he's still very much involved there, because the show is running up there, too. He went to the Boston Conservatory of Music and studied musical theater, primarily as a performer. ''Forbidden Broadway'' opened in 1981 at Palsson's, a restaurant on West 72d Street. It ran for six years, with annual revisions, and took a year off before returning last week in a new version called ''Forbidden Broadway 1988.'' ''I originally put on the show as a performance showcase for myself and a friend,'' he says. ''I thought maybe I could make more of a hit as a performer at that time. But then I realized the fun I could have.'' He's working on another show, ''Masterpiece Cabaret,'' which spoofs great works of literature. And yes, he would like to write a book musical. But for now, satire is king. ''I like it best when it's just turning a little of the phrase,'' he says. ''When it's leaving a lot of it, or some of it, the same, and then changing a line or two to give it a completely different meaning. I guess that's really parody, because you really have to use the original. And it also saves me time. ''Like in the skit about Kiri Te Kanawa and Jose Carreras recording all those Broadway shows'' - to the tune of ''Some Enchanted Evening'': Who can explain it? Who can tell you why? Fools do the casting Stupid people buy. No, it's not easy to do, he says. ''It drives me crazy sometimes. It takes me a long time to come up with a way to use the tune. Usually I'll have to listen to the album a lot, and maybe see the show twice. Then I let it sit for a while, listen to what other people say. I usually go and get the major reviews of a show. And I really do prefer to choose music I really like. I think that makes a difference with the show - how good the music is. Then I just have to think of a gimmick, a way to slant the words to fit the parody. And very often it won't work the first time. I'll have to do two or three versions.'' Often the celebrities who are parodied come to laugh at themselves. Has anyone ever become angry? ''Nobody's ever stormed out,'' he says. ''In fact, Carol Channing asked never to be taken out of the show. She's become our mascot. And Stephen Sondheim said, about our parodies of him, 'The meaner the better.' '' Mr. Alessandrini prefers, he says, to parody the hits. ''I think you can kick somebody when they're up,'' he says. ''But it's almost distasteful to kick somebody when they're down. It just doesn't become entertainment anymore.'' So he really is a nice guy? ''Maybe it's human nature, the destruction of something, that does come into play,'' he says. ''You do feel it's kind of fun to tear something down.'' All right, already. So he really is a nice guy.

711-> Bound Girl, 13, Is Found Slain in Her Home
A 13-year-old girl who had been bound, gagged and repeatedly stabbed was found dead yesterday in the apartment where she lived with her family in the Parkchester section of the Bronx, the police said. The body was discovered at 5:30 P.M. by the girl's brother and sister when they returned home, according to Sgt. Maurice Howard, a police spokesman. The slain girl was identified as Joanna Acosta.

712-> AFTER THE CONVENTION; Excerpts From Questioning of Quayle About Guard Role in Vietnam War
Following are excerpts from reporters' questions and Senator Dan Quayle's answers yesterday in Huntington, Ind., as recorded by The New York Times. At some points crowd noise made the questioning unintelligible. Issue of Service in Guard Q. Can you assure us that nothing else was done on your behalf besides the efforts made by Mr. Phillippi? A. I can only assure you that I never asked anybody to break any rules. And I would never ask anybody to break any rules. Q. . . . this campaign who queried you about your military service? . . . these efforts made on your behalf. A. I went into my military service. And when I went into the service and why I went into the service at that time in my life, obviously I didn't get into all these details, and a lot of 'em are rumor and innuendo; we didn't get into that detail at all. Q. Did you mislead him at all? A. Not at all. I went in to - and and told him fully that my time and my career, that when I graduated, upon getting close to graduation at DePauw, my desire was to continue to law school. At that time I also made a decision to fulfill my military commitment to join the National Guard. The National Guard, which I served for six years very proudly, I was on active duty for six months. I could have been called up to Vietnam, as other Indiana units were, and if I had been called, I would have gone. Q. Did you tell them about Mr. Phillippi's efforts and the other efforts made on your behalf? A. We did not in - we did not get into any of the details. We - we did not - we did not get into any kind of the details. We went through why I joined the Indiana National Guard and I gave them essentially the same answer I gave you. Because I wanted to continue - Regrets About Vietnam? Q. Do you regret that you didn't serve in Vietnam, sir? A. At that time in my life I - I had a choice and an opportunity to fulfill two responsibilities, or two - one responsibility and one thing I wanted to do: the responsibility to have an armed services commitment to my country, and I signed up for the National Guard. And I wanted to say something, that serving in the National Guard is patriotic. There is nothing - there is - there are no -there is nothing - Duties in National Guard Q. But in the National Guard, sir, the reports are that you spent your time in the National Guard writing news releases, magazine articles and learning to be a welder. Is that true? A. I was - in the - in the - in the National Guard I served - I served - I served for six years. Q. What did you do? A. I served a week - weekend and two weeks during the summer. I was attached to the 120th public information detachment. Q. Well, write press releases and magazine articles and learn to be a welder, is that basically what you did? A. The welding, the welding was part of the basic training. I didn't do welding when I came back. I was - Q. But you did write press releases? A. . . . and I also served in the kitchen patrol and peeled a lot of potatoes and things that other specialists do. Damage to the Ticket Q. . . . hurting your ticket, Senator. And if you thought you were hurting it, would you resign from the ticket? A. I don't believe, being a member of the Indi - I don't believe being a member of the Indiana National Guard and serving your country as any disrespect for your ticket. As a matter of fact, I am darn proud of it. Options on Military Service Q. Sir, others did not have that option, isn't it true? A. Pardon? Q. Did not have the connections to get into the National Guard. You're talking about it as though it was an option available to everyone. Isn't it true that most who called into military service at that time did not have the option . . . connections? A. I got into the National Guard fairly. I did not ask anybody to break the rules. And as far as I know, nobody did break the rules. I got in fairly. Role During Vietnam War Q. By serving in the National Guard, were you trying to avoid going to Vietnam? A. No. What I was doing at that particular time, I wanted to continue my legal education, as soon as possible. And as far as continuing a legal education at that time, I was willing to go forward with active duty, which was about six months, and to get into law school. And also, also, to serve your country. And I decided to serve the country in the Indiana National Guard. I might add that I was doing that for six years. No one knew how long that Vietnam War was going to go on. And if the Vietnam War would have dragged on to '74 or '75, I was still in the Guard and I could have been called. And if my unit had been called to Vietnam, I would have been proud to go. Q. Do you think Vietnam vets will support you, Senator? A. I hope so. Q. Senator, I'm asking you about your thinking when you joined the Guard. Were you trying to avoid service in Vietnam? A. No. I did not join to avoid service in Vietnam. Because by joining the Indiana National Guard, my unit could have been called up and I would have gone to Vietnam had my unit been called up. Q. But that was unlikely, sir. You knew that was unlikely. A. Well, you ought to talk - you ought -you ought - you to ought to talk to Company D in Muncie. And you ought to talk about some of the Guards people that perhaps lost their lives. The families that - Discussion With Phillippi Q. Mr. Phillippi, who made the call for you, said that you did discuss the issue of whether or not you might be called to Vietnam, and you were told that that unit was probably not going to be called to Vietnam. Is that correct? , A. I don't - I don't recall that. Let me just say this, that being a member of the Indiana National Guard, I could have been called up like any other National Guard unit. The in -the National Guard - you ought to understand that the - the reserve forces help provide peace and deterrence. The Reserve forces is nothing to say is unpatriotic. There are millions of people in the National Guard that identify with the National Guard that consider them - consider themselves patriotic, including Dan Quayle. Q. . . . Senator, did you feel less likely to go to Vietnam after enlisting in the Guard than you would have been if you had just gone into the regular army? A. I'm not going to say that, no. . . . Support for Vietnam War Q. Do you still support the war in Vietnam? Did you support the war in Vietnam? Did you support the war in Vietnam and fighting in Vietnam? A. I thought - I thought the goal - Q. Did you support the war in Vietnam during those years of the fighting? A. Can I - can I answer the question? Q. Please. A. O.K. I supported the goal of fighting Communism in Vietnam. Q. Did you support the Vietnam War? A. I - I - I, like many, many other Americans, had particular problems about the way the war was conducted, but yes, I supported my President and I supported the goals of fighting Communism in Vietnam. Q. Why don't you think that it's hypocrisy to support it but not go? A. Pardon? Q. Why don't you think it's hypocrisy to support it but not, yourself, put yourself in harm's way? A. What - what you're saying by that question is somehow, by serving in the Indiana National Guard is not being patriotic. And I'll tell you, the Indi - Q. . . . the Indiana Guardsmen were never called up. Your commandant said so. A. The - the - serving in the Indiana National Guard is a patriotic thing to do. I served my country. Q. What troubled you about the war? What policy aspects and tangible aspects? A. I think that it was the - the no - the no-win policy aspect. Q. Did you think that there should have been a more aggressive stance taken or what? A. When you get into conflicts and regional conflict, I mean, you have to have certain goals. And a goal cannot be really a no-win situation. I think we learned a lot from Vietnam. Bid for Guard Acceptance Q. . . . What were the mechanics of the phone call that was made to National Guard officials by the managing editor of the Indianapolis newspaper who was working for your family? Did you ask him to make the phone call? A. No. Q. Did your parents ask him to make the phone call? And to whom did he place the call? A. O.K. Like any - let me see, how old would I have been? - 21, 22-year-old college senior, when you're thinking about making a major decision in your life on how you're going to serve your country, of whether you're going to join the National Guard or to join the Army, join the Navy or, like my brother did, join the Marine Corps, about the same time, you call home. I talked to my mother and my father and I said I am interested in getting into the Indiana National Guard. We communicated that to Mr. Phillippi. You'll have to ask Mr. Phillippi what calls were made. I did not ask him to make any calls. I told him I was interested in getting in the Indiana National Guard. Q. Did you ask him how he was doing it, or - A. I asked him - I told him I wanted to get into the Indiana National Guard. Q. Did you know he was making calls for you - A. Well, I would assume that calls would be made if I asked him to get in - that I wanted to get into the Indiana National Guard. Q. Did you ask him to make calls in your behalf? A. Look, you're goin' back - you're goin' back 20 years - you're goin' back 20 years -I asked - I talked with Mr. Phillippi very briefly and expressed my interest in getting into the Indiana - Q. Did you ask his help? Did you effectively ask his help? A. Wendell Phillippi knew that I wanted to get into the National Guard and I hope that he helped me, and I think he did. Q. Did you expect at that time that - A. I would hope that he had helped me, I expect that. Likelihood of Vietnam Service Q. You said that you were certainly not unaware of the fact that joining the Guard would make you less likely to be called to service in Vietnam. Did you not also consider that to be one of the benefits of serving in the Guard? A. One of the benefits of serving in the Guard? There are bene - there's good points and bad points about serving in the Guard. The good points are that you are going to continue to - to serve your country, and I do not - I want to repeat this thing. By serving in Guard somehow is not patriotic, I really do not subscribe to that. And that is the implication that's going on here. The implication - Q. The implication is that people were dying in Vietnam and you were writing press releases. A. The impli - well, the implication is somehow - the implication is somehow that Dan Quayle, by voluntarily signing up for the Indiana National Guard, was not patriotic, and I resent that. It is not - Q. . . . didn't you consider . . . to be one of the benefits that you would be less likely to be called? A. At that time in my career I was wanting to go to law school as soon as possible, and the National Guard offered me an opportunity to serve my country and to go on to law school. Q. So the answer is yes? A. To - to what question? Q. To the question of whether or not it was not indeed one of the benefits that you wouldn't have to, probably wouldn't have to go to Vietnam. A. No. It wouldn't make any difference whether I'd be at Vietnam or Germany, it's the two-year commitment. I wanted to go to law school as soon as possible. I could have been drafted or gone into the Army. I may or may not have gone to Vietnam. But it was the two-year commitment. The thing that attracted me to the Guard was I was able to go to law school as soon as possible. . . . Vacancies in the Guard Q. Senator, was there a waiting list when you got in the National Guard? A. Well, the - the report that I read - and I'm only going on a report, I was not the commanding general 20 years ago - the report that I read in the paper was that there were vacancies. Q. Well then why didn't you just go down to a recruiting office and fill out the papers? Why did you - A. I do - I do - I do - I do what any normal person would do at that age, you call home. You call home to mother and father and say, I'd like to get in the National Guard. Mr. Phillippi's a very good friend of my father. And there's - I don't think there's anything wrong with asking you mother and father or friends for advice. Q. You asked them for - A. I - I told them I wanted to get into the Indiana National Guard. Class Distinctions in War Q. Senator, what about the idea the Vietnam war was a rich man's war fought by poor men's kids? A. I don't - I don't buy that. There were many different people in - in Vietnam that fought very nobly, and I have a great deal of respect and honor and a sense of feeling for those people that were willing to go to Vietnam and particularly those - and I have some good friends, some friends here in Huntington that lost their life in Vietnam. And my thoughts, my thoughts have been with their families and I believe that they, in their sense of duty, did what they thought was right and I have a great deal of respect for them. Hindsight on War Period Q. Would you have done anything differently? A. No, I would not have done anything differently. . . .

713-> The Law; Federal Court Rules Challenged After 50 Years
Dissatisfaction is growing among lawyers, judges and scholars over the 50-year-old rules that make up the foundation of the Federal court system. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which were established in 1938 to make it easier to bring cases into the Federal courts, define scores of important and arcane issues that crop up daily in courts around the nation. The rules govern anything from bringing a lawsuit to having it dismissed or appealed. They also broadened the authority of judges in a way that helped define and enforce civil rights laws, consumer regulations, enviromental rules and many other modern social reforms. The rules, said Professor David L. Shapiro of the Harvard Law School, ''have become part of the consciousness of every American lawyer and judge.'' Commemorating the anniversary of the changes, Benjamin Kaplan, a Massachusetts judge and Harvard law professor emeritus, declared: ''Let's light a bonfire in celebration. But don't throw the rules in.'' Too Permissive or Too Limited? Some critics want to do just that to some or all of the rules. Some maintain that the rules have become too permissive, allowing actions to be brought to court too easily. Others contend that they have become too restrictive, freezing out valid claims and permitting obfuscation. At a two-day conference here sponsored by the Northeastern University School of Law, many of the nation's leading procedural thinkers, judges and academics criticized the rules. Most of the experts expressed dissatisfaction with one rule or another and said it was time to change the guidelines to reflect modern realities in the courts. The rule makers in 1938 could hardly have anticipated the pretrial discovery, hourly billing rates and copying machines that enable litigants to file mountains of paperwork. ''It's time to start over,'' said John P. Frank, a former Yale Law School professor who is now in private practice in Phoenix. ''Let us accept past triumphs but recognize that new problems have arisen.'' A drastic move is hardly likely. Despite strong dissatisfaction with some of the rules, there is even less agreement about how to replace them. The triumphs of the 1938 reforms were widely acknowledged by many participants at the conference, which included members of the advisory committee that recommends rule changes for approval by the United States Supreme Court. A Move to Simplify The rules went into effect with almost no public fanfare on Sept. 16, 1938, four years after Congress passed the Rules Enabling Act, which grants the Supreme Court the power to make and change rules in the absence of objections from Congress. The new rules vastly simplified an older system that elevated procedure over substance. Under the older system, said Federal District Judge Jack B. Weinstein of Brooklyn, ''forms of action were rigid and technical, and minute formulistic deviations generated much litigation.'' The fundamental goal of the changes was to democratize the courts, encouraging Federal judges to get to the merits of complaints no matter how they were drafted. The lofty vision of the rules is found in Rule 1, which instructs judges and litigants to construe all the other rules in such as way as ''to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action.'' Two Remedies at Once To further those goals, and in their boldest move, the 1938 reformers made it possible for a judge to do two things at once: give an aggrieved plaintiff monetary damages and at the same time order the Government or some other defendant to comply with the law. Under the old system, these remedies had to be pursued independently. This merger of law and equity gave lawyers more leverage to use the courts to reshape American society. Combined with rules that enabled broad categories of plaintiffs to sue as a group, the merger enabled civil rights lawyers to obtain enforcement of major cases desegregating school districts or townships. The 1938 rules also tried to strike a balance between two strongly competing interests. A national uniformity in the results of similar cases was sought. Yet the guidelines also tried to give judges broad discretion and flexibility to handle each case according to its peculiar needs. Has the Pendulum Swung Back? Although the rules opened the courts to more litigants and granted broader powers to Federal judges, some in the legal profession now believe that the courts and recent amendments to the rules have swung the other way. Federal District Judge Robert L. Carter asserted that Rule 11, which governs sanctions against lawyers for frivolous actions, is being used to deter civil rights lawyers from bringing cases. The rule was made tougher five years ago. ''A Rule 11 when I was a lawyer would have delayed the desegration cases for at least a decade,'' said Judge Carter, who sits in Manhattan. In the 1950's and 60's he was a lawyer for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Stephen B. Burbank, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Law, said judges had frustrated the goals of the rules and did not, for instance, apply provisions like Rule 11 with any degree of uniformity, predictability or simplicity. ''There is a conflict among the circuits about virtually every aspect of the rule,'' said Professor Burbank. To Federal Judge Richard A. Posner, however, the rules are too permissive and have caused the courts to be overwhelmed with litigation. ''It has reached crisis proportions,'' said Judge Posner, a well-known scholar on law and economics, who now sits on the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago. ''At some point there is going to be a collapse, and that will be delayed if we use makeshift changes.'' Perhaps the most telling observation came from Federal District Judge Robert E. Keeton of Boston. ''Why is it that lawyers are turning to other places?'' said the judge, referring to alternative forums for resolving disputes, like arbitration, mediation and private organizations with their own rules. ''Is the market telling us something?''

714-> BASEBALL; Athletics Need Five to Clinch
Dave Parker drove in three runs with two singles as the Oakland Athletics beat the Texas Rangers, 6-2, today and moved another step closer to the American League West title. The Athletics' magic number for clinching the division race was cut to five. Todd Burns (7-2) pitched his second complete game, allowing seven hits, striking out six and walking one to beat the Rangers' Bobby Witt (6-10). Storm Davis was scheduled to start for Oakland but was replaced after complaining of a stiff neck while warming up. Dave Henderson and Parker had run-scoring singles in the first inning. The Rangers made the score 2-1 in the second on a single by Ruben Sierra, who had three hits, and a triple by Chad Kreuter. Parker had a two-run single in the fifth, when the Athletics got three consecutive singles after Henderson walked with one out. Twins 10, White Sox 3 MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - Jim Dwyer's pinch-hit grand slam capped a six-run sixth inning and Frank Viola became the first 22-game winner in the major leagues. Viola (22-6) allowed seven hits, struck out five, and walked one over seven innings. After single runs in the first and second by Chicago, Viola retired 13 straight hitters until one out in the sixth when he walked Carlton Fisk. Minnesota took advantage of a wild streak by the Chicago starter, Melido Perez (11-9), to score six runs in the sixth. Don Pall came in to strike out Gary Gaetti, a pinch-hitter, but then Dwyer delivered his first homer of the year and his second career grand slam. Blue Jays 3, Indians 0 TORONTO (AP) - Jeff Musselman pitched a four-hitter over eight innings for his first victory since Aug. 13 for Toronto. Musselman (6-4) struck out four and walked none before Tom Henke finished with one-hit relief for his 24th save. Mike Walker, making his major league debut, gave up six hits and all three runs in six innings, walking four and striking out five. He was 15-7 at Class AA Williamsport of the Eastern League with 145 strikeouts in 164Y innings. Cardinals 3, Phillies 1 PHILADELPHIA (AP) - Scott Terry won his seventh straight decision as St. Louis snapped a three-game losing streak. Terry (9-3) struck out six and walked none in eight innings. He made his first start on Aug. 11 and he has allowed 11 runs in 57 innings over 8 starts, a 1.74 earned run average. Todd Worrell finished with perfect for his 30th save. Shane Rawley (7-15) gave up nine hits and three runs in six and a third innings. The game was played before 10,434, the smallest crowd at Veterans Stadium since Sept. 7, 1987, when the Phillies drew 10,338. Expos 9, Pirates 4 MONTREAL (AP) - Andres Galarraga drove in three runs with a two-run homer and a triple as Montreal dropped the Pirates further out of the National League East race. Coupled with New York's 4-1 victory over Chicago earlier in the day, the second-place Pirates fell 11 games behind the Mets. The combination reduced the Mets' magic number for clinching the division to seven. Randy Johnson was a winner in his major league debut with relief help. Andy McGaffigan pitched two and a third innings of one-hit relief for his fourth save. Johnson, recalled from the Expos' Triple-A affiliate at Indianapolis, became the tallest player ever to appear in a big-league game. The 6-foot-10-inch Johnson is an inch taller than Johnny Gee, who pitched with the Pirates and the New York Giants in the 1940s. Johnson, who walked three batters and struck ot five, yielded six hits in five innings, with bases-empty home runs by Glenn Wilson in the second and fourth innings being the only runs he allowed. Dave LaPoint (4-1), the Pirates' starter, had a career-high seven-game winning streak ended. He had recorded three of the victories with the Chicago White Sox, who dealt him to Pittsburgh last month. Reds 7 Astros 5 CINCINNATI (AP) - Eric Davis and Barry Larkin drove in two runs apiece to lead Cincinnati. The Astros rallied from a 6-2 deficit on sixth-inning homers by Billy Hatcher and Danny Darwin off the starter Norm Charlton, but were shut down by the Reds' bullpen over the last three innings. John Franco pitched the ninth to gain his 34th save in 36 opportunities. The loss dropped the second-place Astros seven games behind Los Angeles in the National League West. Charlton (2-4) got his second victory in seven major league starts despite allowing five runs and nine hits in five and two-thirds innings. The Reds handed Bob Forsch (10-5) one of his worst drubbings of the season. Forsch had allowed more than three runs just once in his previous 14 starts for St. Louis and Houston. The right-hander suffered his first loss since being traded to Houston for Denny Walling on Aug. 31. He's 1-1 in three starts for the Astros.

717-> Review/Film; The Last of an Empire
The film opening today at the Public Theater, titled ''The Last Emperor,'' is a double-decker footnote, to history and to movies, specifically, to Bernardo Bertolucci's Oscar-winning ''Last Emperor.'' The film, made three years ago as a joint venture of movie people in Hong Kong and China, supplements the far more scenic and sweeping Bertolucci epic. The Chinese film includes some interesting archival newsreel film relating to the political upheavals surrounding Pu Yi, China's last emperor, and gives us a recap of how Pu Yi found himself washed up, out of a job and a prisoner of war at the end of World War II. Its principal interest, however, is Pu Yi's redemption, through the benignity of an all-wise, all-seeing Communism. As played by Tony Leung, Pu Yi has some of the qualities of a Chinese Jimmy Stewart. He's good-humored and all thumbs when, as a freshly indoctrinated, newly demoted absolute monarch, he attempts to cope with the mysteries of a commonplace cooking stove. The movie goes on to recall his last, happy marriage with a pretty nurse, with whom he goes sightseeing in the Forbidden City; his brutal arrest during the Cultural Revolution, and, finally, his death from cancer in 1967. As the Bertolucci film turned Pu Yi and the members of his entourage into lost, rather Europeanized Bertolucci characters, this ''Last Emperor'' sees Pu Yi as a winning example of a politically born-again former emperor. This ''Last Emperor'' doesn't cut deep but Pu Yi's life and times, as well as the manner in which the Chinese have come to treat him officially, remain fascinating. AN EMPEROR'S REHABILITATION - THE LAST EMPEROR, directed by Li Han Hsiang; screenplay (Mandarin with English subtitles) by Mr. Hsiang, based on Li Shu Xian's ''Pu Yi and I,'' ''Pu Yi's Latter Life,'' and ''Pu Yi's My Former Life''; a New Kwun Lun Film Production Company (Li Han Hsiang) and China International Television Corporation co-production; released by Southern Films in the Nanyang theater chain.

719-> Robert B. Braswell, 57, Financial Analyst
Robert B. Braswell, a financial analyst and corporate executive, died of a heart attack on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 57 years old. At his death, Mr. Braswell was vice president for corporate contributions at MCA Inc., a post he had held for seven years. Before that, he was with the Ford Foundation for nine years as an administrative officer dealing with investments. Mr. Braswell was a native of Buford, Ga. He was a graduate of Morehouse College and received master's degrees from the University of Illinois and the Rutgers Graduate School of Business. In the 1960's, before he entered the field of philanthropy, Mr. Braswell was one of the first blacks to hold executive positions in finance with major corporations, serving as a financial analyst for the International Telephone and Telegraph Company and for the Standard Oil Company (New Jersey), now Exxon. For the last decade, Mr. Braswell was a director of Phoenix House, a drug treatment center. He is survived by a sister, Virginia Gist of Newark.

720-> Americans and Soviets Coordinate Storm Flights
American and Soviet tracking aircraft flying inside the vortex of Hurricane Gilbert in recent days have found themselves so close at times that they were forced yesterday to begin coordinating flight paths as they whirled through thestorm. Flying nearly continuously inside the storm, eight WC-130 Air Force weather planes and two P-3 Orions of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are providing American forecasters with measurements vital in assessing the hurricane's destructive potential. With them inside the storm are Soviet Ilyushin 18 storm trackers flying from their bases in Cuba. Even though Gilbert is no longer a threat to Cuba, the Soviets remain interested in the workings of the hurricane. In the past, Soviet climatologists have coordinated their hurricane research efforts with those of American forecasters. Air Force pilots at Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Miss., said in telephone conversations that there had been fears that American and Soviet pilots might be flying in such constricted airspace in and around the narrow eye of the hurricane that a collision was possible. Two pilots of the 53d Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, 1st Lieut. Eric Kivi and 1st Lieut. Robert Pickrell, said that ''we finally managed to work things out'' by establishing voice communication in English with the Soviet pilots. Henceforth, the Soviets and Americans will keep each other advised of their hurricane reconnaissance plans, including courses and altitudes. The main purpose of flights lasting up to eight hours inside the hurricane is to gather radar, pressure, temperature and wind velocity measurements that will help disaster workers make plans. But the weather agency's aircraft also carry instruments allowing them to gather scientific information. Both Air Force and weather agency storm trackers expressed professional satisfaction with Hurricane Gilbert. ''The last two years have been lean ones for hurricanes, and this is the first really good one we've had to study in quite a while,'' one hurricane expert said. Robert W. Burpee, the agency's hurricane field program director in Miami, said that data gathered by his agency's Orion planes from three types of radar would permit analysts to reconstruct the hurricane in unprecedented detail. ''In particular,'' he said, ''we are seeing how the rain bands develop and change in a huge storm.'' Bands of Rain From 10 percent to 30 percent of a hurricane's rain is concentrated in its ''eye wall,'' a region of high-velocity winds wound tightly around the calm eye at the center of the storm. The rest of the storm's rain, which can cause severe flooding over a huge area, is concentrated in spiral arms of cumulus clouds radiating from the hurricane's center, Dr. Burpee said. When these arms pass over an area torrential rain falls, but when the spaces in between are overhead, there may be no rain at all. ''A hurricane's rain bands are rather analagous to the spiral arms of a galaxy,'' he said, ''and in common with galactic arms, we don't know how or why they form. Missions of the kind we are currently flying may shed some light on the problem.'' Weather agency and Air Force aircraft are both assigned by the Weather Bureau's National Hurricane Center in Miami, and tasks are divided between them. As the hurricane nears land, priority missions gather information for forecasts. Instruments aboard the planes and in parachute sondes dropped into the storm relay data at a rapid rate, some if it transmitted via satellite directly to stations in the United States. James D. McFadden, manager of the weather agency's aircraft operations, said his pilots enjoyed one important advantage over their Air Force counterparts. ''The Air Force is permitted to fly no closer to the Cuban coast than 65 miles,'' he said, ''while our planes can approach to a distance of 12 miles. In some storms this is an important edge.'' Tracking planes generally avoid flying higher than about 10,000 feet in storms as strong as Hurricane Gilbert, a pilot said, to avoid the increased hazards of lightning and freezing at high altitudes.

723-> Review/Film; Imamura on Updating Divine Squalor
The robust good looks of Shohei Imamura's 1968 Cinemascope epic ''The Profound Desire of the Gods'' only heighten the perverse quality of the action, and Mr. Imamura's ribald, casually comic direction has much the same effect. This three-hour film, which will begin the Film Forum 2's Imamura retrospective, makes an ideal introduction to the maverick qualities of this film maker's idiosyncratic style. At some moments sounding a note of bizarre domestic comedy, and at other times attempting tragedy of mythic proportions, ''The Profound Desire of the Gods'' is nothing if not far-reaching. It unfolds on the tiny, remote island paradise of Kuragejima, in the Ryukyu Islands, and it concerns the Futori family, who are widely regarded as beasts by their neighbors. As the film demonstrates, there is a certain amount of justification for this. The Futori family history is rich with incestuous unions, forbidden practices and punishments from both fellow islanders and the gods. So one of the family members, a man named Nekichi (Rentaro Mikuni), has been chained in a pit for his crimes; his sister and onetime lover, Uma (Yasuko Matsui), has become the much-abused mistress of the manager (Yoshi Kato) of a local mill. Another Futori is the wanton, feebleminded Toriko (Hideko Okiyama), who scampers about happily in a burlap sack and is much too popular with the local men. There are also a venerable, mischievous grandfather and a grandson named Kametaro (Choichiro Kawarazaki), who remains understandably confused about his lineage. And there is a certain majesty to all this squalor, for the gods who founded Kuragejima are said to have been as incestuous as the Futoris themselves. The early parts of the film unfold in a sunny, unhurried, halfway humorous style, as Mr. Imamura documents the peculiarities of the Futori household and conveys the elements of myth and superstition that color the islanders' lives. He does this in typically unpredictable fashion, often switching abruptly from the matter-of-fact to the fanciful with no warning. And there are frequent shots of the exotic sea and land creatures that live side by side with the islanders, suggestive of another dimension. Indeed, these glimpses of nature are specifically equated with divinity, and the film creates a strong sense of all-knowing, ever-present unseen powers. In one scene, the village storyteller sings of Kuragejima's gods and goddesses to a group of children, while a snake slithers placidly in the foreground. If the best parts of the films are those that convey the mixture of real and spiritual elements in the life of this unspoiled island, the more commonplace ingredient is a notion of civilization's corrupting influence. This takes the form of a subplot (which along with a fleeting reference to Vietnam is the only thing that makes the film seem dated) introducing a bespectabled engineer (Kazuo Kitamura) who has come from Tokyo to help modernize Kuragejima. Having no understanding of the local people's deep superstitious and religious convictions, this engineer is a ready source of low-keyed comedy as he tries to adapt his plans to the local customs. The easygoing style in which these events unfold doesn't entirely pave the way for the divine retribution that is exacted from the Futoris by the film's conclusion, but in a way that makes these climactic events even more disturbing. Less successful is a coda that depicts the island five years later in its newly civilized state, with abundant Coca-Cola signs to overstate the point. This film, and others in this well-deserved retrospective, amply emphasize the prophetic qualities of Mr. Imamura's work as well as the more erratic ones. Twenty years ago, he was helping to pioneer the break with traditionalism that has brought about such a flowering of iconoclastic Japanese cinema today. When Paradise Is Passe THE PROFOUND DESIRE OF THE GODS, a film by Shohei Imamura; screenplay (Japanese with English subtitles) by Mr. Imamura and Keiji Hasebe; cinematography by Masao Tochizawa; music by Toshiro Mayuzumi; produced by Imamura Productions/ Nikkatsu Corporation; released by East-West Classics.

725-> Restaurants
It's really not fair the way chefs move from on restaurant kitchen to another in this town, often under cover of darkness with no public announcement so diners can keep track. Perhaps restaurateurs should be like professional sports teams and hold well-publicized drafts: ''I'll swap your Bobby (Mesquite Sizzler) LaRouche and his saucier for two pastry chefs and a first-round draft choice next year.'' Such a system would be particularly helpful in following establishments like the River Cafe, which has seen three major team changes in the last four years: first Larry Forgione, who established it as one of the premier all-American restaurants in the country; then Charles Palmer, who added his own distinctive touch until quietly moving on last December to open his own place. Since then, the chef has been 26-year-old David Burke, an inventive former sous chef at the cafe who spent most of 1987 training in France with such luminaries as Gaston Lenotre, Georges Blanc and Marc Meneau. The River Cafe, on a barge on the Brooklyn shore of the East River under the Brooklyn Bridge, remains one of the most spellbinding settings in New York. The vista of lower Manhattan across the busy waterway is stirring any time of day but especially at dusk, when the sky deepens to silvery indigo and the lights begin flickering in the glass towers. The dining room - with a piano bar on one side and rows of well-spaced tables, all with good views - attracts a blend of special-occasion revelers, out-of-town visitors and well-heeled New Yorkers. Despite the festive nature of the place, noise is rarely bothersome. Mr. Burke obviously has fun with food presentation, and many of his winsome creations leave diners loath to disassemble them. The pristine carpaccio of yellowfin tuna comes with a dome of salmon tartar on top pierced with two corrugated potatoes and a ruffle of creme fraiche speckled with black olives. Bright green snow peas ring the dish. Quail legs are stuffed with foie gras, enveloped in pasta and served so the bones form little handles; the legs and sauteed quail breasts are set in a clear, heady mushroom broth flecked with pistachios. Excellent cold foie gras marinated in Madeira is presented on a sward of tiny green lentils along with a puree of endive sweetened with honey and sherry vinegar. And good lean lamb sausage redolent of cumin is paired with a creamy fondue of goat cheese (the first two times the lamb was sampled, however, it was inexplicably dry). As fanciful as these combinations sound, all are assembled for flavor and texture affinities, not just theatrics. A starter called warm pastrami-cured salmon belly was too provocative to pass up. This eccentric twist on the New York deli staple is cured in coriander, salt, pepper and sugar overnight, then brushed with a melange of peppery spices and smoked. The ruddy strips of salmon are pleasingly salty and leave a piquant echo on the palate. They are served with creamy mashed potatoes and artichoke sections rubbed with mustard oil. The service staff here is well informed but sometimes overly mannered. One evening, our otherwise excellent waiter had the unsettling habit of pressing his nose close to my face while describing dishes, and gleefully rubbing his hands like a diabolical scientist in a horror movie. The recently updated wine list, which includes a special selection of older California vintages, reflects considerable care. Mr. Burke is a flashier chef than his predecessor, sometimes a bit too flashy. Some of the best entrees are the least cerebral: superb aged Black Angus sirloin, grilled over fruitwood and served with a lusty red wine sauce and rosti potatoes, or the perfectly sauteed salmon steak embedded with cracked pepper and ginger, over an invigorating red wine and butter sauce perfumed with ginger. Tuna steak also is masterly prepared, under a thin golden roof of sauteed potatoes. A sweet, buttery sea scallop is set in the center of the plate and everything is ringed with a vegetable bouillon-based sauce scattered with minced black olives, carrots, white beans and broccoli florets. One effort that failed to excite my intrepid crew of tasters was the overproduced grilled chicken breast that came with a supporting cast as large as that for ''Les Miserables'' - including mushroom sausage, morels, black olive pasta, tomato sauce -all of which muddled the plot. A special of peppery duck breast was barely eaten because of dryness. Roasted squab is better, the meat rich and full flavored in a red-wine sauce touched with clove and served with a sweet confit of dates and soothing risotto with corn kernels. Several desserts are worth rowing across the East River for: the incredibly light timbale-shaped banana-and-chocolate parfait with light and dark chocolate sauces; a raucous assortment of sublime chocolate pastries, ice creams and cookies, and sharp, moist cinnamon pudding with creme anglaise. Plum tart is a distant runner-up, although the lemon cream accompanying it is great, and creme brulee is a winner. The River Cafe has survived yet another change of captains without straying from its course. Under David Burke, there should be smooth sailing ahead.

726-> House Panel Passes Tax Measure
The House Ways and Means Committee has approved a tax bill making technical corrections in the Tax Reform Act of 1986, providing some tax breaks for special interests and raising some taxes to offset those breaks. Committee staff members estimated that the bill would provide $7.1 billion of tax cuts over the next three years and would raise an equal amount to finance them. The bill, approved Thursday in a 33-to-3 vote behind closed doors, now goes to the House floor, but the Presidential election campaign could prevent it from becoming law this year. Some lawmakers have questioned whether Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and the choice of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts to become the Democratic Vice Presidential nominee, will want to get involved with the bill later this summer. In addition, the Reagan Administration opposes some of the money-raising parts of the measure. The House bill was originally meant to correct parts of the 1986 tax overhaul legislation. Those errors, including wrong legal citations, are so numerous and so complex that Congressional staff aides wrote a 446-page book explaining them. A Variety of Provisions The bill includes these provisions: * The tax exclusion for employer-provided educational assistance would be renewed, but only $1,500 of such aid annually could be excluded. * Credits for research and for owners of low-income rental housing would be extended. * Farmers would be relieved of a 1987 requirement that they pay tax on off-road diesel fuel and then apply for a refund. * Owners of mutual fund shares would be allowed to deduct certain fund expenses. * Tax benefits from single-premium life insurance policies would be curtailed but not eliminated. * Taxes on various corporations, including those that own parts of other corporations and military contractors, would be increased. * Operators of offshore or Alaska oil rigs would be permitted to deduct the full cost of meals provided to employees; most businesses may deduct only 80 percent. * Pipe tobacco would be taxed at $2.67 a pound, equivalent to the 16-cents-a-pack tax on cigarettes. This is the only tax bill with a chance of getting through Congress in 1988, so lawmakers know that any tax provision they want enacted now will have to be attached to this bill.

727-> Cuban Lists Conditions for Angola Troop Pullout
Cuba will start to withdraw its troops from Angola only after South Africa begins to carry out a long-stalled United Nations plan for independence in neighboring Namibia, the chief Cuban negotiator in the talks on the Angolan conflict said here today. The negotiator, Jorge Risquet Valdez, the Cuban Communist Party secretary for international affairs, said he was ''encouraged by the progress made'' in the three rounds of negotiations on the Angolan conflict held between Angola, Cuba, South Africa and the United States. Speaking of talks this week on Governors Island in New York, Mr. Risquet described his Government's conditions for a withdrawal of the estimated 45,000 Cuban troops in Angola. He said it was agreed that South African troops must withdraw ''immediately'' from Angola and that there must be international guarantees that Angola would not be attacked by South Africa again. ''That would be the beginning,'' he said, ''so that later South Africa would also leave Namibia as part of the application of U.N. Resolution 435.'' That resolution, approved by the Security Council nearly 10 years ago, in September 1978, calls for South African troops to be withdrawn from Namibia and elections to be held to bring majority rule and independence to the former German colony, which is also known as South-West Africa. Withdrawal to Take Time ''That would create the conditions for a withdrawal of Cuba's troops from Angola,'' he said. ''Resolution 435 states clearly that the independence process in Namibia should take between 12 and 13 months,'' Mr. Risquet said. ''The withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola will take more time than that. So during the withdrawal of Cuban troops, the decolonization of Namibia must be taking place to give the Namibian people access to independence.'' The chief American negotiator, Assistant Secretary of State Chester A. Crocker, said Wednesday that the issue of the Cuban troop withdrawal had yet to be resolved. Mr. Risquet is visiting Zimbabwe as the head of the Cuban delegation of a joint Cuban-Zimbabwean Cooperation Committee. Urges End to Rebel Support Speaking through an interpreter, he said another condition for a Cuban withdrawal is an end to American and South African support for Jonas Savimbi's Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or Unita. ''There must be a cessation of all external support for Unita - that means by the U.S.A., South Africa or any other third country,'' said Mr. Risquet, adding that the end of South African support for the rebels was being discussed in the four-way talks, while the end of American support was to be resolved by ''bilateral discussions between the U.S.A. and Angola.'' Mr. Risquet said that although there were many details to be worked out, he believes that ''if there is a political will from all four sides then we could see more progress.'' He said the next negotiations would take place in the first week of August at a location still to be chosen, with a package of agreements to be worked out before October. Showing a bit of gratification with the progress made in the talks so far, Mr. Risquet spoke favorably of Mr. Crocker's mediating role. ''I have perceived in the attitude of Mr. Crocker and in the U.S. that they are interested in finding a solution as soon as possible,'' said Mr. Risquet. ''We take their attitude as indications that there is an interest in the U.S. Government to find a solution. I am not given to praising the U.S. Government, but seeing it objectively, I can see a positive role is being played by the American Administration.''

728-> Review/Film; Guns and Corruption
In ''Shakedown,'' something fancy happens every 15 minutes or so, which is part of what makes the whole film so unremarkable. It becomes difficult to remember why the stolen police car being driven by the runaway thug, for example, has got upside-down amid the piles of burning rubble. Or why the roller coaster has run amok at Coney Island, or why the taxi has been impaled on the wrecking ball. The writer and director, James Glickenhaus, whose chief claim to fame is the earlier ''Exterminator,'' would surely be lost without the sounds of screeching brakes and spraying gunfire at regular intervals. Not all of ''Shakedown'' is as lurid as this. A lot of it is bogged down in exposition, with a plot about police corruption in which Peter Weller plays a legal aid lawyer named Roland Dalton. In this, his last case before he begins work for his future father-in-law's Wall Street law firm, Dalton is assigned to defend a drug dealer (Richard Brooks) accused of killing a policeman in Central Park. Dalton's nagging, acquisitive fiancee, Gail Feinberger (Blanche Baker), doesn't understand the first thing about his dedication to doing good. ''Shakedown,'' which is full of ethnic stereotypes, also gives Dalton the chance to rekindle his utterly perfunctory affair with Susan Cantrell (Patricia Charbonneau), who happens to be the assistant district attorney on the case and the voice of his conscience, too. Susan urges him to stick with legal aid and not to forsake his values by selling out to the wealthy Feinbergers. However, she delivers this speech from her own very nice penthouse apartment with a big terrace and a full view of Central Park. This peculiarity goes unexplained. The other star of ''Shakedown,'' which opens today at the Orpheum and other theaters, is Sam Elliott, who plays a colorfully dissipated undercover cop named Richie Marks. First seen waking up in a round-the-clock movie theater on 42d Street (it is one of Mr. Glickenhaus's wittier touches to make the film on the screen a shoot-'em-up featuring armed ski jumpers), Marks quickly establishes himself as Dalton's alter ego, and together they hunt down the entrepreneurial policemen who are the story's villains. Mr. Elliott, who seems to get better with age, has developed a grizzled look and an enjoyably wild gleam in his eye. Mr. Weller also demonstrates a maverick streak, though his is established mostly through loud neckties, a taste for Jimi Hendrix and an inappropriate tan. In Mr. Glickenhaus's screenplay, these are the sorts of things that pass for character traits. The dialogue tends to be aggressively heavy on the hackneyed (''You don't exactly look like chopped liver yourself'') and the jive (''Is this gonna be some kind of female territorial doo-wop?''). Among the notable secondary aspects of ''Shakedown'' are the presence of memorable character actors like David Proval and Antonio Fargas in small roles, and a credit for ''music composed, arranged and realized,'' which in this case seems a bit much. Lawyer and Cop Join Forces directed and written by James Glickenhaus; director of photography, John Lindley; edited by Paul Fried; music by Jonathan Elias; production designed by Charles Bennett; produced by J.

729-> FUTURES/OPTIONS; Grain Mixed in a Quiet Day Amid Weather Uncertainty
Amid uncertainty created by conflicting weather forecasts for the drought-stricken Farm Belt, grain trading was fairly subdued yesterday after several wild sessions. On the Chicago Board of Trade, soybeans made strong gains, but corn and wheat were mixed. On other markets, pork bellies surged by the limit allowed for one day's trading, while energy futures were mixed. Forecasts for next week's weather were so varied that ''every time I pick up the telephone I hear a different one,'' said John Frazier, Chicago-based grain specialist with the Balfour Maclaine Corporation. Temperatures in Chicago soared above 100 degrees yesterday afternoon. Some private meteorologists were calling for dry conditions and searing temperatures to linger in the Midwest through next Thursday. But other private forecasters said they expected cooler temperatures and scattered showers to move into the region this weekend. ''We're in the hands of the weather and the weatherman,'' Mr. Frazier said. Ted Mao, grain specialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York, agreed. ''People are not sure we're not going to get another rain front in the middle of next week,'' he said, ''and the markets are very, very nervous.'' The drought has taken a heavy toll on the corn crop. The Agriculture Department estimated in a report issued Tuesday that 1988 corn production would fall 27 percent below last year. During the week the damage increased as the stunted crop neared the end of its pollination stage. Soybeans will enter a critical growing period within two weeks, analysts said. The Agriculture Department's report predicted a 14 percent drop in soybean production, based on Tuesday's conditions. Yesterday's mixed close ended a week marked by wide swings in prices. Soybeans for July delivery ranged during the week from $8.56 to $10.20 a bushel, and July corn ranged from $2.86 to $3.50 a bushel. Frozen pork belly futures continued their recovery from recent lows near 32 cents a pound amid higher cash prices and retail featuring of bacon, analysts said. Yesterday's gain of 2 cents a pound, the daily limit, on contracts for July and August delivery marked the fourth day of the pork belly rally on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Most cattle futures advanced in pre-weekend squaring of positions, analysts said. Energy futures ended mixed on the New York Mercantile Exchange in light pre-weekend trading, which brokers attributed largely to internal market influences. West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 16 cents lower to 10 cents higher, with the August contract at $14.86 a barrel.

731-> Galway Finds the Charmed Life a Bit Too Charming
''You know, people think I lead a luxurious life,'' said the flutist James Galway, one of the classical music world's bona fide superstars. ''But it consists of getting up early, getting on a flight, going to the next place, settling in, changing the hotel room because it's no good - there's always something - and getting through the day. On top of that, I have a family, a record company, a management to deal with. It doesn't leave a lot of time. This life takes a toll on everyone. And I've been thinking about that a great deal lately.'' Mr. Galway is in town for Mostly Mozart performances, tomorrow through Thursday at Avery Fisher Hall, and an appearance at Caramoor, in Katonah, N.Y., next Saturday. The Thursday concert will mark the 10th anniversary of Mr. Galway's New York debut, which also took place at the Mostly Mozart festival, and while he isn't making a fuss about the occasion, he has spent the last year and a half taking stock of his career. When Mr. Galway came to New York in 1978, he rode a wave of publicity unusual for a classical instrumentalist. Only three years into his solo career (he left his post as principal flutist of the Berlin Philharmonic in 1975), the bearded Irishman had already established himself as a celebrity in Europe, with hit singles on the British pop charts and a growing collection of recordings that ran the gamut from standard repertory to penny whistle marches to pop crossover collections. He was proclaimed the greatest gift to the flute since Pan, or, at least, since Jean-Pierre Rampal. And with his trademark gold flute, a seemingly unlimited repertory and the combination of his melodious brogue, irreverent manner and hearty laugh, he piped his way across the world's concert stages and television screens, sold lots of records and quickly supplanted Mr. Rampal, many would argue, as the leading flute virtuoso of our time. A One-Man Industry Since then, Mr. Galway has continued to be something of a one-man industry. Besides pursuing a globe-trotting concert schedule and making a few dozen more disks for RCA (the latest are a ''Greatest Hits'' collection and a record of Mercadante concertos, one of which he is playing at Mostly Mozart on Tuesday and Wednesday nights), he has edited a series of performing editions, made promotional videos, flirted briefly with a conducting career and earned a reputation as a champion carouser. But now, the 48-year-old flutist says, he is mending his ways, professionally and personally. ''About 18 months ago, when I was on holiday, I decided it was about time I examined the whole situation,'' he explained. ''I took a look at what's happening to performers my age and a little older, and I thought, I don't want to get out of shape. I decided I was not going to fall into the trap of just getting old and famous and playing bad concerts and having the press write that I'm slipping. So I started practicing, all the time, and I drove everyone around me crazy. ''But it paid off. When I began this overhaul, I started by playing scales, and it was the biggest shock of my life to hear how out of shape I was. I could play concertos and repertory pieces. But the scales were stiff, and they were inconsistent from key to key. So I worked on that.'' He has also modified his offstage life somewhat. ''When you tour around,'' he said, ''there are all these wonderful parties and receptions people give you. They feed you to death. They kill you with kindness. But there are only so many meals you can eat before you begin to look like a tent. And when you go to a party, it's sometimes hard to get up at 6 for a 7:15 flight and to face the next day. I was beginning to feel unhealthy. So last year, I checked into a health farm. I went again this year, and I'll go next year. I think all musicians should do this, because the best thing you can invest in is your health.'' He Turns to Teaching As a result of all this, he has reordered some of his professional priorities. Lately, his thoughts have turned increasingly to teaching because, as he says, ''I've figured out how to play the flute well, and what's more, I've figured out how to make other people play the flute well.'' He is writing a book on flute technique with an Australian flutist and writer, Andrew Richardson. And he will give a master class this summer at the Aspen Music Festival in Colorado. Meanwhile, he has shelved his conducting ambitions. ''I decided that to conduct, you really have to know the music from memory. If I'm going to play the flute as well as I can, I don't have time to learn orchestral repertory too.'' And while he continues to dabble in crossover projects, he seems to approach these with the same care he brings to the classical literature. ''I like to play these things, and a lot goes into them,'' he insisted. ''If I'm recording a song by John Denver or Andrew Lloyd Webber, I have to start by finding out where it will sound best on the flute. That might mean playing it in every key and every register; and even then, there have been tunes I just didn't think worked, and I've decided not to record them. If it doesn't grab me, I won't do it.''

732-> N.H.L. Playoffs; Oilers Rally to Gain 2-0 Lead in Series
Mark Messier scored his second goal of the game and assisted on Craig Simpson's game-winner at 5 minutes 1 second of the third period, capping a three-goal surge that gave the Edmonton Oilers a 5-3 victory over the Detroit Red Wings tonight in Game 2 of the Campbell Conference finals. The Oilers lead the four-of-seven-game series, 2-0, with Game 3 scheduled for Detroit on Saturday night. The Oilers trailed, 3-1, after a listless two periods before Messier made the score 3-2 just 48 seconds into the period. He came out of the penalty box, picked up Craig Muni's breakaway pass at center ice, raced in and beat Glen Hanlon with a backhander. 2-on-1 Rush Jari Kurri then tied the score for Edmonton when he scored from the side of the net at 1:18, capping a 3-on-2 break. Kurri scored his 10th goal of the playoffs after taking a pass from Esa Tikkanen from the right circle. Simpson then produced the winning goal, capping a 2-on-1 rush with Messier after the defenseman Randy Gregg broke up a Detroit rush. Simpson played give-and-go with Messier before taking a pass and beating Hanlon just under the crossbar from the lower right circle. Wayne Gretzky scored into an empty net with 18 seconds remaining and Hanlon on the bench in favor of an extra attacker. Hanlon entered the game early in the second period when the starting goaltender Greg Stefan was hit behind the net by Simpson. Stefan was diagnosed as having a sore neck. John Chabot gave the Red Wings their first lead of the game with the only goal of the first period. Messier tied it early in the second on a power play before Mel Bridgman and Brent Ashton scored later in the second period to give the Red Wings a 3-1 lead. The Wings also played without the left wing Petr Klima, their goal-scoring leader in the playoffs; the center Shawn Burr and the defenseman Gilbert Delorme. All were out with injuries suffered in Tuesday night's 4-1 loss to the Oilers. Before tonight, the Red Wings had been 7-0 in games when they led going into the third period. The Red Wings, who didn't reach double figures in shots in the first game until the third period, played more aggressively this time and took a 1-0 lead after the first 20 minutes, outshooting the Oilers, 12-9, and carrying the play for most of the period. Chabot put the Red Wings up by 1-0 when he swept a backhander from the lower right circle past the Edmonton goaltender, Grant Fuhr. Bob Probert carried the puck out from behind the goal line to set up Chabot's fourth goal of the playoffs. The Oilers tied the score on Messier's power-play goal at 5:24 of the second period. Messier deflected in a shot from the top of the right circle by Gretzky for his sixth power-play goal of the playoffs and eighth over all. The score came just 46 seconds after Hanlon replaced Stefan. Bridgman put the Red Wings ahead when he took a breakaway pass from Darren Veitch at the Oilers' blue line, came in alone and beat Fuhr from about 10 feet at 15:20.

738-> No Headline
A field of 17 3-year-olds was entered today for the 114th Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs Saturday, and the luck of the draw put two of the favorites in the outside posts. Private Terms, unbeaten in seven starts and the 5-2 morning-line favorite, will break from post 16, and Forty Niner, last year's champion 2-year-old, will break from post 17. Private Terms, who usually drops back off the pace, will need a superb ride to avoid being forced wide in early traffic under Chris Antley, who is riding in his first Derby. Fast Pace Seems Likely Forty Niner's outside post seems to insure a lively Derby pace. Pat Day will have to gun the Mr. Prospector colt from the start to clear the field, setting up a potential early duel with Winning Colors, the front-running filly who will start from post 11. ''I've got the filly right where I want her, inside of me,'' Woody Stephens, Forty Niner's trainer, said a bit gleefully after the draw. ''She'll be feeling some heat. Forty Niner's the fastest-breaking horse in America. He just might break a length in front and say, 'Move over, boys.' '' Another potential front-runner is Din's Dancer, who missed his final Derby prep race because of a virus but has recovered to the satisfaction of his trainer, Jack Van Berg, who sent out Alysheba to win last year's Derby. Din's Dancer, who set quick fractions before tiring late in the Rebel Handicap last month, will break from post 9. Lively One and Intensive Command, both bred and owned by Nelson Bunker Hunt, will run for the first time in the name of Thomas J. Curnes, Hunt's son-in-law, under a lease arrangement connected to Hunt's bankruptcy proceedings in Texas. Lively One is trained by Charlie Whittingham, who won the 1986 Derby with Ferdinand, and Intensive Command is handled by John Campo, who won the 1981 Derby with Pleasant Colony. Private Terms Made the Favorite Mike Battaglia, the Churchill Downs linemaker, today made Private Terms the 5-2 morning-line favorite and Winning Colors the second choice at 3-1. Private Terms will try to become the fifth undefeated horse to win the Derby and the first since Seattle Slew in 1977. Winning Colors would become the third filly to win the Derby, following Regret in 1915 and Genuine Risk in 1980. Stephens, who won the 1974 Derby with Cannonade and the 1984 edition with Swale, will send out both Forty Niner and Cefis, and his entry is rated the third choice on the line at 5-1. Next at 6-1 is Risen Star, followed by Seeking the Gold at 8-1, Brian's Time at 12-1, Proper Reality at 15-1, the entry of Lively One and Intensive Command at 15-1, and Granacus, Kingpost and Jim's Orbit each at 30-1. Battaglia designated a mutuel field consisting of Din's Dancer, Purdue King, Regal Classic and Sea Trek and made that four-horse coupling 15-to-1. The mile-and-a-quarter Derby will offer a purse of $786,200, of which $611,200 will go to the winner. First Leg of Triple Crown The Derby begins the Triple Crown, which has been won 11 times but not since Affirmed edged Alydar three times in 1978. The three-race series, which concludes with the Preakness Stakes at Pimlico May 21 and the Belmont Stakes in New York June 11, offers bonuses instituted last year that would bring a crown winner's overall take, including purses, to $5 million. That total includes a $1 million bonus that will go to the horse who compiles the best overall record in the series while contesting all three races. Last year, Bet Twice won that bonus for finishing second to Alysheba in the Derby and Preakness and then winning the Belmont, where Alysheba finished fourth. New Yorkers can legally bet the Derby both at OTB outlets and at Aqueduct race track, which will share a betting pool and offer the same 12 betting interests as Churchill Downs. The Derby will be televised by ABC on a 90-minute broadcast beginning at 4:30 P.M., with post time scheduled for 5:42. The National Weather Service predicts clear skies for the Derby and temperatures reaching into the 80's. Several Derby horses had their final blowouts today, all at half a mile. Forty Niner, Brian's Time and Lively One were timed in 50 seconds, and Cefis went in 49 1/5. Several others will have three-furlong blowouts Friday. 114TH KENTUCKY DERBY/3-YEAR-OLDS. 1 1/4 MILES.

740-> Officer Recounts Gunplay in Inwood Raid
A police officer in a drug raid in the Inwood area in which a sergeant was slain gave the first eyewitness account yesterday of the shooting, quietly testifying about the gunplay. In nearly an hour's testimony in Criminal Court in Manhattan, the officer, John Huvane, gave a halting but chilling shot-by-shot account of the bedroom struggle that resulted in the wounding of a suspect and the death of Sgt. John F. McCormick on April 27. In a low monotone that court officials strained to hear, Officer Huvane told how he shot Mercedes Perez twice and how she tried to kill him with a snub-nose black revolver. The court was holding a hearing to determine whether there was enough evidence against Ms. Perez to sustain charges of attempted murder of a police officer. 'She Kept Coming at Me' ''I saw her point the gun toward me,'' Officer Huvane said. ''She kept coming at me. I heard more shots. I heard a click. I heard clicking, clicking. I thought I was dead.'' The police said the clicking sound signaled that Ms. Perez's gun was misfiring. Officer Huvane said he was in the raid on the Perez apartment at 24 Sickles Street in upper Manhattan and broke down the door with a sledgehammer, shouting, ''Police, police,'' as he rushed into the apartment with other officers, including James Curran and Sergeant McCormick. The raiders were not in uniform, although Officer Huvane wore a bulletproof vest with the word police in large white letters. ''I saw a small pit bull in the kitchen and a woman run into the bedroom,'' Officer Huvane said. As he reached the bedroom door and grabbed the fleeing woman to throw her back into the living room, he testified, he saw another woman behind the partly open bedroom door. ''She had a gun in her left hand and was pointing it at my body, about a foot away,'' he said. ''I was shouting, 'Police, police,' and yelling for her to drop the gun. ''I blocked her gun from my face with my right hand. At that time, she fired once at me. And I fired two shots.'' ''How far were you from her?'' an assistant district attorney, Gregory Waples, asked. ''About two feet,'' Officer Huvane said. ''I observed her still coming at me with the gun. I then stepped back and lost my balance and fell back on a bed.'' Officer Huvane said that Ms. Perez, despite being hit twice in the abdomen and right arm, ''still kept coming, and I fired one more shot to stop her.'' ''She again pointed her gun at my head,'' he recounted. ''She was still coming at me and I closed my eyes. I heard more shots. I saw her wanting to kill me. She was still pointing her gun at the top of my body, and I closed my eyes.'' ''Before that, did you hit her?'' Mr. Waples asked. ''I believe I did.'' ''How many times?'' ''I believe twice.'' ''Where did you fire at her?'' ''I just fired at her torso.'' ''I fired to stop her from killing me. I was trying to survive.'' Total of Seven Shots With that testimony, Officer Huvane, wearing at gray suit, white shirt and a yellow tie, paused and sighed deeply. He looked quizzically at Ms. Perez, sitting 15 feet away at the defense table with her right arm in a blue sling. All told, the police said, seven shots were fired, three by Officer Huvane, two of which struck Ms. Perez; two by Officer Curran, and two by Ms. Perez. The police determined that one shot by either Officers Huvane or Curran killed Sgt. McCormick. Later, Officer Huvane used a diagram of the apartment on a board to describe how he and about 12 other officers had been deployed. He said Officer Curran, who followed him into the apartment, tried to save his life when he was shot at by pushing Ms. Perez away and jumping on top of him as he lay on the bed. ''Jimmy jumped on me to save me,'' Office Huvane said. ''He thought I was shot.'' ''Were you hit?'' Officer Huvane was asked. ''Thank God, no. But I had powder burns on me.'' Order of Judge He testified that when the shooting ended, ''I felt my face, my hands, and pulled up my bulletproof vest, to see if there was any blood.'' Judge William Leibovitz ordered Ms. Perez, 23 years old, held on a charge of attempted murder of a police officer, which carries a possible life prison term on conviction, as well as on charges of aggravated assault and weapons offenses. But he dismissed a drug charge because although police report said there were trace of cocaine, not enough was found to sustain a felony indictment. Similar charges against the other woman in the apartment, Maritza Batista, were dismissed. Hours after Ms. Perez was shot, she gave birth to a girl at Presbyterian Hospital, where the child remains in stable condition. Ms. Perez has recovered from her wounds and is in jail.

746-> BASEBALL; PIRATES LOSE, 4-2; FALL 2 GAMES BACK
Mickey Hatcher's two-run, pinch-hit double in the seventh inning broke a 1-1 tie and Tim Belcher pitched five and a third no-hit innings as the Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates, 4-2, tonight. It was the Pirates' second loss in 14 games and it dropped them two games behind the first-place Mets in the National League East. Belcher (7-4) combined with three relievers on a five-hitter as the Dodgers ended a three-game losing streak. The winning rally was set up by two walks from Mike Dunne, the Pirate starter. Dave Rucker relieved Dunne (6-8) after the second walk, to Steve Sax with two out. Hatcher then lined a drive to right-centerfield that glanced off the glove of Andy Van Slyke, the center fielder, who tried to make a diving catch. Belcher (7-4), making just his second start since June 18, did not allow a hit until Barry Bonds singled to right with one out in the sixth. Belcher was removed for a pinch-hitter after six innings. Alejandro Pena allowed a run in the seventh, the first run he had allowed in 22 and two-thirds innings. Jay Howell retired the last four batters, striking out two, to earn his 11th save. Reds 4, Expos 1 CINCINNATI (AP) - A botched rundown by Montreal and a run-scoring single by Eric Davis gave Cincinnati a 2-0 lead in the first inning, and Danny Jackson won for the seventh time in his last nine starts as he scattered seven hits over eight innings. Jackson (12-5) struck out six and walked three, pitching out of trouble frequently in the early innings. John Franco worked the ninth and earned his 18th save. Franco, who has a victory and nine saves in his last 10 outings, has saved eight of the last nine Cincinnati victories. Cubs 5, Padres 4 CHICAGO (AP) - Manny Trillo scored the winning run from second base in the 11th inning for Chicago when Roberto Alomar dropped a pickoff attempt. Trillo led off the 11th against Lance McCullers (1-6) with a single and went to second on a sacrifice bunt. With two outs, Damon Berryhill was walked intentionally and when Alomar dropped a pickoff attempt by Benito Santiago, the catcher, the ball rolled into center field as Trillo came around to score. Frank DiPino (1-3) worked two scoreless innings for the victory. Tony Gwynn had a run-scoring single in the eighth to cut the Cubs lead to a run. He has a 17-game hitting streak and is hitting .500, 36 for 72, during that time. Cardinals 4, Giants 2 ST. LOUIS (AP) - Jose Oquendo hit a two-run homer with one out in the 11th inning as St. Louis gained its fourth straight victory. With one out in the 11th, Mike Laga singled off Craig Lefferts (2-7), and Oquendo hit the next pitch to left for his third homer. Dan Quisenberry (1-0), the fourth St. Louis pitcher, worked one inning for his first National League victory. Astros 5, Phillies 3 HOUSTON (AP) - Glenn Davis hit a three-run homer to give him a league-leading 74 runs batted in as Houston gained its fifth straight victory and 10th in 12 games. The Astros hit a homer for the 10th game in a row, tying a club record. Bob Knepper (10-3) gave up six hits, walked four and struck out a season-high eight in six innings. Danny Darwin pitched three hitless innings to earn his third save. Twins 6, Orioles 1 MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - Frank Viola pitched eight scoreless innings and became baseball's first 16-game winner as the Twins ended a three-game losing streak. Viola (16-2) won his seventh-straight start and remained unbeaten in 19 decisions at the Metrodome since May 22, 1987. He gave up five hits, lowered his league-leading earned run average to 2.18, struck out six and walked three. Brewers 2, Rangers 1 MILWAUKEE (AP) - Dale Sveum tripled home the tying run and scored the winning run on B. J. Surhoff's single in the ninth inning. Jeff Russell held the Brewers to three singles before Billy Jo Robidoux opened ninth with a single. Mitch Williams relieved and Sveum hit the first pitch off the top of the left-field wall. With the outfield in, Surhoff followed with a fly ball over Oddibe McDowell, in center field, for the game-winner. Chuck Crim (3-4) pitched the ninth inning and got the victory. Williams fell to 1-3.

747-> AFTER THE CONVENTION; DUKAKIS SETS OUT TO PARLAY UNITY INTO FALL VICTORY
After meeting here this morning with the Rev. Jesse Jackson's supporters, Michael S. Dukakis and his running mate, Lloyd Bentsen, set out to do battle with Vice President Bush. On the morning after the flag-waving finale of the 40th Democratic National Convention, Mr. Dukakis told Mr. Jackson and his supporters: ''We need you. We want you. We can't win without you.'' Then he and Mr. Bentsen boarded a campaign plane together for a cross-country swing as they began their drive to take on the Republicans in crucial battlegrounds like Texas, California and the Farm Belt. [ Page 8. ] Seats on National Committee In Atlanta, the Democratic Party finished up some of the critical business of unity, electing 10 of Mr. Jackson's supporters, including his eldest son, to positions on the Democratic National Committee. Those posts were fruits of Mr. Dukakis's political bargain with Mr. Jackson, who only days ago was feuding with the Massachusetts Governor. Eight Dukakis backers were elected, too. Mr. Dukakis's decision to make his first stop this morning in the camp of his vanquished rival for the Democratic Presidential nomination was a vivid illustration of what the party chairman, Paul G. Kirk Jr., called the most united and broadest coalition the Democrats have put together in years. ''We have 110 days, and I hope we can enlist every single one of you in this cause,'' Mr. Dukakis told Mr. Jackson's delegates. ''The stakes are very high. We can't take another four years of what we've been going through for the last eight.'' Rival Camp's 'Duke' Chant Mr. Dukakis and even Mr. Bentsen, who was selected over Mr. Jackson as the running mate, were well received by Mr. Jackson's delegates, who broke into a chant of ''Duke! Duke! Duke!'' ''Even when you're hurting, you can forge forward,'' said one delegate, Sam Velazquez, a housing coordinator from Syracuse, N.Y. Mr. Jackson urged his supporters to back the fall ticket because he had been promised ''access to where policies are made and priorities are set.'' He said he would work for the ticket but would also keep the ''street heat'' on both Mr. Dukakis and Mr. Bentsen when necessary. Mr. Jackson said that having Senator Bentsen on the ticket was good because it would mean he would have to relinquish some of his conservative positions for the sake of party discipline, an idea the Texas Senator may not agree with. Speech Regained Center Stage Mr. Dukakis's first day on the campaign trail as the Democratic nominee came after an acceptance speech that stirred the delegates and stunned those who had dismissed him as a cold and wooden orator. The speech helped him seize back center stage from Mr. Jackson. Even Mr. Bush, who is to be nominated by the Republican convention next month, praised Mr. Dukakis's address. While campaigning in Milwaukee, Mr. Bush said, ''He did a very good job,'' adding, with an eye to the fall campaign, that the political differences between Mr. Dukakis and Mr. Bentsen were ''enormous.'' Mr. Jackson said he would be campaigning for the Democratic ticket but would remain free to speak his mind. He said his speeches would not be cleared with the campaign, ''I want to be close enough to serve and far enough away to challenge,'' Mr. Jackson said. He said he would take no salary or title in the Dukakis campaign, but he would not rule out a post in a Dukakis administration. ''It's possible,'' he said of a Government job. ''But it's not on my agenda of consideration.'' In bringing Mr. Dukakis and Mr. Bentsen before his delegates, Mr. Jackson acknowledged their disappointment that he was not on the ticket. But he urged them to take the long view. ''If you think there's some agony, some hurt here today,'' Mr. Jackson said, ''try Atlantic City 1964.'' That was the Democratic convention at which blacks had to fight for a handful of seats, as against the more than 900 seats they held here this week. Looking ahead, Mr. Jackson said, ''In our lifetime, you and I will be in the White House.'' To 'Serve' Yet 'Challenge' Even as Mr. Dukakis and Mr. Bentsen sat by his side, Mr. Jackson made no bones about the idea he might run again for the Presidency. ''I don't feel no ways tired,'' said Mr. Jackson, just ending his second race for the nomination. ''Even Reagan ran three times, tired as he was.'' Mr. Jackson is trying both to place some of his supporters into the Dukakis campaign structure and at the same time to preserve some of the local organizations the Jackson campaign established as a source of strength after the election. Black Voting Record A central message of Mr. Jackson's campaign has been that the party cannot take for granted one of its base groups, black voters, even as most party strategists have focused their attention in recent years on the need to win back Southern whites and Northern ethnic voters. While blacks over all, according to the Census Bureau, are slightly less likely to vote than whites are, the gap has been cut in half since 1976 and in some places blacks vote in higher proportions than whites. Nationally 61 percent of whites and 56 percent of blacks told Census Bureau surveyors that they voted in the 1984 election. It is likely that both figures are inflated, but by a similar degree, according to studies of Americans' tendency to exaggerate their participation in elections. Mr. Jackson said he planned to spend much of his time this fall trying to encourage people to register to vote. In party business here growing out of Mr. Dukakis's agreement with Mr. Jackson, Mayor Sidney Barthelemy of New Orleans, a Jackson backer, was elected to a newly created vice chairmanship of the committee, in charge of registration and voter participation. Signaling the party's desire to enfold Mr. Jackson and his backers, Mr. Kirk, the party chairman, himself nominated Jesse Jackson Jr., 23, to fill a vacant spot among the committee's at-large delegates. The committee approved the nomination by acclamation, as it did every other piece of business. Ron Brown, Mr. Jackson's negotiator with the Dukakis campaign, was elected to the party's executive committee, along with Janice Thurmond, a lawyer and Jackson supporter from Athens, Ga. The post of President of the Conference of Democratic Municipal Officials was also made a seat on the Executive Committee. That post is held by Robert Farrell, a Los Angeles City Councilman who supports Mr. Jackson. Additionally, the party agreed to create 18 new at-large posts on the National Committee, for a total of 45. These Jackson supporters filled 10 of those seats: Toney Anaya, former Governor of New Mexico. The Rev. Willie Barrows, executive director of Mr. Jackson's Operation PUSH. Odell Berry, a Colorado businessman. Yolanda Caraway of Washington, D.C., a Jackson staff member. David Claxton, political director of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union. Joel Ferguson, a Detroit businessman. Vivien Davis Figures, a Jackson supporter from Mobile, Ala. Harold Ickes, a Manhattan lawyer who represented Mr. Jackson in the negotiations about the National Committee appointments. May Louie of Massachusetts, a Jackson campaign staff member. Ruth Ann Skaff of Texas, a vocal supporter of the Palestine Liberation Organization. These eight Dukakis supporters filled the other new seats: Richard Alatorre, a Los Angeles City Councilman. Elaine Baker, Secretary of State of Iowa. Susan Brophy, a Dukakis campaign aide. Mary Chambers, minority leader of the New Hampshire House of Representatives. Ray Jordan, a Massachusetts State Representative. Jean O'Leary, a gay rights advocate from Los Angeles. John Sweeney, president of the Service Employees International Union. Verne Watkins, an official of the Association of Federal, State, County and Municipal Employees.

748-> 39 Illegal Social Clubs Closed In Crackdown After a Blaze
Less than a week after six people were killed in a fire in an illegal basement social club in the Bronx last Sunday, a city task force has begun a crackdown on similar clubs, which are scattered across New York City. Thirty-nine of the clubs have been closed - at least temporarily - since the crackdown began Thursday night, a police spokesman, Sgt. Maurice Howard, said. Investigators from the task force began inspecting the illegal clubs, several hundred of which are believed to exist in the city, Thursday and were scheduled to continue the inspections through the weekend. During the first two nights of the inspections, task force members ordered 39 clubs closed until building and fire code violations are corrected. The task force also issued more than 200 summonses for code violations, Sergeant Howard said. Vacate Orders Issued On Friday, 22 clubs were issued vacate orders by the task force, which includes members from the Police, Fire and Buildings Departments. The orders will close the clubs until the violations are corrected, said Larry Simonberg, a spokesman for Mayor Koch. The Mayor promised the crackdown hours after the fatal fire last Sunday at an illegal social club known as ''the hole,'' at 1750 Jerome Avenue in the Morris Heights section of the Bronx. More than 30 people, including a dozen firefighters, were injured when the five-alarm blaze raced through the dimly lighted, narrow club at 12:30 P.M. As many as 100 people may have been inside the club when the accidential fire began. There was mass panic, fire officials and witnesses said, as the patrons fought to escape the blaze through the club's only exit. Yesterday, Mr. Simonberg said many of the clubs that were issued vacate orders on Thursday and Friday had only one exit. On Thursday, 17 clubs were ordered to close because of code violations, Sergeant Howard said. So far, the task force has found and attempted to inspect 213 clubs. Many of them were closed when inspectors arrived. They have been able to enter and examine 62 of the clubs - 31 on Thursday night and 31 on Friday night. On Thursday, 80 summonses were issued by the Fire Department and 45 by the Buildings Department. On Friday, 48 summonses were issued by the Fire Department and 46 were issued by the Buildings Department.

749-> Coping With Medical Waste
THE needles, syringes and other medical waste that have washed up on beaches this summer point to a larger problem confronting every medical institution: how to deal with infectious wastes that are increasingly barred from the hospitals' own incinerators. ''State regulations are becoming extremely stringent,'' said Arthur E. Weintraub, president of NorMet, the regional association that helps hospitals increase their operating effectiveness. ''Many incinerators built recently don't meet current standards.'' But when hospitals must dispose of the wastes off-site, he said, it is ''a situation that represents real economic hardship.'' Using private carters, Mr. Weintraub added, also reduces a hospital's control over the disposal process and ''hospitals are caught in the middle.'' Hospitals want to be leaders in serving community environmental-health needs, Mr. Weintraub said, but ''if they don't have a place to put their infectious wastes, it becomes more than an issue for a single hospital. As a society, we have a problem.'' Mr. Weintraub said the 40 hospitals that are members of his association, which represents a seven-county region including Westchester, have called on state officials to form a task force to study the problem, including finding regional sites for incineration. ''As it is now,'' he said, ''the situation lends itself to violations of the law.'' Local hospitals, the organization's data indicate, are using both methods to dispose of medical waste. Westchester hospitals burned 98,000 pounds of infectious waste in l986, the last year for which figures were available; 54,000 pounds were incinerated on site while 44,000 pounds were shipped out of the county for disposal to sites as far away as South Carolina. Infectious waste, commonly referred to as ''red bag'' waste because state law requires that it be segregated in red disposal bags, includes any surgical, obstetrical or pathological material, Mr. Weintraub said, and all blood-soiled materials. State law requires all such material to be incinerated. Review of Disposal Options Several hospitals in the county are reviewing their disposal options, with some electing to build on-site incinerator units and others hiring private carters. Some hospitals own incinerators that do not comply with existing state regulations and therefore are not supposed to be used. The Westchester Medical Center recently began designing a $2.1 million dollar on-site incinerator. St. Joseph's Hospital in Yonkers will begin construction of a $600,000 plant this month. At the Westchester Medical Center, expenditures for a private carter to ship its infectious wastes to incinerator sites in Virginia and South Carolina have doubled in the last six years, according to Barry Bowman, a hospital spokesman. The cost now averages $600,000 a year. Change at Northern Westchester In Mount Kisco, the Northern Westchester Hospital Center recently abandoned its 14-year-old incinerator in favor of off-site burning in Lawrence, Mass. The move, which doubled the hospital's yearly incineration costs to $300,000 from $150,000, was made because the cost of renovating the incinerator to meet state regulations could not be justified. ''Our people felt more restrictive regulations were on the way,'' said Armando V. Galella, vice president for communications and development. ''It was a question of expectation.'' Those expectations were correct, according to the State Department of Environmental Conservation. New regulations, requiring incinerators to have higher temperatures, more complete burn rates and tighter pollution controls, should be in effect about the end of this year, R. W. Groneman, the agency's spokesman, said. Of the 300 on-site infectious-waste incinerators in New York State, Mr. Groneman said, ''almost none would comply with these new regulations and only a few could be retrofitted to bring them on-line.'' Meeting the new regulations - including the installation of ''scrubbers,'' or large filters necessary to control pollution - will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, Mr. Groneman said. Not Easy to Find Sites> The hospitals and laboratories that own their incinerators will have until l992 to bring their facilities into compliance or to find alternatives, Mr. Groneman said. Although his department ''envisions regional facilities for the disposal of infectious wastes,'' he conceded that finding such sites would be difficult. ''Garbage is a fact of life,'' he said. ''You know the old not-in-my-backyard threat? Well, these sites must be in somebody's backyard.'' In New Rochelle, where nearly all the city's beaches have been closed for varying periods this summer, administrators at the New Rochelle Hospital speak with pride of their $440,000 waste-to-energy incinerator. ''We sleep rather restfully knowing our infectious wastes are not ending up in Long Island Sound,'' said John N. Kastanis, vice president and operating officer for the hospital. Installed in l986 with the help of a grant from the Department of Energy, the incinerator supplies 60 percent of the hospital's energy needs. ''It was considered the newest thing,'' Mr. Kastanis said, when it was built. Maintenance is sometimes a problem and neighbors have occasionally complained, Mr. Kastanis said, but ''if this incinerator starts to generate any type of pollution, we stop burning.'' Meeting existing state regulations has not been a problem, Mr. Kastanis said, but more stringent regulations would force the hospital to begin using private carters. At the moment, he said: ''On-site incineration is the lesser of two evils. I wouldn't feel comfortable knowing others were handling my infectious wastes.'' One of the Largest Haulers The Northern Westchester Hospital Center in Mount Kisco has a service contract with the Merrimack Valley Medical Service Company of Valley Cottage, N.Y., a subsidiary of the Houston-based Browning Ferris Industries. The company is one of the three largest waste haulers in the world, a company spokesman said. It is licensed by the state to haul and incinerate hospital wastes. Company regulations governing the disposal process are equal to or exceed state requirements, the spokesman, John Sullivan, said, and hospital representatives agreed. Each ''red bag'' of hospital waste is sealed in double red liners and placed in corrugated boxes. The boxes are numbered and weighed and identified on a manifest that both the carter and hospital must sign. The tracking system that accompanies each daily shipment continues in Lawrence, Mass., at a company incinerator, where the manifest is verified and signed, with copies returned to the hospital's infection-control committee. ''We know our infectious wastes must be burned, and they are burned,'' Mr. Galella said. ''They cannot be dumped.'' The hospitals' decision to hire a carter, Mr. Gallella said, involved something of a ''guesstimate.'' Hospital costs are higher now, Mr. Gallella said, but he added: ''By the early l990's, we believe our costs will be less than at other hospitals. But it's a toss of the coin.''

751-> Blood Bank Loses Bid To Keep a Name Secret
A blood bank has lost an effort to protect the identity of a donor whose blood may have been tainted with the AIDS virus. The South Carolina Supreme Court dismissed an appeal of an order requiring the Carolina-Georgia Blood Bank to identify the donor, whose blood was used in a transfusion three years ago for a woman who died earlier this year during treatment for AIDS-related symptoms. Lawsuits filed by the estate and husband of the 74-year-old woman, Daisy Lee Young, maintain that she contracted acquired immune deficiency syndrome from the transfusion, which she received at Self Memorial Hospital in Greenwood after a 1985 hip operation. A circuit judge ruled in May that the blood bank had to release the name of the donor, but it appealed, saying the donor's right to privacy outweighed the plaintiffs' interests. The Supreme Court refused the case July 8. Scientists say a blood screening test that came into use in 1985 has now virtually eliminated the risk of AIDS from a transfusion.

752-> Washington Talk: The Cabinet; As Reagan Clock Ticks, Thornburgh's Pounds
For an Attorney General of the United States, Dick Thornburgh may have the ideal resume: lawyer, former United States Attorney, former head of the Justice Department's criminal division, former Governor, Ivy League academic. In a sense, he has been in training all his professional life to run the Justice Department. But now that he has the job - his nomination was approved unanimously by the Senate last month - he has a very real predicament. The Reagan Presidency ends next January, which could leave Mr. Thornburgh with only five months to make his mark on the Justice Department, to do whatever it is that could give his tenure as Attorney General a place in history. Nor is it his problem alone: Two other new arrivals to the Reagan Cabinet face the same ticking clock: Nicholas F. Brady, a Wall Street banker who is the new Secretary of the Treasury, and Lauro F. Cavazos, chosen to be the new Secretary of Education. Special Pressure Cited ''It's a tough one,'' said Raymond E. Miles, dean of the School of Business Administration at the University of California, Berkeley, who is a management specialist. ''On the one hand, everything is working against them. In most large organizations, you don't move in a hurry. You need time.'' ''But I suppose on the other hand,'' he said, ''What have you got to lose? There's a certain freedom in temporariness.'' Indeed, Mr. Thornburgh seems altogether relaxed about what may be a very short stay at the Justice Department. He says he has no guarantee that he would remain as Attorney General should Vice President Bush be elected to the White House in November. ''If it's five months or five years, I'm going to do my best to provide leadership for this department,'' the Attorney General said in a recent interview at the Justice Department, his wood-paneled office still littered with unpacked boxes. ''The President made clear to me that he wants me to assume this office in a vigorous way and that it is my operation to run.'' Better than most politicans, Mr. Thornburgh understands that a reputation can be made - or lost - in a matter of days. It was only a few weeks after Mr. Thornburgh was sworn in as Governor of Pennsylvania at Harrisburg in 1979 that the nuclear accident at the Three Mile Island power plant just below the state capital on the Susquehanna River turned him into something of a national celebrity. He was subsequently hailed for his calm and intelligence. '24 Hours Is a Lifetime' ''As an old politican once told me, 'In this business, 24 hours is a lifetime,' '' he said. Management specialists say the situation faced by Messrs. Thornburgh, Brady and Cavazos has parallels in the business world. On Wall Street, several executive-search firms have begun specializing in so-called executive temp services, meaning they will provide experienced managers to fill openings of a year or less, perhaps to assist a large company through a business crisis. The advice from the management experts is clear: Whether in government or industry, they say, managers whose assignments may last only a few months should limit their agenda and reassure the bureaucracy. ''In a few months you can't hope to conquer a huge agency,'' said Reuben R. McDaniel, a professor of management at the Graduate School of Business at the University of Texas in Austin. ''You've got to offer some comfort to the people who remain, express some confidence in the system. If you attempt to remake the world, the bureaucracy will rebel. And then your tenure will be little but conflict and confrontation.'' Mr. Thornburgh seems to be following that advice closely. In public remarks since his nomination, he has repeatedly complimented and attempted to reassure Justice Department officials who remained after the much-publicized departure of Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d. No Sign of Wholesale Shift While Mr. Thornburgh is expected to bring aboard a number of senior aides who worked with him at the statehouse in Pennsylvania, there is no sign of a wholesale shift in the leadership of the Justice Department. Next, the management specialists say, comes the hard part for Mr. Thornburgh and his deputies: selecting a project that can be completed before next January but will remembered long after they have departed from the Justice Department. Thomas L. Whisler, a professor of business policy at the University of Chicago, said the Attorney General ''should order a very fast review of recent history,'' including, ''Were there good projects under Meese that never got completed, things that were just about ready to go and that you could push out before the election?'' ''There's nothing wrong with taking credit for something your predecessor did,'' Professor Whisler said. ''They do it in business all the time.'' Mr. Thornburgh has already announced that his chief priority as Attorney General will be drug enforcement. Professor McDaniel of Texas said he would advice the Attorney General to resist the temptation to establish broad new policies on drug abuse. ''He should look to that one good research program, to that small group of people in the bureaucracy with good ideas he can funnel some money to,'' the professor said. Mr. Thornburgh and his new colleagues in the Cabinet might also consider a long talk with others who have faced short tenures in earlier administrations. John A. Knebel, for example, was Secretary of Agriculture in the last 108 days of the Ford Administration; his predecessor, Earl L. Butz, resigned under fire after news reports that he had told a racist joke in private. Now president of the American Mining Congress, a trade association for the mining industry, Mr. Knebel said he saw his role in his three months in President Ford's Cabinet as ''keeping my hand on the rudder and the train on the track.'' ''We were in a very prosperous period as far as agriculture as concerned, so there really weren't any major problems or any need for new initiatives,'' he said. ''My feeling was that if you didn't try to do too damned much, you'd probably get more done.'' Mr. Knebel said there was one overriding advantage in such a short tenure: no time to make serious mistakes, or serious enemies. ''My predecessor once told me that I was the only Secretary of Agriculture who wasn't hung in effigy,'' Mr. Knebel said. ''And I think it's true.''

754-> After the Convention; Dukakis, in Texas, Opens Five-State Campaign Swing
Michael S. Dukakis, elated over the reviews of his rousing address to the Democratic National Convention, embarked on the first official trip of the general election campaign today, choosing the critical state of Texas as his first stop. At a rally this afternoon in McAllen, Tex., the Democratic Presidential nominee gave a preview of his political strategy for a state whose 29 electoral votes figure prominently in his plans for a victory this fall. The elements were simple. There was Senator Lloyd Bentsen beaming at his side, his running-mate and a proud native son. There was the basic economic message, a promise of ''full employment'' that is particularly compelling in a region like the Rio Grande Valley, where McAllen is situated. And there was the fluent and easy oratory in Spanish, from both Mr. Bentsen and Mr. Dukakis, which delighted an audience that included many Hispanics. 'That's America, Folks' The Massachusetts Governor, who spoke movingly about his Greek immigrant parents to the Democratic convention Thursday night, told his audience today that Mr. Bentsen was the grandson of immigrants. ''A son of immigrants and a grandson of immigrants - that's America, folks,'' Mr. Dukakis told an audience that had waited patiently in the blistering heat to hear the new Democratic nominee. Mr. Bentsen's grandfather emigrated from Denmark. Aides said Mr. Dukakis was glowing from the reaction to his speech Thursday night, when he formally accepted the Democratic nomination. Hoping to build on that burst of favorable notice, he began a five-state campaign swing that will also take in California, North Dakota, Missouri and Pensylvania. Tom Cosgrove, Mr. Dukakis's top political operative in Texas, said the campaign intended to open a headquarters in the state within a week. ''Bush can no longer come to Texas like a tourist,'' Mr. Cosgrove said of the state that the likely Republican nominee claims as his home. ''We're going to run an aggressive campaign.'' 'We Need Your Help' In McAllen, Mr. Dukakis underscored that point. ''I'm not going to kid you,'' he told an audience of about 1,000, that gathered beneath a banner reading, ''Bienvenidos,'' and where he was serenaded by a mariachi band. ''You know how important to us Texas is going to be,'' he said. ''And we need your help.'' At a news conference after the rally, Mr. Dukakis was relentlessly upbeat about the convention and the campaign to come. He said that neither he nor Mr. Bentsen ''have ever been to a convention where there was more diversity and more fundamental agreement.'' And, he said, he would continue to resist any efforts by Mr. Bush to paint him as a liberal. ''If the Vice President wants to spend all his time talking about labels, he can do so,'' Mr. Dukakis said. But the Governor asserted, as he did Thursday night, that the election was not about ideological labels but about competence. From McAllen, Mr. Dukakis and Mr. Bentsen headed to Houston, where they addressed a huge outdoor rally in a downtown park. Mr. Dukakis declared: ''The Republicans are a little confused. They don't know what to make of this ticket. And they are a little worried, I'll tell you, because they know we are not going to concede one single state of the 50 this fall.'' The crowd was awash in blue Dukakis-Bentsen signs, although there were a healthy number of Bush signs in the back.

755-> Corporate Training: From A B C's to Z
''WE wanted to promote one of our good employees, a materials handler who had been with us for five years, to a better job, as supervisor,'' said Stephen J. Rodgers, personnel director at the Rawlplug Company in New Rochelle. ''But when it came to filling out the forms, he couldn't do them. And he couldn't complete what was essentially a third-grade math problem, either.'' Rawlplug, manufacturers of masonry anchors used in the construction industry, has about 125 employees and most of them are blue-collar workers. Mr. Rodgers, who is also director of the Westchester Personnel Management Association, is trying to get Westchester companies to band together to draft a plan to teach illiterate workers. ''Companies are spending millions of dollars on training, but only a fraction of the dollars is being spent to reach 72 million Americans who can't read,'' Mr. Rodgers said, explaining why he is spearheading a drive to alert the business community to the dangers of illiteracy in the workplace. Some Cases in Point ''Every company has its horror story of some unfortunate incident that was caused by an employee who couldn't read,'' Mr. Rodgers said. ''In our own case, there was a branch manager who made a $12,000 error in basic math that caused an $8,000 shortage in the account of a customer. But that was minor compared to the case of a Western feedlot operator who misread a label and killed a pen full of prize cattle by giving them poison instead of grain.'' Mr. Rodgers said the Business Council for Effective Literacy, a corporate-sponsored group headquartered in Manhattan, has documented hundreds of such cases in which employees misordered millions of dollars in parts, overpaid bills and endangered workplace safety because they didn't have reading and math skills necessary to function. ''Illiteracy has become an economic time bomb,'' he said. ''As other countries raise their literacy standards, ours have dropped. It's getting so bad that it's threatening our ability to compete in the world market.'' Workplace Illiteracy Is Costly As an example, Mr. Rodgers cited the experience of The New York Telephone Company, which discovered in 1987 that 84 percent of its New York City applicants flunked the entry-level exam that included basic questions on vocabulary and numerical relationships. According to a study made by the Institute for Study of Adult Literacy at Penn State University, workplace illiteracy is costing at least $225 billion a year, said Mr. Rodgers, a former remedial-reading teacher who worked in the Yonkers public-school system. ''But on the bright side,'' he said, ''many Westchester companies are aware of the problem'' and are willing to have their representatives attend seminars on combating illiteracy. He added: ''Other companies are beginning to contribute money to community-literacy efforts and have hired tutors to help disadvantaged workers. Companies here are sophisticated and aware that it is in their long-term interest to have an adaptable and educated workforce.'' But combating illiteracy is just one of the goals of corporate training programs. With the tight job market that exists in Westchester, other personnel directors in the county said their training and development programs were essential, both to retain employees and to attract good new ones. ''Well-trained employees will give a company a competitive edge,'' said David M. Gilman, manager of training and development for the Merrill Lynch Realty/Relocation Management Division in White Plains. ''Our in-house training programs are geared to two different groups of employees. One is for new employees, of whom many are new to the relocation field. They are required to take 40 hours of instruction in all aspects of relocation and real estate during our normal business hours. The other program is for our seasoned employees who have the ability and desire to move ahead in the company.'' Self-Instruction Has a Part Mr. Gilman's department has a staff of seven full-time instructors who work in two well-equipped classrooms to train two to five employees a year. Self-instruction, using specific video programs in conjunction with workbooks, is also part of the training program. Training costs Merrill Lynch about 3 to 5 percent of its employees' salary, Mr. Gilman said. ''You base it on an average salary of $35,000; it costs the company about $1,750 to train each employee.'' A company making such a sizable investment in training its employees, hopes to retain them, said Mr. Gilman, who explained that Merrill Lynch Relocation's management development program had advancement as its goal. ''Our employees know they have an opportunity to get ahead and that leads to a stable workforce. We don't have too many job hoppers, and turnover is low.'' In addition to formal classroom training, Merrill Lynch Relocation also spends money on on-the-job training, for such things as new computer automation systems. ''We'll also assign an experienced employee to a new employee to help speed up the training process,'' Mr. Gilman said. A Focus on Retention When a company is at the top, with the largest portion of the market share in its field, it focuses on retaining people, said Gail Robinson, manager of human resources and development at Pepsico Food Service International, a division of Pepsico, whose headquarters are in Purchase. ''In the snack food and the Mexican food market, we're at the top, and our success is largely due to the efforts of our people,'' Ms. Robinson said. ''When you have good people you want to keep them. In my division, the philosophy is that people can be developed best right on the job. We have a lean staffing structure with fewer layers of management than most large companies. ''A big part of the job in my office is to identify people who are able to move ahead in the company - by creating what we call a 'coaching culture' in which people get a candid appraisal of their skills in addition to feedback on how they are perceived in the workplace. Management workshops help them develop further. Potential leaders are encouraged to learn new skills.'' Ms. Robinson cited the career of one of the company's senior managers, John Daly, as an example. Mr. Daly, who is in his early 30's, is a senior manager of the Taco Bell restaurant chain in Canada. ''He joined the company eight years ago as a real-estate representative for locating restaurant sites,'' she said. ''He knew nothing about restaurants, but he had leadership quality so he was quickly promoted into overseeing the construction and building of restaurants and then promoted to general manager.'' Mr. Daly was then moved to the Pizza Hut division to learn the franchise side of the operation, Ms. Robinson continued, and after six months of training with Pizza Hut, he was sent back to Canada. ''He's now in a job of senior manager there.'' Richard C. Conant is the manager for human resources development at Texaco corporate headquarters in White Plains. His department is in charge of training programs for about 27,000 Texaco managerial, nonunion and nontechnical employees. ''Training is given to all Texaco employees, as part of employee career opportunity,'' Mr. Conant said. ''In a big company like ours, employees are encouraged by management to reach their full potential. For instance, we have eight courses in developing skills such as writing and negotiating and four courses in management development that deal with such things as teaching supervisors and managers how to get along as a team.'' Career Goals Discussed Courses at Texaco are held in two on-premise classrooms. Nine full-time instructors are employed by the company. ''Two are in White Plains and seven in Houston,'' Mr. Conant said. ''Employees discuss career goals with their managers and then they are encouraged to take courses in order to acquire the skills necessary for advancement.'' Saying that the Texaco method is a good way to retain employees, Mr. Conant noted that he was his own best example. ''I started with the company as a salesman selling consumer products, namely grease and oil, 23 years ago in Tallahassee, Fla.,'' he said. ''Along the line I was encouraged by managers to develop my writing skills and I took a course that taught me how to write more concisely. ''They then encouraged me to get into personnel,'' he said. ''Soon afterward I was sent abroad as a personnel employee in Europe and Africa and on coming back to White Plains was made assistant personnel manager for Europe, until I was named to my present job in January.''

756-> Yanks Trade for Phelps
The Yankees today finally landed the left-handed power hitter they have been pursuing since last winter, but the acquisition of Ken Phelps from Seattle is likely to create complications in the lineup. Manager Lou Piniella was enthusiastic about the deal that sent Jay Buhner and Rick Balabon, a minor league pitcher, to the Mariners, even though it means Piniella will have to find ways to play Phelps, a designated hitter who has 14 home runs and a .284 average this season. Piniella indicated that the solution might involve Jack Clark, Dave Winfield, Rickey Henderson and Don Mattingly. ''What we'll try to do is rest Winfield a day a week, Henderson a day a week and Clark a day a week,'' he said. ''Another option is to put Phelps at first and move Mattingly to the outfield.'' Phelps, who will turn 34 years old next month, will play only against right-handed pitching. He is the Mariners' career leader in homers with 105. Buhner struggled this season in three stays with the Yankees, hitting .188 and going 1 for 30 in his last stint, including 15 strikeouts. Balabon had a 1-1 with the Class A Fort Lauderdale affiliate. The Mariners will also receive a minor league player to be determined.

757-> WINE TALK
HERE is a suggestion for a wine lover who has nothing to do this month or next: come to France for the Ledoyen wine auction. Ledoyen, a Paris landmark, closed a year ago this month. It had been a restaurant since Antoine-Nicolas Doyen opened it in 1792, in almost the same location in the flower-filled gardens at the foot of the Champs-Elysees. Ledoyen will reopen, probably in December, under the tutelage of the ubiquitous Regine, the prominent nightclub and restaurant owner, but meanwhile its wine collection will be sold. Ledoyen was known to have a formidable wine cellar, but just how formidable came to light only after it had been appraised by the auctioneer, Jean-Jacques Mathias, and his consultant, Jean-Claude Jambon, wine steward at Faugeron, another prominent restaurant. Mr. Mathias believes it will be the largest wine auction ever held in France, involving as it does some 160,000 bottles. To accommodate wine enthusiasts from all over the world, the auction will be spread over two months. The wines are to be exhibited Sept. 19 and 20 at the Hotel Drouot, this city's principal auction house. The first sale will begin at the Drouot on Sept. 20. Subsequently, portions of the Ledoyen cellar will be sold on several dates: Sept. 21-23, Sept. 26-30 and Oct. 24-26. Anyone may bid by mail, by telephone or through an agent present at the auction. But wine lovers who plan to come to Paris to bid may have trouble choosing their dates. For example, someone who hopes to pick up a couple of the 15 cases of Chateau Calon-Segur 1961, scheduled to go on the block Sept. 20, will have to return on Oct. 26 if he or she also fancies some of the 242 cases of Chateau Malescasse 1982. Suggested opening bid on the Calon-Segur will be about $450 a case; on the Malescasse about $700 for 10 cases, the minimum lot. The 7 cases and 10 bottles of Chateau Mouton-d'Armailhacq 1928 will be up for bid only on Sept. 30, and the 13 cases of magnums and 1 case of regular bottles of Krug Grande Cuvee Champagne will be sold only on Sept. 28. The Mouton-d'Armailhacq, which is now known as Mouton-Baronne-Philippe, will open at about $1,250 a case; the Krug at about $225 a case. Many of the wines to be offered are not the sort of rare old bottles that most of us associate with wine auctions. In Europe auctions serve as secondary market for quantities of wine that for one reason or another have not moved through the market. The 242 cases of Chateau Malescasse are a good example; in addition to the 242 cases of the 1982 vintage, the Ledoyen stocks also include 75 cases of the 1979 vintage and about 90 cases of the 1975. Few collectors, if any, will be interested in these wines because they are young, because they are being sold in large lots - a minimum of 10 cases in most instances - and because Chateau Malescasse is not even a ''classified growth'' of Bordeaux but a ''cru bourgeois.'' But another restaurateur or a consortium of restaurateurs might just jump at the chance to own these wines. Malescasse is a reputable wine and, because 1982 was such a good vintage, it can be sold at a good price. Another item, 2,088 bottles of 1985 Macon-Villages, to be sold in two-case lots, has a suggested opening bid of about $45 a case. A restaurant owner, retailer or local wine enthusiasts could go after those if they just happen to need a few cases of white wine. This is not to say that the connoisseur is being ignored at the Ledoyen sale. On Sept. 29 eight bottles of Chateau Haut-Brion 1918 will go on sale, as well as nine cases and eight bottles of the extremely rare wartime vintage, 1943. The following day hundreds of bottles of Chateau Gruaud-Larose will be sold - from 2 cases and 4 bottles of the 1916, 10 bottles of the 1928 and 9 cases of the 1949 to 25 cases of the 1982, including 8 in magnums. Opening bids will range from about $200 a bottle for the 1916 to more than $1,000 a case for the 1949 to about $300 a case for the 1982. For the less affluent, some 3,500 bottles of 1975 Mouton-Cadet will also be sold, mostly in four- and five-case lots with a suggested bid of about $280 for four cases. On Oct. 24 hundreds of bottles of Champagne will be offered, much of it in small lots, including 10 methuselahs of Mumm Cordon Rouge 1966. A methuselah holds the equivalent of eight regular bottles. Suggested opening bid on one of the big bottles is around $20, which may say something about the condition of the wine. Port lovers are invited to present themselves on Oct. 25, or perhaps more profitably on Sept. 22 when a dozen bottles of 1900 Andresen Tawny-Colheita and 135 bottles of the 1910 will be offered. Both wines were bottled in 1979. There are some 1934 Barros, some 1924 Real and some 1904 garrafieras. Suggested bids range downward from about $85 a bottle for the 1900 Andresen. On Sept. 27 and Oct. 25 various liquors and spirits will be up for bid. Under Regine's direction, the Ledoyen name will remain, as will most of the interior structure because the building is classified a national monument. The decor, according to Regine, will be more ''Proustian.'' The head chef will be Jacques Maximin, a pillar of the nouvelle cuisine movement. He will leave his famous Chantecler in the Hotel Negresco in Nice to come to Paris. The Chantecler has three stars in the Michelin Guide; Ledoyen had two. The restaurant's closing seems to have had less to do with its own fortunes than with those of its most recent leaseholder, Cerus, a French investment company owned by the Italian entrepeneur Carlo de Benedetti. The building is, in fact, owned by the city of Paris. Mayor Jacques Chirac and other city officials are said to have discovered that Mr. de Benedetti's company was taking over the lease only when they read about it in the newspapers. Irate at not having been informed, they immediately rescinded the lease, closed the restaurant and asked for new bids. Regine won out over nine competitors. A catalogue listing the wines and the sale dates can be obtained from the Hotel Drouot, 9 rue Drouot, 75009 Paris; telephone 4246-1711.

758-> Competition Intensifies at India's Top Schools
Scores of young men and women surged around the bulletin board not long ago at St. Stephen's College here, one of India's elite education institutions, craning to glimpse their names on lists announcing those selected for interviews. Similar scenes are repeated at other prestigous colleges here and across the country. The lists are only the first stage of the admission process. The lucky ones are then interviewed by a college panel, which decides their eligibility and then announces a final list of admissions. Of the tens of thousands who apply for admission to the elite schools, only a small fraction of them will get in. ''We are admitting about 400 students this year,'' said John Hala, the principal of St. Stephen's. Mr. Hala said that there were more than 15,000 applications this year and that the competition was likely to get more intense in the future. India has more than 5,000 colleges, most of which are affiliated with about 135 universities. There are more than 3.5 million college admissions per year. Many whose applications are rejected turn to correspondence courses or short-term, job oriented courses. ''Many people come here for the name, the pedigree that St. Stephen's offers,'' said an economics graduate who identified himself as Gautam. His brother, an 18-year-old high school graduate from a school where Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi studied, said he had been summoned for an interview to judge his application for the economics course. Those who are well connected often resort to a time-honored tactic employed across the world: they make a telephone call to a Cabinet minister or a high official or even a relative of the head of the institution and request their assistance. Often, their wards get in. Competition for the elite institutions is tough. And it starts early, from pre-school levels. Jag Pravesh Chandra, a top local politician here, is constantly visited by constituents who seek his help in insuring the admission of their children to exclusive, privately run schools. The other day, before a reporter, Mr. Chandra picked up the telephone, called a principal and ordered him to include a boy's name in pre-school. With a fast-growing middle class, India's 1,200 ''public'' schools, which are actually prestigous private institutions, take a fraction of the country's school-going children. Most urban middle-class families do not want to place their children in the Government school system. Senior officials acknowledge that these schools are poor in quality, budgets and facilities. But they are free until the secondary level. Of a population of about 800 million, more than 110 million go to school, most of them to the free Government institutions. Of this figure, 75 percent drop out by the time they are 12 or 13, Government officials say. They attribute the high dropout rate to pressures at home, especially in the rural and slum areas, where children must work to supplement the family income. Those at the secondary level hire tutors or go to special coaching classes so that they can score high marks and enter the prestigious institutions. ''This is a time of rising expectations,'' said Indu Pillay, the principal of Mother International School. ''Parents want their children to do better than they did, get better grades, better jobs, earn more money.''

759-> After the Convention; Lawyer Is Reported Chosen To Head Wright Investigation
A Chicago lawyer active in Democratic politics is expected to be named shortly as the special legal counsel to lead the House ethics committee's investigation of Speaker Jim Wright, according to a person familiar with the inquiry. The lawyer is Richard J. Phelan, who was elected as a delegate pledged to the Presidential candidacy of Senator Paul Simon of Illinois, although he did not attend the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta. The selection of Mr. Phelan was reported today in The Washington Times, and the person familiar with the investigation said the account was basically correct, although another person with knowledge of the ethics committee's proceedings suggested that Mr. Phelan's selection was not yet certain. Both sources spoke on condition of anonymity. Breach of Confidentiality The panel, the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, has guarded its activities closely, so that the report in The Washington Times reflected a rare breach of confidentiality. The chief counsel for the committee, Ralph L. Lotkin, declined to comment on the report. Charmayne Y. Marsh, Mr. Wright's press secretary, reached in Atlanta, said his office had not been told of the selection of any outside counsel. But she said, ''If it is true, the Speaker is pleased to see the committee moving forward so we can get this matter settled in an expeditious manner.'' The committee voted June 9 to investigate allegations that Mr. Wright, the nation's highest elected Democrat, had misused his office for personal gain and had improperly intervened with Federal banking regulators. Founding Partner Ms. Marsh said that Mr. Wright, a Texan, was on his way to Texas with the Democratic candidates for President and Vice President, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis and Senator Lloyd Bentsen, to help them begin their campaign. Mr. Phelan was not in his office Friday afternoon, and a partner, William J. Kunkle Jr., said he could not comment on the reports. Mr. Kunkle said that Mr. Phelan, 51 years old, was a founding partner of Phelan, Pope & John, a firm of more than 50 lawyers that specializes in civil litigation; was a former president of the Chicago Bar Association, and was a graduate of the Georgetown University Law School in Washington. Mr. Phelan successfully headed the defense of a company in Melrose Park, Ill., against claims for $300 million in punitive damages after an outbreak of salmonella poisoning had been traced to a dairy it owned, Mr. Kunkle said.

760-> After the Convention; Bush, Courting Ethnic Vote, Counters Dukakis's Themes
Vice President Bush moved today to combat two perceived political strengths of Michael S. Dukakis by making an appeal to ethnic voters and arguing that the Massachusetts Governor's overall record, not just the issue of competence, would be critical this fall. Campaigning much of the day in Milwaukee, Mr. Bush embraced and joked and posed for pictures with Italian-Americans as he argued that they and other ethnic voters would be won over by an appeal to their values and not their heritage. ''Ethnic pride, as I think of it, really rejoices, celebrates, not only the diversity of America but the good things about America,'' he said. ''It is the ethnic America that says, 'Look, we are free, we appreciate it more than others,' and our Administration has made a significant contribution to this concept of standing for freedom.'' 'Enormous Appeal' ''So the values are what I will be appealing to ethnic America on,'' the Vice President said, ''and I think the ones that I will be spelling out will have enormous appeal.'' The Vice President's comments, at a news conference, were offered to rebut Mr. Dukakis's acceptance speech Thursday night, in which the Democratic Presidential nominee emphasized his Greek ancestry and argued that the election was about competence and not ideology. Mr. Bush, who conceded that the trip was an attempt to win ethnic votes, paid a visit to the 11th annual Festa Italiana in Milwaukee, where he attempted several words in Italian on a stop at an exhibit of religious items and afterward during a breakfast of scrambled eggs and plump Italian sausages. Earlier, at the news conference, the Vice President said he had watched Mr. Dukakis's nationally broadcast address, adding, ''I thought he gave a very good speech.'' But Mr. Bush challenged several of the Governor's key contentions, such as the remark about competence. 'Made a Contribution' He said that the record ''can't be blurred over'' and that a candidate ''can't run just as a manager.'' ''You have to be what you've stood for,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I will say what I'd stood for, and we will be sure that people know what he's stood for.'' Mr. Bush also sought to counter the Democrats' repeated suggestions that as Vice President he has been uninvolved, failing, for instance, to oppose the sale of arms to Iran. Mr. Bush has said that he supported the policy but eventually voiced reservations, while Mr. Dukakis has said that his own Vice President would not sit silently when somebody comes up with a ''cockamamie idea.'' The Vice President has said his relationship with Mr. Reagan is such that ''I can walk in and tell him anything I think.'' ''He knows I am not going to go out and talk to the press about it,'' Mr. Bush said today. ''And therefore, as you will hear from the President, I am sure, during the course of this campaign, the Vice Presidency has amounted to something, and we have made a contribution.'' 'Effective Use' of Bentsen Mr. Bush also sought to raise questions about the ideological differences between Mr. Dukakis and his running mate, Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas. ''Now if he is suggesting that Bentsen can change his views on gun control, that's good; that would be an effective use for Lloyd Bentsen,'' Mr. Bush said. ''If he is suggesting that he can convince Governor Dukakis never to have a furlough program that would furlough a man like Willie Horton, never again, that would be good.'' Mr. Horton, a convicted murderer, was given a furlough in Massachusetts before he was eligible for parole, and he later raped a woman in Maryland. 'Texas Values' Plugged Mr. Dukakis and Mr. Bentsen traveled today to Texas to begin the campaign, an effort Mr. Bush minimized. ''He's doing exactly what he ought to do,'' Mr. Bush said of Mr. Dukakis. ''I don't feel any threat. I will win Texas.'' ''The things that I will be talking about in Texas are Texas values, and the issues that he will be talking about, Dukakis, will not be in accord with the mainstream of Texas thinking in my view,'' he said. Asked to explain ''Texas values,'' Mr. Bush singled out opposition to gun control, which Mr. Dukakis supports, and support for the death penalty, which the Governor opposes. He also cited support by the Democratic nominee for the American Civil Liberties Union, which Mr. Bush called ''pretty far out in left field.'' Ocean Dumping Criticized At a news conference held later on a rainy and foggy beach of Point Pleasant, Mr. Bush called for an end to ocean dumping of garbage. Mr. Bush, who was presented with samples of medical waste and other garbage that that had surfaced on New Jersey's shoreline, called ocean dumping a ''national tragedy'' and endorsed Federal legislation to ban the practice. The visit, which was similar to one Mr. Dukakis made before the New Jersey primary in June, was intended as a learning experience, Mr. Bush said. More than 75 reporters were on hand for the event, which Bush aides had considered canceling because of the weather. In the background, several demonstrators shouted, ''Where was George?'' - a chant from a speech by Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts at this week's Democratic National Convention.

761-> Chile's Novel 'Venture Capitalist'
AUGUSTO GROB caught on to the idea at a public meeting near this commercial and agricultural center in Chile's southern lake region. At the meeting, a representative of Fundacion Chile - the Chile Foundation - offered to go into partnership with farmers and investors and provide the expertise to set up a berry farming and exporting business. ''I had never heard of Fundacion Chile, but they inspired a lot of confidence by the seriousness with which they explained the venture,'' said Mr. Grob, a local farmer and businessman. ''I had been wanting to find a way to get us out of what was almost one-crop farming - milk and sugar beets. So I began to talk to others in La Union, and in a few days we put together the capital.'' The resulting company, called Berries La Union, was organized in January 1985 with 80 shareholders and capital of $650,000, 20 percent from the foundation. Mr. Grob was named president. In 1987, Berries La Union had sales of $1 million and declared its first profit - a year ahead of schedule. The foundation, an unlikely legacy of the political turmoil that swept Chile during the early 1970's, ''could have come here and just been consultants, but that would have been slow,'' said Jose Plutarco Dinamarca, an agronomist who used to work for the foundation and now manages Berries La Union. ''We thought we had to begin by creating an example.'' The foundation's role in setting up Berries La Union is just one of the ways that the 12-year-old nonprofit organization carries out its goal of helping the Chilean private sector to modernize and increase exports through the introduction of technological advances. ''It is not our idea to do research and discover the wheel, but rather to take advantage of developments elsewhere and apply them here,'' said Anthony Wylie, director general of Fundacion Chile. ''And we think the best means to transfer technology is to get in and show people,'' he added, referring to the foundation's policy of taking part in business startups. Operating from a modern complex in the Andes foothills outside of Santiago, Fundacion Chile has become involved in a broad range of activities. It has played a pioneering role, for example, in developing salmon farming in Chile and has participated in the start of 10 businesses. In the near future, it expects to be a partner in Chile's first venture capital firm and is searching for ways to use the country's extensive forest reserves, particularly in the manufacture of furniture for export. IN addition, it sells its consultation services to any business that comes to it for help. If its own staff of about 75 professionals from a variety of fields cannot deal with the question, it will turn to a network of about 30 other consultants in Chile and the United States. The roots of Fundacion Chile go back to the expropriation in the early 70's by President Salvador Allende, a Marxist, of the Chilean Telephone Company from the ITT Corporation. Although the Allende Government expropriated many businesses and farms, antagonisms were particularly strong between it and ITT, which later admitted having offered to finance efforts to prevent Mr. Allende from taking office following his election in 1970. After the armed forces overthrew the Allende Government in September 1973, the military regime offered to return the telephone company to ITT or to negotiate compensation. In 1974, ITT accepted compensation estimated at $100 million to $120 million. The Government's negotiator, Raul Saez, recalled that after the agreement was reached, he told ITT executives that he wanted the company to remain involved in Chile in some way. ''They asked what I wanted, and I pointed out that multinationals have a custom of establishing research centers in developed countries,'' Mr. Saez said in a recent interview. ''I suggested that, for the first time, the research and logistical support ought to be in both directions. I said why not create a research center in Chile?'' ITT and the Government each put up $25 million, and the foundation came into being in mid-1976. For the first 10 years, ITT provided the management and recruited a staff of experts - Chileans and Americans - in various business and technical fields. In 1986, ITT's management period formally ended and Mr. Wylie, a Chilean with a doctorate in vegetable physiology from the University of California at Davis, moved from deputy director to head of the foundation. Three ITT executives remain on the board, along with several prominent Chilean businessmen and Government appointees. THE foundation has an annual operating budget of about $4 million, 60 percent of which comes from consulting fees and the rest from income from the endowment, which has liquid assets estimated at $22 million to $24 million. Funds for startups come from the endowment. Officials and directors of the foundation acknowledge that in the early years they had difficulty finding a niche for an organization that came into being apparently without a role model anywhere in the world. At the same time, Chile was beginning a form of economic revolution as the military Government gave economists and businessmen wide latitude in which to create a free-market economy in a country with a long tradition of state control. Mr. Saez, who resigned from the Government in 1975 and is now semi- retired, said that when he proposed the idea of the foundation he had envisioned something closer to pure scientific research, but that ITT ''didn't want to get involved in anything so complex.'' ''ITT favored an orientation toward applied technology,'' he said. ''It's true that that is what is most important now for the country, but good applied technology depends on pure research, and some day Chile will have to free itself from the limitation of having no significant role in pure research.'' After initially devoting itself primarily to consulting services sought by businesses, the foundation decided six years ago to take a strong entrepreneurial thrust. One of its earliest entrepreneurial undertakings was the creation in 1982 of the wholly owned affiliate Salmones Antartica Ltd., which has led the way in making Chile a major salmon producer and exporter in just a few years. In fact, Chile was the first country in the Southern Hemisphere to successfully produce salmon, since joined by New Zealand. Salmones Antartica exported 1,000 tons of fresh and frozen Pacific salmon this past season. The fresh salmon goes almost exclusively to the United States. The frozen salmon goes to Japan, the United States and Europe. Sales in 1987 totaled $8 million, with profits of $1.4 million. Like Chilean fruit, salmon is harvested here during the Northern Hemisphere winter and does not compete directly with production in the United States. Werner von Bischhoffshausen, general manager of Salmones Antartica, said the foundation's role in starting the company had been crucial because ''no one in the private sector was willing to take the risk.'' Now that the risk has paid off, many private investors have created their own salmon businesses in Chile. FOUNDATION officials plan to start two additional companies every year and to sell off their interest when a business becomes profitable, said Ricardo Cortes Donoso, public relations director. The proceeds would be returned to the endowment. The first company offered for sale is Salmones Antartica, for which bids will be opened Aug. 22. Only one of the 10 startup companies has failed so far, Mr. Cortes said. That operation, Caprilac Ltd., sought to improve and sanitize cheese produced with goats' milk, but Mr. Cortes said the goat herders could not adapt to the requirements of machine production of cheese. In deciding how to invest in startups, the foundation ''looks for projects that will have effects other than just making money from modern management techniques,'' Mr. Wylie said. ''First, they have to be technically innovative,'' he said. ''We hope they will be export-oriented but that is not absolutely necessary. Also, they have to have social importance, such as creating good jobs and setting examples that others can duplicate.'' With Chile's economy now growing rapidly, he said, the challenge to the foundation is ''to keep ahead of the private sector, which is becoming much more aggressive in its own search for technology and ideas.''

765-> YONKERS: THE COST OF DEFIANCE
On Aug. 2 the City of Yonkers and four Councilmen were held in contempt of court for refusing to approve part of a court-ordered housing desegregation plan. Following are the requirements of the housing order and the actions taken against the city for its refusal to approve them. The Consent Decree In 1985 a Federal judge ruled that Yonkers had intentionally discriminated in housing and education over four decades. In 1986 a school desegregation plan was instituted. Last Jan. 27 the City Council approved a consent decree in which Yonkers agreed to remedy the housing discrimination by building 1,000 low-income and moderate-income apartments across the city. Nearly all of the city's public housing is in southwest Yonkers. Low-Income Housing The first 200 apartments, financed by the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, would be public housing for low-income families. They would be in two- or three-story buildings on seven sites scattered among predominantly white neighborhoods in eastern Yonkers. Moderate-Income Housing The other 800 apartments would be for families with incomes between $14,750 and $35,400. They would be built over the next four years by requiring developers to set aside for such families 20 percent of all new apartments they build in the city. Tax abatements and zoning incentives would be used to encourage developers to build in Yonkers. On Aug. 1 the Council voted 4 to 3 to reject legislation needed to provide those incentives. The Contempt Ruling In July the judge, Leonard B. Sand of Federal District Court in Manhattan, had threatened the city and Councilmen with fines if they did not act to approve the legislation needed for the 800 moderate-income apartments. On Aug. 2 he found the city and the four opposing Councilmen in contempt. Each of the four Councilmen was fined $500 for each day of defiance; in addition, those still opposing the plan after 10 days were to be jailed. Judge Sand ordered the Council to meet once a week to vote on the housing plan. The city was fined $100 the first day, and the fine was to double each day; within 22 days, the cumulative fines would exceed the city's annual budget of $337 million. When a Federal appeals court suspended the fines on Aug. 9, pending the city's appeal of the contempt ruling, the fines totaled $12,700 for the city and $3,500 for each of the Councilmen. Financial Control On Aug. 9, hours before the fines against the city were suspended, the Emergency Financial Control Board took control of Yonkers's finances, freezing hiring and blocking pay raises and other discretionary spending. The board, established to monitor Yonkers's finances after the state bailed out the city with a $10 million grant in 1984, must approve the city's spending plans. Officials said they acted because money for the fines was not included in the city's budget. The board's action also made the Council members subject to possible criminal prosecution if they continued to incur fines not authorized by the board. The Appeal Yesterday a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the contempt rulings against the city and Councilmen and all sanctions against the Councilmen. The fines against the city were modified, capped at $1 million a day once they reach that amount. The panel gave the city seven days to appeal to the United States Supreme Court before the fines would resume.

766-> Gorbachev Backers Want Grip of Party Apparatus Loosened
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's drive for domestic revival has entered a new round in recent weeks with the opening of a wide-ranging debate on the powers of the Communist Party. In an almost daily barrage of official remarks and press commentaries, a campaign has begun to weaken the iron grip of the party network that extends down to each workplace and school, and to give more authority to the soviets, or people's councils, that have traditionally been largely ceremonial. Strengthening the soviets has emerged as a major theme as the country prepares for a nationwide party conference in late June, the first such extraordinary meeting since 1941. Mr. Gorbachev apparently hopes to use the meeting to give fresh impetus to his program of economic and social change, which has bogged down in political and bureaucratic resistance. He has said the conference will take up ''a far-reaching reconstruction of the political superstructure.'' Soon Became Rubber Stamps The Communists took power in 1917 under the slogan ''All Power to the Soviets,'' but the councils soon became rubber stamps for the Communist Party. Real power resides with the party apparatus, a network of 200,000 full-time party functionaries, and with the party committees that extend into almost every business and school. Recently Mr. Gorbachev's supporters have singled out this powerful network as an obstacle to economic and social change, especially outside Moscow. Government officials and industrial managers are often afraid to make a move without instructions from their local party bosses. Mr. Gorbachev now appears to view the soviets as a useful political counterforce to break the stranglehold of the party apparatus. ''The key issue here is the necessity of fundamentally increasing the role and securing the full power of the soviets of people's deputies as the political basis of our socialist Government,'' Georgi P. Razumovsky, a party Secretary, declared in a speech last week. Mr. Razumovsky is a Gorbachev ally who was promoted to a nonvoting seat on the ruling Politburo in February. Many Complaints in Press Editors of leading newspapers have chosen to publish a barrage of letters and commentaries complaining of local party officials who have thwarted such Gorbachev initiatives as the creation of more private businesses and greater independence for farm and factory managers. ''In the cities, districts and counties, power today effectively belongs not to the soviets but to the party committees,'' an engineer from Ufa wrote in Pravda on Monday, adding that local government executives ''cannot take a single step without coordinating it with the party organs.'' On Tuesday a historian, Nikolai P. Popov, published a daring analysis of party power in the newspaper Sovetskaya Kultura, arguing that the party's monopoly on power violates Lenin's thinking. Mr. Popov said Lenin intended for the party to guide overall national policy, not to interfere in day-to-day decisions of courts, Government officials and factory directors. Even before Lenin's death, the historian said, the party began to supplant the soviets, paving the way for Stalin, who ''created the ideal totalitarian state.'' 'Pale Little Stalins' Assailed ''Stalin's methods are dead today as far as the system of personal dictatorship and mass repressions goes,'' Mr. Popov wrote, ''but they are still very much alive as the antidemocratic norm. The pale little Stalins are living among us.'' Soviets exist for governmental units ranging from villages to republics, and the Supreme Soviet is the nation's nominal parliament. Deputies are chosen in direct elections from candidates nominated under party control by such organizations as party committees and in meetings of unions, schools and collective farms. In the vast majority of districts, only one candidate for deputy is registered. It is not clear exactly how much power Mr. Gorbachev would like to give the soviets. Some Soviet and Western analysts say they believe he genuinely intends to open the system to political forces that would compete with the Communist Party, without formally permitting a multiparty system. Others feel he is merely bent on shaking things up and clearing away the obstacles to economic change. In any case, the Soviet leader has not shown any desire to relax the hold he and his colleagues in the ruling Politburo hold over national affairs. His public remarks so far have focused on the need for greater grass-roots control at the local level. Some of the specific proposals now appearing in the press are ideas raised by Mr. Gorbachev more than a year ago but not fully embraced by the party then. Choice in a Few Elections They include limiting the terms of both party and Government officials, requiring the party to use secret ballots in chosing its leaders, and expanding the use of competitive elections, in place of the traditional system in which the voter is offered a single candidate for each opening. Competition was introduced in about 5 percent of the districts in local elections last year as an experiment, but has not become the norm. The party's governing Central Committee evidently rejected the idea of limiting terms in office. The preparation for the party conference has called forth an array of suggestions for political change that go beyond what party leaders have endorsed so far. One writer, in a letter to the weekly Moscow News, proposed creation of a new constitutional court, with power to throw out any law or administrative order that violates rights promised in the largely symbolic Soviet Constitution. Another, in a letter to the Government newspaper Izvestia last week, said nonmembers of the party should be included in key executive jobs ''at all levels.''

767-> Havana Journal; Balm for a Bruised Clergy, and Hope for Believers
At offices in the seven Roman Catholic dioceses of Cuba, workers are installing special cables and making places for telex machines that will link church officials throughout the island and give them immediate access to the rest of the world. The telex, which transmits typed messages almost instantly over telephone lines, is a common tool of communication, widely available in even the poorest of countries. But the church here has been without the machines since the 1960's, when Fidel Castro ripped them out in a counterattack against the many priests who were trying to topple his fledgling Communist Government. Mr. Castro also expelled scores of priests, took over the Catholic schools, forced many churches to close and so stigmatized religion that no more than 1 percent of Cuba's 10 million people are now practicing Catholics. In the last several years, apparently in an effort to improve his international standing and especially to repair relations with the rest of Latin America, Mr. Castro has been moving toward reconciliation with Cuban Christians and the country's small Jewish population. Fresh Bibles and New Priests Progress toward more freedom and equity has been agonizingly slow for Cubans who want to practice Catholicism or Judaism, and for a while last year it seemed to have stalled. But the restoration of the telexes, which Mr. Castro quietly approved in late February, is one of several concessions the Government has made in the last six months. Toward the end of last year, the church was allowed to import 30,000 Bibles, the first in 16 years. The number of priests had dwindled to about 220, and for the first time since the expulsions the church was permitted to bring in a group of foreign priests. About 20 have arrived in the last few weeks, and 7 more are expected soon. Speaking last week with John Cardinal O'Connor, the Archbishop of New York, Mr. Castro praised four members of Mother Teresa's order who have been working with cancer patients here since late 1986 and said he would welcome many more nuns to join the 250 now in Cuba. How the Believers Are Faring By holding well-publicized meetings with Cardinal O'Connor and other prominent clergymen, Mr. Castro reinforces his message that churchgoers or ''believers,'' as they are known in Cuba, are no longer to be regarded as enemies. Yet it is still not entirely acceptable to practice religion in Cuba. No one who does, for example, can become a member of the Communist Party, which is essential to advancement to the highest levels in trades and professions. Mr. Castro has said housing, education, medical care and most jobs are to be available to churchgoers without discrimination, and he has appointed a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba to listen to grievances. But many Cubans say they are still afraid to let neighbors and fellow workers know that they are religious. Some believers attend churches far from where they live, and others are afraid to go at all. Cardinal O'Connor was preceded in Cuba this year by the head of the Jesuit order, Peter-Hans Kolvenbach of the Netherlands; Archbishop Theodore McCarrick of Newark; and Rabbi Arthur Schneier, the president of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, an ecumenical organization for human rights based in New York. When Rabbi Schneier was here, Mr. Castro let him send in a shipment of matzoh and wine for Passover and said he would have no objection to having a foreign rabbi take up residence and minister to the 1,200 Jews in Cuba, who have been without a spiritual leader for years. A Theme of Reconciliation For Mr. Castro, the clerical visits are another means of trying to reduce his political isolation. As he has done periodically during his 29 years in power, Mr. Castro has been talking lately about a desire to end his long, bitter feud with the United States. Several times during Cardinal O'Connor's visit, senior Government officials echoed this theme. Some things have not changed for the better. Processions and religious rallies outside the churches are forbidden. The church has little access to the Government-controlled press, and the only Masses heard in Cuba are those broadcast from Washington over the United States Government Spanish-language station, Radio Marti. Even so, church leaders say attendance at services has been rising. A Mass to Remember The Cathedral of Havana was filled to overflowing one night when Cardinal O'Connor said Mass there. Most of the worshipers were old women, as has been the case in Cuba for years. There were also many old men. But in what is regarded as more evidence of a modest revival, there were a few young people as well. There was a young organist, and he was surrounded by a choir of teen-agers. More than two dozen priests trailed the Cardinal into the cathedral. One with a thin halo of gray hair slammed his palms together above his head, applauding like a little boy. His face was a vision of delight, and his eyes were brimming with tears, as were those of many others in the church. The church learned long ago that it could not make demands on Mr. Castro, and it is very careful in its public statements. In contrast to many of their colleagues elsewhere in Latin America, Cuban church officials generally treat religious freedom and other human rights as separate issues. In mid-April, when one of Cuba's few campaigners for human rights appealed to the church for help in a struggle with the Government, there was only silence from the church. In a news conference after the meeting with Mr. Castro, Cardinal O'Connor and Jaime Ortega, the Archbishop of Havana, were asked to comment on church-state relations. Cardinal O'Connor noted that ''improvements have taken place,'' and added that he ''naturally would like to see more dramatic, more substantive changes.'' Archbishop Ortega shook his head and did not reply.

768-> Governor Is Willing to Sign Bill to Abolish Runoffs
In a shift that could affect the Democratic mayoral primary in New York City next year, a spokesman for Governor Cuomo said yesterday that Mr. Cuomo would sign a bill to eliminate the primary runoff. That means that if the bill, already approved by the State Senate, is passed by the Assembly, the one candidate who gets the most votes in the primary next year will be the winner, no matter what his or her margin of victory. Many see the elimination of the runoff as a move to damage Mayor Koch's re-election chances, on the ground that in a crowded field - as 1989 is expected to produce - a runoff is a certainty and the incumbent would have the edge in a one-on-one contest. Others in Albany say there is an equal chance that eliminating the runoff would help Mr. Koch for almost the same reason - in a crowded field, he would be the most likely to come out first. 'Principled Position' Interviews with legislative leaders yesterday indicated that nobody is quite sure what impact a change in the law would have. The Assembly Speaker, Mel Miller, has not taken a position on the bill. The chairman of the Assembly Election Law Committee, Steven Sanders of Manhattan, supports it, as does the Legislature's Black and Puerto Rican Caucus. ''We intend to push it as the principled position supported by many people as a civil rights agenda,'' said a sponsor of the Assembly bill, Democrat Roger L. Green of Brooklyn. Under the current law, if no candidate gets 40 percent - rather than more than 50 percent - the two candidates who received the most votes compete in a runoff. The measure was last under consideration in 1985, a mayoral election year. At that time, Mr. Cuomo opposed changing the law, calling the timing unfair. ''In 1985, the Governor said that he wouldn't change the rules in the middle of the game, but if somebody wanted to make a structural change now, and could persuade both houses of the Legislature that this was a prudent move, he could consider this legislation now,'' the Governor's spokesman, Gary Fryer, said yesterday. ''He said, 'If both houses of the Legislature sent this bill to me, I'd sign it.' '' The Governor does not think doing away with the runoff - which has been law in New York City since 1969 -would hurt Mr. Koch, Mr. Fryer added in answer to a question. Mr. Koch said he agreed, predicting that without a runoff, he would be the most likely to win anyway. But in an interview yesterday, he said that in the interests of ''good government'' he favored the current system and said the Governor was ''making a mistake.'' ''From a good government point of view, to provide that whatever candidate wins has a substantial portion of the party, I agree we should keep the existing law,'' the Mayor said. With the Mayor against the bill and the Governor agreeing to sign it, its future is likely to be based on whether it is seen as a pro- or anti-Koch measure.

769-> Suit Is Filed By Motorola
Motorola Inc. has sued a Silicon Valley competitor, the Cypress Semiconductor Corporation, and five former Motorola employees, accusing them of taking part in a conspiracy to steal trade secrets. The suit is aimed at Ross Technology Inc., a start-up company in Austin Tex., formed by Roger Ross, who led the team that designed Motorola's 88000 microprocessor, which is based on a technology known as reduced instruction set computing, or RISC. Ross Technology is being financed by Cypress and has said it intends to work on a competing RISC microprocessor designed by Sun Microsystems and manufactured by Cypress. The suit, filed Friday in Texas District Court in Austin, maintains that Cypress had lured the Motorola employees to leave Motorola, weakening Motorola and giving Cypress an unfair advantage. It said the Motorola officials had access to confidential Motorola information that is now at risk of being disclosed. This is the third suit in the last few weeks against San Jose-based Cypress, one of the fastest-growing young semiconductor companies. The National Semiconductor Corporation sued for theft of trade secrets, and Advanced Micro Devices for patent infringement. T. J. Rodgers, president and chief executive, denied all the charges, saying, ''You're seeing the reaction of older companies because we're aggressive, we're out there doing new things.'' Dr. Rodgers said that Ross Technology would not use Motorola trade secrets because it was working on a different microprocessor architecture. He said that Ross Technology had offered to let itself be periodically audited by an impartial inspector but Motorola refused.

770-> Dukakis Loses Appeal On Power Over Guard
Michael S. Dukakis, who attempted to use his power as Governor of Massachusetts to block a National Guard training mission in Central America, has lost an appeal challenging Federal authority over the Guard. The United States Court of Appeals for the First Curcuit on issued a one-sentence order Tuesday affirming a decision by Federal District Judge Robert Keeton on May 6 that upheld Federal supremacy over the Guard. Mr. Dukakis, the Democratic Presidential nominee, filed a suit in January to block the assignment of 13 public relations specialists in the Massachusetts Guard to Honduras and Panama for two weeks in May because of his opposition to the Reagan Administration's policies in Central America. After Judge Keeton issued his ruling in May, Governor Dukakis appealed but did not try to stop the Massachusetts troops from participating in the road-building exercises.

772-> Dubai Journal; A Barometer of Gulf Riches: How Now the Dhow?
Below the high-rises, where the boats called dhows depart from this emirate for the waters of the Persian Gulf, the merchant vessel Kalyampasa loaded up the other day with vacuum jugs and grain, tomatoes in tin cans and vegetable oil by the tub. A little way along the shimmering waterway known locally as the Creek, on and around which Dubai is built, other wooden craft of varying vintage and lineage are filled to the gunwales with wheelbarrows and trunks, air-conditioners and refrigerators. They are produced in Japan and the West, bought in Dubai and finally shipped to India. It is a business born centuries ago, long before diesel engines replaced the sails that carried the wood-hulled dhows along trade winds to East Africa and the Indian subcontinent. And it has present-day implications, too. Dhows are a part of the maritime landscape elsewhere in the United Arab Emirates, in Bahrain, and in other places in the southern Persian Gulf. Here in Dubai, where income is drawn from relatively modest oil reserves and from bustling trade in everything from faucets to caviar, the dhows that triple-park along the Creek represent something of a barometer - a signal of who's buying, who's selling, who's rich and who's poor. Hard Times for Iran In recent months, Dubai's main trading partner, Iran, has secured an unwanted niche, reflecting a boom that never came. ''The dhow traffic with Iran,'' said a banker from the Iranian minority here, ''is at a virtual standstill.'' Long before Dubai began to export crude oil in 1969, the sheikdom had established itself first as a center of pearl-diving. Then, when the sale of cultured pearls destroyed that business, it became a focus of commerce in a region where commerce is often blurred with smuggling. Oil money, however, kick-started a new era. With sudden riches drawn from the sale of 400,000 barrels a day, Dubai's traders could purchase far more than they could consume. Between 60 and 70 percent of all the goods coming into the emirate, said Omar A. Deesi of the Chamber of Commerce, are re-exported. Customs duties, he said, are virtually unknown, and never reach more than 4 percent. Last year, according to the chamber's statistics, the re-export business was worth around $1.5 billion. Iran, by far, ranked as the biggest single customer. Peace Is Not Prosperity The cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war has paradoxically turned all that around, in a way that says something about the perils and opportunities of the Persian Gulf. As the war between the Baghdad and Teheran Governments spilled into the tanker lanes of the Persian Gulf, the dhows kept on plying their trade with Iran, and that commerce, which reached its low point in 1982, crept back to prewar levels. ''The conflicting parties,'' Mr. Deesi said, ''found Dubai to be a peaceful resort for their business activities.'' And the so-called ''tanker war'' brought brisk trade for the drydock here, the biggest of its kind in the world, and for the salvage companies whose tugs patrolled the slick waters in quest of potential clients hit by rockets or mines or air strikes -damage repaired at the drydock. During the conflict, shipping executives here recorded more than 315 tankers hit, maimed or scarred. Then, in July, as Iran accepted a United Nations cease-fire, talk of peace sent markets jumping. Outbreak of Speculative Fever ''Dubai traders climbed into the money market, buying up Iranian currency on a speculative basis,'' an Indian textile merchant said. ''Everyone expected a boom.'' That, in turn, sent the value of the Iranian currency, the rial, shooting up to seven times its wartime value one day, only to plummet the next. Speculative fever seized the bazaar, a place fragrant with spices, aglitter with gold. The speculation sent jitters through the traders in Iran, fearful of building up inventories lest the currency's new optimism cut into profits, the Iranian banker said. That left currency speculators holding large sums of Iranian money, and businessmen holding even larger supplies of goods destined for Iran. ''This talk about a boom,'' said a British businessman, one of many expatriate Britons here, ''is bull.'' One group of mariners seems untroubled by considerations of trade and global politics. At Ras al Khaima, north of here, there is much speculation about the activities of high-powered speedboats that can cross the gulf to Iran in two hours where the dhows take eight hours and time their arrival to avoid the Coast Guard. ''You could call it unrecorded barter trade,'' a Westerner said. ''They take their cargo, cigarettes or whatever, and get paid in kind - caviar and carpets.''

775-> Prague Gives Dubcek a Visa For First Time Since Ouster
Alexander Dubcek, the former Czechoslovak Communist Party chief who led the short-lived period of liberalization in 1968 known as Prague Spring, is to travel abroad for the first time in two decades to visit Italy, a Government spokesman said today. The spokesman, Dusan Rovensky, said Mr, Dubcek was issued a visa so that he may receive an honorary degree in political science from the University of Bologna on Nov. 12 for ''his role in defending democratic principles and personal liberties.'' Now 66 years old, Mr. Dubcek was ousted as General Secretary of the Czechoslovak party after the invasion by Soviet-led Warsaw Pact troops. He was expelled from the party in 1970 and has not traveled abroad since. The Dubceks live in the Slovak city of Bratislava, where he is retired as a functionary in the Forestry Department. In recent months, he has given interviews to Western journalists, in which he called for his own rehabilitation and for the carrying out in Czechoslovakia of changes similar to those introduced in the Soviet Union by Mikhail S. Gorbachev.

776-> PATENTS; An Improved Form Of Anti-Cancer Drug
The Cetus Corporation of Emeryville, Calif., received a patent this week for a new form of the anti-cancer drug, interleukin-2, or IL-2. Company officials believe the new compound, which entered human medical trials in April, can be administered in lower doses and with fewer side effects than the existing version of IL-2. According to the patent, the new compound overcomes a problem shared by a number of drugs made from genetically cloned human protein: Such drugs stimulate the body to create antibodies, which then attack the drug. As a result, patients receiving IL-2 often need repeated, heavy doses, adding to the treatment's cost and side effects. The new IL-2 is linked to a molecule of polyethylene glycol that may mask its identity to the antibodies and allows the drug to circulate longer in the body. Cetus received patent 4,766,106.

The Standard & Poor's Corporation announced yesterday that it had adopted a new dual rating policy to help investors distinguish between traditional pass-through issues and pass-through issues that get their cash flow from a convertible adjustable-rate mortgage collateral pool and include a repurchase obligation from the originator or servicer. Upon conversion of adjustable-rate mortgages, the originator or servicer is obligated to repurchase the loan from the mortgage pool to insulate changes. Because the originator's credit rating is often lower than the assigned long-term rating, a single rating could be misleading, S.& P. said.

779-> Corte Madera Journal; Brain Tuneup at 'McMeditation' Spas
On a recent sunny Saturday afternoon, Joan D'Amico, a contracts supervisor for a shipping company, hopped into her car and zipped over to the Paradise Shopping Center in this residential town a few miles north of San Francisco for a few repairs. Nothing major, just a quick brain tuneup. With a group of similarly inclined people who regularly sample from the self-discovery smorgasbord that is Marin County, Ms. D'Amico plunked down her $12 and donned the Synchro-Energizer, a set of headphones (which that day were playing a combination of nature sounds and a New Age piano version of ''A Whiter Shade of Pale'') and a set of goggles that flash patterns of colored light like a kaleidoscope on fast forward. She had been careful to get her favorite lounge to lie on for the 45-minute session on the machine that promoters say helps ''synchronize'' the brain. Ms. D'Amico says it has improved her tennis game. ''Some people like to face north to be aligned with the planets'' during the sessions, said Randy Adamadama, the proprietor. For the last 14 months Mr. Adamadama (ne Stevens) has presided here at the Universe of You, Marin County's first brain spa and the first multiuser facility for the Synchro-Energizer. Literature supplied by Mr. Adamadama says users report a number of salutary results, including euphoria, improved problem-solving and heightened self-esteem. Mr. Adamadama, who said his new name came to him in a dream while sleeping at his previous job as a night watchman, hopes such brain spas will become a sort of McMeditation, doing for brain function what fast-food franchising did for hamburgers. ''You park your car, you run in, you get your anxiety released,'' he said of his operation. ''Every shopping center should have one.'' It seems fitting that Californians, with their unshakeable faith in technology, would find brain spas the answer to the question: am I doing enough for my brain? ''What we can do with our own brains is the next frontier,'' said Carol Cramer, who comes from nearby Sausalito for as many as three sessions a day at the Universe of You. Denis E. Gorges, the inventor of the Synchro-Energizer and the sole stockholder of the Synchro Tech Corporation, recently visited one of the centers, Less Stress, in San Francisco. It is one of 14 around the country including two in New York City. Asked how the Synchro-Energizer works, Mr. Gorges said: ''We don't really know. I don't think the body is that knowable, Nobody knows what the brain does.'' He did say the machine uses light and sound to get and hold the attention of the brain and ''create a harmonic,'' like a conductor leading a symphony. Although the device is said to improve memory, Mr. Gorges could not recall the location of the New Jersey institution he said awarded him a Ph.D. after he completed a course in psychology through the mail. While he also says he is a medical doctor, Canadian Government agencies and professional organizations could find no record of the private medical school he said he attended outside Toronto. He is not licensed to practice either in Canada or his native state of Ohio, according to official records. Dr. Douglas Goodin, an assistant professor of neurology at the University of California San Francisco Medical Center who is doing computer-assisted research on the brain's response to light, said researchers are not aware of any health benefits that can be derived by watching flashing lights. ''There would have to be a theory about why this would work and then a controlled experiment,'' Dr. Goodin said. ''I know of no legitimate research going on in this area.'' Scoffing at the lack of scientific data proving any measurable benefit from the machine, Mr. Gorges said he relied instead on the testimonial of thousands of satisfied users. ''I'm results-oriented,'' he said. ''I'm interested in what the public wants.'' For those want to experience the Synchro-Energizer but have no brain spa within easy driving distance, two portable models are now available for use at home, in the office or on the commuter bus: the Relaxman for a single user or the InnerQuest for a sort of pas de deux of the cerebral cortex. Charles Landon, a salesman of electronic goods, drove over to the Universe of You to purchase the InnerQuest, which he said produces ''very intense'' colors and is ''a great tool for centering.'' Alas, they were sold out of his favorite tape, ''Machu Picchu Impressions,'' named for the ancient Incan city high in the Andes where it was recorded in last year's Harmonic Convergence. ''There's a whole galaxy of New Age get-in-control-of-yourself mumbo-jumbo granola stuff that's bogus,'' Mr. Landon said. ''This is based on scientific phenomena.'' Jacqueline Ford, a medical assistant who has been coming to the Universe of You for nearly a year, said, ''Everybody's into meditation and stress reduction, but it's hard to take time out to visualize.'' But she added that, since using the Synchro-Energizer regularly, ''my brain is operating on a different wavelength.''

780-> CREDIT MARKETS; Bid for RJR Nabisco Jolts Bonds
The corporate bond market was jolted yesterday by the $17 billion leveraged buyout offer for RJR Nabisco. Prices of the company's outstanding intermediate and long-term debt plummeted and yields rose by nearly two full percentage points after the announcement yesterday morning. While traders said the rest of the secondary corporate market held up well, the steep decline in RJR issues did generate small price declines in other issues as well. By late yesterday, for example, R.J. Reynolds 8 5/8 percent bonds that mature in 2017 were offered at 72 1/2, traders said, down 14 1/2 points on the day, or $145 for each $1,000 face amount of securities, to yield around 12 percent. The buyout offer to take the consumer products company private was made by senior RJR Nabisco executives and Shearson Lehman Hutton, a unit of the American Express Company. Takeover-Related Decline The movement in RJR bonds was merely the latest takeover-related drop that has occurred this week. Earlier, prices of outstanding Philip Morris securities fell sharply after the company made an unsolicited offer for the Kraft Company. ''Over the last 30 days or so it has become increasingly obvious that there is an increasing level of event risk in the bond market because stock market prices are so low,'' said James Ednie, corporate vice president and senior industrial corporate bond trader at Drexel Burnham Lambert. ''Bondholders suffer from those sorts of transactions, because securities become increasingly attractive to raiders and management. It is clear that the industrial bond market cannot benefit from this deal.'' Underscoring Mr. Ednie's point were the actions taken by the two major ratings services, Moody's and Standard & Poor's, in the wake of the RJR announcement. Agencies Monitor Ratings Yesterday afternoon both agencies said they were monitoring the company and suggested that ratings might be downgraded on RJR's $5 billion in outstanding debt. The company currently is rated A by both services. The ripples that spread from the RJR announcement were big enough to overcome a rise in the secondary Treasury bond market and caused prices of many other industrial bond issues to ease by about one-quarter of a point, traders said. Generally, corporate prices move in line with the Treasury market. A drop in oil prices and what appear to be fast-fading prospects for passage of a technical corrections bill that would allow the Treasury to issue new 30-year bonds next month helped bolster prices of notes and bonds yesterday. Trading activity, however, remained quite light. ''We should know by late Friday whether or not Congress will pass the bond authority,'' said David Green, head of the government bond trading department at Chemical Bank. ''Right now, the market is pricing the thirty-year as though there is less than a 50 percent chance that we will be bidding on new bonds in November.'' In late trading yesterday, the 9 1/8 percent bonds that mature in 2018 were offered at a price of 103, up 19/ 32 on the day, to yield 8.83 percent. But such gains, built on the idea that no new bonds will be offered, could dissipate quickly, some analysts said. ''If the technical corrections bill doesn't get passed, I think that long bond prices will fall some,'' said Joel Marver, chief fixed-income analyst at Technical Data International, a financial consulting firm in Boston. ''This is a classic, 'buy the rumor, sell the news' sort of development. Watching the to's and fro's on this issue has so captivated the market that it will be a relief to have it out of the way.'' Yields on the Treasury's 9 1/4 percent 10-year notes also fell in anticipation that no new bonds will be offered this year. By late in the day, the issue was offered at 103 1/32, up 5/32, to yield 8.78 percent. Short-term bill rates were little changed. For example, the two-year notes to be sold next Wednesday were offered on a when-issued basis yesterday at a price to yield 8.35 percent, down 1 basis point, or hundredth of a point, from late Wednesday. One-year Treasury bills auctioned yesterday were sold at an average discount rate of 7.57 percent, up sharply from the 7.48 percent average rate at the last auction on Sept. 22. In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board said yesterday that all three measures of the nation's money supply rose in the week ended Oct. 10. Although the monetary aggregates have been under closer scrutiny in recent weeks, yesterday's announcement had no impact on bond prices. The Fed also said that borrowings at its discount window, excluding extended credit, averaged $600 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from an average of $446 million in the previous week. The Fed said that the two-week borrowing average was $523 million a day, down from $734 million a day in the previous two-week period, and the lowest for any period since the two weeks ended June 29, when borrowing averaged $520 million a day. Activity in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds was very light yesterday, with little movement in prices. Following are the results of yesterday's auction of one-year Treasury bills: (000 omitted in dollar figures) Average Price . . . 92.346 Discounted Rate . . . 7.57% Coupon Yield . . . 8.15% High Price . . . 92.346 Discounted Rate . . . 7.57% Coupon Yield . . . 8.15% Low Price . . . 92.376 Discounted Rate . . . 7.54% Coupon Yield . . . 8.11% Accepted at low price . . . 81% Total applied for . . . $27,507,185 Accepted . . . $9,017,615 N.Y. applied for . . . $24,154,200 N.Y. accepted . . . $7,747,650 Noncompetitive . . . $423,490 The one-year bills mature Oct. 26, 1989.

781-> Ettore Rella Dies at 81; Wrote Dramas in Verse
Ettore Rella, a poet and playwright who championed the use of verse in the theater, died of a stroke on Sunday at Columbia Memorial Hospital in Hudson, N.Y. He was 81 years old and lived in Hudson. Mr. Rella, who was born in Telluride, Colo., of Italian and Albanian parents, studied in Rome and later settled in New York. Among Mr. Rella's plays were ''Communicate Please,'' ''Ten Star General,'' ''Making Change,'' ''Stars for a Dark Cave'' and ''Sign of Winter,'' which were presented Off Broadway in the 1940's and 50's. Mr. Rella, who received grants from the Rockefeller Foundation, the Theater Guild and the National Foundation of the Arts, also taught at Bennington College. A book of his poetry, ''The Scenery for a Play,'' was published by George Braziller in 1981. He is survived by his wife, Jessie, and a sister, Avelina Bardwell of Hudson.

783-> CURRENTS; Milan Architect: From High Tech to High Tea
MARIO BELLINI, the Italian architect who has had a hand in designing everything from computers for Olivetti to furniture for Cassina, has just introduced, for Rosenthal China, his version of the teapot. To go with it, Mr. Bellini, based in Milan, Italy, has also designed a matching cup and saucer as well as a line of crystal. The teapot costs $115, the cup $35 and the saucer $9. These items are part of the manufacturer's new Cupola line, now available in the United States. Cupola, the Italian word for dome, is an approprate name for the line since each design is based on circles, semicircles and hemispheres. ''I've spent the last three years working on this,'' Mr. Bellini said. ''Designing the handle was a particular challenge. Since every conceivable handle had been designed before, I wanted to create something truly meaningful that respects the cultural history of tea services.'' And indeed the architect's ingenious solution, a spiral-shaped handle that has a bit of a twist to it, gives his designs a fresh look. The glasses, which Mr. Bellini designed in conjunction with Michael Boehm, Rosenthal's crystal designer, have a fresh look, too. They have double stems and are available in nine shapes - everything from red and white wine goblets to beer glasses and champagne flutes. They are $22 each.

784-> Union Leader Backs Police in Tompkins Sq. Clash
The leader of New York City's largest police union yesterday defended the actions of police officers during the clash with demonstrators at Tompkins Square Park earlier this month, and predicted that most of the 111 brutality charges filed against the police would be found invalid. Phil Caruso, the president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said at a news conference that the police assigned to Tompkins Square Park on the night of Aug. 6 and the predawn hours of Aug. 7 had done ''the best they could, under the circumstances.'' He predicted that 80 percent of the brutality complaints filed by demonstrators and bystanders would be found to be without evidence, adding, ''That's been par for the course.'' And he pledged to file civil lawsuits against people he said had set out to ''frame police officers'' by making false allegations of brutality. Mr. Caruso lashed out at the Civilian Complaint Review Board, calling its members ''a bunch of incompetents'' who were unqualified to judge the actions of police officers because ''they have never been in the heat of battle.'' 'Loss of Public Confidence' Earlier in the day, at a promotion ceremony for police officers and civilian employees, Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward alluded to the condemnation of police behavior at the scene that was the subject of a report released Wednesday. ''How many of you would like to walk in the Ninth Precinct after the Tompkins Square incident?'' Mr. Ward said. ''A loss of public confidence is difficult to regain.'' Two police supervisors were removed from their posts and a precinct captain was temporarily relieved of his command as a result of the internal investigation. Two police officers have been charged by the review board with using unnecessary force. More charges are expected as a result of the scores of police brutality allegations filed with the review board after the incident, parts of which were captured on videotape by amateur photographers and broadcast on network television. The police officers who are brought up on departmental charges will be tried before an administrative law judge from the city's Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings, rather than the Police Department's Deputy Commissioner of Trials, Rae-Downes Koshetz, or one of her assistant commissioners. The procedure is permitted under the terms of the latest contract between the city and the police union. The prosecution will be led by police department lawyers. Mr. Caruso said he did not condone the excessive use of force against demonstrators or the concealment of police badge numbers during the incident, adding that he was not sure any police officer had done that. He called the police department's report on Tompkins Square ''a very candid and thorough self-analysis of the situation,'' but added that he thought the incident ''wasn't as bad as some people suggested it was.'' ''It wasn't our finest hour,'' Mr. Caruso said, ''but it certainly wasn't our most dismal hour.''

785-> A Bit Late, Town Approves Constitution
The stoic Yankees who live in the small towns nestled in the Litchfield Hills are renowned for their sense of tradition and their resistance to new ideas. Today, however, at an old-fashioned town meeting, residents here finally gave in on one concept that has been around for 200 years. They ratified the Constitution. ''Cornwall never accepted it, so we said, 'Let's try it again,' '' said the First Selectman, Richard B. Dakin. ''We want the rest of the world to know we're in favor of the Constitution.'' A Vote Against The town historian, Michael R. Gannett, a 68-year-old retired Foreign Service officer, proposed the resolution last month as a way to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the Constitution. The only Cornwall delegate present at Connecticut's ratification convention in Hartford in 1788, Matthew Patterson, voted against the Constitution. The town's second delegate, Edward Rogers, was absent. It is believed that he was ill. ''That some people were not in favor of the Constitution should not be a surprise,'' Mr. Gannett said. The delegate from Cornwall, which now has a population of 1,400, slightly smaller than in 1788, was not alone in voting against the new Constitution, Mr. Gannett said. The vote on whether the state should ratify the document was 128 to 40. It made Connecticut the fifth state to ratify the Constitution, which was drawn up in 1787. Mr. Gannett, who discovered Cornwall's vote against the Constitution several years ago, said some delegates voted against the document because they were reluctant to see the states cede so much power to the newly formed Federal Government. ''It probably strikes people as very odd,'' he said. ''But it was a very iffy proposition.'' Only registered voters were allowed to vote today on the resolution, which asked whether the town should endorse the state's ratification of the Constitution and, in effect, repudiate Mr. Patterson's 200-year-old vote. About 100 residents and a handful of schoolchildren attended the meeting. Only one, Monte Dunn, a musician, freelance writer and Libertarian activist, voted no. He argued that the Constitution ratified in Hartford did not include the Bill of Rights or subsequent amendments and made no mention of issues that were settled later, such as slavery. Praise From Townspeople Mr. Dunn, tackling an issue that dates to Alexander Hamilton and The Federalist Papers, also criticized the document as a ''Tory plot.'' Despite Mr. Dunn's protests, most of the residents at the town meeting preferred to look at the resolution as more of a patriotic gesture rather than a civics lesson. There was some grumbling that the resolution was a slap at the memory of Mr. Patterson, but for the most part they took the view of Pat Blakey, a 53-year-old librarian. ''I felt that given the test of time they did an incredibly good job,'' she said. ''Granted, we had to make some amendments. But all in all it's a good document.'' Mr. Dakin, 62, said: ''We're the only town that's taking action to correct this. How many people you know ever got a chance to vote for the Constitution of the United States?'' The resolution, which has no legal significance, is to be forwarded to the Connecticut Secretary of the State's office. Mr. Gannett noted, however, that there is a precedent for similar symbolic votes. He said Connecticut did not ratify the Bill of Rights until 1939, long after it had become part of the Constitution. ''It's tradition,'' Mr. Dakin said. ''Connecticut Yankees are a little bit stubborn.''

786-> Bridge Open and Women's Teams To Be Picked the Same Way
For the first time, the American Contract Bridge League will this year use the same formula for selecting the two United States squads. When the usual open team playoffs are staged in Memphis in May, there will be a parallel event to choose the women's team. The two groups of winners will travel to Venice in October to fight for titles in the World Team Olympiad. Two of the contestants in Memphis will be Roberta Epstein of South Orange, N.J., and Carol Simon of Summit, N.J. They will not be partners then, but they were on the diagramed deal from a regional event last year. It demonstrates an important exception to an opening-lead guideline. A Discarding Problem A singleton trump is normally a bad choice, but it can be right when ruffs in dummy are clearly imminent. Against three hearts, Epstein, as West, led her trump, knowing that South would have to ruff spade losers. The declarer won with dummy's ace and took an unsuccessful club finesse. West shifted to a diamond, allowing her partner to win with the nine and lead another trump. This gave West a discarding problem. She needed to keep all her black cards, and she found a neat solution by throwing the diamond king. This unblocking move insured that her partner would be able to win the next diamond lead for a further trump play. South had no way to make more than seven tricks, and East-West collected 200, and a top score, against a contract that was sometimes made at other tables.

787-> FUTURES/OPTIONS; Precious Metals Post Gain On Hopes of OPEC Accord
Futures prices for gold, silver and platinum posted solid gains yesterday on expectations that members of the Organizaton of Petroleum Exporting Countries would agree on a plan to reduce exports of crude oil, analysts said. The analysts said the metals markets were primed for a technical rally, and the impetus for a surge was provided by reports that seven independent oil-producing countries had offered to lower their oil exports if OPEC members would do the same. Even though reports of Saudi Arabia's opposition to the output reductions caused oil futures to drop late yesterday, traders in metals ''ignored that completely,'' said Bette Raptopoulos, an analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York. ''The metals are anticipating that the OPEC talks will continue in a positive vein tomorrow,'' she said. Richard Levine, the vice president of the precious metals and foreign exchange group at Elders Futures Inc. in New York, said that technical data suggested that the metals rally would continue. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold settled $2.50 to $3 higher, with the contract for June delivery at $454.30 an ounce; silver was 11.5 cents to 11.9 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in May at $6.50 an ounce. Platinum gained $6.50 across the board on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with the contract for July delivery settling at $526.20 an ounce. In Chicago on the Mercantile Exchange, higher cash prices linked to stronger demand supported livestock futures, said Philip Stanley, an analyst with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in Chicago. Contracts for frozen pork bellies advanced on technical strength and on expectations of a seasonal increase in demand, he said. On the Chicago Board of Trade, grain and soybean futures settled mixed, with much of the selling resulting from profit taking after a sharp rise in soybean prices on Tuesday.

789-> Little Federal Office Has Big Role in Art Tours
Last year, an art exhibition in the United States commemorating the 750th anniversary of the City of Berlin was postponed, not because of the usual artistic or political problems but because Federal officials declined to provide a form of insurance to protect the lenders against possible loss. The postponement of the tour of the Berlin exhibition, which may yet be reinstated, illustrated the importance in international art of the little-known Federal Council on the Arts and Humanities. The office is authorized by Congress to provide the insurance, called an indemnity, for a total value of $1.2 billion at any one time. It has cost the Government virtually nothing. And because the rejection of the indemnity for the Berlin show and for others was based on the frailty of some of the art, the agency's actions have had the indirect result of encouraging research into packing and transporting valuable artworks. ''The purpose of the program is to make accessible works of art that otherwise would be inaccessible by minimizing insurance costs,'' said Alice M. Whelihan, the administrator of the indemnity program. Although the program is intended to encourage the flow of art both into and out of the United States, most of the flow has been into the country. 'The Greatest Bargain' J. Carter Brown, director of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, said of the program: ''It is absolutely crucial. The beauty of it is that, if all goes well, it is the greatest bargain the American taxpayer has ever had. And it makes it possible for millions and billions of dollars in great works of art to come here for the enjoyment and edification of the American people.'' The indemnity has been extended to the showing in the United States of ''The Treasure Houses of Britain''; the big Renoir show; ''The New Painting: Impressionism''; the planned Japanese exhibition at the National Gallery of Art; both van Gogh shows at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York; the Berthe Morisot show at the National Gallery; ''The Age of Suleymann the Magnificent'' in New York, Washington and other cities, and the Raphael Soyer show at the Morgan Library in New York. In addition, indemnities have been provided for exhibitions in smaller cities, like Little Rock, Ark.; Coral Gables, Fla., and Cincinnati, as well as for the national tour of Magna Carta. The indemnity is administered on behalf of the Federal Council on the Arts and Humanities by the museum program of the National Endowment for the Arts. Museums apply for indemnities and the council passes on them, approving them if they meet high criteria for packing, transportation, conservation, surveillance and protection against fire and water damage in the museums. A $125-Million-a-Show Ceiling There is a limit of $125 million for one show, and Mr. Brown pointed out that since many blockbuster shows today have a higher value than that, museums must still buy commercial insurance for any protection above the limit. Mrs. Whelihan said the participation of the Federal Government in providing the basic indemnity had encouraged insurance companies to establish reasonable premiums for the balance. Without the Federal indemnity, she said, commercial insurance would carry astronomical premiums or not be available at all. If there is a loss, the owner of the art must absorb the first $15,000 of loss for art valued at up to $2 million, the first $25,000 for art valued from $2 million to $10 million and the first $50,000 for art valued at more than $10 million. So the exposure of the United States Government is great. Mrs. Whelihan said, however, that only one loss had been incurred since the program was established in 1975, largely under the prodding of Representative Sidney R. Yates, the Chicago Democrat who has been one of the leading arts advocates in Congress. That loss occurred in 1982 after a tour of Israeli art in the United States. Mrs. Whelihan said the exhibition was intact when it left its last American showing in Coral Gables, but two paintings were missing when it was unpacked in Israel. ''We never could figure out how they disappeared,'' Mrs. Whelihan said. U.S. Was Liable for $100,000 The works, ''Old Sycamores'' and the other ''Lake of Tiberius,'' were by the pioneer Tel Aviv artist Reuven Rubin. They were valued at a total of $115,000, and after the $15,000 deductible, the United States paid the $100,000 to the Israel Museum and to a private collector. The indemnity is not granted to particularly fragile pieces, like those in glass and old oil paintings on wooden panels. It was the latter that led to the rejection of the indemnity of the Berlin show and its subsequent postponement. The major piece in the Berlin show was the ''Miraflores'' altarpiece by Rogier van der Weyden, Mrs. Whelihan said, and when the indemnity was rejected, she noted, ''It had the effect of saying, 'We don't think this should be borrowed or lent.' '' Insurance companies took note of that, so private coverage became out of the question, she said. But Mrs. Whelihan's office has not heard the last of the Berlin show, even though the 750th anniversary has slipped by. Ruth Kaplan, a spokeswoman forthe National Gallery of Art, said that research in packing and transporting art treasures was being conducted at her museum and at other places, including the Smithsonian Institution, the Tate and National Galleries in London and the Canadian Conservation Institute. ''We will reapply,'' she said, speaking of the indemnity, ''and if we get it, we hope the Berlin show will still come here.''

792-> Caracas Journal; A President, a Liaison and a Lot of Political Clout
When President Jaime Lusinchi took office in early 1984, his longtime liaison with his private secretary, Blanca Ibanez, seemed nothing out of the ordinary for a country where the extramarital relationships of prominent politicians have traditionally been heralded as signs of virility. But the scandal that has erupted around Mr. Lusinchi's private life in recent months has demonstrated that Venezuelan tradition also requires that such relationships be discreet. And this the 62-year-old President is perceived to have violated. Instead of maintaining the formalities of his marriage, Mr. Lusinchi has filed for divorce from his wife, Gladys Castillo de Lusinchi, reportedly in order to marry Miss Ibanez before he leaves office in February 1989. The bitterness surrounding the suit has become public because Mrs. Lusinchi is contesting the suit. The President also appears to have ignored the rule that Government business should not be influenced by affairs of the heart. Today, Miss Ibanez, who is divorced and in her early 40's, exercises significant political power, not only serving as Mr. Lusinchi's closest adviser, but also using her Government connection to promote herself as a populist benefactor. 'Being Run by a Woman' ''The fact the President is a womanizer gives him prestige,'' a prominent member of the Government party, Democratic Action, said, insisting that his name not be used. ''That's considered normal. What weakens his image is the appearance that he is being run by a woman, that he is dependent on Blanca Ibanez.'' Yet, perhaps still more controversial for a country that has known 30 years of democracy, the President has also adopted measures that have restricted press freedom, one result of which has been the shielding of himself and Miss Ibanez from public criticism, [ On Thursday, some 2,000 journalists and broadcasters marched through Caracas carrying placards and shouting slogans to protest the new measures. ] Thus, while journalists say they exercise self-censorship for fear of reprisals and Mr. Lusinchi himself has angrily denounced those who interfere in his private life, the President's divorce and Miss Ibanez's power are not only constant subjects of private gossip and jokes, but have also become the most sensitive topics of political debate. A Court Appearance Oddly, it was the Government itself that first brought the divorce into the open. Although Mr. Lusinchi's first, unsuccessful suit last year was never made public, a statement from Miraflores Palace last Sept. 5 said the President would appear before a Caracas court ''like an ordinary citizen'' to initiate new divorce proceedings against his wife, ''from whom he has been separated for a long time.'' The President's lawyers argued that Mrs. Lusinchi had abandoned him, had failed to fulfill her conjugal duties for 19 years and had refused to join him in Miraflores Palace. Mrs. Lusinchi denied they had long been separated and argued that the official residence of Venezuelan presidents had always been the mansion of La Casona, where she still lived. But after this first court hearing, the Government moved quickly to smother press coverage. The presenter of a popular call-in radio show, Isa Dobles, took up Mrs. Lusinchi's defense, but her station, Radio Suave, was closed by the Government, then reopened without her program. Almost the entire issue of a weekly newsletter that reproduced an article about the divorce was mysteriously stolen. And finally the judge presiding over the case prohibited any written or broadcast news about the proceedings, arguing that questions of ''public decency'' were involved. Before Congressional Hearing On Nov. 10, Mrs. Lusinchi appeared before a congressional committee to demand an investigation of political pressure on the judiciary and, to the applause of many women supporters, she said that ''in this case I am at an enormous disadvantage because I am the weak party and in Venezuela there is no law that favors the wife of the President.'' Yet while much of the press covered the uproar that disrupted the session when two secret service agents were discovered to be posing as journalists, El Nacional was the only Caracas newspaper to report Mrs. Lusinchi's remarks. Yet while at least some information about the divorce has been published, the gap between public information and private commentaries is much wider in the controversy over Miss Ibanez. An article last month in the magazine Zeta actually defended Mr. Lusinchi's right to seek a divorce ''in order to marry the woman he now loves,'' but such references are rare. Concentrates on Travels Rather, press coverage of Miss Ibanez's activities concentrates instead on her travels around Venezuela accompanied by ministers and state governors, her inaugurations of hospitals and schools, her donations to church and other private charities and the decorations she often receives for her labors. Public awareness of her power is also reflected in the vast numbers of petitions she receives from individuals and institutions around the country. Just before Christmas, a time when she was shown on television handing out toys to poor children, a full-page advertisement in several newspapers denounced her critics and praised the work she has done from her ''humble position.'' Politicians, though, take a different view. Some critics recall that, while she is reportedly Colombian by birth, the local Red Cross, after she made a donation to its work, discovered a birth certificate showing her to have been born in Venezuela. Others complain of the embarrassment caused to foreign governments when she -rather than Mrs. Lusinchi - has accompanied the President on numerous state visits abroad. But, above all within the governing Democratic Action party, it is Miss Ibanez's political power that has caused most irritation. Officials say she not only gives orders to ministers, but also plays a crucial role in filling senior Government posts. As a result, they say, she now has a loyal circle of followers within the administration, among them the head of the secret police, Porfirio Valera. A final test of her strength, though, still lies ahead. During the campaign to pick Democratic Action candidates for the presidential elections, Miss Ibanez favored the former Interior Minister, Octavio Lepage, but the man she was trying to stop, a former President, Carlos Andres Perez, in fact won the nomination. Miss Ibanez has stated that she would like to become a congresswoman - an ambition her enemies attribute to a desire to enjoy parliamentary imunity during the next administration - while aides to Mr. Perez believe she would be a party liability. But they also recognize she still holds an important card: if she is not chosen as a candidate, Mr. Perez can expect no cooperation from the President during his campaign.

796-> Hong Kong Charges May Grow
Ronald Li, the former chairman of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange who was charged Thursday with accepting $352,000 from a Japanese company in return for listing it on the exchange, could face further charges as the colony's Government continues its investigation, a prosecutor said today. Mr. Li was charged with accepting 1.1 million shares, valued at 32 cents each, from the construction concern Kumagai Gumi (Hong Kong) Ltd. last May 15. When the stock started trading on May 29, it almost doubled in value. Anthony Ducketts, Deputy Crown Prosecutor, said the investigation by the Government's Independent Commission Against Corruption was continuing and that additional charges could be filed against Mr. Li; the exchange's former chief executive, Jeffrey Sun, and the head of the exchange's listing department, Donald Tsang. All three men were arrested on Jan. 2. Only Mr. Li has been charged. Chairman for Two Years Mr. Li, 58 years old, stepped down last month after serving two years as chairman. Mr. Sun resigned in November, saying he wanted to emigrate to Canada. Mr. Tsang has been temporarily suspended. Kumagai Gumi of Japan owns 35 percent of its Hong Kong subsidiary. The public owns 23 percent. Several smaller firms own the remainder. Kumagai Gumi's offices were closed today because of a national holiday in Japan, and its officials could not be reached for comment. If convicted, Mr. Li faces a maximum sentence of seven years in prison and a fine of $64,102. Bail of $1.3 Million Mr. Li was released on Jan. 2 after posting bail of $1.3 million and surrendering his travel documents. The court reaffirmed the bail today, took custody of the travel documents and ordered Mr. Li to report to the commission every week. Mr. Li's most controversial act as head of the exchange was to close the market for four days in October. Many brokers complained that the shutdown had worsened the Hong Kong market's plunge. The corruption commission said the investigation began before the plunge. Mr. Li has been suspended from his post as vice chairman of the exchange until the investigation is over. Under Mr. Li's leadership, four rival markets merged to form the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1986.

802-> Despite It All, Poland Rocks
To the Editor: From ''As Austerity Nears, Warsaw Relaxes Rules for an Elite'' (Week in Review, Jan. 10), accompanied by a photograph of the Polish heavy-metal band Vincent rehearsing in Wroclaw, I assume readers were to infer that the relaxation of political restraints in Poland would liberate Polish rock-and-roll. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Polish rock needs no ''liberation.'' During the seven years of martial law, rock-and-roll in Poland has prospered as in no other Soviet bloc country, perhaps with the exception of Hungary. Since the early 1980's, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski's Government has encouraged this raucous leisure-time activity among its youth. The party hoped to win the hearts and minds of Poland's youth and at the same time to provide a pressure valve for seething disillusionment and frustration. ''I prefer them to project their frustrations into bitter protest songs,'' explained one Polish official, ''than to go out into the streets with stones.'' Bitter protest songs proliferated. In 1983, the singer Izabella Trojanoeska had a hit song attacking people who ''hide behind dark glasses that hide nothing.'' That same year, Kora of the band Manaam received a prize from the Communist youth organization publication Sztandar Mlodych for her ''Night Patrol'' album. The title song lauded with bitter irony the benefits of martial law. The punk band Dezerter was not so oblique in its criticism. In 1984, Dezerter toured Poland shredding Tribuna Ludu, the party daily, and screaming ''Propaganda!'' as it threw the scraps into the audience. During the martial-law era, the Polish city of Jarocin became a magnet for many of Poland's most clamorous bands. Every August, between 20,000 and 30,000 punks, hippies and heavy-metal fans assembled in Jarocin to listen to groups bearing such names as Delerium Tremens, Sewage, SS-20, Paralysis and Pathology of Pregnancy spewing high-decibel diatribes against the state. Poland has also imported derision in the form of foreign rock bands. In 1986, the American heavy-metal band Iron Maiden asked to begin its world tour in Poland. The band felt that a country under martial law would be an appropriate place for starting its ''World Slavery'' tour. Pagart, Poland's official concert organization, obliged. The concert was an ear-shattering success, complete with banners bearing the word ''Solidarity'' in Iron Maiden's Gothic-style script. There are certainly limits to Government tolerance. In June 1986, Jan Borysewicz, lead guitarist for the Polish supergroup Lady Pank, exposed himself and screamed obscenities before a crowd of Polish fans estimated to be 14,000 at a youth-day festival. The local Communist youth organization called for Mr. Borysewicz's arrest and demanded that Lady Pank be dissolved. Polish courts treated the guitarist mildly. While political dissidents are confined for years in prison, Mr. Borysewicz was given a three-month jail sentence and by summer's end was back with Lady Pank. One newspaper asked in dismay, ''Are we to entrust the education of our young to people like Jan Borysewicz?'' What are the prospects for Polish rock as General Jaruzelski slackens the political reins? As the opportunity for open expression returns to Poland, Polish rock, which provided one of the only social pressure valves during the darkest days of martial law, will lose much of its punch. It would seem that Premier Jaruzelski, by introducing a Polish-styled glasnost, may be pulling the plug on some of Poland's most provocative rock bands. TIMOTHY W. RYBACK Cambridge, Mass., Jan. 12, 1988 The writer is author of ''Rock Around the Bloc: Rock and Roll in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union,'' scheduled to be published this year by Oxford University Press.

803-> IN SHORT; FICTION
GOD'S WATER CARRIERS. By Manes Sperber. Translated by Joachim Neugroschel. Foreword by Elie Wiesel. (Holmes & Meier, $24.50.) In ''God's Water Carriers,'' Manes Sperber (1905-84) describes a time during his youth when, questioning God and beginning a lifelong debate over his faith, he climbed a barn roof in his shtetl in Poland to hurl stones into space, in the hope of challenging the God he was certain waited behind the ''trapdoor'' in the sky. This first volume of the autobiographical trilogy ''All Our Yesterdays,'' by a prominent intellectual, novelist and philosopher (and a self-described ''old revolutionary''), is an uneven but earnest account of the education of a religious rebel, the evolution of a man from devout Jew to faithful skeptic. Ably translated from the German, the book concentrates on Sperber's youth, spent in eastern Galicia. The grinding poverty of the time is here, as well as the specter of anti-Semitism and his life in the heder, the classroom where he learned to speak Hebrew by the age of 4. Sperber digresses often and with relish, moving from the literal anecdote to the expansive metaphor and back again. We are party not only to historical events but also to a wealth of personal recollections. As a diary of an education in skepticism, ''God's Water Carriers'' is disjointed, refusing to hew to a chronological narrative line. But as a chronicle of one of the century's more formidable intellects, the book is an enlightening work and a mirror of values - those of a man who, despite having arms too short to box with God, nevertheless rose to the challenge.

804-> METRO DATELINES; Judge Sets Limits On Child Aid Society
The Westchester County Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children has been ordered not to say it is a police agency or a state agency and has been forbidden to lock up suspects. But in the order Wednesday, Justice Aldo A. Nastasi refused to dissolve the agency as requested by the State Attorney General, Robert Abrams. Justice Nastasi, of State Supreme Court in White Plains, said the nonprofit group may stay in business under the conditions he set. The ruling came in a suit filed by Mr. Abrams seeking to dissolve the 14-year-old society on grounds that, by arresting and detaining child-abuse suspects, entering homes without search warrants and conducting its own investigations, the group has become a private police force with no accountability. Justice Nastasi's ruling was almost identical to one he issued in December, before a preliminary hearing at which the state presented details about the society's activities. The only new element in Wednesday's ruling was a ban on fingerprinting and photographing suspects.(AP)

805-> IN THE REGION: New Jersey; A Superstore Rises in Tiny Edgewater
By RACHELLE GARBARINE LIKE other old industrial ports in New Jersey, Edgewater watched its riverfront languish in the 1950's as major businesses shut down or moved away. But in the last five years, this square-mile community hugging the banks of the Hudson River has experienced a surge in building spurred in part by the lack of land in nearby Hoboken and Jersey City. That shortage has made Edgewater the next logical place for waterside housing, and 3,000 new residences are now planned or under construction. As a corollary, work is progressing on three retail projects totaling 188,150 square feet of space - one taking up more than half the space, another 68,000 square feet and the third, 22,000 square feet - and local officials embrace their arrival. ''We cannot afford to have all our redevelopment in residential construction,'' said Mayor Bryan Christiansen. ''We need to balance the growth and strengthen our tax base, too.'' The community's first major retail complex, Waterside Plaza, is being built by Feldman Enterprises of Hackensack on a 14-acre former industrial site on River Road and Archer Street. The $20 million project, made possible by a recent zoning change, contains 98,150 square feet of retail space in three buildings, plus parking for 102 cars. It is expected to generate close to $1 million in new tax revenue a year, according to Thomas Tansey, the Borough Clerk. At its center will be a 49,250-square-foot super supermarket - a mix between a traditional grocery store and a full-scale emporium. Feldman has rented the entire complex to Yaohan USA Corporation for $30 a square foot with increases over the 25 years of the lease. In turn, the company is subleasing some 20,000 square feet of space to other retailers for $36 to $48 a square foot, depending on location. About 75 percent of that space has already been leased, according to Yoshiya Watanabe, a manager at the company - part of the Yaohan group, a retail organization in Namazu, Japan, with 117 stores around the world. Neal Borden, a general partner at Feldman, said his company purchased the site, which is three miles south of the George Washington Bridge, in 1985 for $3.1 million. The tract is bordered on the south by the Hills Brothers Coffee plant and a Hess Oil tank farm on the north. Feldman decided to put up a shopping center because the site is unsuitable for housing and because there is a strong demand for additional retail space in the growing communities between the George Washington Bridge and the Lincoln Tunnel. ''You can prelease 50 percent of a shopping center before beginning construction, therefore eliminating much of the inherent risk,'' he said. But since the retail center sits along Edgewater's riverfront - which is difficult and costly to develop - construction costs came to $200 a square foot, twice as much as it would cost to build a traditional center inland. As a result, leasing the supermarket at rents commensurate with construction costs, which was necessary for the project to move ahead, proved difficult. Mr. Borden said because major domestic supermarket chains were reluctant to pay the high rent without a substantial number of dwelling units nearby, his company turned to a foreign retailer. Yaohan - which had been looking to expand its operations to the East Coast - proved to be willing to assume the risks. Part of the reason for its willingness is the shift in the retail industry from the straightforward grocery stores to the more varied ''super supermarkets,'' an approach the Japanese have been particularly effective in adopting. The markets - those with more than 40,000 square feet of space, offering a wide selection of nonfood merchandise and services and doing more than $8 million a year in business - include specialized services like bakeries and departments catering to such varied needs as shoe repairs and travel information. The trend to superstores is prodded in part by changing demographic patterns, such as a growth in two-income professional families who prefer the convenience of one-stop shopping, said Karen H. Brown, spokeswoman for the Food Marketing Institute, a trade research group in Washington, D.C. THE supermarket at Waterside Plaza will offer a traditional line of groceries, along with prepared meals and ethnic specialties, including a wide assortment of Japanese products. There will also be up to 20 departments - from 300 to 2,500 square feet in size - leased to concessionaires. Among them are a sushi stand, a cappuccino cafe, a dry cleaner and a florist. A 34,400-square-foot building in the plaza will house a department store, as well as a dozen shops and offices, and a Japanese restaurant, Chinzan-So, will occupy an adjacent, octaganal building with 7,500 square feet of space. Mr. Borden said the plaza was designed to attract not only residents from Edgewater, but all of southeast Bergen County - including Palisades Park and Fort Lee, with their rapidly growing Asian populations. Originally planned as one large structure, Waterside Plaza was modified to its current configuration to provide clear views of the river from points inland. And the state's Office of Waterfront Development is requiring the developer to allow public access to the river by building a 30-foot-wide walkway. Mr. Borden said his company has agreed to the borough's request to widen the portion of River Road fronting its project from two to five lanes and to contribute to the installation of a traffic light on Archer Street. All three buildings in Waterside Plaza, which are in various stages of construction, are expected to be completed this fall. Just a few blocks north on River Road, the two smaller projects are taking shape. The 68,000-square-foot, 2.5-acre development being built by the Marketplace Concept of Matawan has 30 stores with a total of 62,000 square feet of retail space and 6,000 square feet of office space in two buildings - one two stories, the other one story. Rents are $35 to $40 a square foot for retail space, $30 for office space. Completion is scheduled for June. The other project is a two-story, 22-000-square-foot building, with 12,500 square feet of office space and the rest for retail. The building, which is being constructed by Calendar Development Partners Limited of Franklin Lakes, will be completed by late spring. Rents have not been determined.

806-> '88 WINTER OLYMPICS: Sports of The Times; Steinbrenner Becomes the New Olympic Baron
On a Sunday afternoon late in 1986 in the Las Vegas airport, George Steinbrenner was discovered sitting patiently between flights. ''I'm on my way to Tampa,'' he explained. ''I just flew down from Reno, where I attended a United States Olympic Committee meeting.'' His listener, who never thought it would be necessary someday to equate the Yankees' principal owner with Baron Pierre de Coubertin in the history of the Olympic movement, quickly dismissed the significance of that chance encounter. Thursday morning, spiffy in a burgundy blazer rather than the navy blue blazer he wears at Yankee Stadium, the very same George Steinbrenner surfaced here as the new Olympic baron, the chairman of the U.S.O.C.'s new Olympic Overview Commission. ''We're up against nations,'' he intoned, ''who are really taking this seriously. The American public deserves the very best we can give 'em.'' If those phrases sound familiar, they will sound even more familiar if ''the Tigers and the Blue Jays'' is substituted for nations and ''Yankee fans'' is substituted for the American public. But while baseball historians wonder what he has done for the Yankees lately, the new Olympic baron has taken on problems in the Winter Games that can be solved only by a sudden ice age that will transform the United States into a nation of skaters, skiers and sleigh riders. Despite the new Olympic ideal, as defined by the new Olympic baron. ''The pursuit of excellence,'' he said, ''is what the Olympics are all about.'' That's not how Pierre de Coubertin defined the Olympic ideal. The Frenchman who revived the Olympics in 1896 always talked about how the important thing was not to win, but to take part. That's the philosophy that the new Olympic baron's baseball team has symbolized ever since it last won the World Series in 1978. It's also a philosophy that the United States Olympic teams have had to tolerate ever since the Winter Games began in 1924. Unless the new Olympic baron is able to sign a glacier as a free agent in order to increase the popularity of ice and snow sports in the United States, the number of medals Americans win in the Winter Games is not going to increase suddenly, if ever. No matter how much the new Olympic baron blusters. Through the years, the United States has sustained some Olympic success only in figure skating and speed skating. Every so often an American woman has won an Alpine ski gold medal, but Billy Johnson and Phil Mahre in 1984 were the first American men to do so. American bobsledders won medals when it was a beer-belly sport, but now it's a high-tech sport that Europeans dominate. Americans have never won even a bronze medal in Nordic skiing, biathlon, ski jumping and luge. And don't hold your breath until they do. In hockey, the United States twice stunned the Soviet Union to win the 1980 and 1960 gold medals. But the hockey team's seventh-place finish here wounded the new Olympic baron's pride. ''On two occasions we won against tremendous odds,'' he said, alluding to the 1980 and 1960 gold medals. ''Anything we can do once or twice, you should be able to do three times.'' In the confusion, the new Olympic baron apparently forgot that his Yankees won the World Series twice, but for nearly a decade haven't been able to win it a third time. And with professional hockey players now eligible for the Olympics, the American team is unlikely to be a gold-medal contender unless National Hockey League teams allow some of their quality American players to join the United States team on an Olympic leave. But if any N.H.L. team did disrupt its drive for the Stanley Cup playoffs by permitting Olympic leaves, its fans would be howling in protest. When the new Olympic baron was asked if he would allow a Yankee player to join an Olympic baseball team during the crisis of the American League East race, he flim-flammed. ''I wouldn't want to decimate my team,'' the new Olympic baron said, ''but I think I could give up a player that they might figure would help them. You wouldn't want to give up one of your main stars, perhaps, but if I could help in any way with a fellow who might be good on the Olympic team and perhaps would be not really a regular, but amongst a group of players you might be able to fill in with a Triple A player and do just as well, you might be able to consider that.'' As if that waffle were not soggy enough, the new Olympic baron had the nerve to add, ''I feel that strongly about how this nation does.'' And if, say, the Rangers think ''that strongly'' about helping the United States Olympic team in 1992, any decent minor league goaltender will do. But in some U.S.O.C. areas, the bluster of the new Olympic baron might be helpful, notably in his own gold-medal event: firing and hiring people. Despite the new Olympic acceptance of pro athletes, amateurs still exist, especially in the U.S.O.C. structure. Don't be surprised if Rick Bay, the former Ohio State University athletic director recently hired as the Yankees' new executive vice president and chief operating officer, is reassigned by the new Olympic baron to U.S.O.C. duty. And if the new Olympic baron can shake up the U.S.O.C. and some of the various American organizations that control winter sports, and also stir the construction of more winter sport facilities, he'll be worth his weight in burgundy blazers. It won't be easy. But even if the new Olympic baron doesn't produce a batch of United States gold medals in future Winter Games, he'll at least have taken part in the movement. That's all the original Olympic baron ever asked.

807-> IDEAS & TRENDS: Free Needles for Addicts; Experts Find Fault in New City AIDS Plan
WHEN the Cuomo Administration decided last week to let New York City give clean needles to drug addicts, it may have seemed like a bold new step to stem the spread of AIDS. But in the days that followed, the experimental program drew criticism and questions from a wide range of drug abuse experts who said the project will be plagued by problems. By the end of the week, in fact, even its supporters conceded that the new needle program was just a sideshow in the war on AIDS. A more central problem - the shortage of drug abuse treatment centers in the United States - is largely being ignored by the nation's leaders. If the worst predictions about the spread of the disease come true, some experts argued, in a decade the debate over giving away needles may have long been forgotten. The era in which government could have done more to contain the epidemic may be remembered with a simple epitaph: ''too little, too late.'' ''We have not yet been serious about setting up treatment programs,'' said Dr. Beny J. Primm, the director of the Addiction Research and Treatment Corporation, a drug treatment program in New York City. ''If we had enough treatment programs and we made them attractive enough, we wouldn't need a needle program.'' No one is sure how widely the disease will spread. So far, it has remained primarily among homosexuals, intravenous drug abusers and their sexual partners. With each passing week, however, the virus is dispersing, from the addicts and their lovers to their newborn children. The idea for a needle exchange program comes at a time of rising desperation among public health officials in New York. As when an enemy fleet is cruising through a narrow passage to the open sea, they feel this is the place to make a stand. Under the plan, two groups of 200 addicts waiting to be admitted to drug treatment programs will be observed. One group will receive clean needles and will be permitted to exchange used needles for new ones. This group will be compared with the control group to see if there is a decrease in exposure to the AIDS virus. Blood traces inside the returned needles will be analyzed to see if they are being shared. The program is meant to discourage addicts from sharing and to lure them into counseling, so they can be told how to avoid transmitting AIDS, whether through needles or sexual intercourse. Means of Transmission Within days, as the proposal gained support from some legislators in Albany, it was met with practical and philosophical objections. Dr. Primm said the program failed to take into account that the virus may be spread not just by needles but by the bottle caps in which addicts ''cook'' their brews of heroin and cocaine and by the cotton they use to strain the mixtures. Dr. Robert Newman, the president of Beth Israel Medical Center, the largest provider of methadone maintenance programs in the city, said he supported the idea of needle distribution. But he pointed out that many communities have rebelled against having former addicts receiving treatment in their midst. What would be their reaction to practicing addicts appearing regularly in their neighborhoods to pick up hypodermic needles? Dr. Mitchell S. Rosenthal, the president of Phoenix House, the largest provider of drug-free treatment programs in New York, suggested a more fundamental problem: People involved in the test project would probably receive needles only for a few weeks or months before they enter drug treatment programs. With such a small group involved in needle sharing for such a short time, he said, it will be difficult to come up with any meaningful scientific conclusion about whether the program helped reduce the spread of the AIDS virus. ''These are the most disordered people in society,'' Dr. Rosenthal said. ''To think this person is going to get on a bus or a train and travel across Manhattan to register and appear regularly flies in the face of what we know.'' Encouraging Addiction? In addition, objections were voiced by Archbishop John Cardinal O'Connor and Robert M. Stutman, the head of the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration, who condemned any action that would put government in the position of assisting addicts with their habits. The Commissioner of Health in New York City, Stephen C. Joseph, conceded that all these objections have some weight. But he believes the needle program may very well be effective, and that a small scientific study is at least worth a try. But even if the project succeeds, he said, free needles can only be a small part of the answer. Epidemiologists estimate that there are 500,000 to 1.2 million intravenous drug users in the nation; last year, publicly financed drug treatment programs were able to handle 100,000 of them, according to the National Association of State Alcohol and Substance Abuse Directors. For addicts trying to enter the programs, the wait ranges from up to six weeks in poor neighborhoods of Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago, to two to four months in New York City, officials report. In some methadone programs in Boston, treatment specialists say, the wait can be up to a year. Officials in New York announced last week that the state planned to expand treatment programs to accommodate another 3,000 addicts. Yet far more space is needed, in New York and in other states, and there is virtually no political lobby to make treatment an attractive issue for politicians. Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d recently announced that, according to new research, court-ordered drug testing and treatment may be an effective way to fight crime. But even he argued that it is the obligation of states and cities, not the Federal Government, to spend more money on such programs. ''If anybody were to ask my advice, I'd say take a moon-shot approach - do everything you can in terms of treatment,'' Dr. Joseph said. ''But we shouldn't delude ourselves. It is not a static situation. We don't have that much time.''

808-> '88 WINTER OLYMPICS; Hometown Is Preparing for the Eagle to Land
This staid old spa town was delighted, though surprised, to discover that the Winter Olympics best-loved loser is a native son. Cheltenham, like most of the rest of the world, hadn't heard of ski jumper Eddie (the Eagle) Edwards until he leaped into the Olympic limelight with flailing arms and an unflappable smile. He finished last in two events, but came first as a crowd-pleaser, and British television viewers saw him rubbing shoulders with Burt Reynolds and Johnny Carson on ''The Tonight Show.'' Cheltenhamites stayed up late to watch him jump and are preparing a homecoming parade for the 24-year-old part-time plasterer. ''There were quite a number of people that had never heard of his name,'' said Mayor Gil Wakeley. ''But I think most of Cheltenham stayed up to watch his final jumps.'' There was no sign of excitement on the promenade of chic shops and fine Regency buildings - no banners in the city of 95,000 inhabitants 90 miles west of London, no Eddie-the-Eagle T-shirts. Cheltenham, a resort town built round mineral waters, isn't the type of place to blow its horn about the Eagle, but it seems quietly proud. Without sponsors, coaches or a single jumping slope in his native land, with no one but his parents and sister with him in Calgary, Edwards had dared to ''have a go at it,'' as the townspeople said. The Eagle, whose thick glasses made him easy to recognize as he prepared to jump, came last in both his events, the 70- and 90-meter jumps. His longest jump fell 46.5 meters short of the winner of both events, Matti Nykaenen of Finland. But when he added three meters to the British record of 68 meters, London newspapers blared headlines like, ''Eddie Survives and Breaks British Record.'' Edwards, who doesn't mind coming across as a bit of a klutz, always had a smile and wave for the crowd after his jumps. Back home there were doubters, like The Times of London whose sportswriter commented: ''The question remains whether the likes of Eddie, the Wingless Eagle, deserved to compete in the Games,'' since ''the emphasis should be on excellence.'' Cecil Baylis, a retired businessman, agreed. ''It's a bit of a joke, isn't it?'' he said. ''I think people are laughing at him and with him, too.''

809-> IN SHORT; FICTION
WINTERS' TALES: Stories and Observations for the Unusual. By Jonathan Winters. (Random House, $13.95.) Included in the publicity material sent to reviewers along with ''Winters' Tales'' is a quotation from Jonathan Winters's most famous fan. ''Jonathan showed me,'' Robin Williams writes, ''that anything is possible - one of the few people able to make me laugh from my soul.'' Notice that while praising his mentor, Mr. Williams does not specifically refer to the book itself, which may mean that he too found these dozens of whimsically macabre short pieces disappointing, sounding faint echoes of H. P. Lovecraft and Steve Martin's ''Cruel Shoes,'' even fainter echoes of such memorable Jonathan Winters characters as Maude Frickert. The comedian-turned-parabolist sometimes gives his stories an ending with a twist, sometimes gives them a twisted ending, sometimes gives them both. Recurring themes are nostalgia for small-town life, the importance of toys to both young and old, the bond between children and grandparents, the estrangement between children and parents, mental imbalance and death - lots of it. Unfortunately, the stories of cognitive animals who turn out to be stuffed, generals who are engaged in military combat with what are revealed to be lead soldiers and cranky partygoers who (surprise, surprise) are the President and First Lady are, if not predictable and menacing or predictable and sentimental, simply so arbitrary as to confound comprehension. What Mr. Winters, who at 60-plus is, in his daughter's phrase, ''proud to be strange,'' has come up with is the equivalent of Garbage Pail Kids cards for adults.

810-> TV: HBO's 'On Location' Presents Dennis Miller
On NBC's ''Saturday Night Live,'' Dennis Miller is the ''Weekend Update'' anchor, reviewing the week's headlines with a flip grin that challenges the audience to realize just how clever he is. On his first solo television special, ''Mr. Miller Goes to Washington,'' he brings the same carefully honed manner to his stand-up comedy act. This Dennis Miller/Brad Grey Production, produced by Vic Kaplan and directed by Paul Miller, is a Home Box Office ''On Location'' presentation. It is having its premiere on the pay-cable service tonight at 10 o'clock. Employing what he calls low-keyed cynicism, Mr. Miller is exquisitely attuned to contemporary foibles. The show itself comments on other television comedy shows. There is, for instance, the inevitable opening sequence that tapes the performer getting to the theater and then walking onstage to the audience's enthusiastic cheers. Sure enough, Mr. Miller is seen traveling from New York to Lisner Auditorium at George Washington University. But he doesn't just amble onto the stage. He enters from the top of an airline ramp, taking off his topcoat as he descends the stairs, conveying the distinct impression that he has more important business elsewhere. At the end of the act, Mr. Miller runs back up the ramp but then, acknowledging the applause, comes down again. ''Thank you,'' he says, ''for participating in the requisite HBO encore.'' He then winningly concedes that he is the typical ''showbiz whore willing to suck the last bit of adulation out of you.'' It's all very post-everything. Mr. Miller is a boyishly slender man, given to running his hands through his luxuriant head of hair. The women in his audience tend to squeal inordinately. Dressed in a conservatively modish black suit - the shoulders are only tastefully broad -he fusses frequently with his tie, not unlike Bob Hope, actually. His delivery is low-keyed, eschewing the infantile screaming popular these days in other comedy quarters. And his material is a compendium of pop-culture references, at times sounding like People magazine crossed with television schedules from the 1970's. Mr. Miller's material can be scathing, especially when it comes to Southern parts of the United States. On the Deep South: ''To be frank, I find those people anything but deep.'' On Alabama: ''Talk about Darwin's waiting room.'' Or on West Virginia: ''It makes Mayberry look like a think tank.'' And he can turn unexpectedly pornographic, going into vivid details about private parts and acts. For the most part, the cynicism holds. There is more than a little anger here and it makes Mr. Miller reach a bit further than most other comedians for the scorching comment. What, for instance, can anyone say at this point about Sylvester Stallone? Mr. Miller goes back to Larry Storch of ''F Troop'' for an apt comparison. Or, considering the game show ''Let's Make a Deal,'' he finds Monty Hall, the host, offering $50 to ''anybody who could come up with some dignity or self-respect.'' At one point, Mr. Miller announces that he will do historical impersonations. The audience falls uneasily silent. Then Mr. Miller confesses that he is just kidding around. ''I wanted,'' he explains, ''to get right up to the precipice, pivot and then jete back to Coolsville.'' He succeeds. This smart aleck has an uncommonly sharp eye.

811-> No Need to Make Calamity of So Long Life
To the Editor: Anna Mary Wells described eloquently what many older people feel (''At the End, We Ask the Unanswerable Questions All Over Again,'' letter, March 13). What I would like to add is the attitude of younger people toward us. Next month, I will be 82 years old. I live alone and manage quite well. When I was 77, I got a degree in college, which created a furor, as if I had done something extraordinary. When my husband died 10 years ago (he was a psychoanalyst), I was dismayed by the change in my social life. However, I had always maintained friendships with people outside this circle, artists and writers. I played tennis until two years ago, when the sport became difficult. I walk, albeit slowly, visit museums and attend concerts and movies occasionally. Impairments of health have slowed my activities. I read slower and hear less, but maintain a lively interest in politics. Many people are patronizing to older people; hesitation seems to indicate senility, although many of us have been absent-minded all our lives. Art can still be enjoyed even if the colors are not distinct; music is delightful despite minor impairments. We do not have to rush to a job, so life has compensation in serenity. Having a mix of friends and entertaining is pleasant. Younger people are frequently interested in maintaining a relationship with us. Retiring into inactivity, intellectual and physical, induces hypochrondriasis and no one, of any age, enjoys an obsession of ''organ'' recitals. We resent being patronized; our wit may not be as quick and our reflexes may be slower, but friends my age still have an intense fascination with everything we did at a faster pace when we were younger. The most serious complaint seems to be the attitude of doctors toward us. Generally we are dismissed peremptorily when we request a simple brief explanation of a diagnosis. A friend waited in a cardiologist's office more than two hours. The doctor gave no explanation or apology. When my friend protested, he said contemptuously, ''What else do you have to do with your time?'' We don't want maudlin hand holding, but the incivility of the medical profession is flagrant. Any feelings of depression and reluctance to seek medical help by the elderly can be charged to physicians. Patience and interest is usually tendered by young doctors, who are overworked. This may sound harsh, but it is a frequent complaint. We should bear in mind that our children, when we are in our 80's, are usually in middle age. Frequently they have problems in their marriages, illnesses and need to cope with their children, who are in great need of their love and attention. We, therefore, cannot expect them to devote a great deal of time to us. Divorce intrudes, and at times economic problems have to be dealt with. We are frequently shielded from this turmoil through sympathy for our age. There are children who have time to visit their parents in nursing homes daily. This is, of course, splendid, but it is frequently done through a grim sense of duty. Reminding our children of this ''exemplary'' behaviour causes feelings of guilt and estrangement. If we have had a moderately good relationship with our children we should continue this by trusting them. SADIE F. KLEIN New York, March 15, 1988

812-> WHEN EATING IS ALL THAT MATTERS
MY NAME IS CAROLINE By Caroline Adams Miller. Illustrated. 278 pp. New York: Doubleday. $17.95. First-person accounts of alcoholic recovery - and there have been many - follow a predictable pattern. In the beginning the narrator is seduced by drink; gradually it drags him under, and he risks losing love, job, friends. There then follows an extended tour of the lower depths: sleazy gin mills, bad company and the false fellowship of the bottle (unfailingly the best part of the story). Finally, the narrator saves himself with the help of a group of fellow suf-ferers who know one another by first names only. The remainder of the book is taken up with tributes to Alcoholics Anonymous. ''My Name Is Caroline'' faithfully adheres to this format - except that the disease that Caroline Adams Miller suffers from is not alcoholism, but bulimia, and the organization she credits with her recovery is not A.A., but a similar group for overeaters. As a genre, the literature of eating disorders has a built-in disadvantage compared to alcoholic confessions: instead of being grimly fascinating, the ''before'' parts are merely grim. In chronicling her seven-year slide into degradation and despair, Ms. Miller takes us not for a walk on the wild side to places the likes of which we've never seen, but to Baskin-Robbins and Steve's Ice Cream in Harvard Square. Let this reviewer draw the veil on specifics, but the opening section of ''My Name Is Caroline'' would do for a bulimic's handbook, as Ms. Miller describes in revolting detail her techniques for eating, and vomiting, enormous quantities of food. After the customary crisis of belief, Ms. Miller, who is in her 20's, comes to rely on a Higher Power - a prerequisite for the program she is in (which sounds like Overeaters Anonymous but which she does not name) no less than for A.A. - and eventually is delivered from her compulsion. In tracing the source of her bulimia, she nods in the direction of her perfectionistic, overachieving personality, but spends most of her time blaming the prestigious - and pressured -education she received, from nursery school through Harvard University. Even now, Ms. Miller's thoughts seldom stray far from her own internal workings. The onset of her husband's apparent epilepsy is assessed for its potential to trigger a bulimia relapse and never mentioned again. By book's end, Ms. Miller has become something of a meeting addict; in addition to her group for overeaters, she's taken to attending A.A. and Narcotics Anonymous meetings for good measure. While she's away, her husband, in an irony that appears to escape the author, does volunteer work at a soup kitchen.

813-> SPORTS PEOPLE; Daniels Suspended
The Topeka Sizzlers of the Continental Basketball Association have suspended Lloyd Daniels, the former New York City high school star, for the rest of the season because he failed to get into playing condition and had not participated in a drug rehabilitation program. Daniels, 20 years old, pleaded guilty last summer to a misdemeanor charge of attempting to possess cocaine. He voluntarily submitted to a drug test Jan. 28 and was placed on the injured list. The Sizzlers' owner, Bernie Glannon, said he had not received the test results, but he was concerned that Daniels had not attended appointments as part of a drug rehabilitation program at a Topeka hospital. Daniels, who averaged 16 points in 29 games, said he planned to return to New York and file for the National Basketball Association draft this spring.

814-> Rancher Awarded $8 Million In Police Drug Raid Mistake
A sheep rancher and his family have been awarded $8 million because 60 law-enforcement officers took over their home and held them at gunpoint for eight hours, only to find the wrong place had been raided. ''There is justice in this country,'' the rancher, Bill Hay, said after the jury returned its decision Thursday in Mendocino County Superior Court. But Paul Hammerness, a deputy state attorney general, called the award ''astronomically unjustifiable,'' and added, ''There isn't much chance it won't be appealed.'' The lawsuit stemmed from a raid in March 1985, after a informer identified Mr. Hay's ranch near Point Arena as the site of an underground drug storehouse. The informer was eventually flown to the ranch and told the officers there had been a mistake.

815-> WORKS IN PROGRESS; Spanning the Centuries
THE HUNDREDS OF ROPE bridges that once spanned the chasms in the Peruvian Andes were testaments to the engineering skills of the Incas. Part of the elaborate system of roadways within the vast empire known as Tahuantinsuyu, the bridges contributed to the remarkable commerce and communication that the Incas developed during the 15th and 16th centuries. In remote South American highlands, the traditional skills survive. Above, in the Cuzco region of Peru, local Indians construct a span over the Apurimac River. (In the family of languages - one of which was the official tongue of the Incan empire -known as Quechua, which is still in use by more than 5 million people, ''apu'' means powerful one, and ''rimac'' means oracle.) It is the same serpentine body across which Thornton Wilder placed his fictional ''Bridge of San Luis Rey.'' The rope strands are woven from a strong grass known as ichu. Abundant in the ''puna'' - the high altitude plains -of Peru, ichu is used as a general building material, and also as fodder for beasts of burden, notably llamas. In a process that takes days and requires the participation of entire villages, the strands are measured, cut, woven together in bundles of 12 and finally tautened. Four ropes serve as the longitudinal planks of the bridge floor; two others provide handrails. One method of stretching the ropes from one precipice to the other is to hurl lighter lines, weighted at the ends with rocks, over the chasm and use them to haul the heavier ones across. Finally, villagers weave the lattice balusters, working from both ends of the precarious skeleton toward the middle.

816-> SCHOOL FOR THE HANDICAPPED WORKS MIRACLES OF HOPE
I was deeply touched by the article ''Here, Small Steps of Hope.'' As a parent of a child who attends the Little Village School, I have nothing but praise for this wonderful place. I've literally seen a miracle occur before my eyes. Just four years ago, Lauren entered Little Village unable to walk, talk or communicate in any fashion. As a family we were deeply saddened and felt both helpless and hopeless. The school atmosphere is difficult to describe. Everyone is warm, friendly and supportive. Because of the love and compassion of all the professionals, we learned to cope and be happy with small progressions. They never gave up, so how could we? At 7, Lauren can now not only walk but also independently go up and down a flight of stairs. Recently, they have even begun to teach her to ride an adaptive bicycle and roller-skate. While she still can't speak, with the aid of a ''communication board'' she can communicate. Our little girl who lived in a world of solitude and frustration has developed into a curious human being. I must applaud all of her teachers and therapists. Special thanks to Dr. Bank and Dr. Feingold for making the dreams of 150 families into realities. CINDY SOSHNICK Great Neck The Times welcomes letters from readers. Letters for publication should include the writer's name, address and daytime telephone number.

817-> RESULTS PLUS
N.H.L. Nordiques Beat Red Wings: Michel Goulet's 35th goal of the season, 5 minutes 57 seconds into the second period, broke a 2-2 tie last night and Quebec held on for a 3-2 victory in Detroit. Mario Brunetta, the Nordiques' goalie, stopped the final 27 shots he faced as Quebec won for only the second time in its last six games. The loss was the third straight for Detroit. The score was tied at 2-2 after one period before Peter Stastny slipped a pass to Goulet, whose shot from the slot beat Glen Hanlon.(AP) Cycling Phinney in the Lead: Davis Phinney of Boulder, Colo., regained the lead in the Florida portion of the Tour of the Americas bicycle race yesterday when his six-rider team won a 28-mile time trial in St. Petersburg. Less than three hours later, Phinney extended his lead by winning a closely contested one-hour circuit race. He surged ahead of the pack of 91 riders in the final yards to edge Paolo Rosola of Italy. In the first race, Phinney's six-rider team had a time of 54 minutes 15 seconds. Steve Tilford of Topeka, Kan., who led the event going into yesterday's fourth and fifth stages, fell to second place, 37 seconds behind Phinney. Tilford's team was eighth in the time trial, more than two minutes behind Phinney's team. A 101-mile race is set for today in West Palm Beach. The final leg will be tomorrow in Coconut Grove, a Miami suburb.(AP) Tennis Navratilova in Semifinal: Martina Navratilova beat Zina Garrison for the 21st straight time yesterday, posting a 6-1, 6-3 victory to gain a berth in the semifinals of the Virginia Slims of Washington tournament in Fairfax, Va. Navratilova, who has never lost to Garrison, has won 42 of 44 sets against her. The top-seeded Navratilova will next play Hana Mandlikova, who overcame an 0-3 deficit in the final set to eliminate Natalya Zvereva, 5-7, 6-3, 6-3. Pam Shriver and Gabriela Sabatini also advanced and will face each other in the semifinals. Shriver, seeded second, registered a 6-2, 7-5 decision over Helena Sukova. Shriver has won 465 matches, which puts her 10th among female professionals in the Open Era, which began in 1968. Sabatini won 9 of the final 11 games in a 6-3, 6-2 triumph over Barbara Potter.(AP) Another Upset: Unseeded Jorge Lozano, who has left a trail of upsets in the United States Pro Indoor tournament in Philadelphia, did it again yesterday by defeating 14th-seeded Dan Goldie, 4-6, 6-1, 6-4, to advance to the semifinals. Lozano reached the quarterfinals by beating Wally Masur, Amos Mansdorf and Jim Pugh. In another quarterfinal match last night, Christo Van Rensburg defeated Sammy Giammalva, 7-6, 6-2.(AP) Golf Strong Showing by Crenshaw: Ben Crenshaw, an extremely disappointed runner-up in the Los Angeles Open a year ago, shot a seven-under-par 64 yesterday to share the second-round lead in this year's tournament at the Riviera Country Club in Los Angeles. Crenshaw was in a tie with Jay Haas at nine-under-par 133. Haas, in a four-way tie for the lead at 65 after the opening round, shot a 68 yesterday. Chip Beck, who also had a 65 on Thursday, shot a 69 yesterday to join three others at 134. Last year here, Crenshaw made an 18-foot birdie putt on No. 18 on the final day to take a one-shot lead over T. C. Chen. But Chen rolled in a 16-footer to send the tournament into overtime. Crenshaw missed a 3-foot par putt on the first playoff hole to give Chen the victory.(AP) Delk Ahead in Hawaii: Joan Delk battled stiff winds on Oahu's north shore yesterday to shoot a three-under-par 69 for a one-stroke lead after two rounds of the L.P.G.A. Hawaiian OpenDelk, who has won in two years on the L.P.G.A. Tour, matched the best round of her career despite winds gusting to 25 miles per hour on the 6,220-yard Turtle Bay Resort course. Delk made four birdies and one bogey for a 140 total, four par, going into today's final round of the 54-hole tournament. JoAnne Carner and Ayako Okamoto, the 1987 L.P.G.A. player of the year, one stroke back 141. Carner shot a 71 yesterday; Okamoto finished with a 72. Anne-Marie Palli shot a 71 for a 142 total and sole possession of fourth place.Five players, including Thursday's, leader Jan Stephenson, were three strokes back at 143. The others were Sally Quinlan, Kathy Postlewait, Beth Daniel and Cathy Gerring.(AP) Hill Leads Seniors: Dave Hill struggled with his putter but still shot a four-under-par 68 for a one-stroke lead after one round of the Aetna Challenge for Seniors in Naples, Fla. Bob Charles, Bruce Devlin and Don Massengale were tied for second at The Club at Pelican Bay.

818-> Indictment in Asbestos Dumping
A Staten Island construction company and one of its employees were indicted yesterday on charges that they used unsafe methods to remove asbestos from a Sanitation Department garage and dumped the debris outside a Bronx apartment house. The indictment accused DAR Construction, and a company foreman, Maurice Dieyette, of six counts of Federal environmental rule violations in the August 1986 removal of asbestos from the sanitation garage at 4036 Ninth Avenue at West 215 Street in the Inwood section of Manhattan. Mr. Dieyette, a 41-year-old Brooklyn resident, also was charged with two counts of obstructing justice. He is accused of trying to get two company workers to lie to a grand jury about how the asbestos was removed. Clouds of Dust Officials said the case involved the first criminal indictment for asbestos violations under the Clean Air Act in the metropolitan region. The indictment charged that the company's workers, some not equipped with gloves, respirators or other protective clothing, stripped dry asbestos from pipes and let it fall 25 feet to the floor, causing clouds of dust - all in violation of Federal regulations. The workers placed the debris in plastic bags turned inside out to conceal their warning labels, took the bags late at night to the Bronx and left them in a garbage bin outside an unidentified apartment building, the indictment charged. The company, whose address is 1941 Richmond Terrace on Staten Island, faces a maximum fine of $25,000 per day for each violation, if convicted, said Assistant United States Attorney William E. Simon Jr. He said Mr. Dieyette, who is free on bond, faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted on each obstruction of justice count, the most serious charge.

819-> City Hall Notes; New York Panel Draws a Whimsical Picture of Government
One thing New York City's government has never been accused of is being artistic. Colorful, maybe. But not artistic. Until now. In an effort to explain the current city government to an electorate that will be voting on changing it next November, the Charter Revision Commission has issued a whimsical poster that illustrates the city's vast bureauracy. The poster, which looks a little bit like a Monopoly board, has the cognoscenti of city government chuckling because instead of relying on charts or lists or diagrams, it is a flow chart of sorts that turns each agency into a playful illustration of its function. The Department of Investigation has a spyglass on its roof. The Board of Education is a little red schoolhouse. The Public Development Corporation is transformed into a bulldozer; the Taxi and Limousine Commission looks like a Checker cab and has four tiny cabs scooting around it; the Department of Sanitation is a garbage truck; the Office of Management and Budget is pictured as one big adding machine. The 10,000 posters, paid for by a $15,000 grant from the J. M. Kaplan Foundation, went to city officials, schools and the like and are almost gone. Patrick Merrell, the freelance illustrator who did the poster with Greg Wozney, a graphic designer, said it took about a month of work and yes, there was a glitch. In their final draft, they forgot to include the Board of Ethics. ''There sure would have been some political comments about that,'' said Mr. Merrell, rather relieved that someone at the Charter Revision Commission caught the error. English, Anyone? Move over ''wacko.'' Make room for ''gezunthayt.'' Or ''gezunterhayt.'' Or ''gay gezunt.'' An explanation: A few weeks ago, when a State Supreme Court justice ordered the Mayor to release his private appointment books, an angry Mr. Koch complied, but under protest. ''As my mother would have said, gezunthayt,'' he said to reporters on the investigative trail. Mr. Koch said the Yiddish word meant ''May the force be with you,'' which it does not. Just what it does mean is, however, open to interpretation. Several of them. This newspaper reported that the phrase was ''fractured Yiddish'' for ''go in health'' because in his book ''Hooray for Yiddish,'' Leo Rosten explains that gezunthayt is ''Yinglish'' for ''health'' and that the literal translation of ''go in health'' is ''gai gezunterhayt.'' Some Yiddish experts disagreed, among them Herbert Bienstock, director of the Center for Labor and Urban Programs, Research and Analysis at Queens College. ''Please forgive the purist in me,'' Mr. Bienstock, wrote in a good-natured letter. '' 'Gezunthayt' does not translate to go in health,'' he advised. ''That would be 'gay gezunt.' The correct translation of 'gezunthayt' is 'in a healthy way.' Actually, the idiomatic translation is almost 'Be my guest.' '' Which is no doubt what Mr. Koch meant all along. Next time, perhaps, the Mayor - who generated a similar debate years ago about the spelling of wacko (versus whacko) - will stick to English. AIDS and Hospitals Generally, news conferences generate news. Sometimes, they generate embarrassment, as was the case not long ago when City Council President Andrew J. Stein held one to accuse some hospitals in the city of refusing patients with AIDS. He cited statistics showing that while 5.2 percent of all Manhattan hospital beds are occupied by AIDS patients, some hospitals had well below that total. This meant that either people with AIDS were being turned away, as Mr. Stein contended, or were not going to those hospitals in the first place. Mr. Stein, who has held quite a few news conferences in his years in city government, has zeroed in on some serious problems. This time, though, when asked to prove that the hospitals he cited actually had rejected AIDS patients, he could not. ''We have not done an investigation,'' he conceded. ''I do not have hard evidence that they are turning them away. I do have evidence from these statistics that they are not doing their fair share.'' The Greater New York Hospital Association denied Mr. Stein's charges. Mr. Stein's aides are continuing to analyze the issue. 'I Am Not' The latest additions to the ever-growing list of what Mayor Koch says he is not. (As in ''I am not a punching bag,'' or ''I am not a diplomat''). In recent weeks, the Mayor has said he is not: ''Wharton,'' ''an expert in econometric models'' or ''someone who has never served in a legislature.''

820-> Welfare Test Tries A Personal Approach
OFFICIALS hope an experiment in eastern Connecticut can offer clues to help remove people from the welfare rolls. The three-year program, which began this month, mirrors efforts by other states to change the welfare system. The goal of the program, Project Pride, is to help 200 applicants become self-reliant as quickly as possible. Unlike the existing welfare process, where applicants go to their regional office of the State Department of Income Maintenance to determine their benefits and are reviewed every six months, Project Pride, in the Norwich office, sends a case manager to the applicant's home in lieu of office visits and works with the family on many problems, not just financial. ''The current Aid for Dependent Children program is very similar to the one which began in 1935, which was designed to help widows with children until they remarried,'' the public information supervisor for the welfare department, Claudette Beaulieu, said. ''And while there have been enormous changes in society,'' the welfare system has not kept pace. She said Project Pride was testing three of the four proposals before Congress. They are a caseworker's providing comprehensive services, a signed agreement for a plan toward self-reliance and more intensive use of Job Connection, an employment and training program. If families do not fulfill their obligations, their benefits could be reduced. State Representative Patricia Dillon, a Democrat of New Haven who has studied the welfare system and is familiar with Project Pride, said she thought early intervention was key to helping people leave welfare. ''I think this project is a reasonable thing to try to do, especially on a pilot basis, because it deals with the human side of the family,'' she said. ''When you're on the outside, it's sometimes not easy to recognize how debilitating the whole process is to the family. However, I don't think it would be prudent to do it statewide, yet.'' Ms. Beaulieu said day care, transportation and a lack of self-confidence had been deterrents in helping families, the vast majority led by single mothers, on their feet and off welfare. Although the state allows for day-care and transportation allowances for parents who are in job training or working at minimum-wage jobs, these parents are often uanaware of the benefits and go from one training program to another or from one low-paying job to another and never really end assistance, she said. ''What we're trying to do is get these families to start thinking about becoming independent as soon as they sign up for welfare,'' Ms. Beaulieu said. ''This is a complete departure from what's happening now.'' Health-care benefits, she said, were another serious'' problem. Welfare recipients are often offered entry-level positions that offer inadequate or no coverage. The people in Project Pride will be directed to go to such training as data processing, nursing and other health-care positions. There are 37,000 households in the state receiving state welfare. A consultant who supervises Project Pride, Marie Nenninger, said the case managers who worked with the families ''get a real feel for the applicants' environment.'' If a child is having trouble at school, if a member of the family has a drug addiction or if there are problems with former spouses, the manager can step in. Sometimes, Ms. Nenninger said, people on welfare do not realize they have the potential to support themselves and feel trapped and hopeless. A case manager, Gail Salony, said a mother she was working with had been a factory worker who disliked her work and applied for welfare. After speaking with the woman, Ms. Salony learned the applicant would like to become a nurse. Their written agreement stipulates that the woman attend nursing school. Despite the hopes, some officials say Project Pride might not be a solution. ''I don't think we should make it easier for people to collect welfare,'' State Senator Thomas Scott, a Republican of Milford, said. ''I think they should have to be involved in a workfare program, instead.'' Workfare, which began in Connecticut in the early 1980's and lasted about one year, mandated that all able-bodied welfare recipients perform a number of hours of community work weekly to collect benefits. Mr. Scott said he objected to Project Pride because he it would ultimately require more caseworkers, if it becomes statewide. He said it would be ''bureaucratic empire-building,'' because the worker-client ratio would be smaller. ''An awful lot of people on welfare today find it attractive to be so,'' Mr. Scott said. ''If the stiffs got off welfare, there would be more money for those who were truly needy.'' Ms. Dillon said, ''If we don't work with someone early, they're likely to end up in a welfare motel or some other kind of emergency housing, costing the state five to six times as much.'' Ms. Beaulieu said most recipients did not want to receive welfare. ''We really think,'' she said, ''given a chance, most people want to get off and stay off.''

821-> Budget Called Bad for New York Area
Legislators from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut say that President Reagan's $1.09 trillion budget calls for too many sacrifices from the region's cities, but that the most improvement they expect is revisions for several key programs. ''This budget still shows a mean-spiritedness toward the programs that help New York's poor and middle class,'' said Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat who serves on the House Budget Committee. ''It requires major surgery. But I think that if we can rearrange the cuts to make the pain-sharing more equal with other parts of the country we'll be able to live with it.'' Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat who sits on the Senate Budget Committee, said that in its present form the budget ''would not serve our state's interests well.'' But he added, ''It could be worse.'' Representative Frank J. Guarini, a New Jersey Democrat who is on the House Budget Committee, said the President was ''playing political football'' with programs vital to New Jersey. ''It's fiscally irresponsible of the President to cut programs that have a track record and have worked,'' he said. #3 Areas of Concern The President sent his budget for the 1989 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, to Congress on Thursday and legislators have been scrutinizing its numbers and their significance since. Congressmen from the New York region said Friday that the proposed budget shortchanges the region in three areas: mass transit, housing and community development. However, they added, because the budget meets the guidelines of an agreement to reduce the Federal deficit that was negotiated by Congress and the President after the stock market collapse in October, it was unlikely that a majority of House members would advocate discarding it and drafting an entirely new document. Instead, the President's version is expected to be chopped up and put back together so that it better reflects the priorities of the Democratic majority in Congress without diverging so far from Mr. Reagan's agenda that he would be inclined to veto it. ''We're talking about making a political deal,'' Mr. Guarini said. ''I'm not satisfied with that, but there's no real alternative at this point.'' Schumer's Analysis Mr. Schumer, who produces a detailed analysis each year of the impact of the budget on New York City, calculated that the total cuts to major programs important to the city would come to more than $500 million. He said an unrevised Reagan budget would have these effects: * A 10-cent or more increase in subway and bus fares because of a proposal to eliminate all operating assistance to the city's mass transit system. * An increase in homelessness because the President proposes no new housing for the poor and seeks to cut funds to rehabilitate rental property by 25 percent and support for public housing modernization by almost half. * A ''virtual moratorium'' on low- and middle-income housing construction because of cuts in Community Development Block Grants and the elimination of Urban Development Action Grants. Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, said he was pleased that Mr. Reagan had proposed keeping total spending at roughly last year's levels while ''proposing increases in Federal support for education, toxic waste cleanup, AIDS prevention and treatment, and child-support enforcement.'' But he expressed concern about cuts for mass transit sewage treatment grants and land acquisition for parks and refuse programs. Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, a New Jersey Democrat who sits on the Senate Budget Committee, said, ''The Administration is once again asking Congress to approve a budget that ignores New Jersey's needs.''

822-> Baseball; Johnson Greets 9 Position Players
Dave Johnson began his fifth and final year as manager of the Mets today with a new spring training address but with the old thunder, and predicted: ''We should win. We could dominate.'' ''On paper, I think we've got the best team in baseball,'' he said, and promptly added: ''But that doesn't win games.'' Johnson surveyed the world of the Mets from a swivel chair behind a large desk in a huge office a few steps away from the team's carpeted locker room in its new $11 million training camp. The first workout wasn't scheduled until Monday, when the pitchers and catchers take the field, one week ahead of the rest of the squad. But Johnson already was in residence with 20 or so of his players and with all the appearance of a man drawing a bead on a target. He was joined by a remarkably full and distinguished group of early arrivals, including nine position players who didn't have to show up until a week from Monday. They were Keith Hernandez, Gary Carter, Howard Johnson, Tim Teufel, Lee Mazzilli, Mookie Wilson, Wally Backman, Barry Lyons and Keith Miller. They looked and acted fit and confident, and nobody suggested that the team's attitude this season would be diminished by the fact that Johnson in effect is a lame-duck manager. His contract ends at the close of this season, and he has not been invited back by Frank Cashen, the general manager, who instead has offered him another job in the club's heirarchy. Status the Same This Year Johnson refused to discuss life after 1988, but he said firmly: ''My status hasn't changed for this year. It has no effect at all, period. I'm going to enjoy this year. I'll be a happier person.'' Johnson said that the Mets had regained the health and the depth that escaped them last season, when they won 92 games of 162 but still ran three games behind the St. Louis Cardinals in the National League East. Seven starting pitchers were disabled during the season, plus Roger McDowell, the ace of the bullpen. ''The bullpen needs to be beefed up, and that's my only concern,'' he said. ''The bullpen's numbers weren't as good last year as the year before. Our pen was no longer the dominating force it was in '86. It ranked in the middle of the league. Now, we've traded Jesse Orosco and Doug Sisk, and we've got to replace them. ''But we're going to win a lot of games. We have guys who still haven't had career years. Darryl Strawberry hasn't, and Kevin McReynolds, and maybe only Dwight Gooden's had a career year among the pitchers. On paper, we could dominate. If our bullpen comes around and puts up the numbers it did two years ago, we could dominate.'' 'Guys May Be Hungrier' ''Last year,'' he said, taking a kind of clinical look back, ''we were on such a high from winning the World Series. The guys probably did too much during the off season. This spring, the guys may be hungrier. I guess we weren't in great demand. ''The great effort we made in 1986 just to get there, it fell off last year. But when you had the kind of year we had, everybody wants to work much harder.'' Everybody will get the chance during the next six weeks, because the Mets' new camp was built for work. After 27 years of spring training in St. Petersburg on Florida's Gulf Coast, the Mets moved across the peninsula this year to a 100-acre complex built by the Thomas J. White Company of St. Louis as part of a planned community. It has a 7,000-seat stadium with outfield dimensions that match those in Shea Stadium in New York (410 feet to dead center field, 338 down the foul lines). It has four practice fields, another field surfaced with artificial turf, a separate practice infield and 15 batting cages, four of them indoors, plus two indoor pitching mounds. Well-Stocked Weight Room The camp also has a weight room stocked with 22 exercise devices, including four Lifecycles and numerous weight-pulls and other stamina builders. ''The emphasis,'' said Keith Cedro, the Mets' fitness coach, ''is 162 games. You get tired, you get hurt, or you get into a slump.''

824-> Wachtler Supports A Nonpartisan Vote To Re-elect Judges
The Chief Judge of New York State, Sol Wachtler, bowing to what he called the political realities in Albany, has endorsed a proposal to replace the partisan re-election process for sitting judges with a nonpartisan retention election. The judge's endorsement represented a compromise with his own well-known position of favoring the appointment of all judges in New York. The judge's concept of a modified elective process was generally supported by other witnesses at a hearing Thursday on the judicial selection process. The hearing was held by the Commission on Government Integrity at the New York County Lawyers Association Building in lower Manhattan. The most notable exception was former Governor Malcolm Wilson, who said replacing the long-established elective system with an appointive system would be ''papa-knows-bestism in its most aggravating form.'' 'Partisan Political Arena' Judge Wachtler, who heads the Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, said he recognized that the State Legislature would not go along ''in the foreseeable future'' with his belief in an appointive process that would take the selection of all judges ''entirely out of the partisan political arena.'' Mr. Wilson countered that to move to an appointive process would simply ''shift the politics from the political parties to the Governor'' who now picks Court of Appeals judges, for example, from nominations made by a nonpartisan commission. ''Advocates of change deplore political contests,'' Mr. Wilson said. ''Those who seek to change the system bear a very heavy burden of proof.'' Judge Wachtler said his proposal for a nonpartisan retention election would ''relieve sitting judges and the courts of much that is unseemly in our elective system while, at the same time, maintaining in the electorate the right to choose its judges.'' Such a proposal would require a Constitutional amendment and have to be approved first by two separately elected legislatures and then a statewide referendum. ''First, by requiring a judge seeking re-election to secure endorsement by the local commission on judicial qualifications, it provides the public with objective assurance that he or she remains qualified to sit,'' Judge Wachtler said. ''Second, through the vehicle of the retention election, it permits the public to voice its approval or disapproval of the sitting judge.'' Other supporters of Judge Wachtler's position included Assemblyman Saul Weprin, Democrat of Queens, who headed the Assembly's judiciary committee from 1980 to 1986, and Donald Sullivan, a former State Supreme Court justice from the South Bronx who was denied renomination by Stanley M. Friedman, then the Bronx Democratic leader, in 1983.

825-> THE REGION; City Finally Focusing on Its Sluggish Rights Panel
WHEN a Mayoral task force issued a stinging critique of New York City's Human Rights Commission last month, saying it took years to handle complaints that should be resolved in months, few were surprised. Public documents, including Mayor Koch's own twice-yearly management reports, had long chronicled a serious backlog in cases, staffing shortages and other problems at the agency. City officials and community groups concurred that the panel was ineffective. For much of last year, it received an average of 70 cases a month and closed an average of only 50. Mr. Koch says his administration had tried to reduce the 1,000-case backlog of the agency, which is charged with enforcing the city's anti-discrimination laws and improving race relations. But it was only a year ago, in the wake of the Howard Beach racial attack and at the urging of community leaders, that Mr. Koch ordered aides to review the agency's operations and make recommendations for change. What took so long? ''It's the Mayor's responsibility, it's one of his agencies,'' said Manhattan Borough President David N. Dinkins, the city's top black elected official. ''They've had a tremendous backlog of cases there for a long time. Unfortunately, it takes something as ugly as a lynch mob in Howard Beach to shock this city into action.'' City officials, human rights experts and community leaders say the commission's problems, and the long inattention to them, are complex. The factors they cite range from the cutbacks of the city's fiscal crisis and Mr. Koch's subsequent concentration on rebuilding services like police and sanitation, to the Reagan Adminstration's inattentiveness to the issue. There has also been some criticism of the agency's leadership. But Dr. Marcella Maxwell, who was appointed four years ago to cure the agency's ills and resigned last month, said she had no previous complaints about her effectiveness. ''Nobody at City Hall ever called me in and said there was anything wrong with what I was doing,'' Dr. Maxwell said. In a recent interview about the agency's problems, Mayor Koch said that Dr. Maxwell ''cured many of them, not all of them.'' In the 1970's, the commission had a high public profile under its chairman, Eleanor Holmes Norton, and was widely regarded as an important organization that aggressively pursued complaints of bias. But the agency's budget was reduced during the lean years of the late 70's, and when the city began to recover in the 1980's, the Koch administration concentrated first on improving essential services. ''Clearly the message was going out that so-called soft services like human rights were not a major priority for the administration,'' said David R. Jones, general director of the Community Service Society of New York, a nonprofit social welfare group. But he said he thought the main reason was ''the fact that the Mayor and the people around him were most concerned with bringing back economic vitality.'' Mr. Koch defended his record and said his drive to bolster services was, in fact, a result of his wish to improve relations with blacks, who, he said, especially need police protection because they often live in high-crime areas. ''There isn't a single agency in this government that has enough money to do all that it should,'' he said. ''My focus is still on more money for cops, more money for education, and then take whatever monies we can and have some fair allocation for other agencies including the human rights agency.'' Its current budget of $7.5 million a year supports a 230-person staff, including 52 investigators. Mr. Koch has named the Rev. Dr. John E. Brandon, the former pastor of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Harlem and president of Payne Theological Seminary in Ohio, as the new head of the Human Rights Commission. When Dr. Brandon takes over next month, the agency will have changed its handling of complaints so that lawyers and investigators work on cases simultaneously in an effort to cut the backlog. In addition, its 15-member board of commissioners is to be reconstituted. Ms. Norton, who is now a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center, said New York's commission faces special challenges because of the city's size and diverse population. ''It must be both the most sophisticated human relations agency in the country and the strongest kind of law enforcement agency,'' she said. ''It has probably the strongest human rights law of any in the country to work with.'' Mr. Jones of the Community Service Society, said it remains to be seen how the agency will meet those challenges. ''The trouble with this is the administration's going to have to make a commitment of more than just a few months, while the Howard Beach situation is fresh in everybody's minds,'' he said.

826-> Sakaide Journal; In the Other Japan, a Bridge Is a Two-Way Street
Japan's Inland Sea is sometimes called the Aegean of the East. On calm days, it is an emerald mirror, embossed with many hundreds of dark, thickly wooded islands across its 300-mile length. To the north looms Honshu, the dominating main island of Japan. Here, on the other side of the sea, lies the island of Shikoku - unassuming, underpopulated, usually ignored. Shikoku looks much like the rest of Japan. Yet it is different. It has open spaces. It has tangerines growing on the hillsides and splendid high-school baseball teams. It has a Buddhist pilgrim's circuit of 88 temples and a Shinto shrine perched atop 785 steps, where the elderly, the lame and the merely lazy can be carried up the stone stairs in palanquins. Island of 4.2 Million Other Japanese regard Shikoku and its 4.2 million people as isolated, reachable as they are only by ferry and aircraft. But now this large island is about to become a piece of the main. A bridge has been built, stretching from Sakaide, a workaday city on Shikoku's northern coast, to Kojima, a nondescript town on the Honshu side. It took 10 years, 11 lives, millions of man-hours and $8.8 billion to construct the Seto Ohashi, or Seto Great Bridge. But now it is finished and will open in two months, a double-tiered wonder that is actually a network of six bridges and connecting viaducts, hopscotching nearly six miles across tiny islands and designed to carry cars above and trains below. There are all sorts of forecasts about what the Seto Ohashi will mean for Shikoku. Local officials and businessmen look for more tourism and a steady flow of goods to and from the island, now at the mercy of the weather. Shikoku, they predict, will be integrated with the economy of bustling Osaka and Kobe on Honshu. Those are the forecasts. But then the officials also acknowledge that they can be sure of nothing. A bridge, after all, goes two ways. No one knows if Honshu companies will now flock here, or whether the people of Shikoku will race across the bridge instead to bathe in the dazzle of Osaka. 'Psychological Boost' Despite the uncertainty, they suspect the Seto Ohashi is a blessing. ''It will give us a strong psychological boost into a new era,'' said Kazuo Okura, a banker in Takamatsu, a major Shikoku city. And if one bridge is desirable, then two must be twice as good and three better yet. After an infinity of detachment, Shikoku is destined to get two more bridges to Honshu within another 10 years. Some people see pork-barrel politics at work, but not Mr. Okura. When it comes to bridges, he said, ''the more the better.'' It's Not the Golden Gate How ridiculous to call it the Seto Great Bridge, Masayuki Nagare was saying. The Golden Gate - now there's a great bridge. This one here, he groused, is too imitative, too glitzy, too expensive, too ill conceived. Thank goodness, he said, that he cannot see it from his spacious studio, which commands a jaw-dropping view of the Inland Sea from a promontory jutting out from Shikoku's northeastern coast. Mr. Nagare, 65 years old on Valentine's Day, is one of Japan's foremost sculptors. In World War II he was a trained kamikaze pilot who got lucky: the fighting ended before his number was up. After several years of aimless wandering, he took up sculpture and settled on this island. He is an unabashed Shikoku booster. It was for that reason, Mr. Nagare says, that he gave his imprimatur to the bridge he so dislikes, honoring it with a giant sculpture that will stand near the Sakaide entrance. It is a granite ''shishi,'' a fabulous, lionlike creature that guards the entrances to many Shinto shrines. Similarly, Mr. Nagare said, his shishi will watch over ships passing beneath the bridge. That also means the statue will be guardian to the Seto Ohasi itself. But even with such protection, the bridge will not last more than 300 years, the artist predicted. ''My sculpture,'' he said, ''will last longer.'' The Quest to Be No. 1 A traditional Japanese bridge is a parabolic delight, a wooden swoop across an inlet or garden pond. This new one is hardly that. But every suspension bridge has an allure, and there are three such spans among the six that form the Seto Ohashi. One of them, the Minami Bisan-Seto, is among the longest in the world, officials are quick to note. It stretches 3,609 feet across its main span, surpassing the George Washington Bridge but falling short of the Golden Gate, the Verrazano-Narrows, the Mackinac and the Humber in Yorkshire, England, which holds the record at 4,626 feet. There is something very Japanese in all this measuring. Japan constantly takes its own pulse, fretting about such matters as whether its underwater tunnels are the longest or its ''bullet trains'' the fastest. So officials here observe with pride that while the Seto Ohashi may not be the world's longest suspension bridge, it is the longest one with two decks. By 1998 they hope to be absolutely No. 1. One of the two other Shikoku-Honshu connections being built will include a suspension bridge, the Akashi Kaikyo, designed at 6,529 feet across the main span. It will leave the poor old Humber Bridge in the dust, and Japan presumably can then move on to another conquest.

827-> SPORTS PEOPLE; Nance's New Home
Acknowledging that the move was contrary to his franchise's commitment to build with young players, Wayne Embry, general manager of the Cleveland Cavaliers, said he traded to obtain Larry Nance because Nance was the best small forward the team could expect to find for several years. ''We thought that it was an opportunity to get an All-Star small forward,'' Embry said. ''And as we look at the draft this year and in the following years, we didn't see that caliber of player there for us.'' The Cavaliers sent three players and three draft choices to the Phoenix Suns for Nance, a seven-year veteran, and Mike Sanders, another veteran, plus a draft choice. The trade was announced Thursday night less than an hour before the National Basketball Association trading deadline. The Cavaliers parted with Kevin Johnson, a guard, Tyrone Corbin, a forward, and Mark West, a center.

829-> TIPS FOR THE SOPHISTICATED TRAVELER: In the Right Place at the Right Time; AMAZEMENT UNDER THE MIDNIGHT SUN
I am not often in exactly the right place at the right time, unless you consider it lucky to be near Cape Hatteras during a hurricane or on the subway when there's a derailment. But sometimes I believe that I have only myself to blame for certain travel mishaps. After all, I did pack a flashlight for Fairbanks during the summer solstice, and I didn't pack any mosquito repellent. There I was, at midnight, at the welcoming party for the Midnight Sun Writers Conference, slightly punchy from the long trip and from all that eerie light. I swatted and scratched and thought, a sleep mask - that's what I should have packed - when someone who'd gone outside for a moment rushed back in, full of excitement. What now, I wondered - an earthquake, perhaps? - as I followed everyone out of the building. And then I saw what all the fuss was about - the peak of Mount McKinley rising with imperial beauty from its usual veil of clouds. We all exclaimed joyfully (as we should have) at this blessing of nature, at our own good fortune in witnessing it. It seemed to be an extravagant reparation for all the minor inconveniences of delayed flights, lost luggage and inclement weather. But wait! That wasn't all. A moment later a rainbow arced across that vast expanse of sky, and at the same time a brilliantly colored, hot-air balloon floated overhead! The whole thing had a mysterious, almost hallucinatory quality. Later, at 3 or 4 in the morning, unable to sleep in my curtainless dorm room, with the light still shining mercilessly through the window, I experienced the usual loneliness and pleasure of being somewhere new and very far from home. I kept replaying that earlier, spectacular confluence of events, thinking that my luck (at least as far as traveling goes) had finally changed, and that probably no one would ever believe it had happened.

830-> CHESS; THE DRAWBACKS OF PLAYING FAVORITES
BEING known for a favorite defense is a two-way street. If you are really good with it, you will intimidate many an opponent and score victories against listless play. Yet no matter how good you are with it, it does point the opponent toward what he has to prepare when he comes up against you. And there are opponents who cannot be intimidated. One of these is the Manhattan grandmaster John Fedorowicz, as can be seen in his encounter with the Brooklyn grandmaster Maxim Dlugy in the 12th round of the United States Championship in Estes Park, Colo. Dlugy is well known for his expertise with the 8 ... P-KR3 branch of the Richter-Rauzer Attack, but Fedorowicz knew that there were new plans fermenting against it in recent games and was willing to try them out. One of the points of 8 ... P-KR3 is to break the pin of the black KN, which cannot be maintained by 9 B-R4?! because the gambit with 9 ... NxP!; 10 Q-B4 is not quite correct after 10 ... N-N4; 11 NxN, PxN; 12 Q-R4, Q-N3; 13 P-B4, N-R2. It is possible to retreat with 9 B-KB4, but on 9 ... B-Q2! (9 ... NxN?, 10 QxN, P-K4?; 11 BxKP just blunders away a pawn), White would have to realize that he cannot count on any advantage after 10 NxN, BxN; 11 BxQP, BxB; 12 QxB, QxQ; 13 RxQ, BxP. On 9 B-K3, the falsely optimistic move 9 ... N-KN5? was tried in Game 2 of the 1957 World Championship match in Moscow between Vassily Smyslov and Mikhail Botvinnik, but after 10 NxN, PxN; 11 B-B5!, B-N2; 12 P-KR3, PxB; 13 QxQch, Black fell into a weak end game. However, for a long time, it was thought that after 9 ... NxN, the recapture 10 QxN was erroneous in allowing Black to secure the bishop-pair with 10 ... N-N5 (because 11 B-Q2? allows 11 ... P-K4). Not so; recent analysis in Chess Informant 43 shows that 11 P-K5!, NxKP; 12 N-K4 yields White a strong two-bishop end game after 12 ... N-B3; 13 NxPch, QxN; 14 QxQ, BxQ; 15 RxB. Moreover, 11 ... NxB; 12 PxN! also favors White. For example, 12 ... P-Q4; 13 P-K4, Q-N4ch; 14 K-N1, PxP? would be crushed by 15 Q-R4ch!, K-K2; 16 Q-R3ch, K-K1; 17 B-N5ch! Dlugy's new 10 ... B-Q2 enabled the black king, after 14 P-KN4, to obtain comparative safety with 14 ... 0-0-0 rather than come under a fire storm of white pawns on the other wing. On 15 P-QR3, opening the game with 15 ... P-Q4; 16 PxP, NxQP; 17 NxN, BxN; 18 BxB, RxB favors White after 19 Q-K4. After 18 B-N4, which began preparation for a break-up of the black pawn formation by P-N6, Fedorowicz had the initiative firmly in hand. Perhaps Dlugy should have delayed 18 ... PxP; 19 RPxP, because opening the KR file benefits only White. After 20 R-R7!, defense by 20 ... B-B1? would have permitted 21 P-N6!, N-B3; 22 PxP, QxP; 23 Q-N6ch, winning a piece. Moreover, defense by 20 ... N-B1 would not have stopped 21 RxP! because 21 ... P-K4; 22 Q-R7ch!, QxQ; 23 BxQch, KxB; 24 RxR wins the exchange. Dlugy should have tried 20 ...

831-> U.S. Vehicle Sales Post 11% Rise
Late March sales of American-made cars and light trucks were up about 11 percent from the comparable period last year, the eight domestic manufacturers reported today. The Big Three auto manufacturers all posted excellent results, increasing their share of the market to about 77 percent, up about 2.5 percentage points from a year ago. Japanese car and truck imports, on the other hand, dropped about 1.5 percentage points, taking 16.1 percent of the market. For the first time since voluntary export restraints were adopted, in 1981, the Japanese auto manufacturers failed to ship their annual quota of import cars, 2.3 million vehicles for the fiscal year ended March 31. Automotive News, a trade weekly, reported this week that the Japanese had missed their mark by 70,000 to 100,000 cars, largely because the Nissan Motor Corporation shipped 66,200 fewer vehicles than its quota. Sales of Imported Cars Actual sales of imported Japanese cars totaled 2.22 million cars in the quota year, down from the previous fiscal year's 2.32 million; both numbers include models marketed under the brand names of the General Motors Corporation and the Chrysler Corporation. Industrywide figures for the month of March showed that domestic and imported light-vehicle sales averaged 54,717 units a day for the month's 27 selling days, up 4.9 percent from March 1987, which had 26 selling days. Domestic car sales rose 3.6 percent, to 27,175 a day, indicating a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.7 million units in March, up from last year's 6.9 million. ''I'm not surprised,'' said Jack V. Kirnan, an auto analyst for Kidder, Peabody in New York. ''We've had a turnaround in consumer confidence and incentives are drawing sales; it's really a buyer's market.'' The Japanese have been hurt by the strength of the yen, which makes their goods more expensive overseas. For the first time, the Japanese auto makers have larger inventories of unsold cars in proportion to their sales rates than the Big Three. The inventories reflect their drive to ship cars in order to meet their quotas, lest they be cut by Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry. Nissan, especially, has inventory problems. It had 150 days' supply of cars at the beginning of March, and Automotive News calculated that it should have had about 206 days' by March 31. The Japanese importers as a whole had a 71-day supply going into the month and a higher level coming out of it, said Mr. Kirnan of Kidder, Peabody. He compared that with his estimates for the General Motors Corporation, with about a 59-day supply of cars, Chrysler, with about 61 days' and the Ford Motor Company, with 50 days'. Economists consider 65 supply-days to be normal. Domestic Car Sales Domestic car sales averaged 27,165 a day in March, up 3.5 percent; imported cars averaged 10,017 sales a day, up 5.5 percent. Domestic truck sales averaged 15,187 a day, up 14.6 percent; imported trucks averaged 2,338 a day, down 26 percent. The Japanese component in imports totaled 8,760 units a day in March, a decline of 4.8 percent from March 1987. The major gainers among importers were Hyundai, which sold at a daily rate of 960 cars, up 29 percent, and Jaguar, which rose 16 percent, to a daily rate of 69 cars. Porsche and Volvo were the major year-to-year losers, declining 25 percent to daily rates of 69 and 307, respectively. In the last third of the month, domestic car sales averaged 33,272 units a day, up 6.1 percent from the comparable period last year, for an annualized sales rate of 8.0 million; that compares with a 6.7 million rate in last year's period. Sales of domestic light trucks rose 21.6 percent, to a daily rate of 18,388 units. Chrysler said March sales were the best for that month in 15 years, completing the best first quarter ever. The company's market share reached 15.3 percent, up 1.2 points from the same month last year, with total vehicles sales averaging 8,288 vehicles a day, up 12.8 percent. In the last third of the month, Chrysler sold 4,813 cars, up 4 percent, and 40,907 trucks, up 16 percent from the comparable period last year. G.M. sold 19,343 vehicles a day in the month, up 3.9 percent, increasing its total share to 35.8 percent of the market, up a point. In the last 10 days, G.M. sold 15,973 cars a day, up 5.6 percent, and 70,156 light trucks a day, up 20.3 percent. Ford sold 13,882 vehicles a day in March, up 8.8 percent, adding 1.1 points to its share, which totaled 25.7 percent. In the last third, it sold 9,359 cars a day, up 6.3 percent, and 6,764 light trucks a day, up 26.1 percent. Among the foreign-owned American manufacturers, Honda of America sold 2,043 cars a day in late March, up 10.5 percent from a year ago. Volkswagen of America sold 248 cars a day, 11.5 percent. Toyota sold 288 cars a day, up 32 percent. The Nissan Motor Company averaged 398 cars a day, down 22.6 percent, and 519 light trucks a day, up 30.8 percent; Nissan has switched production from cars to trucks in recent months. The Mazda Motor Manufacturing Corporation sold 1,511 cars; it sold no cars last year. $ March Car Sales Change Unit From Sales 1987 G.M. 347,273 -1.4% Ford 216,635 +5.7% Chrysler 113,593 +10.0% Honda 36,191 +22.4% VW 4,286 -4.6% Nissan 7,784 -26.0% Toyota 5,162 +43.9% Mazda 2,814 N.A.

A woman about to board a bus for Washington with about two and a half pounds of cocaine was arrested Friday with a companion at the Port Authority bus terminal, the authorities reported yesterday. A Port Authority spokesman, Allen Morrison, said the two suspects -Sheila Harris, 22 years old, of Washington, and Ben Richards, 25, of 1738 Popham Avenue in the Morris Heights section of the Bronx - were arrested about 2 P.M. Friday. They were charged with possession of a controlled substance and conspiracy to transport it.

834-> Panama Envoy Quits, Assailing Military Rule
A senior Panamanian diplomat resigned today, saying he could no longer work in good conscience for a government ''characterized by corruption, illegitimacy and dishonesty.'' The diplomat, Lawrence Chewning Fabrega, Panama's minister-counselor to the Organization of American States, said he had made his decision after he was ordered to give a speech three days ago at an O.A.S. ceremony that was highly criticial of the United States and in his opinion did not reflect the truth. Defending his more than 20 years of diplomatic service as ''unblemished,'' Mr. Chewning added, ''I do not wish it now to be tarnished by an act that will shame my wife, my children, my family and my friends.'' Colleagues Stunned Mr. Chewning's resignation stunned colleagues at the inter-American organization, who described him as a low-key diplomat who went to great lengths to be cautious in his diplomatic dealings. Reading from a prepared statement at O.A.S. headquarters today, Mr. Chewning appeared shaken, but said his Roman Catholic beliefs played a role in shaping his decision. ''My conscience, my dignity and my deep religious beliefs prevent me from continuing to be used as an instrument of a government characterized by corruption, illegitimacy and dishonesty,'' he said. In remarks to reporters, Mr. Chewning called the Government illegitimate ''because it is run by the military.'' May Seek Asylum Mr. Chewning said that he did not anticipate reprisals from Panama's Government and that at the moment he was not seeking political asylum in the United States. But close associates indicated he probably would seek asylum. With his resignation, Mr. Chewning loses his diplomatic immunity and can no longer live legally in the United States beyond a 30-day period unless he applies for political asylum. He declined to comment specifically on allegations made in four days of Senate hearings this week of widespread corruption under the military-dominated Government of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. The general was indicted in Florida last week by two Federal grand juries on charges of drug smuggling and money laundering. Senior Latin American diplomats said Mr. Chewning, 46 years old, the second-ranking Panamanian envoy at the O.A.S., was a career diplomat who served under several Panamanian governments and was not considered close to the military. In the speech that he said he was forced to make Tuesday, Mr. Chewning accused the United States of ''carrying out moral and economic aggression as well as a slander campaign against Panamanian authorities'' in order to bring down the Government and withhold compliance with the Panama Canal treaties.

835-> THE N.C.A.A. TOURNAMENT; An Unwanted Child Grows Up, And Now Everyone Loves It
We will hear about The Road to Kansas City until we have memorized every turn. Late this afternoon, the selection and seeding of the 64 teams for the 50th National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament, a process that once consisted of a few telephone calls, will again be presented live on network television. The information will be placed in brackets to be instantly and passionately analyzed. The brackets will be used to help produce America's stamp of significance, the office pool. And then dozens of young people will create the plot for the nation's most recently embraced major sporting event. Forty-nine years ago, the first tournament, a hastily arranged creation of the National Association of Basketball Coaches, lost $2,531. Soon, the N.C.A.A. assumed the debt and responsibility for the second championship. ''When they took it from the N.A.B.C.,'' said 84-year-old Howard Hobson, the coach of the 1939 Oregon team, the first N.C.A.A. champions, ''it was the greatest investment in the history of the world.'' The 49 tournaments have produced gross receipts of $270,253,387. The N.C.A.A. expects gross revenue of more than $66 million for its 50th tournament, more than 85 percent of which will come from television. In the first year of a three-year contract for $166 million with the CBS network, the four schools that reach the national semifinals April 2 will each receive $1,153,700. That successful investment is a product of the interest, developed over decades and shrewdly capitalized on in recent years, in young people who will head for places from Hartford to Los Angeles in the hope of winning a championship halfway in between. The fortune built by their stories has been based upon their youth, upon heights and skills that have exceeded the dreams of those who introduced the game, and upon an inability for those athletes to conceal their emotions within helmets and protective padding. From the most distant seats of the domed stadiums that have become necessary in an attempt to satisfy the demand, 7-footers may appear the size of insects. But through the lenses of the television cameras, they are bared to their shirts and shorts, and occasionally, to their souls. Theirs is an event that has struggled to survive the effects of a world war, two point-shaving scandals, violations that have voided the participation of teams up to a second-place finisher, and the competition of a once more popular and prestigious National Invitation Tournament. Drug testing was instituted for the 1987 championship, and this year, for the first time since 1971, participants are being asked to sign affidavits that indicate they have not contracted with an agent. With fighting a more persistent problem this season, the N.C.A.A. last week set a new policy that would subject players to immediate suspensions for fights during tournament play. But drugs and agents are not marketed as a major topic on the road to Kansas City at the start of an event that has been known to produce something for everyone: Utah's Utes, the 1944 champions, were a sudden replacement for an Arkansas team that was in an automobile accident. The development of the dominant big man, as George Mikan of DePaul and Bob Kurland of Oklahoma A&M, took place in the first decade. The arrival during the 1950's of Bill Russell of San Francisco, Wilt Chamberlain of Kansas, Elgin Baylor of Seattle and Oscar Robertson of Cincinnati, outstanding black players, changed the way the game was played. North Carolina's 1957 Tar Heels survived the six overtime periods in little more than 24 hours that preserved an undefeated season, overcame Chamberlain and Kansas by a point in the final, and won the championship. Texas Western's 1966 championship was earned when the predominantly black Miners defeated an all-white Kentucky team and ended Adolph Rupp's hope for a fifth title. U.C.L.A. became a four-letter word to opposing coaches and players when Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was known as Lew Alcindor, Bill Walton's red hair grew longer, and the Bruins won 10 championships in 12 seasons from 1964 through 1975. Houston's Phi Slama Jama, the most famous pseudo-fraternal campus organization in the nation five springs ago, created a reputation, and lost the 1983 championship to North Carolina State on a dunk. And even in hindsight, there has been the unthinkable: North Carolina's Tommy Kearns, all of 5 feet 10 inches, was sent in for the center jump against Chamberlain. Twenty-seven years later, in a more sober Carolina moment during a 1984 regional semifinal, Dan Dakich, a reliable, resourceful, but hardly spectacular Indiana player, successfully limited Michael Jordan in a Hoosier victory over the Tar Heels. In 1977, Marquette's Al McGuire, the wise guy from New York, cried real tears. And in 1985, Villanova's Wildcats spoke to each other about playing the perfect game, and then made 78.6 percent of their shots in the triumph over Georgetown and Patrick Ewing. Not so long ago, such moments were secrets of a cult following that obtained its information through small syndicated television networks or radio broadcasts picked up in automobiles. The 1946 championship at Madison Square Garden was telecast locally for the first time, but for the 21 tournaments through 1959, the N.C.A.A. lists a television revenue figure of zero. But significant structural changes had already been made beginning in 1951, the year a point-shaving scandal ruined the memory of a City College championship and ended Madison Square Garden's role as the site of the final game. The field was doubled to 16 teams, including automatic bids for the champions of 10 conferences. Walter Byers, who was executive director of the N.C.A.A. from 1951 until last year, has said that Homer Cooke, who began the organization's statistical service, had suggested the concept of the automatic bid. But Wayne Duke, the commissioner of the Big Ten Conference, who then worked in the N.C.A.A. office, said Byers turned the idea into reality. ''That was a cornerstone of the success of the tournament,'' said Duke, who served as chairman of the tournament committee from 1978 through 1981. ''It provided a solid basis for the tournament. It wasn't designed to knock the N.I.T. out of the blocks, as people in the East were inclined to believe in those days. Walter wanted the major conferences to support the tournament. Walter is clearly the architect of the tournament.'' The Byers stamp was distinctive. He personally sold television rights. He was a presence at meetings. ''That was money as far as he was concerned,'' said Tom Scott, the chairman of the tournament committee from 1971 to 1975. ''Originally, he was in on everything. Expenditures, per diems, transportation for the officials and teams, publicity, anything like that. He didn't want to go overboard. He wanted to make sure the tournament was a success financially. There were no complimentary tickets. Everybody was paid for, except the team members and the coaches. And that got them in the dressing room and on the bench. If they wanted a seat, they had to pay for it.'' Scott laughed when he remembered a suggestion that committee members receive watches. ''No committee member got a watch,'' he said. Into its third decade, the tournament faced a major perception problem. Carolina's victory over Chamberlain in 1957 was observed by the most intense coverage the tournament had known: a television network of 11 stations, a 73-station radio network in 11 states, and 64 newspaper reporters. Eddie Einhorn, now the president of the Chicago White Sox but then a senior who broadcast games for the campus station at the University of Pennsylvania, gave live reports that night in Kansas City. He spent several years trying to understand the regulations involving broadcast rights. ''They talked to all the networks,'' Einhorn said. ''Nobody wanted it. It was considered a regional sport.'' That was before Einhorn paid $27,000 for the right to syndicate the telecast of a 1968 intersectional game he called a ''gimmick'': U.C.L.A., with a 47-game winning streak, against Houston before a crowd of 52,693 at the Astrodome. ''The biggest thing I had in my favor was U.C.L.A.'s streak,'' Einhorn said. ''Those are the games that got the people's attention, and got the attention of the networks.'' The next year, NBC paid $547,500 for television rights and net income exceeded $1,000,000 for the first time. By 1973, Scott's committee moved the championship game from Saturday afternoon to Monday night - prime time - and the television payoff exceeded $1 million. The final was seen by an audience of 39 million. Then changes came swiftly. A 32-team tournament, in 1975, allowed conference members other than champions to receive invitations over the objections of the U.C.L.A. athletic director, J. D. Morgan. The field grew to 40 in 1979 and 48 in 1980. In 1981, teams were moved to regions outside their geographical area to balance the strength of the field. CBS won the rights in 1982 with a three-year contract worth $48 million. The bracket then grew to 52 teams in 1983, and 64 in 1985. What was once that little cult event now sometimes runs beyond 1 A.M. in the East. The final game is an impossible ticket when held in a conventional arena, and establishes a champion that has recently redefined the term. In this decade, 11 of the 32 teams to reach a national semifinal have entered that game with eight or more losses. The eight champions in the 1980's have averaged six defeats. Of the first 38 champions, only one -Kentucky's Fiddlin' Five in 1958 -lost six times. The 10 U.C.L.A. champions lost a total of 10 games. ''I like the conference champions,'' Wooden said. ''I think you determine the strongest team in the conference, with a conference schedule when you play home and home with every opponent, every year. I don't see: 'Well, let's give them another chance. Let's give a second, third, fourth, in some cases fifth team another chance.' Maybe it's a great thing to give people extra chances, but I think they've had a chance in the conference schedule through the year. That's a chance. They've had a good chance.'' More opportunities have created more interest, which has generated more income. Forty-two years after Utah's bizarre opportunity led to Arnie Ferrin's being named the outstanding player at the end of his freshman season, Ferrin, as a member of the tournament committee, was assigned to the University of Louisville team on the night the Cardinals defeated Duke for the championship. That night, two years ago, Pervis Ellison became the first freshman to be named outstanding player since Arnie Ferrin. Ferrin, now the chairman of the committee that will make its announcement today, remembers seeing that same blank look after the initial happiness, the same expressions that have been brought on the road back home to places like Bloomington, Philadelphia, Washington, Chicago, Raleigh, Chapel Hill, East Lansing, El Paso, and Eugene; the same clue that the significance has not yet been grasped. ''The only difference,'' Ferrin said, ''was then, if you wanted to see the looks on our faces, you had to wait a week and go to see Pathe News.''

836-> Israel Liberated Gaza From a Nightmare
To the Editor: Quoting incomplete excerpts from The Times on events in Gaza in 1971, Edward Said, a member of the Palestinian National Council, ridicules the notion that Israel did anything to improve conditions there (letter, Feb. 5). Had he quoted from a Dec. 18, 1971 news article (''Israeli Army Officials Expect Collapse of Arab Guerrilla Organization in Gaza''), readers would have learned that Israelis did no less than liberate Gaza's Arab inhabitants from a nightmare. As reported in that article, in the spring of 1971 more than a dozen Arabs were being murdered by guerrillas every month, ''generally on suspicion of having collaborated with the Israeli occupation officials or for having accepted employment in Israeli factories. In June, there were 25 assassinations.'' Firm Israeli countermeasures brought dramatic improvement. ''For the last six weeks,'' you reported, ''not a single murder has come to light. And random grenade throwing, which made walking in the streets or waiting at a bus stop a tense experience, has dropped sharply.'' The Israeli Government, the article reports, began to implement a long-term plan to ''disperse the refugee concentration and offer economic alternatives to the life of misery in charity-supported camps.'' Families numbering 1,900 were resettled from camps in other parts of the Gaza Strip or the Sinai town of El Arish. Israel's beneficent efforts, however, infuriated Arabs and their supporters. The article explains, ''Arab governments believe that the misery and poverty of Gaza serve as a constant reminder to the world of what they term the usurpation of Palestinian lands by the Jewish settlers.'' Citing international law, the Arabs generated sufficient international pressure to force Israel to halt resettlement of the refugees. PHIL BAUM RAPHAEL DANZIGER New York, Feb. 8, 1988 The writers are, respectively, associate executive director of the American Jewish Congress, and assistant director of its Commission on International Affairs.

838-> Waiting in Line for Life
When the issue is a subway token or a movie ticket, having to stand in line is only a bore, and the person who jumps the line is only a nuisance. For the thousands of Americans waiting months, even years, for organ transplants, the wait is a nightmare and line-jumping is a matter of life and death. Organ transplants are becoming more and more routine; nationally, 924 livers, 1,002 hearts and 8,976 kidneys were transplanted in 1986. That means the line can only grow longer. New proposals from New York State's Task Force on Life and the Law would go a long way toward insuring that nobody in line will lose his place. Seven state organ procurement agencies currently administer the acquisition and distribution of hearts, livers, kidneys and other organs. Most are affiliated with hospitals that do transplants. As a result, kidneys, for instance, are generally distributed according to the hospital's claims rather than according to how urgently patients need the transplant or how long they have waited. Furthermore, patients who can afford to consult several doctors are able to get themselves on the waiting lists at several hospitals, thereby multiplying their chances in a way that the less affluent cannot. The same pattern does not hold for heart and liver transplants only because few hospitals in the state do such surgery as yet. In 1987, 58 heart transplants were performed in New York; and the Health Department recently approved the application of the state's first liver transplant consortium. Kidney transplants, however, number more than 600 a year. After a two-year study, the task force sensibly proposes that the seven organ procurement agencies be consolidated into three. A single statewide list would govern heart, liver and certain other transplants, while three regional lists would regulate kidney transplants. Once patients were admitted to a transplant program, their place in line would be determined by several criteria, chiefly medical, to be developed by a transplant council. In making a hitherto fragmented system more orderly, the task force would also make it more fair.

841-> WHEN THE PUTTING GOES BAD
ON A BRIGHT WINTER DAY with the temperature stuck at around 40 and the ground still heavily patched with snow, Tom Watson stands in the center of a very empty Kansas City Country Club, lofting nine-iron shots at a practice green. Again and again he taps a ball into position between his feet, hesitates barely an instant, then launches it with a controlled, muscular swing. His sturdy compactness exaggerated by baggy rain pants and two baby-blue sweaters, Watson alternates shots that gently fade from left to right with those that draw in from right to left. In minutes, he has covered the small green, some 125 yards away, with a dazzling rash of white Titleists. But when Watson grabs his putter and marches to the green, the results aren't as impressive. Although to an inexpert eye there is nothing conspicuously out of sync in his characteristically short, brisk putting stroke, few of his four dozen putts end up in the hole. To Watson, it's a pattern that has gotten wearisome: first, a beautifully struck approach shot that zeroes in on the flag as if pulled by a magnet. Then a mediocre putt. Golf is basically two games - golf and putting - and among its countless cruelties is that while all the basic shot-making skills can endure to the grave, the crucial little swings on the green that require no exertion at all rarely make it intact to middle age. And although Tom Watson is only 38, with an earnest fair-skinned face that is still boyish, he is in the midst of the struggle with his putting that becomes the theme of almost every great golfing career as it moves even slightly past its prime. In his 18th year on the Professional Golfers' Association Tour, Watson finds himself at one of the more suspenseful points in his brilliant career. From 1977 through 1984 he dominated the tour as thoroughly as any golfer ever has; during that period he won seven titles in what are considered the major tournaments - the Masters, the United States Open, the British Open and the P.G.A. Championship - and 32 tournaments overall, topping the annual money-winner's list five times. But then, suddenly, came The Slump - three years in which his putting touch vanished, and he didn't win so much as a J.C. Penney Classic. Now he has embarked on The Comeback. It started last June when he finished second at the U.S. Open, and many feel it was consummated in San Antonio in November, when Watson won the Nabisco Championships, the final tour event of the year. But while that win put a nominal end to the slump, for Watson, a ferocious self-critic, it has far from proved he's back to what he was three years ago, the world's finest golfer, the man he refers to as ''the Watson of old,'' or occasionally just ''Watson.'' ''San Antonio meant a lot,'' he says. ''but all it proved is that I can win one tournament. Watson won't be back until I win three or four more.'' TOM WATSON HAS SPENT THE last three years stuck in an intolerable limbo. Although his game has fallen off, nothing is going to convince him he's ready for the semiretirement of legends like Jack Nicklaus and Lee Trevino, golfers who are so unquestionably past their prime that nothing is ever demanded of them, and whose rare victories, like Nicklaus's at the Masters two years ago, evoke such tender nostalgia they become cherished national moments. Then, too, the mantle of greatness doesn't fit Watson as comfortably as it does Nicklaus; nor can he offer the populist charm of a maverick like Trevino. A passionate athlete who has always been slightly trapped inside himself, Watson has never felt the inclination to offer the public anything but his golf. ''If people want comedy,'' he says, ''let them go to Las Vegas and watch Joan Rivers.'' Watson's genuinely thorny personality - he once accused another famed golfer, Gary Player, of cheating - separates him as well from the younger generation of touring pros, a generally unflamboyant, noncontroversial bunch cultivated more and more at college golf factories. Watson, a graduate of Stanford, which he attended without an athletic scholarship, is at least as interested in talking about Nicaragua or the Presidential campaigns as the crisis in his golf game. He barks out his often cantankerous views - ''Gary Hart is a jerk'' - un-self-consciously. Walking the golf course in Kansas City, when a writer mistakes a squirrel's nest for a crow's nest, Watson makes no attempt to conceal his disdain: ''You don't spend much time outdoors, do you?'' Even his physique and metabolism are distinct. With his powerful legs and enormous forearms, the 5-foot-9-inch Watson is built more like a welterweight boxer than a golfer. And as he bounds down the fairways, he exudes a far more aggressive energy than most of the competition, who have given the pro game an almost somnambulistic quality in recent years. Watson may have grown up in affluent circumstances, learned his golf at the posh Kansas City Country Club, but he is one of the genuinely tough characters on the P.G.A. tour. As Stan Thirsk, a golf coach who has known Watson since he was 11, remembers, ''Tom was always such a polite little guy, with that impish smile, but as soon as he got you on the golf course, he wanted to beat your brains out.'' The killer instinct obscured by that gap-toothed country-boy face prompted a high school coach to dub him ''Huckleberry Dillinger.'' If the last three years have changed Watson, it shows in that he tempers his outward determination with reservations about his game. On the one hand he talks of a career about to be relaunched -''The burners quit in the first stage, and the second-stage burners are, hopefully, about to kick in'' -and of wanting to show ''that Tom Watson can put the work into his game that's needed to win.'' But more frequently, Watson's self-assessments are negative. During the off-season, he sounded more like an athlete still mired in a slump than one who had just fought his way out. And although he has started reasonably well in 1988, with two top-10 finishes in his first five tournaments and more than $60,000 in prize money, to Watson it has just been five more frustrating weeks without a win. At three tournaments in a row, Watson went into the final round with an excellent chance to win, only to turn in a disappointing score on Sunday. ''It's been bittersweet,'' he says. Watson regrets the effect time has had on various parts of his game. He often harks back to a time when his grip felt more comfortable, his swing was more upright and his left side was stronger. But he is most obsessed with reclaiming his old putting skill. Over the winter, working from films of himself from the 1970s, he attempted to recreate his old grip; he has since given it up. The basement in his Kansas City home is littered with 60 discarded putters. ''I used to step over a putt at 60 feet and try to sink it,'' he says. ''Now I don't see the line nearly as well. Before I saw the line like I was looking down a pool cue. ''Golf is a game,'' he goes on. ''It's supposed to be fun. If you shoot 80, well, then see if you can shoot 79. If you hit it sideways, see if you can find it.'' But then, as if answering himself, he adds, ''Of course it's hard to have much confidence if you can't get it in the hole. And as for the putting, I don't know if I will ever get it back.'' Even Watson's victory in San Antonio didn't restore his confidence entirely because his putting, the part of his game that had always been his stalwart under pressure, felt shaky coming down the stretch. ''I kept leaving myself three-to-five footers for par every time,'' he says. ''I made them all, but they didn't feel good. It wasn't like the old days. I didn't know they were going in.'' IT'S THAT QUEASINESS OVER A PUTT, EVEN more than optical and mechanical problems, that can undo an aging golfer. According to Sam Snead, the most frequent winner in P.G.A. history (as well as the oldest; his last tour victory came when he was 52), deteriorating nerves have eventually caught up with the putting strokes of almost every great player, from Nicklaus to Arnold Palmer to Ben Hogan. And although no one is saying Watson's nerves are shot, or that he has contracted the nervous putting disorder known onomatopoetically as ''the yips,'' it is inevitable, according to Watson's long-time coach, that his nerves aren't quite what they once were. ''When you get to be 38, 39, and you've put yourself under steady pressure all those years,'' says Thirsk, ''there is just no way your nerves are going to be as steady as a man who is 25, 26 or even 35.'' Forty-year-old Johnny Miller recently told Gordon S. White Jr. of The New York Times that the only way he could steady himself for his winning putt at Pebble Beach last year was by imagining he was his teenage son. The 75-year-old Snead, who has had to rid himself of the yips four times in his career - most recently by adopting a stance in which he faces the hole, crouches next to the ball and with one hand grips the putter just above the head - says that in its most terrifying terminal stages a golfer loses all control of his putter. ''You're ready to putt, and the putter won't move, and then when you're not ready, away it goes.'' Jack Nicklaus has also had problems the last few years, but he denies that nerves - or putting, for that matter - have had anything to do with it. ''My hitting of the ball is keeping me from winning,'' says Nicklaus, ''not my inability to putt.'' Older golfers moan about missed putts, he says, because no one wants to admit they can't hit the ball anymore. But as Watson has gotten older he has been hitting the ball better, not worse; that is, his drives and his approaches to the green have become more consistently accurate. According to statistics kept by the P.G.A., the percentage of greens Watson has reached in the number of strokes prescribed for par has gone up every year since his slump began in late 1984. But because he was sinking fewer putts, this improvement did him little good. ''In the old days I sank so many long putts I didn't have to play particularly well to win,'' says Watson. ''Now I have to be firing on all cylinders.'' IT SHOULD BE SAID THAT PUTTING IS an extremely difficult proposition for all golfers, regardless of age. Dropping a putt of any distance into a hole four and one quarter inches in diameter requires a list of calculations and movements so precise that one could get the yips just thinking about them. First, the golfer must ''read'' the green. That is, he deciphers its contours and slopes in order to gauge the proper ''line,'' or path, for his putt, taking into account how much a putt will ''break'' after it starts rolling toward the hole. Finding the line can be almost as hard as propelling the ball at exactly the right speed along it, and doing both is at least as hard as hitting against major league pitching. As Watson confirms, over the course of a year, any pro golfer would be more than happy if on his 15-foot putts he could match Wade Boggs's batting average. Not only is putting the most difficult skill in the game, it's by far the most important. If par for a course is 72 strokes, 36 of those strokes are allotted for putts. Thus a round is evenly divided between putting and all the other skills combined that are needed to move a ball from tee to green. Further, from the standpoint of scoring, sinking a putt is always worth more than hitting a perfect drive or lofting a lovely iron. Every time you sink a putt you save a stroke; for all the brilliance of a drive or an approach, what you earn is a leg up on your next shot, which won't necessarily be worth a thing on the scorecard. Another way of saying this is that putting is important because it comes last. ''You can recover from a bad shot,'' notes Chi Chi Rodriguez, the former P.G.A. player who dominated the senior tour last year. ''But you can't recover from a bad putt.'' The significance of putting is so enormous it can seem like a flaw in the game. There is something almost unfair about the fact that the outcome of every hole, every round and every tournament is determined not so much by powerful drives or spectacular, long-range shot-making, but by what is really little more than miniature golf without the windmills. ''Putting is not golf,'' says Rodriguez. ''You could have someone who couldn't break a 100 and they could be putt-putt champion of the world.'' On the other hand, he estimates that this rarified skill at rolling a golf ball is about 60 percent of the game. Of course, golf is the wrong place to go looking for fairness. Its intrinsic cruelty - the fact that the best shots often go unrewarded and the worst are inconsistently penalized, what Watson calls ''the hardships of the game'' - has always been at the heart of its morbid fascination. It's why there are so many good golf jokes and why a round of golf can seem every bit as heartbreaking as the rest of the week. But over the course of a year golf scoring isn't so much unfair as it is unbalanced, placing a huge premium on the short game, and particularly on putting. And if Watson, his entire game solid except for his putter, is now getting burned by this sad skew, bear in mind that for more than a decade no player took better advantage of it. IT SEEMS AS IF THE MYTHOLOGY OF every great golfer begins when a relative, usually a father or grandfather, places a cut-down golf club in the small hand of a six-year-old boy, where it fits better than anything ever will again. The only difference in Watson's case was that instead of the usual middle iron, Ray Watson initiated his son with a putter. And it came with very simple instructions: Hit the ball into the hole. Watson would soon be taught the full swing as well, but mastering the putter was his life's first great project. As he wrote in his book, ''Getting Up and Down'': ''Trying to solve the problems of the different speeds of breaking putts became my obsession, and whenever possible I spent all my time on the green.'' It was as if Watson had an innate understanding that the golfer's edge lay not in the long swings, but in the short ones. Within a few summers he had extended his short-game rituals to an area just beyond the putting surface where he began teaching himself all the delicate little chips and pitches and bump-and-runs a golfer needs in his repertoire to save par when he misses a green with his approach shot. Thirsk remembers Watson spending hours placing balls in ''the most terrible places he could think of'' around the green - at the bottom of deep trampled rough, in the lip of a trap, right up against a tree. And then, like so many kids in their solitary suburban games, he would fantasize that he had to get himself out of that predicament and into the hole using only one chip and one putt to win the Masters or the U.S. Open. ''And this wasn't just one afternoon,'' Thirsk says. ''It was day after day.'' It's impossible to exaggerate the benefit Watson derived from these elaborate sessions. One reason he was able to dominate the tour was his special talent for saving strokes on these nasty little trouble shots. ''If he hit a drive 200 yards off line, my only thought was, 'Give us a swing,' '' says Watson's caddie, Bruce Edwards. ''As long as he wasn't stymied, there was a good chance he'd find a way to get it done.'' By the time Watson entered his teens he was showing signs of being a prodigy. At 14, he played an exhibition against Arnold Palmer and a year later another one against Nicklaus, who beat him by just two strokes. But like many well-off kids who happen to be precocious athletes, Watson wasn't encouraged to concentrate exclusively on golf. In addition to being an avid hunter and outdoorsman, he was an all-around schoolboy athlete, putting away his clubs every year from fall to spring to play football and basketball. When he went off to Stanford, it was without any intention of becoming a professional golfer. Had Watson felt himself to be more successful in college, he would have followed the pattern set by his father: gotten a job in Kansas City and played a lot of serious amateur golf. But in his senior year he made the typically harsh self-evaluation that there was nothing else he could do. ''My golf was the only tangible talent I thought I had,'' he says today. On a hunting trip that winter, he told his father of his plans to turn pro, and Ray Watson put together a six-man syndicate of his golfing and hunting buddies to sponsor his son on tour. Traveling around the country mainly by car and playing and practicing from ''sunup to sundown,'' Watson was soon showing intimations of greatness. The first came at the World Open in 1973 at Pinehurst, N.C., not long after Linda Rubin, whom he had been dating since high school accepted his third marriage proposal. In the fifth round of the eight-round tournament, Watson shot 6 under par on the last five holes, holing an eight iron for an eagle and then birdieing 15, 16, 17 and 18. ''What impressed me was his ability not only to shoot low,'' says Bruce Edwards, who at the time had only been carrying Watson's bag for a few months, ''but the dramatic way he did it. I guess you could say that it was the first letter of the writing on the wall.'' The next year Watson got his first win - at the Western Open, outside Chicago - and at a dinner held in Kansas City to celebrate it, the 24-year-old native son was asked what goals he had set for his career. To become the best player in the world, he replied. ''After I said that my father pulled me aside,'' Watson recalls, ''and said, 'Son, those aren't public thoughts. Those are private thoughts.' '' Nevertheless, three years later Watson had done it, wresting the title from Nicklaus by beating him down the stretch of both the 1977 Masters and British Open. During the latter, the two were paired for the final two rounds, and in what many consider to have been golf's greatest head-to-head duel, Watson's 65-65 edged Nicklaus's 65-66. The winning margin was the stroke he stole at the 15th hole by sinking a 50-foot putt that began well off the green. Over the next eight years Watson staked his claim to golfing immortality, averaging four wins a year and in the process becoming the first golfer to win $400,000 and $500,000 in a year. In 1980 when he took six tour events, plus his fourth British Open and a tournament in Japan, he won nearly a third of the tournaments he entered. But then at the end of 1984, when the 35-year-old Watson might have been expected to have several years left in his prime, his putting stroke departed. As a result, Watson stopped winning tournaments. Simple as that. TRADITIONALLY, IN GOLF, THE MAJOR tournaments, contested by not just American tour players but the finest golfers in the world, are where greatness is measured. Watson has won eight major titles. Since World War II, only three men have won more, and only Jack Nicklaus, with 18, is realistically beyond surpassing. ''I am motivated by the majors,'' Watson says. Last year, his overall record in the major tournaments was second-best in the world. He always plays them well, though it is ironic - and certainly frustrating - that he hasn't added to his major victory total since his last British Open title in 1983. The major tournaments have taken on added significance for Watson because dominating the pro tour, winning week in and week out, is becoming virtually impossible - for anyone. Today's tour is far more competitive than the one on which Watson won five tournaments in a single year a decade ago. The reason is money. Ten years ago, the total annual purse on the professional golf tour was just over $10 million. This year it's more than $34 million, with top prizes as high as $350,000. That kind of money turns underachievers into workaholics. There are huge fortunes to be made on the tour, and you don't have to reach the very top to do it. Last year's top money winner, Curtis Strange, who earned $925,941, finished first just three times. More than 30 players won at least $300,000, and such widely unknown players as Mark Calcavecchia, Chip Beck and David Frost earned more than half a million. ''Everybody knows that in 10 years they can make all the money they'll ever need,'' Watson says. ''And so they are totally committing themselves to the game.'' When Watson arrived on the tour, his work habits were almost as legendary as his shot-making. Lee Trevino recalls an occasion when he spotted Watson practicing bunker shots as he was about to tee off, then played his entire round, had a beer, got ready to go and then spotted Watson, still in the bunker. Now almost every player on the tour spends hours on the practice range and putting green after every round. And the entire field is capable of winning. ''When I came out I had to beat only eight or 10 guys each week,'' Trevino says. ''That isn't the case anymore.'' Robert Wrenn, a young golfer who had barely been surviving, won a tournament last year by shooting 26 under par, a total that missed the all-time P.G.A. scoring record by one stroke. Today the tour is full of Robert Wrenns, churned out by the dozen from college golf programs. Players at schools such as Oklahoma State University and Brigham Young University practice five or six hours a day all year round and travel to tournaments every month; by the time they reach the pro tour, they're ready to win immediately. Which is why, more than ever, it is a golfer's performance in the big events, the major tournaments, that testifies most eloquently to his stature. The Masters, annually the first major of the year, begins April 7 in Augusta, Ga. If Tom Watson is going to have to chance to win it for the third time, his putting game will be particularly important. The Augusta National Golf Club, with its huge, slick greens, regularly tests a golfer's nerve with long, wide-breaking putts. ''The Masters puts more of a premium on putting than any of the majors,'' Watson says. ''You get some hellacious putts there.''

842-> At the Movies
A Difficult Subject Not resting on laurels that include co-writing ''Mona Lisa,'' writing ''Personal Services,'' writing and directing ''Wish You Were Here'' and catapulting Emily Lloyd to stardom in the process, the British film maker David Leland is toiling away in Hollywood. For the past seven weeks - a period in which he was rewarded with a British academy award for his screenplay for ''Wish You Were Here'' - Mr. Leland has been directing ''Checking Out.'' ''I'm always attracted to taboo subjects,'' is the way Mr. Leland analyzes his involvement in the project, which stars Jeff Daniels (''Terms of Endearment,'' ''The Purple Rose of Cairo'' and ''Something Wild'') and Melanie Mayron (the delicious Melissa of television's ''Thirtysomething,'' not to overlook ''Girlfriends'' and ''Missing'') as husband and wife, along with Michael Tucker (''Tin Men'' and ''L.A. Law'') and Ann Magnuson (''Making Mr. Right,'' among others). In ''Checking Out,'' the taboo subject is death, and the title is a reference to taking leave of the hotel of life - a subject about which Mr. Leland said most men maintain a conspiracy of silence. ''In this case, it's the discovery by one man of his own mortality,'' he said. ''We all think we're driving Rolls-Royces,'' said Mr. Leland, metamorphosing man into machine for purposes of analogy, ''but we're driving Datsuns or Fords guaranteed not only to rust but to fall to pieces.'' If all goes according to plan, Mr. Leland said, filming will be finished at the end of next week, and ''Checking Out'' will be checking into theaters before the end of 1988. Hiatus From Real Life ''We are sort of voyeurs,'' said Jos Stelling. ''Film is for me a sort of mobile keyhole.'' Mr. Stelling, a 42-year-old Dutch film maker based in Utrecht, where he also owns a couple of movie theaters and a cafe, has been making motion pictures since he first laid hands on an 8-millimeter camera when he was 8 years old. All of them, he said, have been feature length, and the latest example is ''The Pointsman,'' opening today (review on page C22). Its tale, based on a novella, involves a mysterious, beautiful woman who embarks on a journey by train, falls asleep, hurriedly disembarks when the train halts and, as a result, spends a year in the middle of nowhere with a strange, unworldly man who inhabits a signal tower. The action of the film, related over the course of that year as the seasons move from winter through autumn, unfolds almost entirely without dialogue, and neither of the two main characters speaks the other's language. ''I like to tell stories in a poetic way,'' Mr. Stelling said. ''When you work that way, after a couple of films, you see you don't need dialogue anymore. Dialogue is rational, and I believe in the irrational things in life.'' Despite the film's yearlong time span, the actual shooting took place over some 40 days on a series of visits to the Scottish Highlands, where Mr. Stelling employed the talents of four different cinematographers. Mr. Stelling said he searched for a year before finding the right location: ''You can see the four seasons in Scotland. It is very honest.'' ''The Pointsman'' opened a year ago in Europe, Mr. Stelling said, and has been accorded warm receptions in Britain, West Germany and Italy. Everywhere he goes, Mr. Stelling is either offered interpretations of his film or asked what it means. ''I can give you all kinds of possibilities,'' he said. Basically, though, he wishes audiences would approach ''The Pointsman'' as they approach music, open to its evocations. ''Everybody's always talking about film as literature,'' said Mr. Stelling, whose next project will be an epic titled ''The Flying Dutchman,'' set in the 17th century and dealing with a man from Flanders finding his way through European war to the New World. ''I believe much more in the relationship of film and music. To me, film is the opera of the 20th century.'' Leaving the Past Behind Through late winter and into spring, Alice Krige - who came to notice as the actress who captured Ben Cross's affections in ''Chariots of Fire'' - has been the object of Jeff Bridges's affections before the cameras at the Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens. That's where she, Mr. Bridges and Farrah Fawcett have been making ''See You in the Morning,'' under the direction of Alan J. Pakula. ''It's a love story and a romantic comedy,'' Ms. Krige said. ''It's about a man who has come through a difficult divorce and left his wife - who is Farrah - and small children and meets a woman who is a widow whose husband has committed suicide. And it's how they get together to put the pain of the past behind them.'' Ms. Krige (the name is pronounced KREE-guh, but the actress good-naturedly collects the mispronunciations, her favorite being KREE-zhay), said her involvement in the film began a couple of years ago. It was then that she met the casting director Alixe Gordin, Ms. Krige said. ''And when they were casting this, Alixe said to Alan, 'I think you should meet Alice.' '' Mr. Pakula and Ms. Krige met last September in Los Angeles, the actress said, ''and it went on from there.'' Explaining her affection for the script, based on a screenplay by Mr. Pakula, Ms. Krige said, ''It just seemed to me that it captured with such compassion and humor situations that happen to us all.'' Besides Mr. Bridges in the role of a psychiatrist, Ms. Fawcett as a model pursuing a career as a star of commercials, and Ms. Krige as the widow of a concert pianist who killed himself when his left hand became paralyzed, the cast includes Lukas Haas (the little boy from ''Witness,'' who stars in a ghost story, ''Lady in White,'' opening next month), Drew Barrymore, Linda Lavin, George Hearn, Frances Sternhagen, David Dukes and Theodore Bikel. Ms. Krige said plans called for ''See You in the Morning'' to turn up in theaters in December.

843-> Study for Regents Finds Higher Scores and Cut in Dropout Rate
The State Education Department said today that scores on standardized state tests were rising, annual dropout rates were declining and class sizes were shrinking. New York City schools still have higher dropout rates than upstate schools and trail them in standardized test scores, the report said, but the city schools have narrowed the gap since the early 1980's. The findings were part of a formal evaluation of the Board of Regents Action Plan, which the Regents approved in 1984 to raise standards for students, teachers and schools. The plan includes requirements that graduating students earn more credits; the offering of more rigorous courses, particularly in math, science and foreign languages, and tougher certification requirements for teachers. A Cautious Reaction While the report illustrated many positive trends, state education officials played down the results. ''I'm glad the numbers are getting better, but I'm not carried away with them,'' the State Education Commissioner, Dr. Thomas Sobol, said today at the board's monthly meeting, where the review was presented. ''We've got a long way to go.'' The vice chancellor of the Regents, R. Carlos Carballada, concurred, calling the report ''a positive first step, but only a first step.'' Education Department officials noted that some parts of the action plan, which took effect in the 1985-86 school year, were not yet in effect. The Rise in Test Scores Scores in math, writing and reading comprehension were all better than in the 1982-83 academic year. Tests were given to third-, fifth-, sixth- and eighth-graders. In the last school year, for example, 81.6 percent of all third-graders in the state met the state-designated reading standard, compared with 77.1 percent in 1982-83. Third-graders in New York City schools, while significantly below others around the state, improved to 65 percent from 56.2 percent. Attendance rates and high school graduation rates have been fairly stable over the past 10 years, the report indicated. A Fall in Dropout Rates Annual dropout rates, however, have declined over the past five years. Statewide, the rate fell to 5.1 percent in 1985-86, the latest figure available, from 6.9 percent in 1980-81. In New York City, the rate dropped to 8.3 percent from 12.6 percent over the same period. The report noted that schools at which students are predominantly from minority groups have dropout rates nearly three times those of predominantly white schools. ''None of us are happy with the 44,000 students who drop out annually, 24,000 of whom are in New York City, but the trend is in the right direction,'' said the Deputy Commissioner for Elementary, Secondary and Continuing Education, Gerald L. Freeborne. Regents Courses More Popular More high school students are receiving Regents diplomas, which indicate that they have taken a more difficult curriculum. About 48 percent of the students received Regents diplomas last year, compared with about 44 percent in 1982-83. The number of high school seniors bound for four-year colleges rose slightly last year from the figure in the early 1980's. In New York City public schools, for instance, 50.9 percent of the seniors were moving on to four-year colleges or universities, compared with 47 percent of the seniors in 1980-81. As for average class size, the number for the first through sixth grades statewide declined to 23.9 students per class last year, from 25.6 in 1980-81. The decline in New York City was even greater, to 27.8 students, from 31.5. Mr. Sobol said it was difficult to determine how much of the improvement could be attributed to the Regents plan or to individual efforts by local school districts that demonstrated the heightened concern nationwide for academic achievement.

844-> Pat Robertson: A Candidate of Contradictions
By now Pat Robertson has made clear that he cannot be written off as an electronic Elmer Gantry, a colorful distraction from the rest of the Republican Presidential field. His strong second-place finishes in the Iowa and Minnesota caucuses and in the South Dakota primary reflect awesome organizing ability, a fervent following and a campaign war chest to which more money has been donated than to any other candidate in either party except Vice President Bush. Mr. Robertson has forged this success with a marriage of the sacred and the secular, a mixture that in some ways reflects the experiences of his entire lifetime. Even to some of his closest associates, he is a man of numerous The Presidential campaign that sprang from this marriage dates from 1980, when, at a prayer meeting with the staff of his Christian Broadcasting Network, Mr. Robertson said that he had been talking with ''other Christian leaders in America'' and that ''there has been a great deal of pressure for us to get actively involved'' in politics. A 'Spirit-Filled' Government What would happen, he mused, if the Goverment was run by ''Spirit-filled Christians,'' if ''every member of the Cabinet was Spirit-filled, the President was Spirit-filled, and the Senate and the House of Representatives were Spirit-filled?'' By early 1981 his CBN ministry had spun off an educational subsidiary, the Freedom Council, which had the avowed purpose of involving Christians in the electoral process. Within five years CBN had poured more than $8 million into the tax-exempt Freedom Council, which is now under investigation by the Internal Revenue Service to determine whether it was in fact formed as a political vehicle to advance Mr. Robertson's candidacy. That candidacy has added to knowledge about a 57-year-old public figure who had already appeared on television daily for more than a quarter-century and about whom five major biographies and thousands of newspaper and magazine articles have been published. After all that, the contradictions remain. Mr. Robertson is the founder of an evangelistic television ministry that reached some 30 million homes and grossed more than $200 million a year while he was at its helm. He has also said God performed miracles at his request, that he heard the direct word of both God and Satan, and he has spoken in tongues. But after polls showed that large numbers of voters were opposed to a minister's running for President, he resigned his Southern Baptist ordination last year with the stroke of a pen. He once said as a minister that only devout Christans and Jews were fit to govern. Yet he now maintains that any discussion of his religious views in the context of his candidacy is ''religious bigotry.'' He is a man of unquestioned intelligence and academic attainment: Phi Beta Kappa, cum laude graduate of Washington & Lee University, recipient of a law degree from Yale. But he described a summer art course as ''graduate study'' at the University of London, and on his resume he called himself an expert in tax law although he had failed the New York State bar exam and never practiced. He is a candidate seeking to position himself as a mainstream Republican, and yet a number of his assertions are met with incredulity, in and outside the party. When Mr. Robertson contended that Soviet missiles were stationed in Cuba, the White House and the Pentagon denied it. When he said his television network once had information about the location of American hostages in Lebanon, President Reagan said, ''Isn't it strange that no one in our Administration was ever apprised of that?'' When Mr. Robertson suggested that Mr. Bush was behind the recent disclosure that the Rev. Jimmy Swaggart had been involved in a sexual indiscretion, Mr. Bush asked for proof or an apology. Engaging and amiable in public, he is quick-tempered and intolerant of mistakes in private, intimates say. ''I know he's had a good day,'' one loyal aide observed, ''when he doesn't chew me out'' at the end of it. 'Wine, Women and Song On Several Continents' A self-described devotee of ''wine, women and song on several continents'' as a young man, he says God has forgiven his transgressions. Yet until last year, when a reporter insisted on clarification, he felt a need to misstate his wedding date to hide the fact that his first child was born 10 weeks after his marriage. A few years ago, he dismissed his chief producer at CBN for what he later described as the producer's failure to be completely candid with him about an extramarital affair. A Young Man Of a Privileged Family This man of contradictions was born into a prominent Virginia family in which both religion and politics played crucial formative roles. His father was A. Willis Robertson, who served 14 years in the House of Representatives and 20 in the Senate. ''The first three words I learned,'' Pat Robertson now says, ''were Pat Robertson now says, ''were 'mama,' 'daddy' and 'constituent.' '' His mother, Gladys Churchill Willis, related to the British Churchills, was a lovely and accomplished woman, a gifted pianist and charming hostess who gradually withdrew in later years, drawing fundamentalist religion about her like a cloak until she became, in the words of a Pat Robertson biographer, David Edwin Harrell Jr., ''a religious recluse.'' As a youngster, Gordon Marion Robertson, nicknamed ''Pat'' for a friend of his father, was a child of privilege, though one whose upbringing was rather straitlaced. He attended public schools in Washington and in Lexington, Va., then spent his last high schools years at the private McCallie School in Chattanooga, Tenn., where he excelled at his studies, played a little football and took up Golden Gloves boxing. Working Hard And Playing Hard After McCallie, he enrolled at Washington & Lee in his hometown, Lexington, lived at home and staggered to the door more than once at 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning, he has since recalled. He was hail fellow well met, majoring in coeds, poker and Jack Daniels. Nonetheless he managed to make Phi Beta Kappa in his junior year and to graduate cum laude, in 1950. He took a course in fine arts at the University of London - the one that became ''graduate study, University of London'' on his resume - but cut something of a swath across the Continent as well, recalling later that he had sown ''plenty of wild oats'' and been ''involved in wine, women and song on several continents.'' Having been a Marine reservist in college, he was called to active duty as a young officer in the fall of 1950. The next January he found himself on a troop ship headed for Japan, and ultimately for Korea. That tour of duty, chiefly in a headquarters post three miles from the front, became a matter of controversy more than three decades later, the subject of a $35 million slander suit filed by Mr. Robertson against a fellow marine who become a California Congressman, Pete McCloskey. After Mr. Robertson's Presidential aspirations had become known, Mr. McCloskey charged that Mr. Robertson had prevailed upon his father, a Senator at the time, to keep him from combat. Mr. McCloskey recalled a day on a Japanese pier: ''My single distinct memory is of Pat, with a big grin on his face, standing on the dock at Kobe, telling us that his father had gotten him out of combat duty.'' Mr. Robertson's next court appearance in connection with his suit against Mr. McCloskey is scheduled for March 8, the day of the Super Tuesday primaries and caucuses. After His Tour, Off to Law School In 1952, a civilian once again, Mr. Robertson enrolled at Yale Law School. In the succeeding three years, he again acquired a reputation as a sharp hand with both the ladies and a deck of cards, although not, this time, with his classwork, which he later said bored him. In 1954, still in law school, he met and married Dede Elmer, a nursing student at Yale. Ten weeks after their wedding, his first child, Timothy, was born. Later, as a minister, Mr. Robertson railed against premarital sex. He also concealed his true marriage date. He celebrated his wedding anniversary on his own birthday, explaining after the matter had become public that he had done so to protect his family from embarrassment. He took and failed the New York bar exam in 1955, saying later, ''My heart was not in it.'' A stint as a corporate junior executive and partner in an electronics company lasted only a short time, and then he suddenly underwent a profound spiritual conversion. 'God Will Take Care of You' Convinced that he was divinely inspired, he told his wife that he was leaving her alone and virtually destitute, caring for one child and pregnant with another, while he went on a monthlong religious retreat in Canada. This, Mr. Robertson himself says, wrung from her the anguished observation: ''I'm a nurse. I recognize schizoid tendencies when I see them, and I think you're sick.'' He left for Canada anyway, and when he received a pleading letter from his distraught wife a few days later, he wondered, as he put it years later, ''Was this God telling me to go home, or was it Satan?'' The Scriptures answered the question, Mr. Robertson says, and he wrote Dede a brief note saying: ''I can't leave. God will take care of you.'' Mrs. Robertson herself later became a ''Spirit-filled'' Christian, and today defends her husband with tenacity on the campaign trail. ''Pat has gotten a bad rap as a male chauvinist you-know-what,'' she has said. ''Well, I'm here to tell you he's not. I'm not a nag, but I'm not a doormat either.'' The Building Of a Religious Empire Mr. Robertson has recalled many incidents of divine guidance over the years, leading him to describe himself as ''a prophet of God'' and to command hurricanes away from his television It is this unshakable faith, coupled with enormous energy and his own boundless self-confidence - or megalomaniacal ego, as detractors prefer to call it - that enabled him to turn a dilapidated Virginia television station into a religious empire. It is one of the contradictions between Mr. Robertson's secular and religious sides that he now attributes the startling success to business acumen, while in his earlier days he gave the credit almost entirely to divine guidance. From a secular standpoint, certainly the key to Mr. Robertson's success is his capacity to attract contributors. A CBN brochure reports that 75 percent of the ministry's income is from donations. CBN buys air time on 158 local stations to present ''The 700 Club'' program, and pays for it through donations from viewers. Mr. Robertson, now seeking to broaden his political base beyond the evangelical Christians who make up much of his support, cites the format of ''The 700 Club'' in part when he insists that the news media should describe him, perhaps, as a former ''Christian broadcaster'' but never as a former ''television evangelist.'' Although the program, with Mr. Rob= Although the program, with Mr. Robertson as host, did include prayer, testimony of guests about religious conversion, faith healing and Bible lessons from Mr. Robertson, and although it always ended with a call to those in the studio audience to dedicate themselves to Christ, Mr. Robertson did not deliver formal sermons, as most television ministers do. In addition to donations, the ministry's income derives from the sale of CBN air time to other television ministers, who want to reach the large CBN audience, and from a commercial affiliate, CBN Cable, which provides ''family entertainment,'' such as re-runs of western serials, to some 30 million subscribers, who pay a fee for the service. The center of the entire vast enterprise is the campus-like 200-acre CBN complex in Virginia Beach, Va., where drinking and smoking are forbidden, where there is a Bible on every desk and where work stops for half-hour prayer meetings. ''Only 40 people showed up for the prayer meeting prior to the telethon,'' Mr. Robertson wrote in a memorandum on May 19, 1987. ''Attendance at the Friday meeting will not be optional. I am going to ask that all supervisors take account of who is there.'' A Religious Goal Engraved in Stone Mr. Robertson's goal for the CBN ministry remains engraved in stone above the door of the main administration building, where he ran the enterprise as both chief executive and spiritual leader until he resigned just before he formally announced his candidacy for President last fall. It is a quotation from the Bible, Matthew 24:12: ''And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached throughout the whole world, as a testimony to all nations.'' The quotation on the building does not include the next five words, which conclude the verse: ''And then the end will come.'' Mr. Robertson, who has on several occasions predicted the imminent end of the world, said the excision of the final words had no significance. ''There just wasn't room for it up there,'' he said.

846-> E.P.A. Declines to Toughen Rule on Sulfur Dioxide
The Environmental Protection Agency announced today that it would not adopt tougher rules for reducing high levels of sulfur dioxide that occur in brief periods. It had been considering the rule to protect asthmatic people. The agency concluded, ''Based on the best data available, the existing set of standards is adequate to protect public health and welfare.'' While the decision involving short-term exposure to high levels of pollution was not unexpected, it was assailed by environmentalists and some public health officials who said that it flew in the face of medical evidence showing that sulfur dioxide emissions threatened the well-being of thousands of asthmatic people and others sensitive to such pollution. They also said the decision violated the spirit and letter of the Clean Air Act. Robert Yuhnke, a senior attorney for the Environmental Defense Fund, an organization that frequently litigates over environmental issues, said his group would sue to overturn the decision if it should become effective. Cost Would Have Been High The proposed standard for limiting sulfur emissions would have required extensive controls on the burning of coal and other fossil fuels by power plants, heating plants, smelters and other sources. Such a requirement would also have helped reduce other air pollution problems and would cost many millions, perhaps billions of dollars to carry out. But J. Craig Potter, Assistant Administrator of the environmental agency for air, said at a news conference today that the Clean Air Act prohibits the consideration of cost factors when regulating pollution and that such factors played no role in the decision by the agency's Administrator, Lee M. Thomas. The rule limiting exposure to sulfur dioxide was one of those that Congress ordered the environmental agency to review to see if it was adequate when it amended the Clean Air Act in 1977. The limit on sulfur dioxide in the air is now set for a 24-hour period, with the average not allowed to exceed an average of 0.14 parts per million. The agency had been considering a limit of 0.4 parts million over one hour, but Mr. Potter said that only asthmatic sufferers directly exposed to this high level of pollution while exercising were vulnerable to aggravated respiratory effects. He said such effects as shortness of breath, wheezing and coughing were ''transient and reversible'' and were not experienced by asthmatics using medication. The agency said that only 1 percent of the nation's asthsmatic people, or 100,000, would be in such situations as much as once as year. And only a portion of the exposed asthmatic people would suffer respiratory effects, the agency contended. #60-Day Comment Period Because relatively few people were affected and because the agency had to deal with much more serious air pollution problems such as smog, Mr. Potter said, it was decided that the current rules for sulfur dioxide did not have to be changed. He acknowledged, however, that the decision was a ''tough call'' and because of the difficulties the agency will take public comment for 60 days before making a decision final. David Hawkins, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council who was assistant administrator of the environmental agency for air in the Carter Administration, said the agency was substantially understating the number of asthmatics potentially at risk from sulfor dioxide. He said that this decision was based on ''this Administration's desire to protect the status quo because it is aware that a program requiring significant sulfur reduction has high political and economic significance.'' Fran Du Melle, director of government relations for the American Lung Association, said. ''We believe that science has definitely established a link between increased health risks to asthmatics and short term exposure to sulfur dioxide.'' Dr. Philip J. Landrigan, director of the division of environmental and occupational health at Mt. Sinai Medical School in New York called the E.P.A. decision ''a mistake''.

847-> Recital: Kiri Te Kanawa at Carnegie
If Kiri Te Kanawa felt a sense of urgency or passion toward the music she sang in Carnegie hall on Wednesday evening, it did not make itself apparent. There was a put-on, disengaged quality about her singing that gave to virtually all of this eminent soprano's performances a false ring. Much as one admired certain aspects of her work - the regal tone, the control across a range of dynamics -Ms. Te Kanawa never seemed other than removed emotionally from the music and this cast a chilling pall over the entire evening. The recital began with Mozart's ''Eine Kleine Deutsche Kantate'' (K. 619) and its distant, almost off-hand performance set what became the prevailing tone. Songs by Liszt, Strauss, Ravel, Granados and Obradors followed. With Strauss's ''Begegnung,'' Ms. Te Kanawa sounded comfortable affecting the requisite coquettish charm, but when something more direct was demanded elsewhere in the program, she offered performances that expressed little beyond a sleek, shiny surface. Roger Vignoles was her pianist. He settled for rough, lazy phrases.

849-> Letter Linked to North Describes Witness Plan
A document found in Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North's safe shows that participants in the White House-directed efforts to supply the contras sought to silence at least one witness who was helping Congress investigate the secret operation. The document was written by Glen Robinette, a former C.I.A. officer who was described by Colonel North in a 1985 memorandum as a ''security officer'' for what he termed ''Project Democracy.'' The document was never released by the Congressional Iran-contra committees and has been declassified only recently. Richard Secord, the retired general who ran the supply operation, has said Mr. Robinette was working for him. The document is not addressed nor signed, but Congressional investigators said Mr. Robinette was its author. The memorandum describes Mr. Robinette's interviews with Jack Terrell, a former mercenary who had turned against the contra cause and was assisting an investigation by the staff of Senator John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat. In the document, Mr. Robinette alludes to an ongoing ''sting'' operation through which Mr. Terrell's criticism would be muted by enlisting him in a book or movie project. Lawrence Walsh, the special counsel, is said to be looking into the possibility that Colonel North enlisted such agencies as the Federal Bureau of Investigation in efforts to keep the contra resupply operation secret.

850-> Dukakis Arms Control Views Drawing Scrutiny
A dispute this week between Gov. Michael S. Dukakis and Senator Albert Gore Jr. has called attention to the Massachusetts Governor's views on arms control. Senator Gore, one of Mr. Dukakis's rivals for the Democratic Presidential nomination, has charged that the Governor's lack of experience in this area led him to make a ''significant mistake'' in describing the Atlantic alliance's policy for using nuclear weapons. A review of Mr. Dukakis's comments suggests that he did not make an important mistake, that he was basically restating orthodox policy of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization: that the Western alliance reserves the right to initiate the use of nuclear weapons in response to an attack by the Soviet Union with conventional weapons. Moreover, some of Mr. Dukakis's arms control positions are in the mainstream, such as his assertion that he would seek to complete a new treaty reducing long-range arms along current lines and not interject dramatic new proposals in arms control talks. Some Views Are Unorthodox However, some of Mr. Dukakis's other recent remarks on arms control have received a skeptical, if not critical response from military analysts even in his own party. Some of these ideas have been largely overlooked so far in the Presidential campaign. The most detailed presentation of Mr. Dukakis's views on arms control were provided in response to questions by the Arms Control Association, a private group, and published in January in the magazine Arms Control Today. In his response, Mr. Dukakis stressed the need to try to negotiate a ban on accurate ballistic missiles that carry more than one warhead. He also said that he would seek a ''mutual moratorium on flight tests of strategic ballistic missiles to set the stage for an agreement on deep reductions of strategic weapons.'' Mr. Dukakis stressed the need to hold down expenditures on strategic weapons, while channeling funds to non-nuclear conventional programs. For example, Mr. Dukakis said that he opposed the Air Force's Midgetman program to develop a new, mobile single-warhead missile that is intended to be less vulnerable to attack. A principal criticism of some specialists is that these proposals do not hang together. On one hand, Mr. Dukakis stresses the need to eliminate accurate ballistic missiles that carry multiple warheads. But it is unclear how the United States would develop a different type of missile arsenal if it adhered to a ban on flight tests on ballistic missiles. And Mr. Dukakis's opposition to the Midgetman program means he is against the only program under way to develop a single warhead missile. Asked whether his views were inconsistent, Mr. Dukakis answered in general terms about the need to end the arms race. Qualifying Proposals James Steinberg, deputy issues director for the Dukakis campaign, provided a more detailed response, which appeared to qualify some of Mr. Dukakis's earlier proposals. Mr. Steinberg said that there was no contradiction in Mr. Dukakis's position because a prohibition on flight tests might only be a temporary measure ''to hold the situation in place'' and prevent each side from improving the accuracy of their missiles pending further negotiations. In addition, Mr. Steinberg added, the prohibition might be drafted so as to allow test flights of possible new, stabilizing weapons, such as a new single-warhead missile that would be put in silos. While some Mr. Dukakis's arms control ideas put him in agreement with some liberal arms control groups, they also place him somewhat outside the mainstream of some former officials and experts of his own party. Mr. Dukakis, for example, has expressed reservations over the Navy's D-5 missile, an accurate long-range, submarine-based weapon. While supporting research, Mr. Dukakis has said that he would withhold deployment of the missile pending efforts to abolish accurate missiles that carry multiple warheads. Arms control activists seized on the issue of the D-5 before the Iowa caucuses. They contended that the weapons would increase the capability of the United States to mount a first strike against the Soviet Union and were, therefore, destablizing to the arms balance. But some former Carter Administration officials like Paul C. Warnke, the former director of Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and Walter B. Slocombe, a former senior Pentagon official, have argued that the D-5 is a worthwhile program. ''I would go ahead with it,'' said Mr. Warnke. ''What we really want is a survivable system.'' Mr. Warnke added that Moscow's decision to develop two new types of land-based mobile missiles that can elude missile attack ''substantially vitiates'' the argument that the D-5 missile would provide the United States with a first-strike capability. Neither Mr. Dukakis's suggestions for a flight test ban nor his opposition to the Midgetman program, which was created at the urging of moderate Democrats in Congress, has been well received by some notable Democratic military experts.

851-> New Squabbling In Israel Widens 2 Leaders' Split
As violence flared again in the occupied territories, a rift in Israel's governing coalition widened today as Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir angrily accused Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of trying to ''sabotage'' his attempts at peace. ''How can I negotiate when my partner is constantly running to the other side and telling them, 'Don't listen to Shamir; whatever he's selling, I'll sell cheaper'?'' the Prime Minister complained. His remarks, underlining doubts here about the chances for the Reagan Administration's new peace efforts, were made as Israeli soldiers used gunfire in furious street battles in Nablus, killing two more Palestinians. Death Toll Rises to 57 The violence in the West Bank city brought the toll to 57 Palestinian civilians killed by Israeli gunfire and beatings since a wave of political protest and rock-throwing began Dec. 9 in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. The continuing wave of violent protest, in which Palestinians have been demanding civil and political rights denied under the occupation authority, has prompted the latest peace proposal by the Reagan Administration. The proposal, based on an accelerated variation of the long-dormant Camp David accords for the territories, has been offered as Israel's feuding principals, Mr. Shamir and Mr. Peres, stake out positions on the intractable Palestinian issue for elections later this year. Their latest bout began when Mr. Peres, the Labor Party leader, contended in a newspaper interview that the Palestinian uprising was caused in part by the opposition of Mr. Shamir and his Likud bloc to the international peace conference favored by Mr. Peres. He accused the Prime Minister of leading Israel in a more extreme direction and asserted that the Camp David accords with Egypt could never have been signed if Mr. Shamir had been the Likud leader in 1977. In replying to reporters, Mr. Shamir was furious at the charge that he had aggravated the Palestinian unrest by being intransigent. ''Those were irresponsible words at this time,'' he said, charging that Mr. Peres was in effect advising demonstrators ''to increase their efforts to get what they want.'' ''That speech supports the Arab claim that the Jews are surrendering,'' he said, referring to the Peres interview. ''That is the crime of his words.'' He described the contacts between them as riddled with political gambits and calculated leaks of official working documents to news organizations. ''He wants to know what I do in order to sabotage it,'' the Prime Minister protested. In the Nablus violence, reporters said some soldiers appeared panic-stricken as they retreated from hundreds of youths, who attacked with chunks of building blocks and fired rocks from rooftops with slingshots. One soldier limped in retreat and another bled when struck in the face with a rock as the skirmishing lasted more than an hour, reporters said. Patrol Reported Attacked Hospital officials said that 5 other Palestinians had been wounded in the volleys of gunfire and that 12 had been treated for beatings as the army confronted crowds in the tight, twisting streets of the Nablus casbah. An army spokesman said the trouble began when a patrol was cornered and pelted with rocks, flower pots and bottles by hundreds of youths who clambered across rooftops and down side streets. The soldiers used tear gas, clubs, rubber bullets and live gunfire in counterattacking, according to the army. Palestinians contended that the violence began after Friday prayer services when soldiers attacked civilians departing from Al Nasr Mosque in Nablus, the occupied territories' largest city, with more than 100,000 Palestinian residents. In addition to the two youths killed today, who were 14 and 17 years old, officials reported that a 60-year-old man hospitalized earlier after a beating during the 10-day Nablus curfew died Thursday. SHULTZ TO VISIT MIDEAST WASHINGTON, Feb. 12 (Special to The New York Times) - The State Department confirmed today that Secretary of State George P. Shultz would travel to the Middle East this month to explore the prospects for movement toward Arab-Israeli peace negotiations. Mr. Shultz's itinerary has not been completed, but he is expected to travel to Israel, Jordan and Egypt. Visits to Syria and Saudi Arabia are unlikely but have not been ruled out. The trip will start on or about Feb. 24. Visits to Syria and Saudi Arabia are unlikely but have not been ruled out.

852-> COMPANY NEWS; 5 Eastern Planes Flunk
Federal officials grounded five Eastern Airlines planes because of safety violations as part of the Government's inspection of the company's 267 aircraft. The inspection was announced Wednesday when the Federal Aviation Administration proposed an $823,000 fine of Eastern for various safety violations. Three planes were taken out of service because of minor fuel leaks, one because of cut tires and another because of a problem with emergency escape path markings in the cabin, an F.A.A. spokesman said. He said the violations were considered minor, as did an Eastern spokeswoman. Jack Barker, an F.A.A. spokesman in Atlanta, said 54 other planes had been inspected and found safe for flying.

853-> Contenders Take Aim At Prized Endorsements
Politicians spend considerable time on the telephone and in meetings seeking endorsements of their fellow politicians, contributors, union chiefs and community leaders. But not all endorsements are equal. Most prized is the backing of a politically active union, a lawyer who can get in touch with scores of other contributors, a politician whose stature lends credibility to a campaign or an entertainment star who can add a little luster to a candidate who lacks it. ''There are only two endorsements that really matter this year, Ed Koch and Mario Cuomo,'' Larry Douglas, Senator Albert Gore Jr.'s campaign manager in New York, said this week before Mayor Koch endorsed Mr. Gore's Presidential bid. Most of the state's Democratic party and public officials have endorsed Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, while virtually every major black and Hispanic party and public official is supporting the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Four years ago, when Mr. Jackson was largely untested and unknown politically, many black public and party officials backed Walter F. Mondale, the Democratic establishment candidate. A Show of Progress ''Endorsements show progress,'' said Norman Adler, a union and political veteran. ''It's like the two guys who bring out the chains to measure first downs in a football game.'' He cited the endorsement of Mr. Dukakis this week by Rabbi Morris Schmidman, director of the Council of Jewish Organizations of Borough Park, an orthodox Jewish area of Brooklyn that has been a prime Gore target. That illustrated another rule of the endorsement game: an endorsement gets attention when it cuts against the political grain. ''Endorsements can be important if they are not expected,'' said New York's City Council President, Andrew J. Stein, who was preparing to endorse Mr. Gore but stayed neutral on the advice of close associates of Governor Cuomo, possibly including the Governor's son, Andrew, who is a friend of Mr. Stein. The Assembly Speaker, Mel Miller, also stepped back from a Gore commitment several weeks ago although his wife is a Gore delegate candidate in Canarsie. Mr. Dukakis has picked up the support of two of the five borough presidents, three of the five Democratic county leaders in the city and one citywide official, City Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin. Dukakis aides have claimed the endorsement of Brooklyn's Borough President, Howard Golden, who is also Brooklyn's Democratic leader. Mr. Golden was reported yesterday by a spokesman to be ill and still uncommitted. The Dukakis camp has not beat the drums very loudly over its numerical lead in endorsements and has offered a multitude of reasons why not: the candidate's schedule, the desire not to promote false confidence, which might depress voter turnout, and finally the clash of egos and conflicting political ambitions among the New York politicians who are often at each other's throats. $2.2 Million for Dukakis Besides giving a candidate credibility at the start of a campaign and momentum in the midst of it, endorsements can also open the resources of unions, political action committees, party committees and major contributors and those who recruit them. Mr. Dukakis's vaunted New York fund-raising operation, which has raised $2.2 million of the $20 million raised nationally by the Massachusetts Democrat, started with four endorsers, Nadine Hack, a professional fund-raiser; Roger Altman, an investment banker; Michael Del Guidice, an investment banker who is a former top aide to Governors Carey and Cuomo, and Tasso Manessis, a restaurateur. That original foursome has grown to at least 125. Nationally, there are 800 finance council members, according to Ms. Hack. Mr. Manessis represents a totally new source of endorsements and money for Democrats, the Greek community. ''Most of them are normally Republicans,'' said George Douris, a public relations official who is a Greek-American. Mr. Jackson has used endorsements to demonstrate a base beyond the black and Hispanic community, including groups representing Asian-Americans, Arab-Americans, the elderly, the disabled and environmentalists.

854-> Colin Birch, Retailing Executives, Dies at 38
Colin Birch, vice president of visual presentation for Bloomingdale's, died Sunday in St. Martin in the French West Indies. He was 38 years old and lived in Manhattan. A spokesman for Bloomingdale's said Mr. Birch had died of respiratory failure. Mr. Birch was born in Birmingham, England, where he graduated from the Moseley Art Institute. He began his career with a two-year apprenticeship in display at Marshall & Shelgrove, a fashion specialty store in Birmingham. When he came to the United States in 1970, he worked for the May Company in Cleveland before becoming display manager at Saks Fifth Avenue's Old Orchard store in Chicago. He then became interior display manager at Saks Fifth Avenue in New York. From 1975 to 1977, he was corporate director of visual presentation at Bonwit Teller. Before joining Bloomingdale's in 1982, he headed his own design company, working primarily with European fashion designers. He is survived by his mother, Edith Birch, four sisters and three brothers, all of Birmingham. Burial will be in England, and a memorial service will be held later in New York.

858-> Hijacker in Colombia Wielded Toy Grenade
A man suspected of hijacking a Colombian airliner to Panama and Aruba and then escaping into the night after returning to Colombia was captured Tuesday carrying a toy grenade, a military statement said. Soldiers seized the man, Gonzalo Carreno, 46 years old, near the airport in Cartagena, where he had vanished Monday as the Avianca Boeing 727 was taxiing toward the terminal. According to the statement, he threatened the crew with the fake weapon while seizing the plane, which was on a domestic flight from Medellin to Bogota. Flying under the name of Albeiro Jimenez, the hijacker passed a note to the pilot saying he was terminally ill and wanted to die quietly outside Colombia. He ordered the plane to return to Medellin, where he let the 131 passengers and flight attendants disembark, and ordered the pilot to fly to Panama. After being denied ransoms in Panama and again on Aruba, the hijacker asked to go to Cuba. However, the pilot convinced him that there was not enough fuel to reach Cuba, and he agreed to return to Cartagena, on Colombia's Caribbean coast. There he stealthily lowered the staircase under the plane and walked away.

859-> Sports of The Times; What Do You Really Think?
THE imprisonment of Joe Pepitone on drug charges is another example of why sports fans and particularly parents should not expect every athlete to be a hero. There was not a more likeable, enjoyable Yankee than Joe Pep when he was in a good mood. He willingly played the role of the buffoon, basking in the fame of being the first major league player to carry a hair dryer with him on the road. And he could play ball, with flashes of power and speed that broke the hearts of managers as well as fans. It was a mistake in the '60's for parents to tell their children, ''Eat your carrots and you'll grow up to be Joe Pepitone.'' Even then, he was undermining his marriage, running up bills, ruining his conditioning. Some of us in the press tried to run consumer-warning paragraphs about Joe Pep. Whether the fans wanted to hear it was their business. On Monday, Joe Pep began serving a six-month sentence for possession of Quaaludes and narcotics paraphernalia. His supporters say he is being imprisoned because he is Joe Pepitone, but Acting State Supreme Court Justice Allan Marrus merely expressed sadness at seeing a former Yankee go to jail. The judge did not send Joe Pep to jail because he was a Yankee, the way Federal Magistrate J. Milton Sullivant did in Kansas City in 1983, when he sent four Royals away because they were Royals, saying they had enjoyed a ''special place in our society.'' Those four Royals did not deserve that reverse glorification, but Joe Pep is being treated as a private citizen who broke the law. Still, there are always fans who are stunned to find their sports heroes are not necessarily better than the rest of the population. At a recent gathering in Salisbury, N.C., some of the otherwise worldly residents seemed shocked to discover that Mickey Mantle was surly and sleepy during his token appearance at a charity event. The trick is to not be taken in by the commercials and the promotions. It is big business to turn athletes into heroes. Admire athletes for what they obviously can do on the field. After that, as they used to say in the Colosseum in Rome, caveat emptor. South Africa is a racist country, governed on the premise that its white minority has more rights, more power than its citizens of darker skin color. It is a country well deserving of most of the condemnations and sanctions aimed at its institutions. Having said that, an American would like to express a bit of revulsion for the recent hounding of Zola Budd, who had been pursuing a running career - let us not say a sport -with a British passport. It is possible that one feels sympathy for Budd because she is tiny and female, because she has already suffered by becoming entangled with Mary Decker during the 1984 Summer Games. But her precarious political role would be no different if she were a brawny male shot-putter trying to win an Olympic medal (with all the attendant rewards, of course). Faced with threats of boycotts by African nations, the British Athletic Board was under pressure from the International Amateur Athletic Federation to suspend Budd for a year after she had made some misguided appearances at sports events in South Africa. She took everybody off the hook by returning to South Africa, apparently suffering exhaustion and depression. And why wouldn't she be? Budd was trying to forge a life as an exile, because of the pariah status of her home country. She is hardly an advocate of apartheid. But she was pursued as a highly visible and vulnerable symbol of South Africa. Monitoring the blatant abuses in South Africa is a valuable service, even in the United States, where we have racial abuses of our own. But forcing Zola Budd off the track became a smug, cruel operation, bringing glory or dignity to nobody, making nothing better in South Africa. Saying he is a bit old to rebuild a basketball program at a different school, Bobby Knight has decided to stay on at Indiana rather than move to New Mexico. By remaining, Knight has set up an inevitable crisis in the state. The next time he does something repugnant - not that far off, by his timetable - Knight will be pitting the new president of the university square against the basketball wackos. The old president, John Ryan, used to duck whenever Knight tangled with police officers, made remarks about Puerto Rico or women, humiliated his players, fought with fans or threw chairs. But Knight has been chastised twice by the new president, Thomas Ehrlich, once for pulling his team off the court against the Soviet Union, once for making a glib reference to rape. Like all bullies, Knight does not take well to being controlled. Will Ehrlich discipline him the next time Knight acts out? Will the fans become mini-Knights if their coach is penalized? The best thing for Indiana to break free of this subservient relationship to a basketball coach would have been for Knight to take the job in New Mexico. Couldn't somebody have slipped him some vitamins? Jacques Demers did not necessarily do wrong by letting Bob Probert and Petr Klima play for the Detroit Red Wings in their last Stanley Cup game last Wednesday, after they had been spotted drinking at 2 A.M. It was his judgment that the team, and the fans, needed the two players, even if hung over. Now that the Red Wings have been eliminated, they must make the hard decision about Probert, who has attended four alcoholism treatment centers in the past two years. Most addiction experts agree that men, in particular, can only be reached when they are threatened with the loss of their primary identity, their jobs. To release Probert might be the kindest thing the Red Wings could do for him. How many other teams would take a man who has failed so often? Overlooking a pattern of destructive drinking is as much a flaw of employer as employee. Good thing there is no symbiotic relationship like that on any New York team.

860-> Ontario Defiance Threatens Canada-U.S. Pact on Trade
The Canadian Government appears to have failed in a last-ditch attempt to persuade the Province of Ontario to comply with the free-trade agreement reached last year with the United States. Its failure could threaten putting the treaty into effect, which is scheduled to take place on Jan. 1, if approved by the United States Congress. Ontario's Premier, David Peterson, told reporters today that the free-trade pact was dead if it required Ontario's approval. Although the provincial legislatures do not have to approve the pact, some portions of it reguire legislation to put it into effect. Mr. Peterson also said that Ontario was considering a court action that would block the national Government's ability to force compliance by the provinces. Court precedents on that issue are unclear, but Canada's Supreme Court, in a 1937 ruling that is considered a landmark in matters of conflicting Federal and provincial jurisdiction, held that Ottawa's power to conclude international treaties did not give it the right to overrule the provinces in areas of their own jurisdiction. The immediate point of dispute between Ontario and the national Government is Ontario's refusal to end its practice of placing discriminatory markups on American and European wines in provincially owned liquor stores, in order to protect the province's small wine and grape industry. Although many economists believe that Ontario's industries will gain under the free-trade agreement, Mr. Peterson appears to have chosen the dispute over wine to vent his broader concerns. The Ontario Premier, a Liberal, has said that the pact undermines Canadian sovereignty in economic matters and makes unjustifiable concessions to the United States in matters such as energy trade. Mr. Peterson made his comments in discussing his meeting in Toronto on Monday with Canada's Trade Minister, John Crosbie, at which Mr. Crosbie sought a way around Ontario's opposition to the pact. Ontario has objected to provisions in the pact that would oblige the province to eliminate price markups that discriminate in favor of Ontario wines and against imports, including those from the United States. Mr. Crosbie has been touring the provinces, seeking support. Only the smallest province, Prince Edward Island, has joined Ontario in opposing the pact. Push for Legislation Vowed In Ottawa today, Mr. Crosbie vowed to press ahead with legislation putting the pact into effect despite Ontario's opposition, but he excoriated Mr. Peterson for his stand, saying, ''It's too bad that one province chooses to set itself above the rest of the country.'' For his part, Mr. Peterson seemed undaunted by the prospect of a court fight. ''I don't think anybody reasonable could have expected me to put my signature on the document and say, 'It's wonderful,' when I think it's flawed in many, many areas,'' he said. The dispute between Ottawa and Ontario, which accounts for more than a third of Canada's population of 25 million and about 40 percent of its manufacturing trade, could derail the trade agreement altogether. Certification Required In Washington, the Senate Finance Committee, which is considering the legislation that would put the agreement into effect, approved a provision on Monday that would require President Reagan to certify that Canada will be able to assure compliance of all 10 provinces before the agreement can take effect. In Parliament this afternoon, the Senate panel's action caused an uproar among the opposition parties, which have vowed to abrogate the pact if they defeat the ruling Conservatives in an election expected in the next year. John Turner, the Liberal Party leader, said: ''It's one thing for us Canadians to disagree among ourselves about how we should operate. It's another thing to allow another country to dictate how we should conduct our internal affairs.'' Smoldering Since Fall The dispute with Ontario has been smoldering since the fall, when Mr. Peterson won a landslide victory in a provincial election after pledging to oppose the free-trade pact. When the agreement between Ottawa and Washington was reached a month after the election, Mr. Peterson appeared to backpedal, saying there were limits to what Ontario could do to block the agreement. According to studies by some Canadian supporters of the agreement, Ontario's industries stand among those gaining the most from the pact, which would eliminate all remaining tariffs between the two countries over a 10-year period. To insure the survival of Ontario's small wine industry, and the grape growers, mainly in the Niagara Peninsula, who depend on the industry, Ontario has long followed the practice of discriminatory price markups in provincially operated liquor stores. The stores the only outlets licensed to sell wine at retail and the markups can add $3 or $4 a bottle to the price of medium-priced California and European wines, compared with the dollar or less that is imposed on Ontario's products. Other Provinces Will Comply Similar practices are followed by other provinces, including British Columbia, that support the trade deal and have indicated that they will comply with its provisions. Although marginal in terms of the $150 billion of trade in goods and services that passes between Canada and the United States each year, the discrimination against American wines became an important point for negotiators after President Reagan singled it out as an issue that required attention when he visited Ottawa last year. Ottawa had hoped that Ontario would agree to a formula in the Canadian legislation to be introduced in Parliament later this month that would put the agreement into effect. Under this formula Ottawa would apparently assert its authority to override provincial jurisdiction.

862-> Randolph Is Concerned
Willie Randolph's decision last week to seek a second opinion on his sore left wrist revealed a ligament tear that will likely force the Yankee second baseman to make a decision about the remainder of his summer. Randolph said today, however, that he would not blame the club for its initial diagnosis of a sprain, which led him to continue playing even though he felt the wrist was more severely hurt. ''That's baseball,'' Randolph said tonight at Fenway Park. ''I'm not upset. I can't expect them to look out for me. It happens all the time in sports.'' Randolph, who sustained the injury April 10 when he attempted a head-first slide against Milwaukee, said he sought an opinion on his own from Dr. Charles Melone last Thursday, a day off for the team. It was then, after undergoing an extensive set of X-rays, that the tear, which Randolph called ''substantial,'' was finally revealed. Randolph has been hitting below .200 for most of the season. A pulled right hamstring has kept him on the Yankee bench since last Thursday. Randolph said he has given consideration to surgery, to more rest, to cortisone shots that would allow him to play. What he has not fully mulled, he conceded, is that he is in the final year of a two-year contract. He will turn 34 years of age in less than a month.

864-> Top South African Executive To Run Anti-Apartheid Party
A senior executive of South Africa's largest corporation today was elected leader of the anti-apartheid Progressive Federal Party. Party officials said they hoped that the new leader, Zach J. de Beer, the executive director of the Anglo American Corporation, would reverse the fortunes of the party, which has only 17 seats in the white Parliament, which has 178 seats. ''Policies based on freedom and dignity can work,'' Mr. de Beer said. ''They represent the true alternative to the chronic conflict and creeping poverty which are the only present prospect.'' Mr. de Beer, 59 years old, succeeds Colin Eglin as head of the biggest party of whites who oppose apartheid. Mr. de Beer said he would quit his posts as executive director of Anglo American and as chairman of Southern Life Association, an insurance company affiliated with Anglo American.

865-> WHERE TO FIND IT; Reviving a Comforter
AT this point, you have probably forgotten (if you care at all) that last winter your down comforter was getting flat and lumpy and was losing its warmth. But now is the season to have it reconditioned. At J. Schachter, which has been in the bedding business since 1919, reconditioning a down comforter means dusting the inside free of decomposed down, sterilizing the remaining down, changing the fabric cover and adding new down. ''We make them as close to new as possible,'' said Miss Kay, an employee. Customers can choose new fabric from the dozens of patterns available or they can provide their own. There are also more than 20 different quilting designs. ''If they want a decorative comforter they can get it here, or if they want a simple one to cover with a duvet, they can have that too,'' said Jay Rosenfeld, the company's president. The cost for reconditioning a comforter starts at $65 for a twin size; it takes three to four weeks in summer and up to six weeks in winter. The concern will also recondition down pillows, starting at $13. This can be done while you wait, ''because some people have no pillows to sleep with that night,'' Miss Kay said. She and another employee, Daisy Montalvo, suggested a few ways to care for down comforters. For summer, comforters should be stored in closets away from overhead lights, so no holes are burned in them. They should not be stored in plastic bags, because down needs air to remain fluffy. Neither cedar nor camphor should be used in storage. ''Down takes on the smell of cedar and camphor and you can't get it out,'' Miss Kay warned. Put a duvet cover over a comforter to protect it. And because inadequate drying makes the down soggy, do not wash it. ''You should always dry clean it,'' Miss Montalvo said. The company also sells new comforters, pillows, sheets, blankets, pillow shams, towels and dust ruffles. The shop is at 115 Allen Street (Delancey Street); 212-533-1150. Hours: Monday to Thursday, 9 A.M. to 5:30 P.M., Friday 9 A.M. to 3 P.M., Sunday 9 A.M. to 4:30 P.M.; closed Saturday. The William Itzkowitz company has been selling and reconditioning down comforters and pillows since 1922. Reconditioning a twin-size comforter starts at $60 and takes about four weeks; pillows are $6 and up and take one or two days. The shop is at 174 Ludlow Street (Stanton Street); 212-477-1788. Hours: Sunday to Friday 8 A.M. to 4 P.M; closed Saturday. The Madison Quilt Shop, in the business for 64 years, reconditions down comforters and pillows. Twin-size comforters start at $70 and take about two weeks; pillows are $8 and up and can be done while you wait. The store is at 2307 Grand Concourse (183d Street) in the Bronx; 212-733-2100. Hours: Monday to Saturday 9:30 A.M. to 6 P.M.

866-> TOPICS OF THE TIMES; Toys That Kill
A popular race-car game for children is ''recommended for ages 3 and up.'' Prudent legislation sponsored by Representative Sam Gejdenson, Democrat of Connecticut, would require the toy's label to say more: that it contains small parts on which a child might choke. According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, toy parts accounted for 13 choking deaths in 1986 and thousands of injuries. For years, the American Academy of Pediatrics has urged that toy package labels disclose the risks. But the safety agency refuses to order such disclosure, bowing to manufacturers' fears of lost sales. Absent stricter Federal rules, buying a toy often involves dangerous guesswork. Does the label ''for ages 3 and up'' refer to intellectual development or to safety? Some children don't outgrow the urge to put objects in their mouth, nose and ears until after age 4. Mr. Gejdenson's measure would require explicit warnings about choking danger. To put sales ahead of so modest and sensible a gesture to safety betrays a shortsighted lack of respect for consumers.

867-> Youths in Poll Outdo Parents in Buckling Up
Mothers have great influence in persuading children to wear automobile safety belts, while fathers often set a bad example, according to a survey of the nation's schoolchildren. The survey showed that 79 percent of the children interviewed believe that seat belts save lives, and that more children than parents wear seat belts. Of the 1,118 children interviewed by Louis Harris and Associates for the American Coalition of Traffic Safety, 58 percent said they wore seat belts all or most of the time, while 57 percent said their mothers regularly wore seat belts and only 38 percent said their fathers buckled up. The safety coalition, which has a $1.5 million annual budget, was set up by the American automobile industry in 1986 to support safety belt use. Among the children surveyed, 30 percent said they used seat belts all the time, 28 percent most of the time and 33 percent sometimes, with 9 percent saying they never wear them. The poll takers interviewed children in the fifth through seventh grades in schools across the country last spring. The poll results, which have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points, were made public last week. Phil Haseltine, executive director of the coalition, said the survey showed that parents are a greater influence on safety belt use than entertainers, sports figures or police officers involved in safety campaigns. ''But fathers don't look too good here,'' Mr. Haseltine said. The survey said 48 percent of the children interviewed wished their parents would use seat belts more often, and 68 percent worried about their parents being killed in an accident. Only 38 percent said they worried about dying in a car crash themselves. The survey said safety belt use was signficantly higher among children in states with mandatory seat belt laws than in states without them - 64 percent in states with laws, and 37 percent in those without.

869-> Washington Talk: Briefing; Cypriot to Visit
The president of Cyprus, George Vassiliou, arrives in Washington today for an official visit that may involve him and his country in Presidential politics in the United States as well as focus attention on the long controversy over Turkish occupation of nearly half the Mediterranean island. Mr. Vassiliou has meetings scheduled with Secretary of State George P. Shultz on Friday and with President Reagan on Mondayto press his campaign for a reunified and demilitarized Cyprus. This would involve dismantling the Republic of Cyrus military forces in return for the removal of 65,000 Turkish settlers and 35,000 Turkish troops from the northern and eastern area of the island they have occupied since 1974. He will also talk with both Presidential candidates, Vice President Bush and Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, in an effort to win their backing for his Cyprus policy. Mr. Vassiliou, a businessman who is a political independent, was elected in February with the backing of the Communist Party, among others. This did not seem to concern President Reagan, who congratulated the new president and called for continued friendly relations between the two countries.

870-> The Multiple Epiphanies of a New-Age Composer
''We have an immense musical vocabulary available to us,'' the electric guitarist and composer Rhys Chatham said. ''Since the turn of the century, we've been looking for different directions. Arnold Schoenberg suggested one. John Cage suggested another. We've seen that anything from random noise to a conversation can be regarded as a piece of music. The question is no longer 'Can we do it?' It's 'Now that we can do anything we want, what do we want to do?' This is the post-modernist dilemma.'' The 35-year-old Mr. Chatham began his composing career as a Serialist and has also written electronic and chance works. But the style that brought him to prominence a decade ago involves Minimalist compositional techniques and rock instrumentation - electric guitars, bass and drums. More recently, he began writing drum and trumpet works; and in his latest piece, ''Minerva,'' he has blended elements of both styles in a score for seven guitars, bass, drums and two trumpets. ''Minerva'' was commissioned by Lincoln Center for the Serious Fun festival, and will have its premiere in a concert Mr. Chatham is sharing with the choreographer Victoria Marks at Alice Tully Hall tonight at 8 o'clock. Mr. Chatham and his band will also perform ''Die Donnergotter,'' the title work from his latest recording (Dossier ST 7538, a German import available from New Music Distribution Service, 500 Broadway, New York, N.Y. 10012). Ms. Marks's program includes ''Armed Response,'' a dance set to one of Mr. Chatham's brass works, ''Waterloo No. 2'' (also on the Dossier recording). ''I write new-age music for heavy-metal fans,'' Mr. Chatham said during an interview last week in his East Village apartment. ''But I consider myself a standard-bearer of Western European art music, not a rock composer. Although I write with a backbeat, my concerns are those a classical composer addresses, and my method is comparatively formal: I begin by establishing the meter, and put the melody on top of it later.'' Mr. Chatham grew up in New York, and began his musical studies as a flutist. His interest, at first, was in contemporary music of a densely chromatic, atonal sort. In 1968, when he was 16, he began studying with Morton Subotnick, a composer of electronic music, at New York University. But that year, two things happened that caused Mr. Chatham to change his direction. One was reading ''Silence,'' a book by John Cage; the other was hearing an organ concert at the Electric Circus by the Minimalist composer Terry Riley. He disliked Mr. Riley's repetitive music at first, but by the end of the evening he had become fascinated with the way it slowly unfolded. Soon he became friendly with other composers and artists working along similarly Minimal lines, and became a student of LaMonte Young. He had a second epiphany in 1977, when the composer Peter Gordon took him to hear the Ramones at CBGB. It occurred to him that the extended-time music he was writing might sound interesting played on electric guitars, and with a rock beat instead of an evolving pulse. One of his experiments in this realm was ''Drastic Classicism,'' a thunderous, wall-of-sound work with choreography by Karole Armitage. He also began playing at volumes exceeding 120 decibels - an approach he has abandoned. ''What happened was that in 1983 I went on a tour of Europe with a program that included 'Drastic Classicism,' 'Guitar Trio' and 'Guitar Ring,' and I found out that everything they tell you about loud music is true,'' he said. ''I couldn't walk into a room where there was loud music without my ears hurting. So I stopped going to clubs and parties, and eventually my hearing returned to normal. But it was scary.'' It was this experience, however, that led him toward drum and bugle corps music. ''I needed to spend time writing in complete silence,'' he said. ''And I found it amusing to combine the process I used in my guitar pieces with a martial sound. It's not the main focus of my work. But as I push in new directions, I want to incorporate as much of my past work as possible.'' At the moment, he is at work on a piece for 100 electric guitars, to be performed next year in Paris. At the start of his composing career, Mr. Chatham discovered that there were few places an avant-gardist could perform in New York. So in 1971, with the video artists Woody and Steina Vasulka, he founded the Kitchen (then on Mercer Street, now at 512 West 19th Street). He served as its music director until 1973, and from 1977 through 1980, and established it as a focal point of experimentation. There are some who argue that Serious Fun is merely a belated and somewhat diluted version of the Kitchen esthetic. But Mr. Chatham finds that a harsh assessment. ''When I started the Kitchen,'' he said, ''there was an audience for this music, but we had to find a way to reach it. At first, we'd have 15 people coming to our events. Ten years later, the place was packed, week after week. What New York needs now is three kinds of spaces. We need small places for musicians, artists and dancers no one knows - places where they can show their work, and where critics will come and put out the word. We need intermediate spaces, for those who have gained some recognition. And we need big spaces like the Brooklyn Academy or Alice Tully Hall, for artists who can attract larger audiences and who need to reach people who have not yet heard their work. I like the idea of attracting a different crowd. The idea has always been to get the music out to the public we've known was there for it.'' ''But New York is very strange now,'' he added, referring to the effect housing costs have had on the downtown arts community. ''Years ago, we had artist ghettos - SoHo, TriBeCa, the East Village. I'd wake up in my loft on Duane Street, roll out of bed and scurry down to Puffy's, where I could hang out and interact with all my artist friends. Then came the advent of the $1,000 hole-in-the-wall, and that has destroyed the arts here. Now everyone is dispersed. They're in Brooklyn or Queens, if they're lucky. So in a way, it doesn't matter where we play. It could be the Kitchen, or it could be Lincoln Center. People who want to hear the music will come.''

871-> How to Make Better Use Of the Airports We Have
To the Editor: ''Aviation Experts Warn of Gridlock at U.S. Airports'' (front page, June 19) shows how those urging huge spending on new airports (the Federal Aviation Administration) can produce ''facts'' that are misleading at best. Examples: * Yes, flying from Akron, Ohio, to Austin, Tex., can include changes at Chicago and Dallas, but this is not new and it makes sense. However, flying from Philadelphia to San Francisco or Seattle to Miami also include changes, usually at an overcrowded ''hub'' airport. This does not make sense and is not ''efficient.'' * Yes, the F.A.A. can list 18 airports as the ''worst'' for overcrowding and delays, but 11 of them are ''hubs'' or affected by one (La Guardia, Kennedy). There is no real need for all the plane changing. * Yes, the reported number of passengers has hugely increased, but every takeoff is counted separately. Massive plane changing on major routes distorts the picture (Seattle-Miami counts as two passengers). * Yes, airlines are replacing small planes with slightly larger ones, but the hub-spoke system has discouraged the use of still larger planes and long nonstop flights. Jointly planned airline schedules have become normal at saturated airports. The Government should encourage jumbo-jet nonstops for major routes. Instead of seven airlines flying Philadelphia to San Francisco, for example, why not two that offer nonstops? FREDERICK C.

872-> SPORTS PEOPLE; Mullaney Resigns
Joe Mullaney, whose basketball teams at Providence College won at least 20 games nine times in the 1950's and 1960's, resigned yesterday as associate athletic director at the college. He had left Providence in 1969 to coach the Los Angeles Lakers and then coached pro teams at Utah, Kentucky, Memphis and Buffalo before returning to college coaching at Brown in 1978. He returned to coach basketball again at Providence in 1981 but again resigned in 1985 and became the associate athletic director at the school. ''There really didn't seem to be enough for me to do,'' said the 63-year-old Mullaney. ''Times change, and I understand that, but the entire scene has changed here in the past few years, and there didn't seem to be a place for me.'' Mullaney said he would like to return to basketball in some capacity.(AP)

873-> SPORTS OF THE TIMES; Glasnost on the Greens
AFTER more than a decade of waggling, the Soviet Union is about to drive its stature as a world power out of bounds. Russia's first golf course is finally on the drawing board. Glasnost has inspired plans for an 18-hole championship course with a log-cabin clubhouse by 1991 not far from Moscow in the woods and lakes of the Nahabino sports center. In adopting hockey not long after World War II, Soviet athletes quickly excelled. But now the Russians will discover what duffers throughout the rest of the world have long known: It's easier to land a man on the moon than a 5-iron on the green. In time, instead of Soviet dissidents being exiled to the gulag, they might be sentenced to the Nahabino outdoor torture chamber. They will learn to fear the three-putt green more than the K.G.B. Up to now, the Soviet Union's vague knowledge of golf has been limited mostly to the names of current European touring pros such as Seve Ballesteros and Sandy Lyle, not to the game itself. When the American golf architect who will design the course, Robert Trent Jones Jr., mentioned to a group of Russians that Jack Nicklaus reigned as the world's best golfer, Jones recalled with a laugh that ''one of the Russians told me, 'We have a Nicholas in our history too.' But for some reason, they seem to know more about Arnold Palmer, Ben Hogan, Sam Snead and Bobby Jones than about Nicklaus and our other current pros.'' ACCORDING to Jones, only one Soviet citizen has a certified golf handicap. Vladimir Kuznetsov, a retired ambassador, learned how to play golf during his stay at the Soviet embassy in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, two decades ago. Diplomats from other nations often gathered there at the Royal Selangor Golf Club early in the morning to beat the equatorial heat. After 18 holes, they conducted much of their embassy business at lunch. Jones met Kuznetsov in Moscow in 1974 when Soviet officials were exploring the suggestion by Dr. Armand Hammer, the American industrialist, that a golf course be built. ''I happened to be carrying my clubs,'' Jones said, ''when Mr. Kuznetsov stopped me and told me he played golf too. Then he asked me what my handicap was, and I told him 6. I asked him, 'What's yours?' and he told me 14, but then I asked him, 'Where do you play?' and he said, 'That's the problem. To play golf, I must go to Czechoslovakia on my vacation. They have courses there.' '' In announcing the Nahabino contract that was signed on June 1 during the recent summit meeting in Moscow, a Soviet spokesman defined golf. ''It's an ancient Scottish game invented by shepherds,'' he said, ''the object of which is to play over a large field in the least number of hits.'' By acknowledging the Scots, the Russians apparently already realize that they don't want to take any credit for having invented this form of masochism. ''When we took some of the Russians out to Nahabino to show them what golf will be like,'' Jones recalled, ''they were asking me, 'What is the green?' and 'What is the hole?' And when I described the green and the hole and what the golfer tries to do, one said, 'Oh, this is like archery.' And another said, 'This is like artillery.' '' The low-lying pine forests of Nahabino reminded Jones of Minnesota and Wisconsin, where he has designed and built several courses in recent years. ''The golf season is also pretty much the same too, May to October,'' he said. ''The latitude of Moscow is exactly the same as that of Minneapolis.'' Jones is the son of the 81-year-old dean of golf architects and the brother of Rees Jones, who supervised the face lift of several holes at The Country Club in Brookline, Mass. for this week's United States Open. ''My father and I went to Moscow in 1974 after Dr. Hammer suggested to Brezhnev that Moscow businessmen needed a golf course,'' Jones said. ''But the time wasn't right. Now that it is, my father's no longer interested.'' JONES will collaborate on the Nahabino project with Olga Korlchagina, a Soviet civil engineer who has never seen a golf course. But she and a few colleagues will visit the United States later this year to inspect courses. ''Olga told me, 'We are great golf martyrs, we have been trying to do this for 14 years,' '' recalled Jones, who has designed 150 courses in 20 countries. ''And I told her, 'By using the word martyrs, you already understand the game.' The Russians will be paying me my normal fee, the same as if I were building a course near Chicago. Once they agreed to pay me, I knew they were serious.'' And knowing the Russians, they will be serious in developing serious golfers. ''The course will be free,'' Jones said, ''but their plan to is to take some of their best young athletes and train them to play golf, the same way they trained their first group of hockey players years ago. What they seem to like best about golf is that one, it's a people-to-people game you can play all your life, and two, the handicap system enables players of unequal ability to compete against each other.'' Jones doubted that a Moscow Open ever will be part of the European pro tour. ''But they're interested in getting the World Amateur Team championships for Nahabino some year,'' he said. ''And with the Russians' love of sports, I wouldn't be surprised if they had a golfer capable of competing in the men's or women's United States Open, if not both by the year 2000.'' But those touring Russians would have to answer a question harder than any golf shot: How are you gonna keep 'em down on the work farm after they've seen Pebble Beach?

874-> New Irving Proposal By Bank of New York
Rebuffed in its attempt to replace the Irving Bank Corporation's board, the Bank of New York Company yesterday announced a new step in its eight-month battle to acquire Irving. If Irving's management would drop its objections to a merger, Bank of New York said, it would raise its bid for all of Irving's shares. But if Irving continued to resist, Bank of New York said, it was still willing to buy two-thirds of Irving's stock at the old, slightly lower price. That novel approach surprised banking analysts, who previously thought that Bank of New York would be deterred by an anti-takeover provision in New York State law preventing a full-scale merger for five years when the target objects. Proxy Vote to Irving Bank of New York's latest overture came just a day after Irving officials began hoping they had won the biggest battle of all by retaining control of their board. Thanks to overwhelming support from the more than 6.5 million shares held by individuals, and a last-minute telephone campaign by senior Irving officers and members of its board to some key institutional investors, Irving won that May 6 proxy vote by about 52 percent to 48 percent. Irving shareholders, who have shown a tepid response so far to a rival offer from Banca Commerciale Italiana, are now faced with a new, higher offer from Bank of New York, and a tight deadline to make up their minds. Bank of New York offered to increase its bid for each Irving share by $3.11, to the equivalent of $67.13. The offer consists of $15 in cash and 1.675 shares of Bank of New York stock. But it would be effective only if Irving's management and board stops objecting to a merger and rescinds a ''poison pill'' by 5 P.M. Friday. The poison pill would give Irving shareholders the right to buy more stock in the new company at half price. Terms of Preceding Offer Bank of New York said it would proceed with its previous offer of $15 cash and only 1.575 shares of stock, equal to $64.02 a share, assuming it can obtain two-thirds of Irving's stock. Bank of New York already owns nearly 5 percent of Irving's stock. Irving's poison pill would not be triggered under this offer, Bank of New York's lawyers said, since there would be no actual merger of the companies. ''Bank of New York is trying to force Irving against the wall, into a corner'' said Mark Alpert, a bank stock analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company. Bank of New York's message, he said, ''scares Irving shareholders'' and could encourage them to tender their stock so as not to miss out on Bank of New York's offers. Joseph A. Rice, Irving's chairman, declined to comment on recent developments. David Santos, a spokesman for Irving, said ''the board will review the matter in due course.'' One legal adviser to Irving, who asked not to be identified, said that ''cute tricks like this do not win takeover fights, and the fact that shareholders have to remember is that the offer from B.C.I. is still higher than the offer from Bank of New York.'' Banca Commerciale has offered $75 in cash per share for 51 percent of Irving's stock and has also promised to pay about $1 of interest that will accrue while shareholders wait for regulatory approval. Value of Italian Bank Bid Combining the Banca Commerciale cash offer with the estimated value of the remaining shares, Irving and Banca Commerciale officials value the Italian bank's proposal over all at more than $70 per Irving share. That estimate includes a special $10-a-share dividend to be paid from the sale of assets, an increase in the regular dividend to $4.50 from $2.42, and an estimated market value of more than $50 for the Irving shares not bought by Banca Commerciale. Other analysts, including many institutional investors and arbitragers, say the Italian bank's offer is worth much less than its proponents claim. ''One of the issues all along as been what the B.C.I. offer is really worth,'' said Felice M. Gelman, an analyst at Dillon, Read & Company. Because of uncertainties surrounding the time required for the Italian bank to obtain regulatory approval, about the ability of Irving to pay its $10 special and $4.50 regular dividend, and about Irving's ability to sustain earnings at a higher level, the Dillon, Read analyst concluded that ''the Bank of New York offer is as good as B.C.I., and has the advantage of being more certain.'' The Federal Reserve has already approved the Bank of New York's merger proposal, but the Italian bank's plan must still be cleared. Irving Stock Up to $61.375 Irving's stock rose sharply after the Bank of New York announcement, closing at $61.375, up 75 cents on the day but more than $2 above its intraday low of $59.125. Bank of New York stock, which had moved up Monday when it looked as if its efforts to acquire Irving had been thwarted, closed at $31.125, down 87.5 cents and well below its intraday high of $32.625. H. Rodgin Cohen, an attorney at Sullivan & Cromwell representing Bank of New York, said he expected that the Federal Reserve Board would allow a revision in Bank of New York's original proposal whereby Bank of New York could operate Irving as a subsidiary rather than merging the two banks into one institution with more than $40 billion of assets. J. Carter Bacot, Bank of New York's chairman, said that, ''operating Irving as a subsidiary, we can still produce some very sizable efficiencies, almost as well as with a merger.'' Mr. Bacot based his assessment on Irving's description of its plan to restructure its operations and avoid a Bank of New York takeover. In documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Irving said its restructuring plan would produce savings of $55 million in the first year and $105 million in the second year. Bank of New York officials were more modest in their estimates, saying that Irving's expenses might drop by $36 million in the first year and $72 million the following year. Institutional investors were dismayed at the outcome of the May 6 shareholder vote, disclosed Monday, when the Bank of New York slate of directors was turned down in favor those proposed by Irving. One New York City investment adviser, who voted one of the largest blocks of stock in favor of Bank of New York, said the vote favoring the Irving directors was ''the result of a crazy system where votes are cast by the shareholders of record on March 4, even if they subsequently sold their stock.''

875-> Trashing Privacy
A man's home is his castle, but is his trash can part of that protected domain? No, says the Supreme Court by a 6-to-2 vote, it's abandoned property left for the municipality. The police may search it for evidence without a warrant or even a reason to suspect that it contains something incriminating. How sensible that seems - as long as it's the other fellow's trash that's being poked and sifted, the other fellow's home that will be searched if the cops find something suspicious enough to justify a search warrant. How comforting to know that it will only happen when the other guy is a crook who deserves his fate. If only that were true. In fact, the Court's decision in California v. Greenwood threatens the innocent as much as the guilty. Of course people put out their trash realizing it may be combed, anonymously, by scavengers. They do not, and should not, expect the Government to be the scavenger. Under traditional, valid tests, the Fourth Amendment's ban on unreasonable searches requires the police to respect a person's reasonable expectation of privacy. That doesn't immunize anyone. It merely insists that before police invade that zone of privacy they have probable cause, the kind of reasonable suspicion that would persuade a neutral magistrate to issue a warrant. Police in Laguna Beach, Calif., suspected narcotics trafficking in Billy Greenwood's home but lacked cause to search it. So they enlisted the trash collector, who turned over the trash. It included what Justice Byron White called ''items indicative of narcotics use.'' Those items became the basis for a warrant application and a drug bust. Maybe Mr. Greenwood expected privacy, said Justice White, but not reasonably. Everybody knows that plastic trash bags are prey to ''animals, children, scavengers, snoops and other members of the public.'' Yes, but that does not legitimize the snooping or disparage the rightful expectation of privacy. What people throw away offers considerable information about them - about their health, their sex life and other intimate details that are nobody's business but their own. Who among us can now be sure that every discarded object is of no interest to prying officials? Justice William Brennan, in his dissent, tried logic. True, there's always the possibility of rummaging meddlers, but does that make the hope of privacy any less reasonable? An operator might eavesdrop on a telephone conversation, but the police still need a warrant to listen in. ''The American society with which I am familiar,'' he said, chooses reasonable security and freedom from surveillance ''and is more dedicated to individual liberty and more sensitive to intrusions on the sanctity of the home than the Court is willing to acknowledge.'' When citizens must wonder, each time they discard a condom, document or dirty book, whether the cops might be interested, some part of freedom has been trashed.

876-> Senator Says Drought Area Tour Showed Urgent Need for Farm Aid
The drought has turned the nation's major crop-producing region into ''a brown and brittle land,'' creating an urgent need for Federal aid to farmers, the Senate Agriculture Committee chairman said today. ''This drought comes at a time when many farmers are just climbing out of the hole after five years of farm depression,'' said the chairman, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont. ''But now, with their crops burned and their livestock hungry, they are once again threatened with bankruptcy.'' Mr. Leahy, who made a weekend inspection tour of Montana and the Dakotas with six other senators, told of crop damage amounting to billions of dollars. Study Group to Meet ''These three states, along with Minnesota, are suffering through the worst drought this early in the season that has occurred in my lifetime,'' Mr. Leahy said. ''Estimated crop losses in these states alone are running in excess of $1.8 billion, and that's a conservative estimate that goes higher every day.'' He said a group of lawmakers and Reagan Administration officials that is studying the drought are scheduled to meet Wednesday and should stay in session until a consensus is reached on what kind of aid package to recommend. Any hope of winning approval of drought relief depends on keeping the issue bipartisan and avoiding friction with the Administration, Mr. Leahy said. He praised Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng for opening conservation lands for cutting hay and cattle-grazing. The senator's comments came as a Government report said that crops and livestock were continuing to suffer from drought in much of the nation, but that the effects were varying widely. Precipitation last week ''across the northern Great Plains did very little to ease the drought and improve crop condition,'' the Ariculture Department report said. ''The lack of moisture, combined with high temperatures, stressed crops and slowed growth throughout most of the eastern half of the nation.'' 'No Signs of Resurgence' Livestock pastures ''showed no signs of resurgence'' in the eastern half of the nation, and producers began culling herds as forage supplies declined, the report added. Other areas of commerce in the Middle West and the South were being affected by the drought as the Coast Guard planned to close the Mississippi river at Memphis, Tenn., to river traffic so a 1,000-foot section could be widened and deepened. That section of the river had shrunk from 500 feet wide and 15 feet deep to 170 feet wide and 9 feet deep. Comdr. Michael Donohue of the Coast Guard said the river would stay closed starting tonight for up to three days for the dredging, tieing up as many as 1,800 barges. Heavy rain was reported today on part of the northern Plains, but the intense heat gave it little chance of soaking in deeply. Records Tumble Early Temperatures hit record highs Monday across the central and eastern United States, the National Weather Service said. And records for high temperatures started toppling today, well before the sun was directly overhead. Milwaukee tied its record for the date with a 93-degree reading at 10:34 A.M., then the mercury continued upward until it reached 101. Other three-digit readings included 105 in Lincoln, Neb.; 103 in Aberdeen, S.D. and Bismarck, N.D.; 102 in Grand Island, Norfolk and North Platte, Neb.; 102 in Waterloo, Iowa; 101 in Fort Wayne, Ind., and La Crosse, Wis., and 100 in Rockford, Ill., and Toledo, Ohio. Twenty-three states reported at least one city in triple-digit heat. Agricultural experts said high temperatures worsen the drought by evaporating what little moisture remains in the soil.

877-> Reviews/Music; Classical Prokofiev Joins Sensuous Mozart
Wednesday's concert at Avery Fisher Hall held out the routine pleasures that Mostly Mozart seems intended to provide. Gerard Schwarz conducted the Festival's orchestra, Jean-Pierre Rampal played the flute and Stephen Hough was the pianist. There were Classical symphonies at the beginning and end. The first was Prokofiev's clever and occasionally moving modern imitation in D; the other was the ''real goods'' - the Mozart Symphony No. 29. Mr. Schwarz's slow tempos in Prokofiev's first two movements had varying results. They might have given needed weight to the opening Allegro if his orchestra had played with tighter ensemble. (It didn't.) But in the famous Larghetto a sense of spacious dignity was more or less achieved. Mr. Schwarz seemed so intent on showing us the tonal sensuousness of Mozart's symphony (the composer always found an amorous quality in the key of A Major) that listeners experienced a degree of sonorous overkill. Rhythmic definition disappeared behind a soft haze, emerging for occasionally lovely moments but too often reduced to a kind of delicate mumbling. Wonderful works like this demand an equilibrium - where neither design nor color are oversold, one at the expense of the other. Mr. Rampal was soloist in Mozart's Concerto in G (K. 285c). His performances in recent years have been guilty of a certain nonchalance, but this one, for all its imperfections, had the virtue of enthusiasm and for that at least we were grateful. Mr. Rampal tended to rush quick passages and small note values, and the intonation in sustained tones was not always pure. His free-swinging approach to phrasing in the slow movement also seemed to cause the accompanying Mr. Schwarz some nervous moments. Still, it was nice to hear a talented man playing as if he really cared. Mr. Hough's piece was the Hummel A-minor Concerto - music that hovers between Classic restraint and the virtuoso incrustations of the Romantics. This performance leaned toward the latter, with vivid extremes between pianissimo and forte, broad ritards and emotional gesticulations of phrase. Mr. Hough, fortunately, did all these things without sacrificing any of Hummel's underlying elegance. It was a nice balancing act, one Mr. Schwarz might refer back to the next time he conducts Wednesday's Mozart symphony.

878-> Review/Music; Opposite Styles Attract
An attraction of opposites can make chamber music work almost as well as the meeting of like minds. It depends on one's tastes - do you prefer total harmony or a little healthy conflict? Thursday's edition of the Mostly Mozart series at Avery Fisher Hall had a little of both schools to it. The four players - Shlomo Mintz, violinist; Pinchas Zukerman, violist; Ralph Kirshbaum, cellist; and Yefim Bronfman, pianist - all more or less share a Romantic background with undertones of the Russian string-playing tradition. Yet similarity of style does not necessarily translate into execution. It didn't in Beethoven's String Trio (Op. 9, No. 3), where Mr. Mintz and Mr. Zukerman rubbed roughly against one another and turned the music's C-minor ardor into a blur of cross-purposes. Earlier, however, Mr. Mintz had given Mozart's duo Sonata in G (K. 301) the full benefit of his thick, sweet playing and made it mesh beautifully with Mr. Bronfman's elegant pianism. Indeed, the latter's sleek, well-formed sense of style helped pull together all the pieces he participated in. These included the Mozart E Flat Quartet and Beethoven's ''Zauberflote'' Variations. The Beethoven features a difficult cello part, smoothly managed here by Mr. Kirshbaum.

879-> WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING; It's Not Just Recess
The House majority leader, Thomas S. Foley of Washington, tried to brief reporters yesterday morning about the legislative agenda now that Congressmen were back in town from their five-day break for the Fourth of July. But he had barely uttered the words ''Independence Day District Work Period,'' the official name for the break, when he as well as the reporters dissolved in giggles. ''I don't know why you always laugh when we say that,'' Mr. Foley scolded as he struggled to keep a straight face. ''We used to call it a recess, but you kept calling it a vacation. So we changed the name to district work period, and you still call it a vacation.'' For the record, the House has six ''district work periods'' this year, four of which have already occurred. There were the Feb. 11-15 Lincoln/ Washington Birthday District Work Period, three weeks after Congress began its session Jan. 25; the April 1-10 Easter District Work Period, and the May 28-31 Memorial Day District Work Period. In addition, the House will be out of session July 15-25 for the Democratic Convention District Work Period, and from Aug. 12 to Sept. 6 for the August-Labor Day-Republican Convention District Work Period. The target date for Congressional adjournment this year is Oct. 5.

881-> The Media Business: Advertising; Time Inc. Stake In Hippocrates
Hippocrates magazine, a West Coast publishing venture started a year ago with $5 million in venture capital, is going to sell half its stock to Time Inc., for $9 million. The two companies announced an agreement in principle yesterday. Hippocrates, a six-issues-a-year consumer magazine covering personal health matters, is edited by Eric Schrier, who is also its president. Mr. Schrier never worked for Time but was a co-founder of Science '80 magazine. That publication was acquired by Time Inc., which merged it into its unsuccessful Discover magazine. Discover was later sold to Family Media. Hippocrates, which in its first year won a National Magazine Award for general excellence, competes with American Health, an independent publication; Health, from Family Media, and Prevention, from Rodale Press. Mr. Schrier will continue to run Hippocrates but Time has the right to half the seats on its board. The magazine, which celebrated its first anniversary with its May-June issue, has a circulation rate base of 400,000, and 90 percent of that is by subscription. Mr. Schrier said it has been averaging about 35 pages an issue lately.

883-> Tough Sanctions Against Pretoria Are Sought by House Democrats
Democratic leaders in the House of Representatives are pressing hard for a sweeping trade embargo against South Africa and a ban on virtually all American business investment in that country. The bill goes far beyond the limited sanctions the United States adopted in 1986. Under a timetable the Democratic leaders have carefully plotted, the bill is expected to reach the House floor in mid- to late June so that it can be passed by House members just before the Democratic Party convention begins on July 18. Since Democrats enjoy a comfortable majority in the House, supporters as well as opponents of the new legislation on sanctions say that its passage there appears all but certain. But what shape the proposed sanctions will take in the Senate and whether any such legislation will become law this year is far less clear. Unlike in 1986, when a bipartisan coalition pushed sanctions through Congress and mustered the two-thirds majority to overcome a veto by President Reagan, the current sanctions drive has a far more partisan character. Panels Vote on Party Lines Votes to approve the legislation in the House Foreign Affairs Committee last month and in the House Banking Committee last week broke largely along party lines, and similar splits are expected when several other committees with jurisdiction over portions of the bill take their votes later this week. ''It is not that sanctions will in and of themselves bring down apartheid,'' said Representative Howard Wolpe, the Michigan Democrat who heads the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Africa, They will not and we ought to have no illusions on that score.'' But he said that new sanctions ''will increase significantly the costs the white minority regime must bear for its repressions and its inhumanity, and those external costs will reinforce the internal pressures that have been building within South Africa for many years.'' Representative Dan Burton, an Indiana Republican who serves on the Foreign Affairs Committee, has argued that far from harming the South African economy and hastening an end to apartheid, the proposed sanctions will actually benefit the white majority and harm South African blacks. ''Proponents of this legislation argue that a moral stand must be taken, even if ineffective,'' he wrote in the committee's report on the bill. ''The question becomes, if apartheid is truly abominable, is it moral to pursue an ineffective policy if a more effective policy is available? Can South African blacks afford another moral stand that actually detracts from their ability to fight apartheid?'' Details of the Legislation As currently written, the legislation would ban all American investment in South Africa, giving American companies doing business there or individuals with investments a year from the time of enactment to divest themselves of their holdings. Imports from South Africa would be banned, but exemptions would be permitted for strategic minerals essential for the United States economy or defense, and for publications and imports from businesses 100 percent owned by blacks and other non-white South Africans. American exports to South Africa would be banned, but exceptions would be made for agricultural commodities and products, publications and United States public or private aid for ''disadvantaged'' South Africans. The legislation would also ban new Federal coal, gas and oil leases for American subsidiaries or affiliates under common control of a foreign country that directly or indirectly invests in South Africa's oil industry. The legislation would bar American-owned, -controlled or -registered ships from transporting oil to South Africa, and United States military cooperation and intelligence sharing with South Africa would be prohibited. In what may prove to be the most contentious provision of the bill, the President would be required to retaliate economically against individuals or companies taking significant commercial advantage of the American sanctions. Although the Foreign Affairs Committee has tried to specify that such retaliation would not be aimed at foreign governments, opponents as well as some supporters of the legislation say the provision violates international trade agreements to which the United States is a party and could result in countermeasures against the United States by third countries that continue to do business with South Africa. Little Effect on Americans Supporters of the sanctions legislation have argued that in practical terms, the cost of the disinvestment and the trade embargo on American businesses and individuals will be quite small because remaining American interests in South Africa are already limited. According to figures compiled by the Foreign Affairs Committee, American direct investment in South Africa totaled $1.4 billion in 1986, down from $2.6 billion in 1984. Indirect American investment, consisting primarily of holdings in South African gold-mining companies, was estimated at $2.5 billion to $3 billion in 1986, while American bank loans amounted to $2.95 billion as of September 1987. United States exports to South Africa totaled $1.25 billion in 1987, consisting mainly of computer and electronics products, chemicals and aircraft. All of these would be prohibited under the proposed sanctions, but American exports of agricultural products, which totaled $55 million in 1987, would be exempted. South African imports to the United States, which totaled $1.25 billion in 1987, are composed mainly of strategic minerals that will be exempt from the trade ban.

884-> METRO DATELINES; U.S. Backs Appeal In Zoning-Bias Case
The United States Solicitor General has asked the Supreme Court to hear an appeal from the Town of Huntington in a case that could affect zoning laws nationwide. A Federal appeals court ruled in April that Huntington had perpetuated segregation by restricting the construction of apartments to a part of town populated mainly by minority-group members. Huntington officials are challenging that decision, which broadened the interpretation of Federal fair-housing laws by finding racial discrimination that was based solely on the effects of the town's zoning laws. A plaintiff, the court ruled, did not have to prove that the intent of a zoning ordinance was to discriminate, a much more difficult task. Historically, intervention by the Solicitor General, the Government's chief lawyer before the Supreme Court, reflects the Government's keen interest in a case and greatly improves the chances that the Court will hear an appeal.

885-> Review/Film; The Many Kinds of Division in Israel
In its exasperatingly prolix and tendentious way, ''Shattered Dreams'' accents the growing political, economic, social and religious divisions that are putting dangerous strains on Israeli democracy. The painfully timely British-made documentary, which opens at Film Forum 1 today, is filled with confrontations between Arabs and Israelis, hard-liners and Peace Now demonstrators, religious zealots and people who drive on the Sabbath. The sympathies of the movie makers, Victor Schonfeld and Jenifer Millstone, are never in doubt. They are for peace and against zealotry. They like scenes of Jews and Arabs singing and dancing together. Although a third longer than it had to be, the three-hour movie contains strong footage (some of which has been on American television). There is Rabbi Meir Kahane, leader of the far right Kach Movement, calling for the expulsion of all Arabs, while his opponents blow little whistles to drown him out. (Rabbi Kahane's proposed laws for the treatment of Arabs, given here, bear an unnerving similarity to the Nazi Nuremberg laws regarding Jews.) There are bitter arguments among Israelis; the left calls the right fascists; the right calls the left traitors. There are sadly quiet reflections by relatives of young men killed in the invasion of Lebanon. There are complaints of discrimination by Israeli Arabs and Jewish immigrants from Arab lands. Unfortunately, the movie makers play so heavily on the passions on the edges of Israeli opinion that their work loses focus. ''The danger of civil war certainly exists,'' someone says, and the movie takes that literally, showing us Arab-despising ''racists'' on the one side and on the other, people who are willing to travel to Rumania to talk with representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organization. (The amiable P.L.O. spokesman adroitly avoids making an explicit acknowledgment of Israel's right to exist.) On one side are soldiers who beat Arabs; on the other, soldiers who refuse to serve on the West Bank. (We attend an interesting debate between two opponents of the West Bank policy; one calls on soldiers not to serve there, in hopes of forcing a change of policy, the other warns that such refusals will leave the occupied territories in the charge of thugs.) Small groups are given disproportionate significance, and their clashes, emphasized here, leave the impression that the country is a daily battleground. The middle is slighted. The vintage scenes of the early Zionist pioneers are, as always, moving, but the observation that the Israelis have lost sight of their founders' ideals is by now as trite as the movie's title. ''They had a dream,'' someone says. ''We have no dream left.'' The accomplishments of the fathers have become sticks with which to beat the children. The Israelis that this documentary likes best - and indeed they come through as eminently likable - are those who are working with their Arab neighbors in communal projects, tiny oases of cooperation in a desert of separation. Their efforts are touching, but they, too, are a tiny minority. There is considerable insight and plenty of emotion in ''Shattered Dreams.'' If only it had more perspective. FIREWORKS ON THE FRINGES - SHATTERED DREAMS directed by Victor Schonfeld and Jenifer Millstone; written by Mr. Schonfeld; edited by Ms. Millstone; released by New Yorker Films.

John Michael Begley, the parking meter officer who accepted four baseball tickets from Pete Rose June 29 after ticketing the Cincinnati Reds' manager, has been given a two-day suspension without pay. Begley cited Rose for parking in a no-parking zone on the street named after the former player, Pete Rose Way. Rose said he accepted the $29 ticket, then offered the officer the Reds tickets, jokingly calling them a bribe because the officer seemed like a nice guy. The hearing officer, Glenn Redmer, decided that accepting the tickets was not an intentional violation. But Begley's supperior, Charles Cullen, said ''the hearing officer decided that one could make the inference there was a violation.'' (AP)

888-> THE REPUBLICANS IN NEW ORLEANS: CONVENTION CHRONICLE; For the Republicans, a Final Day of Boos and Hisses and Hugs and Kisses
The day had a Humpty-Dumpty feel to it. The celebration had cracked and everyone was trying desperately, with teddy bear-shaped confetti and tense smiles, with brass bands and brassy speeches, to put the pieces back together again. The script called for a joyous apex for George Bush, but but instead Republicans were improvising, acting as though, if they tried very, very hard, they could make the cascading questions about Dan Quayle's military record go away. Barbara and George Bush cuddled in front of 2,500 people and talked about their conjugal bliss. The Vice President brought his designated running mate, who had started the day hiding from a clamoring press, to a luncheon to give him a spirited endorsement. Delegates and other Republican guests claimed that the whole controversy was a media conspiracy. ''What controversy?'' asked Charles Smith, a doctor from Sulphur, La., who was waving a small flag as the Bushes and the Quayles rode into a luncheon in their honor at the city Convention Center on a fire truck. ''It's just the media trying to intimidate a youth who hasn't learned how to return a hardball yet.'' Down by the Mississippi River, Grace Jesberger, a delegate from St. Mary's, Pa., determinedly agreed. ''From the little I have watched and the comments I have heard on TV, the press is being unfair, very biased,'' she said, as she shopped in her red and white George Bush T-shirt. ''You can write this down. The press are a bunch of left wing, liberal Communists. No, take out Communists. Put down French Socialists.'' #11:50 A.M.In a witty tableau worthy of the Lunts, George and Barbara Bush mock the notion that their marriage lacks fire. Coming to the platform to introduce his wife, who looks elegant in a red and white checkered suit, the Vice President explains that American politics means getting ''analyzed to death'' by people who ''want to know the real you.'' He suggests that the Democratic convention, at which Michael and Kitty Dukakis were so openly affectionate, changed the rules of the game so that just having a wonderful marriage of 43 years is not enough. ''Since the Democratic convention,'' he says wryly, ''you have to be a little more demonstrative, you have to show your emotions a little bit more.'' Sounding like the announcer for the TV game show ''Let's Make a Deal,'' Mr. Bush introduces his wife ''with feeling'' by looking at her slyly and calling out, ''Come on up, sweetie pie.'' Then, he hugs her and mugs over her shoulder like a silent film star. A preppy Valentino, no less. The crowd goes wild. In a syrupy tone that sends the audience into another paroxysm of laughter, Mrs. Bush replies, ''Thank you very much, sweetie.'' ''I hope you don't take your eyes off him,'' she tells them, ''so that you see if he looks at me as adoringly as I looked at him.'' #1:15 P.M.If the stagecraft at Mrs. Bush's tribute is superb, the stagecraft at the party's finance committee gala is embarrassing. The fund-raising affair, featuring the only joint appearance of the new team on this sensitive day, raises $4 million. But it offers an awkward scene because events have overtaken planning. As a way of giving a moving tribute to Mr. Bush's record as a war hero, his aides had arranged for him to be introduced by Leo Nadeau, a California man who served in the Navy with Mr. Bush 45 years ago, when the Vice President was a bomber pilot. As Mr. Quayle sits on the stage with the Vice President and their wives, Mr. Nadeau talks about Mr. Bush's distinguished military record and awards for bravery. He talks about ''the face of war'' and ''the men who didn't make it back,'' and relates the bombing mission in which Mr. Bush himself ''almost didn't make it back.'' ''To this day,'' he says, ''neither of us knows why some men die and some don't.'' As this unfolds, reporters eagerly wait to question Mr. Quayle about whether he used influence to get into the National Guard after graduating from college in 1969, practically eliminating the chance of having to fight in the Vietnam War. #2 P.M.Margaret Foster stands on a wooden platform in the corner of Lafayette Park, a grassy quadrangle shaded with pin oaks and magnolia trees near the center of the city. The police have set aside the park as the site for protest demonstrations during the convention, but so far, not many people have shown up. Consider Mrs. Foster, who is a member of a Christian group that opposes abortion. She is clinging to a microphone, singing a slow spiritual, and the amplified music is drifting through the square. But there is almost no one there to hear it. ''I don't get it,'' said Dick Bashta, who is the pastor of a church here that helped sponsor the rally to oppose abortion, condemn homosexuality and declaim promiscuity. ''Where is everybody?'' #7 P.M.As the final night of the convention comes to order, these are some of the impressions that journalists from around the world are sending to their readers who are curious about this odd ritual of American Democracy. Il Messaggero of Rome reports that Dan Quayle is ''strikingly telegenic and his impetuous oratory is accompanied by wide and vigorous gestures which have earned him many admirers, but also ironic smiles from those who contest his inexperience and his ambition.'' The Daily Telegraph of London asserts that Mr. Bush has a paucity of new ideas and muses: ''Is it very hard indeed to see this weakness being redeemed by the amiable but light-headed Senator from Indiana.'' #8 P.M.Republicans are reluctant to discount their campaign buttons even though the end is nigh. Indeed, the value of at least one button is increasing. ''The banned button is back,'' reads the sign stuck full of ''Where was Teddy?'' buttons with a Chappaquiddick theme. The Republican National Committee tells Jerry Cook these buttons are too tasteless to sell at officially licensed booths in the corridor of the Hyatt Hotel. So Mr. Cook sets up shop in a drug store and raises the price from $3 to $5. #8:35 P.M.As Dan Quayle's speech reaches as crescendo, Joshua Goulet of the Michigan delegation is awakened by applause. Joshua, who is 2 1/2 years old, is sitting next to his mother, Juanita, and sharing his chair with his stuffed bear, Boo-Boo. ''They are inseparable,'' says Mrs. Goulet. As the Vice President's sleek film biography begins, the boy and bear are nodding off again. #9:05 P.M.George Bush takes his place in the sun at the 1988 Republican convention and he talks about his family and his parents. A ''spontaneous'' demonstration begins for the party's new nominee. Twenty-eight years ago this summer, at another Republican convention in Chicago, the Vice-President's father was being carried along with the crowd past the press platform. He was caught up in Richard Nixon's ''spontaneous demonstration,'' which began when the nominee hit his punchline at 9:08 p.m - a zealous troup that Russell Baker, who was covering the convention for The New York Times, described as ''the most superb, the noisiest, the most be-placarded, the most violent, sweatiest, spontaneous demonstration staged this year.'' ''Senator Prescott Bush, the stately gentleman from Connecticut came bobbing along like a chip going out on the tide,'' the Times reported. ''On his head he wore a black three-cornered hat edged in gilt. In his hand he carried a placard proclaiming 'Connecticut for Nixon.' ''Between gasps, he winked as he was swept past the press platform, and yelled, 'Pretty good for an impromptu demonstration, wouldn't you say?' ''

890-> Review/Film; 'Madame Sousatzka,' Or, Life Through Music
Madame Irina Sousatzka (Shirley MacLaine) is a magnificent relic, the kind of creature who can be found only in the memories of her most devoted students, or else on the movie screen. A woman like this would be at a disadvantage in the real world, but Madame barely acknowledges the real world at all. She lives solely for music, surrounded by photographs of great pianists and educating a hand-picked group of prodigies, to whom she gives homemade cookies and imparts her own brand of wisdom. ''I teach not only how to play the piano, but how to live,'' says she. John Schlesinger's ''Madame Sousatzka'' is as much of an antique as the woman herself and a long, sentimental celebration of the ''great pianist and pedagogue,'' as one of Madame's admirers describes her. It's as affectionate, big-hearted and creaky as any film that ever graced Radio City Music Hall, with leisureliness and dime-store philosophizing to match. And if its insights into Madame's character don't go much deeper than the layer of makeup that transforms Miss MacLaine into a painted harridan, they don't really have to. Like its heroine, ''Madame Sousatzka'' finds a form of defiance in what otherwise might merely seem dated. ''Madame Sousatzka,'' which opens today at the Baronet, reserves its greatest enthusiasm for the excesses of the Sousatzka System, which are explained in great detail. (A yellowing chart in her London studio shows precisely how the bones of the fingers are to be held.) Madame will cover a student's eyes when he plays, so the music ''can arise from the depths of the very soul to the height of reason.'' She will declare: ''It's all one: the way we dress, the way we speak, the way we play. It's all connected.'' She will scold: ''No, no! The message cannot come to the fingers if you don't open your body and let it through!'' And she will snap, in her most brittle tones: ''Bartok! As though he could ever play Bartok!,'' about someone whose talents she does not admire. Shirley MacLaine plays this to the hilt and beyond, which is just what the role requires. She's both a monster and a marvel. Festooned with fringed shawls and clanking beads, walking with a slight hobble, spraying herself furiously with perfume when she becomes flustered, and made up garishly as the very essence of faded glory, Miss MacLaine rivets the attention at every turn. Her catalogue of facial expressions alone is fascinating, since she seems to have captured every possible variation on the withering look. With her icy sidelong glances, her overbearing scowls and her brittle glares of suspicion and disapproval, this Madame Sousatzka is indeed as formidable as she means to be. The screenplay, by Mr. Schlesinger and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, brings the character and her friends to life without giving them much of a dramatic raison d'etre. It surrounds Madame with colorful neighbors (among them the great Dame Peggy Ashcroft as the sweet old lady next door, and Twiggy as a flirtatious, blithely charming would-be singer upstairs) and gives her a brilliant new protege (Navin Chowdhry), yet it never succeeds in generating much of a story. The film meanders between Madame's efforts with this new student and her impending eviction from the building in which she has lived for many years. In the end, ''Madame Sousatzka'' very nearly tears down the building to create the impression that something has changed. The plot is so weak that one of its significant developments is the discovery of a stray hair in the Indian food that the new student, Manek Sen (Mr. Chowdhry), and his mother, Sushila (Shabana Azmi), have been cooking as part of their catering business. Nonetheless, ''Madame Sousatzka'' holds the attention through sheer force of personality, if not through any discernible action. Miss MacLaine's scenes with the very appealing Mr. Chowdhry are particularly enjoyable, as the teacher sheds her sternness and begins showing genuine affection for the boy. Indeed, all the older women in the story appear unaccountably attracted to this young man, not the least of them his own mother. Late in the film, there's a clumsy effort to inject an element of longing into Madame Sousatzka's psyche. When Manek makes his concert debut, she relives the disaster that was her own; on the same occasion, she gazes at a painting of a voluptuous nude and then catches a glimpse of two young lovers. If these touches seem entirely superficial, that's because Miss MacLaine makes the idea of Madame's requiring any greater satisfaction from life seem irrelevant. The character's grand assurance, her sweeping faith in the rectitude of her own opinions, is her own greatest virtue and the film's as well. The incidental touches are among the best things about ''Madame Sousatzka'': the wine-dark, portrait-filled apartment that Madame has made a shrine to her art (with a stuffed octopus on the Steinway); the Indian landlady and her friends who've created a home away from home in the apartment downstairs from Manek and his mother; the sign reading ''For Distressed Gentlefolk'' on a box of things Dame Peggy's character is giving away. Dame Peggy also has a wonderful moment when, as a hospital patient, she exclaims more or less happily over the pudding and macaroni she is being fed, and cites this meal as one of the pleasures of being English. ''Madame Sousatzka'' is rated PG-13 (''Special Parental Guidance Suggested for Those Younger Than 13''). It contains some strong language and sexual innuendoes. PIANO HARPY - MADAME SOUSATZKA, directed by John Schlesinger; screenplay by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala and Mr. Schlesinger, from the novel by Bernice Rubens; director of photography, Nat Crosby; edited by Peter Honess; music by Gerald Gouriet; production designer, Luciana Arrighi; produced by Robin Dalton; released by Universal.

891-> Review/Film; Animated Works From All Over
Any film that sends vicious M & M's candies skittering up a human foot as if they were African ants and that sets Che Guevara twirling in dance with the Statue of Liberty deserves a livelier title than ''The 21st International Tournee of Animation.'' The latest in this annual series of short animated films is full of wit, sophistication and visual energy - the best way to escape the listlessness and self-importance such anthologies are prone to. These film makers graciously take their technical finesse for granted, and allow the audience to lose itself in the split-second, magical transformations that are the soul of animation. About half of the 14 pieces tell no stories except visual ones, but as they flash in and out of scenes the films dare us to keep up with them. The Swiss ''78 Tours'' presents a Chinese-box vision; a grassy park turns out to be printed on the dress of a woman, who sits in a park, and on and on. This cyclical world is in constant motion -a coffee cup turns into a man walking down a spiral staircase, which gives way to a Ferris wheel. The drawn figures are viewed as if a movie camera is swinging around 180 degrees, a technique that blurs the definitions of cartoons and cinema. ''Pas a Deux'' is just as dizzying but wildly comic. In vibrant caricatures, unlikely couples dance together and suddenly become even less likely partners. It's hard to say which pair is the strangest of the strange - Don Quixote and Olive Oyl, Tarzan and Snow White or van Gogh and a Playboy bunny. The Pope dances alone. The narrative pieces range from silly to effectively mysterious. In ''Arnold Escapes From Church,'' a clay-animated boy lets his imagination conjure deliciously irreverent, literal responses to Psalm 23. ''Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies'' brings a hatchet-faced schoolmarm to a feast of candy and cake, and ''My cup runneth over'' sends a coffee cup with legs scampering along the table. ''The Writer,'' by the Dutch animator Paul Driessen, has a beautifully eerie, Medieval setting. The writer is a blobby, monkish-looking figure created with spare lines, in subdued shades of blue and brown. Bright red, green and yellow shapes float up from his quill pen to a world in which people can turn into cats or castles and where death roams in the shape of a rickety Halloween skeleton. This deft blend of wit and seriousness owes much more to Ingmar Bergman than to other animators. Even at their most conventional, these films are aware of their animated past and take funny turns on traditional cartoon styles. ''The Cat Came Back'' evokes a Tom and Jerry world full of crayon colors, as it illustrates a Canadian folk song about an indestructible cat who turns up on an old man's doorstep. The man chases him into a cave and underwater, only to return and find the cat has eaten the sofa. The half-hour piece that ends the collection, ''The Man Who Planted Trees,'' is all too much like a bedtime story. It resembles a prettily drawn storybook; in lullaby-low tones Christopher Plummer narrates the tale of a man who singlehandedly planted thousands of trees and reclaimed barren land. It anchors the anthology with solemn reverence, and seems at odds with the generally high spirits of ''The 21st International Tournee of Animation,'' which opens today at the Festival Theater. WALKING SHORTS THE 21ST INTERNATIONAL TOURNEE OF ANIMATION, a series of short films produced by Terry Thoren; presented by Expanded Entertainment. At the Festival Theater, 57th Street west of Fifth Avenue. Running time: 105 minutes. These films have no rating.

893-> WHERE TO FIND IT; Making Old Pictures Look Just Like New
ONE woman brought in a photograph of her grandmother that was so mildewed it stuck to the glass in the frame. Someone else wanted a tiny photo from a gold locket reproduced. Another customer despaired because her child had used a crayon to draw all over a photograph of her mother. Each of these old photographs was restored to look like new at Dan Demetriad, Inc., a photographic studio in midtown Manhattan. ''This is really the part of our business we like most,'' said Iris Devereux, the vice president of the studio and Mr. Demetriad's wife. ''It is really important to us to find historical pictures and reproduce them and make them timeless.'' In most cases, customers no longer have the original negative, so Mr. Demetriad resurrects the damaged photograph by making a new negative. For the picture stuck to the glass, for example, this meant carefully photographing the original print through the glass. Then the negative is enlarged into what Ms. Devereux calls ''a second-generation'' print. The studio never works directly on original photographs because they are so valuable. ''They're too fragile, and being one of a kind, it's an enormous risk,'' Ms. Devereux said. Choosing paper is the next step. What is called black and white paper is used for sepia-tone prints to give an antique look; cream-colored paper produces the feeling of photographs taken in the 1940's and 1950's, and stark white paper gives a modern effect. ''We try to reproduce the photo as close to original as possible,'' Ms. Devereux said. The firm also reprints pictures that are faded or torn. Black and white photographs can be colored by hand tinting. ''And we can isolate a person in a group shot and photograph just them,'' Ms. Devereux said. Prices for 8-inch-by-10-inch prints start at $14.50; retouching and special papers are extra. Estimates are free. The company is at 200 West 57th Street, Suite 200; 212-245-1720. Hours: Monday through Friday, 9 A.M. to 7 P.M. The 12-year-old firm of Galowitz Photographics, photograph restoration specialists, will work on all black and white prints, including tintypes, daguerreotypes and glass negatives. Eight-inch-by-10-inch prints start at $17.25. Estimates are free. The shop is at 511 Avenue of the Americas, near 13th Street; 212-242-8115. Hours: Monday through Friday 8:15 A.M. to 5:30 P.M.; Saturday 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. Thomas Griesel, a freelance photo technician who has been in business for 13 years, reproduces old black and white photographs. Eight-inch-by-10-inch prints start at $20. Estimates are free. He can be reached during the evenings and weekends at 31-34 36th Street in Astoria, Queens; 718-204-1716.

894-> BASEBALL; Another Flop For Mets
For the Mets, the sins had been bunched into one unforgivable inning, the first. There were three stolen bases, three walks, a wild pitch, a balk and an error. For the Expos, there were four unexpected, unearned, but totally appreciated runs. ''My thinking was that two runs were good,'' said Buck Rodgers, the manager of the Expos. ''Four runs, I figured they were in trouble.'' Nine innings failed to provide any redemption for the Mets. They idled on the field, stalled on the base paths, and collapsed in a heap against the Expos yesterday, losing 7-4 at Shea Stadium. ''On paper, we're supposed to be a great team,'' said Bob Ojeda, who was on the mound for the first inning but not much longer. ''But you don't win pennants on paper.'' Ojeda, however, could have filled a page with the trangressions his team committed yesterday. And in a sense, he did, ticking them off to reporters. ''This team is not as indestructible as it's portrayed to be,'' Ojeda said. ''It's not a tremendous club, regardless of who's playing. It's a good team that has managed to stay in first place.'' Ojeda, who has labored without offensive support for much of his infuriating season on the mound, did not need prompting to continue. The words poured out. ''We've been waiting three months to turn it on,'' he said. ''We can't. We are what we are. We're a good club, but we're not going to run away with anything.'' They can't hide, either, from these facts: they have lost five of their last six games, playing sloppy baseball; they fill the bases with runners and then their locker room with exasperation after stranding them, and they are now just four and a half games ahead of the Expos, a team that matches up well with them. ''I promised myself I'd be a good boy,'' said Dave Johnson, the manager of the Mets, who was clearly simmering after this latest afternoon of apathy. ''But this is trying. This is frustrating.'' Not for Rodgers. ''Certainly, I think we're capable of catching the Mets,'' said the manager, whose team has won two straight this weekend, 6 of 10 against the Mets this season and 10 of their last 13 over all. ''I feel good about our spot in the race. Working Out Problems ''My views of the Mets haven't changed, but we're a better club than we were at the start of the season. They were ahead of everybody else coming out of spring training because they were set. We had a lot of experimenting to do. We had to work out our problems.'' The problem for the Mets is that they continue to spend most of their time working out of their own rallies. On Friday night, they left the bases loaded in the 10th before losing by 5-2 in 12. Yesterday, they trailed by 5-0 after three innings, pulled within 5-2 after five, but left the bases loaded in the seventh when the result was still in doubt. The doubt, like the threat by the Mets, didn't last long. Len Dykstra popped to third as the Mets scored nothing in the seventh. The Expos then sealed it in the eighth when Tim Wallach, who drove in three runs, hit a home run and an additional run crossed courtesy of yet another infield mishap that allowed Luis Rivera to score from first on a ball hit to shortstop. Clubhouse Chemistry ''I can't look over and say we have better talent than the Mets,'' Wallach said. ''That doesn't mean I don't think we can win it. Chemistry is an easy word to use, but whatever it is, it feels right in this clubhouse.'' Physics probably can't even explain some of the pitches Pascual Perez employs. Yesterday, Perez threw his bloop pitch, used his hesitation delivery, but most importantly threw some unfunny strikes. ''That's the way he pitches,'' Rodgers said of Perez, who entered the game second in the league in earned run average. ''Each pitch he throws complements the other. It's a head game he plays.'' It's a game that left the heads of the Mets hanging. Perez (9-6) allowed just five hits in seven innings while striking out four. The Mets added an unearned run in the eighth and another run on a sacrifice fly in the ninth. ''We could have closed it out a little neater,'' Rodgers said. The Mets couldn't have begun it any sloppier. Rex Hudler bunted and reached on an error by Keith Hernandez at first. He stole second and then third on consecutive pitches. After Tim Raines was walked and advanced to second on a steal, Hudler scored on a wild pitch by Ojeda. A walk to Hubie Brooks, a sacrifice fly by Wallach and hits by two more Expos produced the final three runs.

895-> At Issue in Davis Trial: 2 Guns and Spent Slug
Two men, two guns and a piece of lead are at center stage as testimony in the trial of Larry Davis enters its fourth week tomorrow in the Bronx County Courthouse. Mr. Davis is accused of trying to kill 9 of the more than 20 police officers who raided the Bronx apartment where he was hiding the night of Nov. 19, 1986. Six officers were wounded, the largest number in a single shooting incident in Police Department history. The first man, and central figure, always present but silent except for whispered exchanges with his lawyers, is the 22-year-old defendant whose defense is justifiable self-defense because, his lawyers say, the police staged the raid and fired first in an attempt to kill him for his knowledge of police drug corruption in the Bronx. The other man is a former Bronx detective, Thomas McCarren, who retired on medical disability from the wounds he received in the shootout. His name has been invoked frequently in the courtroom but he has not appeared. Mr. McCarren was the first of the seven police officers who burst into the apartment in an operation whose purpose, the prosecution asserts, was to arrest Mr. Davis as the prime suspect in the murder three weeks earlier of four suspected drug dealers. The prosecution asserts Mr. Davis, armed with an arsenal of weapons and determined not to be arrested, fired first. Mr. Davis was tried and acquitted of the four slayings earlier this year. The two guns are a 12-gauge shotgun and a .38-caliber police revolver, both found after the shootout in the apartment from which Mr. Davis escaped unscathed. He was captured not far away 17 days later. The piece of lead is a shotgun slug that may or may not have been discharged from the 12-gauge shotgun, which may or may not have been carried by Detective McCarren. The .38-caliber revolver was identified as his in testimony given by a detective who also said that it had never been fired during the shootout, thus supporting the prosecution's contention that Mr. McCarren never fired before he was shot in the face and neck. He has recovered from the wounds. Role of a Shotgun Slug The spent slug bears no ballistic traces because shotgun bores are not rifled. A police officer testified that he found it, early in the morning after the raid, in a dresser drawer with a bullet hole in it in the back bedroom from which, the prosecution contends, Mr. Davis emerged, guns blazing, to drive the raiding party out of the apartment. The defense has tried to suggest, without evidence so far, that the shotgun slug was the first bullet fired in the gun battle. The Davis arsenal of five weapons described in police testimony did not include a 12-gauge shotgun. By the end of last week, the prosecution had brought 15 active or retired police officers, all involved in one aspect or another with the shootout and its immediate aftermath, to the witness stand. They provided a mass of detail about the raid that the chief prosecutor, Assistant District Attorney Brian Wilson, hopes will help persuade the nine black and three Hispanic jurors to accept the prosecution's contention of the legitimacy of the raid and that Mr. Davis, who is black, fired first. As fast as Mr. Wilson has tried to build his case, the defense lawyers, William M. Kunstler and Lynne F. Stewart, have tried to demolish it by citing inconsistencies in the police testimony, by the use of innuendo and inference and, perhaps most effectively, by ridicule. The defense has cross-examined witnesses in a way that suggests the raid was a fake, that Mr. McCarren rushed into the apartment first, 12-gauge shotgun at the ready, to assassinate Mr. Davis and that the unfired .38-caliber revolver the police say belonged to Mr. McCarren was planted by the police after the shootout. What the two defense lawyers frequently only suggest through their questions in the courtroom to sow doubt, among the jurors, they say explicitly outside the courtroom to reporters covering the trial. Suggestion and innuendo, says Mr. Kunstler, is the better tactic before the jury. The defense has also used ridicule to attempt to portray the police witnesses as bumbling, if not dishonest.

896-> THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Y.&R. Plans Joint Venture In Moscow
YOUNG & RUBICAM, a leading exponent of agency joint ventures and America's largest independent agency, yesterday announced plans to form a joint venture with Vneshtorgreklama, the Soviet state advertising agency. The announcement follows by a month and half a similar one from FKB, a British marketing services group, which will also set up a joint venture with the Moscow agency. Alex Kroll, chairman and chief executive of Young & Rubicam, and Yuri M. Deomidov, general director of Vneshtorgreklama, signed the letter of intent in Moscow yesterday. It calls for an office in the Soviet capital, with two Y.&R. executives and six Soviet advertising people, to be opened by Jan. 1. In accordance with Soviet policy, the Soviet agency will own 51 percent of the venture. The office will offer commercial communications counsel to Western clients doing business with Soviet enterprises. In the last quarter-century the Soviet Union has shown a striking change in its attitude toward advertising, which went from official distain to acceptance and then an eagerness to learn more about the commercial art. In the past, American ad agencies, for example, have been contacted by Vneshtorgreklama (which translates as Foreign Trade Advertising) requesting reels of award-winning commercials. The Soviet agency said last year that the marketing of Soviet products overseas was being hampered by a lack of trained advertising professionals, Advertising Age reported. In connection with the Y.&R. joint venture, Mr. Deomidov was quoted as saying that access to the American company's expertise and resources ''should help us develop our commercial communications competences even faster in the Soviet Union.'' His agency has 350 employees, compared with Young & Rubicam's 11,000. In April, Ad Age reported, Soviet trade organizations were told they no longer had to give their business to Vneshtorgreklama and that it was possible to assign it to United States agencies. Although a variety of advertising media are available in the Soviet Union, there is little need to advertise to consumers because there are so few consumer goods. The companies that have shown the most interest in advertising are manufacturers that want to reach decision makers in Soviet industry. That means business-to-business advertising. Back in the mid-1970's both Marsteller Inc. and Black-Russell-Morris of Newark (since acquired by Bozell & Jacobs) made deals with Vneshtorgreklama. Marsteller was to promote technical American equipment and service in Soviet publications, Black-Russell-Morris was to place a majority of the Soviet advertising in the United States. Marsteller was acquired in 1979 by Y.&R. and some years later became the American half of a joint venture with Dentsu of Japan called DYR. The French Havas later joined them, making it a three-way venture, which is now called HDM.

897-> A Vermonter's 'Tough' Help for the Sex Abuser
From her log home in this Champlain Valley town, Fay Honey Knopp, a 70-year-old Quaker minister, regularly corresponds with nearly four dozen prison inmates. Several are sex offenders. ''I'm tough with these guys,'' she said. ''Society has let them off the hook by just locking them up, then letting them out on probation. I'm very up front with them. Yes, most of them were sexually abused as children, but that can't be an excuse to go out and abuse other people.'' Prevention of sexual abuse is a major concern for Mrs. Knopp, who has been working with prisoners for more than 30 years. Mrs. Knopp, who is a documented minister in the Quaker faith, spends much of her time directing the Safer Society Program, a national referral program for treating sex offenders that evolved from a program she founded 14 years ago. The Safer Society operates under the auspices of the New York State Council of Churches. Treatment Over Punishment The organization's goal is a criminal justice system that can provide sex offenders with treatment rather than punishment. ''I'm an advocate for a safer society,'' said Mrs. Knopp, ''and society is not very safe without effective treatment programs for sex offenders.'' Mrs. Knopp said the most effective treatment for sex offenders is a step-by-step approach in which the offender is forced to take responsibility for the crime, then must learn to recognize the pattern of behavior that typically precedes a crime. Finally, the offender must learn to break the cycle before abuse occurs. With Mrs. Knopp, a full-time staff of three and an annual budget of about $65,000, the program runs a nationwide referral service for sex offender treatment programs, publishes a handful of books each year and assists states in designing treatment programs. ''People are aghast at how much stuff we turn out,'' said Mrs. Knopp. ''They can't believe we do all this on such a small budget.'' Headquarters in Log Home The program operates out of a room in the back of the large modern log home that Mrs. Knopp and her husband, Burton, a beekeeper, built 12 years ago on a dirt road here. They moved here from Westport, Conn., where Mrs. Knopp ran a halfway house for ex-prisoners out of their home. On a hot August afternoon, William Stevenson, the staff's data processor, is compiling the results of a survey of all treatment programs in the United States. The number has blossomed to nearly 1,000 adult programs last year from 20 in 1976. This survey, which is the basis of the referral program, follows up on one taken in 1986. On this hot afternoon Jean Rosenberg, the research assistant, is finishing work on a book to be published by the Safer Society Press, an adjunct of the Safer Society Program. Mrs. Rosenberg's book, ''Fuel on the Fire,'' attempts to correlate pornography and violent sexual behavior. The most recent title in the Safer Society Series is ''Adults Molested as Children: A Survivor's Manual for Women and Men,'' written by Euan Bear, a Vermont woman who was molested as a child. Lois Lackey, publications coordinator, is filling an order for Safer Society materials from Canada. ''We get orders from all over the world: Australia, New Zealand, West Germany, the Netherlands,'' said Mrs. Lackey. She is a former librarian. 'A Great Deal of Inspiration' Mrs. Knopp is often on the road, consulting with states or private organizations to work out treatment programs, speaking to groups, organizing conferences. To limit her traveling time, she now rules out ''panels where there are a lot of other people, most commissions and advisory boards, and talk shows.'' Even so, she is booked through the middle of November. Sally Maxton, director of the Ohio Youth Services Network, a nonprofit advocacy group, said Mrs. Knopp helped map strategy for Ohio, where treatment programs went from a handful to nearly 40. ''What she's provided is a great deal of inspiration as well as expertise,'' said Ms. Maxton. ''One of her great strengths is cultivating leaders. There's an entire movement of people across the country, a network of people committed to eliminating sexual abuse, that had its roots in the Safer Society Program.'' Conference in Minneapolis In October, Mrs. Knopp is scheduled to participate in a Minneapolis conference for professionals who work with adult males who were sexually abused as children. ''Most of the people working with sex offenders know her and know the program,'' said Peter Dimock, a clinical social worker in Minneapolis who, with Mrs. Knopp, helped organize the conference. ''The networking she's done, putting people from different states in touch with each other, has been invaluable. I don't know of anybody else who does this kind of work.'' Mrs. Knopp takes calls for referrals, many of them from sex offenders who want to find help. ''Lately we've been flooded with calls,'' she said, ''hundreds of them from offenders. Of course, we keep all calls confidential.'' She is working on new projects, including a trilogy of self-help manuals for offenders. Her newest areas of interest are treatment programs for intellectually disabled sex offenders and early intervention for very young offenders. ''Quakers have what we call 'leadings of the spirit,' '' she said. ''This is mine. I do this work because it's what needs to be done.''

898-> Liberty May Be the Price of Civil Rights Law
To the Editor: George Roche's reference to Alexis de Tocqueville in relation to the Civil Rights Restoration Act (''The Death of Federalism,'' Op-Ed, April 12) could have been strengthened by including Tocqueville's discussion of freedom and equality. In ''Democracy in America'' Tocqueville says: ''Democratic peoples always like equality, but there are times when their passion for it turns to delirium. . . . It is no use pointing out that freedom is slipping from their grasp while they look the other way.'' Tocqueville's acute description reminds us that the relation between freedom and equality often involves trade-offs that need to be weighed. Our commitment to equality through civil rights law has had many positive effects on American society, but we should not blindly support every bill that claims to insure greater equality. As Mr. Roche says, the Civil Rights Restoration Act grants the Government extensive new power to exercise control over our private institutions. This form of government intrusion exacts a significant sacrifice of liberty and involves an undue trade-off. The President saw this and vetoed the bill but Congress, in its delirious mood, overrode his sober judgment. As a democratic people we should continue to strive for greater equality in our society, but we should not do this without always weighing the trade-offs involving political liberty. For if we pursue equality myopically, we eventually will fulfill Tocqueville's stark description when he says that democratic peoples ''want equality in freedom, and if they cannot have that, they still want equality in slavery.''

899-> FOREIGN AFFAIRS; S O S For The U.N.
The United Nations has long been lurching into disrepair, ineptitude and impotence. The main thing done about it was to ignore the world organization. But since the Soviet Union unexpectedly changed its position, chances are starting to improve for making it work. The Soviet policy is part of Mikhail Gorbachev's ''new thinking'' in foreign affairs. Essentially, it is a recognition that military power isn't enough to insure Soviet influence in the world, that major war cannot be contemplated, and that Soviet domestic needs would be better served by pulling back from regional conflicts and if possible resolving them. It follows logically that Moscow is seeking now to revitalize the U.N., since that is the best place for it to pursue a role that was getting difficult to sustain unilaterally. A number of specific steps have already been taken, including paying up past dues. Moscow is now playing host to a big conference here on the ''future role of the United Nations in an interdependent world.'' There are reasons for caution in assessing how far this will really take the Soviets toward becoming peacemakers and how consistently new promises of cooperation in the U.N. will be fulfilled. For one thing, there are too many Soviet proposals, on every possible aspect of U.N. operation - or paralysis - and too many of them are vaguely grandiose to take in earnest. For another, the momentum of Mr. Gorbachev's reforms remains in serious doubt. It is easier to change Soviet foreign policy than to restructure the Soviet economy, and so the direction of this decision is probably irreversible. But an ominous debate is surfacing, ostensibly about Stalin and the origins of the cold war, actually challenging the new line that ''class analysis'' doesn't apply to issues of world security. ''Class analysis'' means simply that everything wrong is the fault of imperialists and capitalists, and that Communists have a monopoly of good ideas and good intentions. Though Soviet officials deny it, the argument echoes in reverse the warnings of American hard-liners about letting down the guard against the foe. Nonetheless, official policy now is to strengthen the world system, undermined from the start by East-West conflict. All the other things wrong with the U.N. have been encrustations on the fissured foundation. The Secretary General's recent successes in regional wars owe a lot to the new Soviet stand. Not surprisingly, prospects for peace in Afghanistan, Angola, the Western Sahara and Cambodia and between Iran and Iraq have excited a mania to ''let the U.N. do it.'' Now Iraq is saying the U.N. should assure clearance of the Shatt al-Arab, clogged by sunken ships. Some Palestinians talk of turning territories occupied by Israel over to temporary U.N. administration. Ironically, inflated and unrealizable ambitions for U.N. responsibilities are coming along just when the organization is running out of means. It can't pay for what it already has to do and will soon need to do. Some people have suggested diverting supposedly vast savings soon to be achieved by disarmament agreements into building U.N. forces - sometimes the same people who already proposed using all that money for development aid, and then for protecting the environment. That's the kind of blue-sky talk that makes U.N. debates so vapid. The money has to come the way it always comes, from government budgets. The spotlight is now on the U.S., which can't consider its debts to the U.N. as another deficit, to be financed by foreigners. By the time President Reagan goes to New York to make his last speech to the General Assembly this fall, he should certainly be able to announce that the U.S. will pay its arrears. It may be self-satisfying but it is no excuse to say that since the U.N. refused to act when the Soviets wouldn't pay, the U.S. needn't meet its obligations. And it is against American interests. Elliot Richardson, Secretary of Defense and then Attorney General in the Nixon Administration, points out that while relative U.S. power in the world has in fact declined, U.S. responsibility for leadership in maintaining world order remains intact. That means a larger, more constructive role in international organizations, not copping out. Mr. Richardson would make a good delegate to the U.N. in a Republican administration. Whether the Republican or the Democratic candidate wins, the next administration will have to be more U.N.-conscious. It's good the Soviets are changing policy. It would be folly to leave them alone in the lead.

900-> Chief Ties 'KKK' Marks to Man Charged in Molestation of Corpse
The Chief of Police here said today that he believed that a man arrested for molesting the corpse of a black teen-ager who had been beaten and strangled was the same person who had carved the letters ''KKK'' into her body. The partially clad body of the teen-ager, Anna Kithcart, was discovered by a white drifter early Tuesday near an abandoned, overgrown railroad bed behind Kingston Hospital. The drifter, Joseph L. Kiernan, 41 years old, was charged Wednesday with sexually molesting the body. The letters had been carved with a sharp object into the body of Miss Kithcart, who was 19 years old. Kingston is about 30 miles north of Wappingers Falls, where another black teen-ager, Tawana Brawley, was found alive last November, with the letters ''KKK'' written on her body, sparking the explosive, racially charged case that continues to capture headlines. The only similarity between the two cases, the Chief, James K. Riggins, said, ''is the letters KKK.'' Several Suspects While Chief Riggins would not rule out a racial motive for the slaying, he said, ''we're not looking for any Klansmen or any other hate group.'' Miss Kithcart's mother is white and her father is black. He said the police were exploring the possibility that the slaying was drug-related. ''We don't know who killed her,'' he admitted. ''We have several suspects, black and white.'' Mr. Kiernan is among the suspects, he said. Donald Williams, the assistant Ulster County Attorney in charge of the Kithcart case, said Kingston authorities and the state task force investigating the Brawley affair have been cooperating ''to determine whether there is a correlation between the two.'' The Rev. Al Sharpton, an adviser to the Brawley family, went to Kingston yesterday, Chief Riggins said. The authorities in this city of about 25,000 people, 7 percent of whom are black, had kept the knowledge of the KKK carvings a secret for more than 24 hours after Miss Kithcart's body was discovered Tuesday morning. ''It's a very sensitive issue,'' the Chief said. Waiting for Laboratory Tests Based on statements from Mr. Kiernan, the Chief said, there is ''an overwhelming possibility that he scatched those slurs on her body.'' He added, however, that there is no physical evidence linking Mr. Kiernan to either the molestation of the corpse or to the carvings. ''We're waiting on the results from the crime lab,'' he said. David J. Clegg, Mr. Kiernan's lawyer, said his client denied all the charges. ''All he did was find a body and report it,'' he said. ''He did what every good citizen would do.'' Since the discovery of Miss Kithcart's body, the police have been trying to piece together her last hours. The Chief said investigators had established that she was in a bar from 11 P.M. Monday until 1 A.M. Tuesday. He said the police had filed several complaints with the State Liquor Authority that the bar, the Royal Grill, was an unruly establishment. Chief Riggins said the area behind the hospital, where the body was found, is covered with broken beer bottles and not far from the bar. He said it is frequented by drinkers, drug users and the homeless. At Miss Kithcart's home, where she lived with her mother, neighbors were sitting under a tree watching their children play in the yard. ''Everyone up here liked her,'' a neighbor, who asked not to be identified, said. ''Anna was one of the best. If she saw you on the street, she'd shout at you. She cared for everybody. The kids loved her.''

901-> 3 More Killed as Standoff Persists at Sikh Temple
Three more people were reported killed today in the third straight day of armed confrontation between Indian security forces and Sikh militants based in the Golden Temple at Amritsar, Sikhdom's holiest shrine. The Indian Government sent scores of commandos to the city, where they joined hundreds of police officers surrounding the sprawling shrine. The commandos were flown to Amritsar, in Punjab state of northern India, on Tuesday night, although Government officials here were at pains to deny that they planned a raid on the temple to rout the militants. ''I would not like to use the expression 'flush out,' but the Government has in mind a series of steps to rid the Golden Temple complex of the terror menace,'' an official of the Home Affairs Ministry, P. Chidambaram, said in Parliament today. A Siege Strategy It appears that the authorities will patiently wait while mounting a virtual siege of the temple. No one is being allowed to enter the shrine, which normally attracts thousands of visitors a day. Buta Singh, the Home Affairs Minister, who is a Sikh, said that officers at Amritsar had been ordered to prevent the militants from building fortifications around the shrine. Government sensitivity about a possible raid recognizes the sense of alienation felt by many Sikhs after the Indian Army routed hundreds of Sikh militants from the Golden Temple in 1984. About 1,000 people, including more than 100 soldiers and many pilgrims, died in that attack. On Monday, five people were killed and five wounded in a six-hour gun battle at the temple. Today, three people were said to have died inside the temple when troops opened fire. Intermittent exchanges of gunfire continued through the day, news reports from the city said. The Sikh militants seek to break away from India and create an independent nation called Khalistan, or ''land of the pure.'' More than 900 people have died in violence in Punjab state so far this year, trouble that the authorities attribute to the Sikh militants. Pre-empting an Attack Home Ministry officials said that the commandos had been sent to Amritsar to prevent the Sikhs from mounting an assault on police positions and from securing private buildings near the shrine for use as additional bases. The Golden Temple is surrounded by crowded bazaars and stores. But a curfew in Amritsar has shut down these shops since violence first erupted on Sunday, when 32 people were killed in various incidents including an attack by Sikh gunmen on a Hindu wedding. The police are now guarding escape routes from the temple as about 100 of the militants, said to be armed with a wide range of weapons, are reportedly taking shelter in rooms along a wide marble path next to the sacred pond in the center of the shrine. Officials at Amritsar have denied reports that they have cut off power and water to the temple. The Sikhs, a prominent and prosperous minority in India, make up 2 percent of the nation's population. Most of them live in Punjab state. An official of the state government at Chandigarh, Punjab's capital, said that authorities were in ''full control of the situation'' in Amritsar.

903-> On Stage
'Bledsoe' Is on the Way It's not unique, but these days it's not that common either - a drama produced directly for Broadway. So it's nice to know that the short list will be a little longer next spring when ''Bledsoe,'' a new play by Arnaud d'Usseau, has its world premiere. The $1.2 million production, to be directed by Keith Hack, a 1985 Tony Award nominee for his direction of ''Strange Interlude,'' and produced by Rick Hobard (''Before the Dawn'' and ''Find Your Way Home''), will open in late April after seven weeks in Boston and Washington. Mr. d'Usseau, the author of ''Deep Are the Roots'' and ''Ladies of the Corridor,'' has set his new play in a Rome hospital, where a twice-married chauvinistic American novelist clashes with the hospital administrator, an English nun. What happens then, according to Mr. Hobard, is ''hate at first sight develops into respect, admiration, love and passion.'' Victoria Tennant, a star of the forthcoming 30-hour television mini-series ''War and Remembrance,'' will play the nun. There is no commitment as yet for the male lead, although both Stacy Keach and Timothy Dalton are being talked about. 'Driving Miss Audrey?' Word is that Audrey Hepburn has said no to replacing Dame Wendy Hiller in the London production of ''Driving Miss Daisy'' next month, but might say yes to the movie version. However, Olivia de Havilland is on the list of possibles for London. Locally Regional The $50,000 Jujamcyn Theaters Award goes to the Second Stage Theater this year, the first time a New York-based company has been chosen (past recipients include the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Conn., and the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass.). The award, given annually to an American regional theater that has made an outstanding contribution to the development of creative talent, will be presented Nov. 21 to Robyn Goodman and Carole Rothman, the theater's artistic directors. Scott Glenn's Progress Almost 10 years ago, Scott Glenn, who had been working in Los Angeles, watched himself on some television reruns and realized, he said, that he was a worse actor than when he left New York seven years earlier. He took his wife and two daughters and moved to within skiing distance of Sun Valley, Idaho, an area he still calls home. ''I had turned into some kind of show-business politician, thinking about billing and money and what people are at what party, instead of thinking about acting and developing character,'' said Mr. Glenn, who is co-starring in ''Burn This.'' ''I wanted to get back to my dream of being an actor.'' It was, he said, ''almost like if you want something, you have to be willing to let go of it,'' because almost immediately after he moved, he got a call that put him in a picture called ''Cattle Annie and Little Britches'' with Burt Lancaster, ''who taught me the difference between being on stage and in film.'' After that, he was offered the role in ''Urban Cowboy'' that more or less changed his career. For a time after that, he worked ''maniacally,'' he said, but he's now more relaxed. He's taken part of the last two winters off to be with his family, ski and ''hang out,'' and he's renewed his theater ties. ''I love the immediacy of the theater,'' he said. ''I love the fact that no one can come running up and say 'stop' or 'cut' or 'I didn't write that.' I love the chance to do a complete unit.'' The Panelists Nelligan and Miles The first of the American Theater Wing's ''Working in the Theater'' seminars takes place Nov. 1 with Kate Nelligan and Sylvia Miles among the participants in ''Performance.'' After that, there are sessions on playwrights and directors, production and design. Isabelle Stevenson, the Wing's president, is acting as chairman, and Jean Dalrymple and Edwin Wilson will moderate. A limited number of seats are open to the public (free of charge). Reservations: 765-0609. Even before that - Oct. 25 at the Pierre hotel -Jan Chipman and Jean Stralem will oversee a special lunch celebrating the creation of Friends of the Wing and honoring Mrs. Stevenson. Scores of theater people will be there, many of them participating in a program produced by Anna Sosenko. The price: $125. Telephone: 765-0986. Names The names of Off and Off Off Broadway offerings are becoming increasingly imaginative. How about ''Kiss Me Quick Before the Lava Reaches the Village''? That's the name of the Musical Theater Works production by Peter Ekstrom and Steve Hayes that is scheduled for St. Peter's Church, Lexington Avenue and 54th Street (688-6022). It may not sound like it, but it's about a movie company invading rural Nebraska. It begins Oct. 26, as does ''What Would Esther Williams Do in a Situation Like This,'' about an eccentric family on Staten Island, written by the twin brothers Don and Rich Werbacher. This one will be at the Village Theater, 137 West 22d Street (564-8038). In the Wings Cynthia Sikes, known to television (''L.A. Law'') and film (''Arthur II: On the Rocks'') audiences, will make her Broadway debut Nov. 15 as the baker's wife in ''Into the Woods.'' . . . The 20th anniversary season of the York Theater Company (2 East 90th Street) opens tonight with a 50-song ''Sing for Your Supper: A Rodgers and Hart Musical Celebration.'' . . . ''Ma Rose'' by Cassandra Medley, about three generations of women in a black family, opens the 10th anniversary season of the Women's Project Wednesday at the Apple Corps Theater, 336 West 20th Street (242-4204). Coming up at the project next June - Edna O'Brien's new work, ''Blood Memory.'' . . . ''Good Black'' by Rob Penny, the romance of a middle-aged woman and a young man, is the next offering of the New Federal Theater, beginning Thursday at the Henry Street Settlement Harry DeJur Playhouse, 466 Grand Street (869-3981).

904-> Consolidation Cuts Profit at I.B.M.
The International Business Machine Corporation said yesterday that its net income fell 18.1 percent in the second quarter. But its revenue rose 6.3 percent and the results were well received by analysts. The decline in net income reflected a $600 million pretax charge that I.B.M. took last month as part of an aggressive campaign to cut costs by consolidating operations. Analysts said the computer maker had a generally strong quarter and several said they expected significantly improved performance in the second half of the year. I.B,M.'s stock rose $1.75, to $126.50, in trading of almost two million shares on the New York Stock Exchange. Still, ''this is the quietest response to an I.B.M. earnings announcement that I can remember,'' said Marc G. Schulman, an analyst at Salomon Brothers. $364 Million Reduction The one-time charge for the consolidation reduced earnings on an after-tax basis by $364 million, or 61 cents a share, I.B.M. said. Excluding the charge, earnings rose 12.7 percent, to $1.33 billion, or $2.24 a share. Including the charge, net income fell to $964 million, or $1.63 a share, from $1.18 billion, or $1.95 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose in the second quarter to $13.6 billion, from $12.8 billion a year earlier. I.B.M. executives said the results showed that the company's actions to renew its growth were succeeding. ''Our business continues to improve as a result of our actions to be more competitive, and customer response to our recent product announcments has been positive,'' John F. Akers, I.B.M.'s chairman, said in a statement. Last month I.B.M. announced a broad plan to consolidate and restructure its operations. The company said that 10,000 employees would be affected and that it expected as many as 4,000 to retire or resign. The consolidation will affect a wide range of manufacturing plants. The plan calls for reducing the number of I.B.M. manufacturing sites to 14, from 19. Among the operations to be closed are the personal computer assembly facility at Boca Raton, Fla., the birthplace of the I.B.M. personal computer. The Tucson, Ariz., facility that makes computer storage devices will also be shut and 2,800 jobs will be eliminated. I.B.M. plans to move its manufacturing for its PS/2 line to Research Triangle Park, N.C. The size of the charge indicated that I.B.M. might be expecting more employees to depart than it had publicly stated, some analysts said. I.B.M. is offering two years' pay and $25,000 to manufacturing employees at two plants who retire, said Jay Stevens, a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. TI.B.M. also said yesterday that it had restated its first-quarter earnings to reflect a change in accounting standards for deferred taxes. That change added 57 cents a share to first-quarter earnings. New Orders Flat Although new orders were generally flat from a year earlier, analysts noted that the company introduced several significant products during the second quarter of last year. Orders stemming from the introduction of Personal System/2 line of personal computers and new mainframe computers created an unusual bulge in sales, Mr. Schulman said. I.B.M. could show significant strength by the end of this year. Strong results are expected from its new AS/400 midrange computer and from a new version of its most powerful 3090 mainframe, which will probably be introduced later this month. ''We're still waiting for the new products,'' said Steven Milunovich , an analyst at the First Boston Corporation. ''Both the AS/400 and new mainframes will contribute significantly during the second half.'' The new products are a key to continued sales growth because I.B.M. needs to respond to new mainframes introduced by the Amdahl Corporation and to the strength that the Compaq Computer Corporation and Apple Computer Inc. have shown in the personal computer market. I.B.M. also recently introduced some additional models in its PS/2 line, including the Model 70, which competes with other high-performance desktop personal computers. Even before the recent introduction of the AS/400, which is intended to rejuvenate the middle of I.B.M.'s product line, I.B.M. had begun to slow the inroads that the Digital Equipment Corporation has been making in recent years, analysts said. According to Bob Djurdjevic, a market researcher at Annex Research in Phoenix, I.B.M.'s intermediate system shipments rose 15 percent, to $6.7 billion, in 1987. The main disappointment I.B.M. was the decline in domestic orders during the quarter. Mr. Stevens said I.B.M. had told him that domestic orders dropped 5 percent but that the downturn was offset by much stronger foreign orders, up 10 to 15 percent. For the first six months of 1988, I.B.M. said its net income rose 12.7 percent, to $2.21 billion, or $3.73 a share, from $1.96 billion, or $3.25 a share, a year earlier. Revenue climbed 8 percent, to $25.3 billion, from $23.5 billion.

905-> Answering The Mail
Q. We left a yellow rubber bath mat in the bottom of our tub for a couple of months. When we picked it up we found that it has left a yellow stain which we cannot seem to remove. We tried scouring powder, then tried rubbing with fine steel wool, but the latter left a gray stain, probably because of the tub's age (34 years). Is there any kind of rubber dissolving chemical I can try that might remove the stain without causing further wear of the thin enamel? A. The steel wool was a mistake; you may have scratched through the enamel or porcelain finish. Try scrubbing with Zud, a cleanser sold in hardware stores, supermarkets and plumbing supply outlets. It works exceptionally well on plumbing fixtures. If this doesn't do the trick, try covering the stain with a piece of turkish towel and soak this with a bleach solution - one part laundry bleach to three parts water. Let this sit for an hour, then remove the toweling and rinse with water. Q. My house is built on a sloping piece of property so the driveway is quite steep. This driveway is blacktop and applying a sealer can make it very slippery. What can I do to get maximum traction on a driveway like this? A. The most common way to solve this problem is to mix coarse sand or similar aggregate in with the sealer when you apply it. This will create a gritty surface that will help improve traction. The sand will tend to wear off quicker than sealer alone, but to keep the sand from wearing off so quickly many find it helpful to apply a second coat of sealer on top of the sanded finish after the first coat has dried.

906-> Louisiana Refinery Explodes, Killing One Worker
An early morning explosion and fire that ripped off roofs and doors of nearby homes rocked a Shell Oil refinery here today, killing one worker, injuring more than 40 people and leaving six people missing. About 2,500 residents were evacuated from an area near the refinery, in the heavily industrialized corridor along the Mississippi River between New Orleans and Baton Rouge. The fire burned out of control for five and a half hours. Most of the residents were allowed to return to their houses at midmorning. The fire was under control at midafternoon, and Shell officials said they were letting it burn itself out. Fred Foster, manager of the Norco-Shell complex, said rescue workers would have to wait for the fire to go out and the rubble to cool to enter the refinery. He said there was no speculation on the cause. #92 Workers at Plant Wendy Jacobs, a Shell spokeswoman, said 92 of the plant's 1,600 employees were on duty when the explosion occurred. The dead man was identified as a Shell employee, but his name was not disclosed. Mr. Foster said the six missing men were Shell workers who had been working near a unit that converts crude oil into gasoline. Shell officials said the unit had ruptured in the explosion. The blast occurred at about 3:30 A.M. It caused widespread damage throughout town, shattering windows and blowing doors from their frames and roofs out of place. The shock wave from the explosion shattered plate-glass windows as far away as New Orleans, 20 miles down the Mississippi River. People 45 miles away said they felt the force of the blast. ''It went boom, and then boom again,'' said Adam Mashia, 65 years old, who lives less than a mile from the plant. ''It knocked me to the floor and as I was getting up, it knocked me down again.'' Phil Schwin, a Shell spokesman, said damage at the refinery complex alone was expected to run into the millions of dollars.

907-> Who Wants a 'Democratic, Secular' Palestine?
To the Editor: Ibrahim Abu-Lughod's dream of a ''democratic, secular'' state in the West Bank and Gaza (Op-Ed, April 25), noble though it may be, is a dream shared by very few Palestinians who actually live in the terri-tories. An entirely different portrait of Palestinian aspirations emerges from the findings of a poll of West Bank and Gaza public opinion conducted under the auspices of the pro-P.L.O. newspaper Al Fajr and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in mid-1986, more than 18 months before the onset of the Palestinian uprising. When the poll results were first released, they caused a minor media stir because they claimed to provide statistical proof that the vast majority of Palestinians support both the P.L.O. (93.5 percent) and its leader, Yasir Arafat (71.1 percent). But the real story of the poll does not concern the Palestinians' preferred representation; rather, its significance is that it testifies to the canyon-like divide that separates the Palestinian body politic from even the most dovish of mainstream Israelis. Of the 1,024 people surveyed, only 10.4 percent shared Mr. Abu-Lughod's dream of a ''democratic, secular'' Palestinian state. Instead, nearly 60 percent dream of a state founded on Islamic law (26.5 percent) or on a hybrid of Islam and Arab nationalism (29.6 percent). Extraordinarily few Palestinians (16.9 percent) accept even the objective of a two-state solution, that is, the creation of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza alongside Israel. A full 77.9 percent prefer the establishment of a Palestinian state ''in all of Palestine,'' essentially calling for Israel's destruction. Palestinians were no less incremental on a tactical level. When asked their preference for an interim solution, more than 40 percent dismissed the idea out of hand, opting instead to ''continue the struggle for . . . a state in all of Palestine.'' And those Americans who believe that the obduracy of the right-wing Likud is the principal stumbling block in the peace process should take note that nearly three out of four people interviewed (73.9 percent) said there was ''no possibility'' for a peaceful and just solution to the Palestinian problem regardless of which Israeli political party is in power. Lastly, when asked to pick among a list of ''justifiable'' acts of violence, most Palestinians interviewed commended such deeds as the 1978 hijacking of an Israeli bus (87.6 percent) and the bombing of an El Al plane (60.5 percent). More than one-third of those polled (36.9 percent) even supported the brutal killing of civilian passengers in the Vienna and Rome airports in December 1985. I note these statistics neither to dismiss legitimate Palestinian claims for political rights, nor to absolve Israel of error in its occupation policy, nor to turn a blind eye to the Kahanist fringe in Israeli politics, whose views are as bloodcurdling as those described above. Rather, these statistics are noteworthy for the dark shadow they cast on the rosy, romantic vision of Palestinian aspirations described so eloquently - and disingenuously - by Mr. Abu-Lughod.

908-> Macmillan Rejects Bid Of Maxwell
Macmillan Inc. said today that it had rejected the $2.1 billion takeover offer from Robert Maxwell, the British publisher, calling it inadequate. In documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Macmillan said it was holding exploratory talks with unidentified third parties. The publishing and information company stressed that it had not entered formal negotations yet. Macmillan told the S.E.C. that in some cases it had provided confidential financial information to the unidentified parties and ''may engage in such negotiations in the future.'' Other Potential Buyers Macmillan ''has had discussions with other parties and, based on those discussions, the board believes that more than $80 a share could be obtained if the board determined to sell the company,'' the company said in the filing. Maxwell is offering $80 a share in cash. Macmillan's stock closed today at $83.875, up 62.5 cents, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Macmillan has also rejected a takeover bid from an investor group led by Robert M. Bass of Fort Worth. In response to the Bass offer of $75 a share in cash, Macmillan's management proposed a restructuring plan that would have divided the company in two, but the plan was blocked by a Delaware court. Court Appeal Sept. 9 Macmillan's appeal of that ruling is scheduled for Sept. 9. The Bass group has extended its offer until the date of hearing. Macmillan said it was continuing to explore alternatives, including a revised restructuring plan, the sale of additional equity or the sale of all or part of its assets. In London, the Maxwell Communications Corporation said it hoped Macmillan would allow Macmillan's shareholders to consider the offer. The statement reiterated Mr. Maxwell's interest in pursuing friendly talks with Macmillan management. The Maxwell offer was conditional on the approval of the Macmillan board. Mr. Maxwell has offered to drop his tender offer for Macmillan, if he is allowed to buy the assets of Macmillan's information services operations for $1.1 billion. Reaction on Wall Street to the rejection of the Maxwell offer was mixed. ''If I were a Macmillan shareholder, I'd be fuming,'' said Ivan Obolensky, an analyst with Josephthal & Company in New York. He said Macmillan shareholders had been forced to accept management assertions that they could better the $80-a-share offer.

909-> High Ground Is a Stranger In Bangladesh
Bangladesh is a nation seemingly founded on unstable footing. Its very ground is, by and large, a swarm of islands created and washed away each year as the waggling, monsoon-swollen Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers reach across its vast delta and tumble into the Bay of Bengal. Its politics are no more predictable. Two presidents have been assassinated in its 17-year history, and Bangladesh has suffered waves of man-made terror. Terrible natural disasters are too frequent in this nation of 55,126 square miles, about the size of Wisconsin, which is bordered by India and Burma at the bend in the Bay of Bengal. The majority of its population of more than 100 million is crammed onto the islands, most no more than 10 feet above sea level, that speckle the delta. When disaster strikes, there is no high ground upon which to seek refuge. Tidal Waves and Heavy Rains In 1970, a tidal wave killed 300,000 people. In June 1976, heavy rains swept away the homes of 300,000 people and killed at least 143. In April 1977, waves created by a cyclone in the Indian Ocean killed 600 people. In 1980, flooding forced the evacuation of 500,000 people. In 1985, a cyclone killed at least 1,400 and perhaps as many as 10,000. Ainslie Embree, a South Asia specialist at Columbia University, said, ''Man-made disasters are just as consequent as the natural disasters.'' Ever since the 12th century, when Moslem invaders brought Islam to Bengal, which encompasses Bangladesh and eastern India, there has been religious strife with Hindus. Most Bangladeshis are Moslem, with Hindus making up 14 percent of the population. The Moslem rulers were forced out by the British in the 18th century. In 1947, predominantly Hindu India won independence from Britain and a separate Moslem state, Pakistan, was created in two parts, divided by 1,000 miles of Indian territory. The partition evoked ages-old religious enmity, and massacres ensued. Power Centered in West Power in the new Moslem nation was centered in West Pakistan, and by 1968, rioters in the more populous East were demanding autonomy. By 1970, separatists from the East had won a majority in the National Assembly and were pressing for more power. But Assembly sessions were postponed by Agha Yahya Khan, then President, and full-scale civil war erupted. ''Bangladesh suffered greatly during the civil war,'' Dr. Embree said. ''A great many of the intellectuals were killed.'' Dr. Embree said the Pakistani Army killed 100,000 Bangladeshis. With Indian troops invading in support of the separatists, independence was won in December 1971. Then, thousands of Pakistani collaborators were slaughtered. One of the nation's continuing tragedies is the presence on its soil of more than a million people from Bihar State in India. These people, who do not speak Bengali, have remained in refugee camps since independence. ''They want to go to Pakistan, but the Pakistanis won't take them,'' Dr. Embree said. ''They are among the more miserable refugees in the world.'' Demonstrations in November ''While these people are Moslems, they are regarded as foreigners because they don't speak Bengali,'' he said. ''They also supported the Pakistan Government, and so they are regarded as traitors.'' After the nation gained independence, much of its Hindu population fled to India. ''India claims there were 10 million of them,'' Dr. Embree said. Since independence, two presidents have been assassinated, the founder of the nation, Mujibur Rahman, in 1975, and Ziaur Rahman, in 1981. Last November, there were major demonstrations against the Government of President H. M. Ershad, who took power in a military coup in March 1982. General Ershad ended martial law in 1986, retired from the army and successfully ran for election. ''The riots in November just about disrupted the economy completely,'' said Craig Baxter, a professor of South Asian history at Juniata College in Huntingdon, Pa. ''There were strikes, transportation breakdowns, a failure to fulfill international contracts.'' Two Opposition Leaders The demonstrations were led by two principal opposition leaders, Sheik Hasina, the daughter of Mujibur Rahman, and Begum Khaleda Zia, the widow of Ziaur Rahman. President Ershad was re-elected this year after a campaign in which the opposition leaders refused to take part, saying the elections could not be fair. As it has been since its birth, Bangladesh remains one of the poorest countries in the world, primarily because its economy is based on agriculture. ''Most people live at an agricultural subsistence level,'' Dr. Embree said. ''Very little industry has been developed,'' he continued, ''and they have very few exports.'' Jute, which is used to make rope and burlap, is Bangladesh's main export. ''But the world market for jute disappeared in recent years because of plastics and man-made fibers,'' Dr. Embree said. Of necessity, the people have developed a remarkable style of life, trying to adapt to the water that annually sweeps through the country with the monsoon. Many Bangladeshis live in homes built on earthen platforms of four yards or higher and sow varieties of rice that will grow in deep water.

910-> Review/Concert; David Zinman Steps In
David Zinman, whose own Baltimore Symphony is on strike, has become the favored substitute of the moment. He stepped in with the New York Chamber Symphony last weekend, and this week he replaced Seiji Ozawa at the Boston Symphony's three concerts in Carnegie Hall. Mr. Ozawa, detained in Japan because of the death of his wife's mother, had planned to conclude the first concert on Tuesday with Beethoven's Seventh Symphony and to devote the last two, Wednesday night and last night, to Mahler's Ninth. Mr. Zinman chose to conclude all three concerts with Mahler's First. He retained Franz Schmidt's Piano Concerto for the Left Hand on Tuesday, but preceded the Mahler First on the remaining two programs with the Chopin Piano Concerto No. 1. That, in turn, served to introduce the much-talked-about young Soviet pianist Stanislav Bunin, who made his formal North American debut on Wednesday (he played a short private concert for Secretary of State George P. Shultz and other officials in Washington). Mr. Bunin has been talked about because of his competition victories and the quality of his recordings. Born in Moscow in 1966, he comes from a musical family; his grandfather, Genrikh Neigaus, trained Svyatoslav Richter and Emil Gilels, and his mother teaches at the Moscow Conservatory. At 17 years old, he became the youngest winner of the Long-Thibaud Competition in Paris, and two years later he won the Chopin Competition in Warsaw. A recording of his performance there on Deutsche Grammophon received prizes, too, with other DG disks already released or on tap. On the Carnegie Hall stage Wednesday, Mr. Bunin looked studious, rangy and bespectacled in a way that recalled Peter Serkin, and seemed shyly touched by the audience's enthusiasm at the end. His performance, lumpily accompanied by Mr. Zinman and the orchestra, sounded expert and efficient without touching the heart. Mr. Bunin certainly had technical matters down cold and, at times, a whiff of poetry crept into his interpretation. But on the basis of this one performance of this one piece, he seemed uncomfortably close to the stereotype of the international-style young pianist, all technique and precious little personality. Perhaps with other music, under other circumstances, he will make a more distinctive impression. Mr. Zinman's account of the Mahler First produced some lovely sounds, pungent and burnished, even if the Boston players made more bobbles than they usually do. The performance lasted 56 minutes (the score suggests around 50), and while the breadth allowed details to be savored, it sapped the score of some of its driving excitement.

912-> BOMBAY; Despite Slapstick And Wet-Sari Scenes, India's Film Industry Is Losing Some Steam
India's film industry pinned its hopes this year on a big-budget thriller in which the country's most popular matinee idol was trying for a comeback after an unsuccessful foray into politics. But after shattering box-office records in the first week, the movie, ''Shahenshah'' (''King of Kings''), quickly ran out of steam and ended up barely recovering its expenses. It was a setback for Amitabh Bachchan, the rangy and athletic star who had resigned his seat in Parliament to return to the movies, and for an industry struggling to recover from its biggest slump in history. ''Indian movies are in a state of crisis,'' said Uday Row Kavi, editor of Box Office magazine, a leading trade journal. ''We're seeing something comparable to the difficulties experienced by the American cinema in the 1950's after the advent of television. Producers are finding it tougher and tougher to be successful.'' The Indian film business is still the most productive in the world, with a remarkable record of 964 movies produced last year. But only about a third of them made money, compared to at least half of them a decade ago. Indian movies grossed more than $800 million in 1982, but have fallen off to $650 million last year. Today, the film industry has to compete with at least 12 million television sets - three times the number in 1984 - many of them watched by large groups. Videocassette players and pirated tapes are also proliferating, further draining box-office revenues in India and in Africa, the Middle East and other parts of Asia where Indian movies have always pulled in huge audiences. Yet movies continue to be what they always have been, an all-purpose dream engine delivering gaudy three-hour extravaganzas packed with romance, action, fantasy and music. No movie is complete unless it is has a bewildering mixture of narrow escapes, mistaken identities, dream sequences, slapstick comedy, star-crossed lovers, violent brawling, sadistic black-clad villains and elaborate song-and-dance production numbers. Because of censorship, the sex cannot be too explicit, although movies were never the same after the late Raj Kapoor, a beloved actor and director, featured a voluptuous star drenched by a waterfall a few years ago, her diaphanous sari showing every curve. Today's movies often have an obligatory wet-sari scene. Film societies in the West know of the Indian cinema from eloquent masters like Satyajit Ray, but art movies have fallen on even worse times here, with television also drawing away talent. It may be, however, that popular cinema offers a more profound glimpse into the contemporary national psyche. Among other things, Hindi language films reflect the breakdown of folk culture, the rise of a restless urban middle class, disenchantment with government and ambivalence about the increased social interaction of men and women, according to Chidananda Das Gupta, the country's leading movie critic. ''The Hindi film formula not only caters to these denominators, but also helps to create and consolidate them, giving its public certain terms of reference for its cultural adjustment,'' Mr. Das Gupta has written. ''It thus supplies a kind of cultural leadership, and reinforces some of the unifying tendencies in our social and economic changes.'' Indeed, the industry's new strains are themselves sharpening the focus on the society's fears and aspirations. ''All kinds of people used to go to movie theaters,'' said N.N. Sippy, a successful producer. ''You used to see plenty of families and the upper-class gentry. Today the movies are catering to the lower middle-class masses who want action, action, and more action.'' Movies, in other words, are becoming more violent and angry toward the establishment. Mr. Bachchan's extraordinary career as the quintessential ''angry young man'' offers a case in point. He burst on to the scene with ''Sholay'' in 1975, still the most popular film in Indian history, in which he portrayed a sullen thief captured and then enlisted by the police to go after a band of gangsters. By the end of the movie, Mr. Bachchan redeems his promise as a misunderstood outcast by performing as a hero. Repeating the role in more than 50 films, Mr. Bachchan became a national icon despite his patrician upbringing as the son of a prominent poet who was a friend of the Nehru family. All of India went into a convulsion of prayer and grief when Mr. Bachchan fell seriously ill in 1982. It thus seemed perfectly logical for Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, Nehru's grandson, to turn to his childhood friend in 1984 to run for Parliament. Mr. Bachchan was following a tradition established long before the likes of Ronald Reagan. Until recently, the chief ministers of two populous Indian states had been former movie idols. After one of them died earlier this year, a political succession struggle ensued between two of his former co-stars: one his wife, the other his mistress. Today Mr. Bachchan has told some interviewers he regrets mixing show business and politics. Fellow politicians had become angry at what they felt was his use of fan clubs to build up a base separate from the ruling Congress Party, and soon Mr. Bachchan was an easy target for corruption charges. Constantly denying accusations that he had received film earnings under the table and stashed them in bank accounts abroad in violation of Indian currency laws, Mr. Bachchan became a political liability to the Prime Minister and resigned from Parliament in 1987. Film industry officials say that under-the-table payments are routine, but it was not the sort of thing that enhanced the image of a star who had battled corruption on the big screen. In ''Shahenshah,'' Mr. Bachchan attempted his comeback by portraying a bumbling policeman who takes bribes during the day and then wanders the streets at night in a black-leather getup to avenge the people who made the payoffs. Some critics assailed the film as representing a ''fascist ideology.'' Its opening became a major political event, but afterward Mr. Bachchan passed up the chance to run again for the seat he had given up. Despite the limited success of ''Shahenshah,'' Mr. Bachchan is still regarded as the country's most bankable movie star, and his formula shows no sign of going out of style. Reflecting a growing public anger and frustration over inefficiency and corruption in law enforcement and government, almost every Hindi movie today has a corrupt cop who sees the light in some fashion and takes the law into his own hands. When will the public's thirst for anti-establishment action be sated? Mr. Kavi, the editor of Box Office, said he had recently detected a resurgence in popularity of simple love stories without violence. Whatever the economic and thematic trends, popular movies are certain to continue reflecting a part of India's definition of itself. Rising costs may force a smaller scale but the vision will probably stay outsized. ''The industry will find its own new level,'' Mr. Kavi said. ''You cannot imagine India without its movies.''

913-> Trade Bill, Facing a Veto, Goes to White House Today
A sweeping trade bill, cleared by both houses of Congress last month but delayed by procedural wrangling over Alaskan oil, will go to the White House Wednesday, the Congressional leadership agreed today. The decision sets the stage for an expected White House veto, perhaps this week. A White House official spoke of a ''24- to 48-hour turnaround'' because of President Reagan's intention to seek speedy enactment of a second trade bill. The President has said he would veto the present trade bill because of a provision requiring 60 days' notice before companies close factories or make large layoffs. The President's advisers have indicated that he would sign the bill if Congress dropped that measure, along with another provision setting what White House lawyers say are unconstitutional limits on exports of oil from Alaska. Assuming that a veto is sustained, Congressional analysts said, the faster it is done, the greater the chances for a second trade bill. Congressional Democrats had tried to get both chambers to eliminate the Alaska provision. They succeeded in the House last week but failed in the Senate, where Republicans withheld the unanimous consent necessary to get the proposal to the floor. Alaska's Senators Wooed Democrats hoped that deleting the Alaska clause would help them to head off the threatened veto or else to gain enough votes to override the veto. Alaska's two Republican senators - Ted Stevens and Frank H. Murkowski - voted against the bill. Although Senator Murkowski has declined to comment, he was widely reported ready to switch if the Alaska restrictions were deleted. Senator Stevens has said he would stick with the President. The Senate minority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, told members today that the Republicans had a number of objections to bringing up the Alaska resolution. The Senate majority leader, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, said, ''There are those who believe that if the President vetoes this bill, it can make a quick turnaround. It's obvious that, while the House can do a quick turnaround, the Senate will call up amendments.'' Complications in Senate Later he remarked to reporters that nine Senate committees were drafting the alternative legislation and that the Senate's rules governing debate and amendments were not nearly as strict as those in the House. The Alaska provision was incorporated as a result of lobbying by maritime unions. It would limit exports to 70,000 barrels of refined products daily. It would also allow 50,000 barrels of crude oil a day to be shipped to Canada - but only after being sent in American ships to a United States port before proceeding to Canada.

917-> FUTURES/OPTIONS; Price of Oil Tumbles on Output Fear
Oil prices fell 55 cents a barrel, or nearly 4 percent, in futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday, as dealers grew increasingly apprehensive about the rise in oil output made possible by the end of the Iran-Iraq war. In contracts for delivery next month, the price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude, the United States benchmark, closed at $14.24, the lowest price since late 1986. ''There's just too much oil out there,'' said Peter C. Beutel of Elders Futures. ''Demand is great, demand is wonderful, but supply is just getting out of hand.'' He said prices could go below $10 a barrel. Charles T. Maxwell, the vice chairman of Cyrus J. Lawrence, said the demand picture would not stay strong. ''The world economy is not on an upswing,'' he said. ''If anything, it is in a slow letdown.'' North Sea Brent crude also dropped, by 50 cents a barrel. Tumbled on Little News The oil markets often show substantial movement in response to events of only modest significance, and yesterday the market tumbled on nearly no news at all. ''Nothing is coming out of OPEC,'' said Sharokh Nikkah, the vice president of futures at Shearson Lehman Brothers. Subroto, the Secretary General of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, traveled to Iran and Iraq in recent days to seek a new agreement between them on oil output. The countries, two of OPEC's largest members, have stopped shooting at each other, but Iraq is demanding a production quota as large as Iran's and is not observing its quota. ''Everybody was hopeful Mr. Subroto would make some progress,'' Mr. Nikkah said. ''But nothing is being done regarding the Iran-Iraq parity issue, and the problem of overproduction by other members can't be addressed before this is addressed.'' OPEC's production ceiling is 15.06 million barrels a day, not counting Iraq, but analysts' estimates of production now run as high as 20 million. In addition, both countries need more revenue to rebuild after the war, and bigger sales are a way to raise income. What's Boosting Production Other members are also seeking more income. Collectively, OPEC countries spent $9.6 billion more last year than they took in from exports, according to a recent report by the Petroleum Finance Company, a Washington-based consulting firm. The group's collective deficit will approach $18 billion this year, the company estimates. All these factors promote higher production volumes. Analysts also point to especially high stocks of oil on hand, which tend to depress prices. In addition, some long-term trends do not bode well for oil prices, some analysts said. Mr. Maxwell of Cyrus J. Lawrence also said that there are cheaper sources of energy, like coal, and, in some countries, nuclear power. ''Every time a new French nuclear plant comes on, it displaces fuel oil,'' he said. ''Gas, coal and nuclear are terribly competitive and tend to take market share from oil.'' Special Meeting Possible Mr. Maxwell said that if the current trend of overproduction leads to a price collapse, OPEC will probably call a special meeting and institute a more effective production quota system. More likely, he said, and more desirable from the point of view of consumers, was that prices would not drop drastically, and the status quo would prevail for months. Mr. Maxwell and others also point out that non-OPEC production worldwide is increasing, although this is not the case in the United States.

918-> Answering The Mail
Q. We left a yellow rubber bath mat in the bottom of our tub for a couple of months. When we picked it up we found that it has left a yellow stain which we cannot seem to remove. We tried scouring powder, then tried rubbing with fine steel wool, but the latter left a gray stain, probably because of the tub's age (34 years). Is there any kind of rubber dissolving chemical I can try that might remove the stain without causing further wear of the thin enamel? A. The steel wool was a mistake; you may have scratched through the enamel or porcelain finish. Try scrubbing with Zud, a cleanser sold in hardware stores, supermarkets and plumbing supply outlets. It works exceptionally well on plumbing fixtures. If this doesn't do the trick, try covering the stain with a piece of turkish towel and soak this with a bleach solution - one part laundry bleach to three parts water. Let this sit for an hour, then remove the toweling and rinse with water. Q. My house is built on a sloping piece of property so the driveway is quite steep. This driveway is blacktop and applying a sealer can make it very slippery. What can I do to get maximum traction on a driveway like this? A. The most common way to solve this problem is to mix coarse sand or similar aggregate in with the sealer when you apply it. This will create a gritty surface that will help improve traction. The sand will tend to wear off quicker than sealer alone, but to keep the sand from wearing off so quickly many find it helpful to apply a second coat of sealer on top of the sanded finish after the first coat has dried. Questions about home repair should be addressed to Bernard Gladstone, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York, N.Y. 10036. Questions of general interest will be answered in this column; unpublished letters cannot be answered individually.

919-> THE DEMOCRATS IN ATLANTA; Dukakis Ancestral Village Erupts in Music and Dance
The village president raised his hands in a victory sign and told the jubulant residents today that Michael S. Dukakis had formally won the Democratic Presidential nomination in the United States. ''The only thing that remains is Nov. 8, Election Day,'' said the official of this Aegean island village, Constantine Stephanou. ''But you all know what Nov. 8 means in our own history and tradition. It means that Dukakis, one of our own boys, just cannot lose.'' The crowd roared, the band renewed its playing and, as is customary at such festivities, plates were smashed at the feet of residents dancing to the frenzied rhythm of the bouzouki, accordion and fiddle players. Pelopi, the Dukakis hometown before the family emigrated to the United States at the start of World War I, was in the midst of an all-night fiesta to celebrate Governor Dukakis's formal nomination as the Democratic candidate for President. Feast Day of Island's Saints Nov. 8 is deeply rooted in the religious tradition and history of Lesbos, one of the largest islands in the eastern Aegean. It is the feast day of the island's saints and spiritural protectors, the archangels Michael and Gabriel. It is also ''independence day;'' on Nov. 8, 1912, the island was liberated from Turkish rule. ''November 8 is also Michael's name day here,'' said the village priest, the Rev. Eleftherios Karmiris. ''In Greece it is the custom for the person celebrating to offer a small gift to his friends and relatives. The gift we are expecting from him on his saint's day is the honor of winning the Presidency of America.'' This small mountain village of 600 inhabitants in the northwestern corner of Lesbos is already deeply affected by its ties to the Dukakis family history. Mr. Dukakis has been declared honorary president of the village; plots of land have been granted to him for a home and for growing watermelons, his favorite food, according to the residents, and the dirt-and-cement street has been named after him. A signpost at the entrance of the village reads: ''Welcome to the home town of Michael Dukakis.'' Funds Sought for Paving People here take it for granted that Mr. Dukakis will win the election and the village is preparing for a flood of American visitors. Funds have been requested from the Greek Government for paving the dirt road leading to the village in anticipation of thousands of automobiles. Residents are also talking of hotels, taverns and shops they will have to establish to cater to the American visitors. Even the local village bard, Leftheris Yannakos, has been inspired to pour out rhymes and lyrics for poems and folk songs eulogizing the Greek-American ''compatriot.'' ''The village has suddenly been put on the world map,'' said Alexander Chiotellis, who, as a second cousin, is Mr. Dukakis's closest relative on Lesbos and served as host to the Governor on his only visit here in 1976. ''Who on earth knew of this village before? Now it is becoming a sort of pilgrimage for the international press and American tourists.'' A major focus of attention here is the ancestral home of the Dukakis family, once a stone-and-wood shack owned by Mr. Dukakis's grandfather, Stelios, and the home of MIchael Dukakis's father, Panos. It was bought and rebuilt in 1933 by Jacob Manolis, the present occupant. Now a metal plaque outside the house reads, in English: ''The home of the Dukakis family.''

920-> Mother on Trial in 2 Deaths Had Postpartum Psychosis, Lawyer Says
A former pediatric nurse charged with smothering two of her children and trying to kill the third was not responsible for her actions because she suffered from a severe postpartum psychosis, her lawyer said yesterday. The lawyer, Michael Dowd, said the psychosis drove the nurse, Ann Green, to smother the children when they were a few days old. ''There was a deep-seated mental illness that was chronic and had existed for quite some time,'' Mr. Dowd told a jury in opening statements in Mrs. Green's trial in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. ''She found herself in the child's bedroom, as if she was watching someone else do something to the baby that she loved,'' Mr. Dowd said. ''We are asking you to find her not responsible for reason of mental disease or defect.'' Incident With Third Child Mrs. Green, 43 years old, who formerly worked in the pediatrics unit at New York Hospital, was charged in 1986 with two counts of second-degree murder in connection with the children's deaths in 1980 and 1982, when both were newborns. One child, Patricia, died in 1980 when she was 5 days old. The other, Jamie, died when he was 3 weeks. Mrs. Green, who sat quietly in court, with her husband, Larry, a few rows behind her, was also charged with the attempted murder of their third child, Larry Jr., who stayed in the hospital three weeks after his birth to be checked for medical problems, said the assistant district attorney prosecuting the case, Marybeth Richroath. Less than a day after his release, Ms. Richroath said, Mrs. Green tried to smother him with a pillow at home at 1303 York Avenue. ''He was a normal healthy baby boy,'' Ms. Richroath told the jury, adding that the other two were, as well. ''Now there was a new diagnosis, child abuse.'' On Aug. 22, 1985, while Larry Jr. was recovering in New York Hospital, Mrs. Green ''admitted to her husband that she had smothered each of the children with a pillow,'' Ms. Richroath said. ''She said: 'I did it. I did it. I know I did it.' '' Ms. Richroath told the jury that the trial would show that Mrs. Green, who is free on $125,000 bail, ''did not suffer from any mental disease or defect that would prevent her from knowing what she did.'' Mr. Dowd maintained that an undetected mental disorder, coupled with Mrs. Green's childhood, in which ''she was repressed in many ways,'' made her not responsible for her actions. When her children were born, he said, their crying set off feelings of failure. ''She became obsessed with a feeling of inadequacy,'' he said. A psychiatric evaluation by doctors at New York University Hospital in 1985 found that Mrs. Green was ''socially, emotionally and morally immature,'' he said. ''Her personality, functioning under stress, was that of a young child,'' Mr. Dowd added.

922-> Bridgeport Starts to Scale Down and Remodel Its 'Model Housing' Complex
When it was built in 1941, Father Panik Village, with more than 1,000 apartments in 42 buildings on 40 acres on the East Side, was hailed as a national model of public housing for the poor. Mayor Jasper McLevy called its construction ''the biggest event in the history of Bridgeport.'' Now, Father Panik Village has become a different symbol, representing what some people see as everything that is wrong with large public housing projects and Bridgeport itself. City officials have called the decaying project a magnet for drug dealing and lawlessness. They said it was a blight that discouraged new businesses from going to Connecticut's largest city, which has yet to share in the prosperity that has spread over the rest of Fairfield County. Taking a leaf from the domestic automobile industry of a decade ago, Bridgeport officials are preparing to scale down the size of Father Panik, as the project is known, by scattering some residents to other sections. Eventually, the officials plan to demolish most of the blood-red three-story brick buildings and rebuild the project at about half its present size. Resistance in Two Areas The first phase, moving 69 families from Father Panik to three vacant apartment buildings in other parts of the city, has led to angry outbursts. Residents of the racially mixed South End, where 14 families from Father Panik are to be relocated, are fighting the decision, saying their neighborhood already has three other public housing projects, with 700 families. Some residents of the predominantly white North End said they would oppose any effort to move tenants from Father Panik into their area. But Mayor Thomas W. Bucci said: ''No one has the right to build barriers around their neighborhood, around their community, to exclude other law-abiding men, women and children. We will not pander to those attitudes.'' Some residents of the predominantly black and Hispanic Father Panik Village said they were being unfairly stigmatized and did not want to move. At a recent backyard meeting on Atlantic Street, 70 residents of the South End peppered the executive director of the Housing Authority, Clarence H. Craig Jr., with questions about the agency's purchase of a recently completed 14-unit building across the street for Father Panik families. Empty Units in North End ''We do not object to people from Father Panik Village,'' Charles Campbell, a resident, said. ''What we are saying is the South End, with its multiracial, multi-ethnic composition, already has its fair share of public housing.'' Another resident, Theresa Sharp, drew loud applause when she listed vacant apartment buildings in the North End. Mr. Craig said that he was committed to the relocation and that his agency was considering other sites in other areas, including the North End. Rehabilitating Father Panik Village is viewed by some officials as the key to revitalizing this working-class city of 143,000 people, of whom 40 percent are black and Hispanic people. ''It is the most important development project the city has on the table for the city's future growth,'' Mayor Bucci said. Relocation and Rebuilding United States Representative Christopher Shays, who has continued the efforts begun by his predecessor, the late Stewart B. McKinney, to obtain Federal approval for the rebuilding, called Father Panik ''one of the worst housing projects in the country.'' ''It is extremely large and it dominates Bridgeport and peoples' impressions of Bridgeport,'' Mr. Shays said. ''For Bridgeport to turn around, it has to come to grips with Father Panik Village.'' The Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development has committed $36 million to relocate 300 residents and rebuild 210 units. About $7 million will be spent to buy the three buildings - the 14 units on Atlantic Street, a 33-unit building on Boston Avenue on the East Side and a 22-unit building on Norman Street on the West Side - from developers. Officials hope to complete the purchases this month and move the first tenants in September. The complex is named for the Rev. Stephen J. Panik, a Roman Catholic priest who crusaded for better housing for the poor here until he died in 1953. Drugs at Night ''It served its purpose in the beginning, but now with all the other social ills that have come along in today's society, a complex of that size and magnitude is not for today,'' Mr. Craig said in an interview. Most residents are law-abiding, officials said. The crime problem, they said, has worsened because people from other areas go to the project at night, when most residents lock themselves in their apartments, to buy and sell drugs in the dark stairwells, which cannot be seen from the street and are difficult for the police to patrol. The vice president of the Father Panik tenants' association, Kathleen Vila, said of the project where she has lived for most of her 44 years: ''It does get an unfair reputation. Most of the people who do things here don't live here. They'll give their address as a vacant apartment, and the police and others assume they live here. They make us the scapegoats. It's mostly the outsiders.''

923-> Nations Left and Right Know to Trust I.C.R.C.
To the Editor: We were amazed to read the statement in an April 18 news story (''Contras Spurn Proposal by Sandinistas'') that the Nicaraguan contras oppose receiving food, clothing and medicine from the International Committee of the Red Cross because it ''works closely with the Sandinista Government,'' and as a result ''they do not trust'' it. Leaving aside the question of whether the I.C.R.C. would accept to play such a role, this statement says more about the contras than about the I.C.R.C. If the contras really believe that the I.C.R.C. is an ally of the Nicaraguan Government in its war effort, they could not be more wrong. In fact, the I.C.R.C. is the quintessential neutral organization. Its mandate, based on the Geneva Conventions, is to protect and help prisoners of war and wounded soldiers, civilian internees, inhabitants of occupied territories, and political detainees and their families, without telling the world about the conditions in which it finds them. The principal reason why the I.C.R.C. is able to conduct such sensitive work as visiting political prisoners in countries as varied as South Africa, Indonesia, El Salvador and Nicaragua, is because of its nearly obsessive discretion and neutrality. While nations both left and right have learned that they can trust the I.C.R.C. to provide assistance without taking sides, there are a few countries which refuse to cooperate with the agency. Not until last January did Guatemala finally allow the I.C.R.C. to set up operations there; negotiations are under way to establish an I.C.R.C. presence in Cuba as well. It is usually assumed that refusals come from governments which have a lot to hide. One can't help but draw that conclusion about the contras. ANNE MANUEL, JUAN E. MENDEZ Washington, April 22, 1988 The writers are, respectively, reports editor and Washington office director of Americas Watch.

924-> Jobs Even More Out of Aliens' Reach
Immigrants having trouble getting work because employment of illegal aliens is prohibited are now finding it even harder because of a Federal crackdown on their makeshift hiring halls: street corners. But several cities and churches in Southern California are exploring ways to help the workers find jobs. Street-corner groups of men looking for landscaping, construction or other work paying $2 to $10 an hour and often lasting only a day have rapidly grown this summer as immigration authorities began to enforce a ban on employing illegal aliens that is part of the 1986 overhaul of immigration laws. But immigration agents have arrested more than 600 illegal day workers in recent weeks in Orange and Los Angeles counties and have warned 72 employers that they could be fined and their vehicles confiscated for hiring and transporting illegal aliens. Immigration officials say the crackdown on street hiring has cut the crowds in half. 'I Have to Work' Immigrants and those helping them say, however, that the ranks of immigrants needing work is still growing. They say employers seeking quick and cheap labor still hire illegal aliens because the workers are even more desperate for jobs and will take lower pay. ''I have to work,'' said an illegal alien who was among dozens on a heavily traveled Redondo Beach street the other day, despite a law banning hiring of laborers from street corners. He said he was supporting six children he had left behind in Guatemala. ''It's very bad there,'' he said. In Los Angeles, two Roman Catholic churches have become sanctuaries and informal hiring sites for illegal workers. Priests contend that the aliens have a right to work. Costa Mesa, in Orange County, plans to open a city-run hiring hall soon for workers who are legal residents. Glendale is considering a similar plan as well as a law like Redondo Beach's. The No. 1 Destination Southern California is the No. 1 destination of Latin American immigrants. In the seven-county Los Angeles district of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, 910,270 illegal aliens applied for legal status under the 1986 immigration law, which was intended to discourage illegal immigration. Nationwide, 1.4 million applied. Thousands of illegal aliens ineligible for amnesty have continued to arrive, and some aliens already here have been fired by employers who fear sanctions. The street-corner groups mushroomed. John Brechtel, assistant director for the Los Angeles District of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, said: ''Corners that used to have 15 or 20 men now had 200 or 300.''The agency is flooded with complaints from businesses and residents of harassment and littering by the workers, he said. Aliens Arrested to Go Home The agency found in a survey that 90 percent of the street-corner job seekers were illegal immigrants. Nearly all of the more than 600 arrested in raids in the last month have agreed to return to their homes in Mexico or Central America, immigration officials said. The workers' supporters criticize the street-corner crackdown. ''It's frightening people away from the employment they are best able to do,'' said Sister Annette Debs, a Roman Catholic nun who is an immigration lawyer at the Community Law Center in Santa Ana, in Orange County. Disputing immigration service figures, she says only half, rather than 90 percent, of the day laborers are illegal aliens. The Rev. Michael E. Kennedy of Our Lady Queen of Angels, a Roman Catholic church in downtown Los Angeles, predicted that the law would ''eventually self-destruct on its own.'' ''The immigration law is a burden to our economy,'' he said. ''These men do jobs no one else will do. A city like Los Angeles needs slave labor - that's the only way to put it.'' Havens for Day Workers His church and the nearby Delores Mission have become overnight havens and hiring halls for over 400 illegal Hispanic day workers. Immigration officials declined to comment on the sanctuaries. No action has been taken against them, although it is illegal to harbor illegal aliens. In Costa Mesa, meanwhile, city officials have given initial approval to converting an unused filling station into a hiring hall for day laborers, said Cheryl A. Friedling, the project coordinator. The hall is intended to replace the current gathering place, a city park in a middle-class neighborhood where 100 workers congregate daily. 'Employers Won't Use It' By October, she said, the new center will open with a system, as yet undetermined, to weed out illegal aliens as well as employers trying to skirt the law. The plan has drawn praise, but Carlos R. Holguin, general counsel for the National Center for Immigrants Rights, said: ''Employers won't use it. They know the legal immigrants there will demand higher wages.'' He said ''the enlightened policy'' would be to discourage exploitation of illegal workers by assuring them of rights no different from other workers. Subminimum wages and few or no benefits are key reasons that employers hire illegal workers, he said. A spokesman for Mayor Tom Bradley of Los Angeles said the Mayor's aides were examining whether a city-run hiring hall would work. Two weeks ago, the City Council of Glendale, a city of 160,000 people bordering Los Angeles, deferred a ban on street-corner hiring and instructed the city manager, David H. Ramsey, to propose other solutions. ''We are sympathetic with the desire of people to work,'' Mr. Ramsey said. ''A public street is just not the place to look for it.''

925-> A Week After Clash, Protestors Hold Quiet Thompkins Sq. Rally
A week after bloody riots despoiled the streets of the East Village, hundreds of people gathered in a cleaned-up and sun-dappled Tompkins Square Park yesterday for a peaceful rally of defiant speeches and a marathon of amplified rock music. Shortly before 11 P.M., after the music ended, about 150 chanting protesters marched west on St. Mark's Place from the park,At Astor Place, the first contingent of 90 helmeted police appeared and escorted the marchers as they continued to Fifth Avenue, then turned south and ended up outside Washington Square Park. Metal police barricades and another contingent of 80 officers, equipped with plastic riot shields, prevented the marchers from entering the park.But there was no violence, and no one was arrested. The protesters marched around the park twice, with a detour in front of the building on Washington Place where Mayor Koch maintains an apartment. The Mayor was not there. About 12:15 A.M. today, the marchers went back to Tompkins Square Park. The police contingent that had followed them then disbanded. The crowd of about 500 who had gathered earlier yesterday in Tompkins Square Park included East Village residents, punk-rockers with spiked hair, beer-swigging teen-agers, civil libertarians, middle-aged hippies, church representatives, folk singers and others who wanted to express their disapproval of the police. But with police officers maintaining a discreet presence, the mood in the park was one of quiet protest, in sharp contrast to the raging violence that racked the area last week in bottle-throwing, nightstick-flailing melees that left 44 injured and 9 under arrest. After a languid morning whiled away by homeless people sleeping on benches, old men playing cards and city workers and volunteers sprucing up the park, the day's loosely planned events began at midafternoon with a three-block march of about 100 people from Cooper Union Square to the park to protest the violent police role. Chanting ''March with us! Free the park!'' and ''Koch is the puppet of landlords and bankers,'' the protesters, flanked by officers on foot and in patrol cars, marched along St. Mark's Place. Then at a bandshell in the center of the park, speakers criticized the police, Mayor Koch, Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward and gentrification of the area around the park, which is bounded by Avenues A and B and East 7th and 10th Streets. ''Where is Benjamin Ward?'' wondered Marie Dormuth, a college art teacher who lives in Greenwich Village. ''He's probably on Fire Island. It's embarrassing that there isn't at least one police representative here.'' During the rally, held under a banner proclaiming ''Gentrification Is Class War,'' some people watched a television screen showing a videotape of 1960's riots in the United States. Park Unusually Clean As the speech-making ended, the music began. At least 20 hard-rock groups, all booked long before last week's violence, wailed away until about 11 P.M., when the concert ended peacefully and the march toward Washington Square Park began. Those who attended yesterday's activities in Tompkins Square Park found freshly cut grass and an unusually clean appearance. A crew of three dozen volunteers and Parks Department employees had swept the sidewalks, picked up litter and debris, raked up leaves and twigs and mowed the knee-high grass. A Day of Changing Moods It was a day of contrasts that began with the laid-back symbols and moods of the 1960's and moved like the sun sailing across decades in an afternoon into the hard-edged 1980's. It might have been the mid-60's early in the day as folk singers with guitars offered up renditions of ''This Land Is Your Land,'' and people wearing T-shirts emblazoned with peace insignias sang ''We Shall Overcome.'' Later, the skinheads began to appear with their silver-spiked leather garb, Mohawk haircuts and hard eyes, the music was turned up and piped through amplifiers to the hard acidic beat of the 80's and the sense of conciliation faded. The change was evident to a gray-haired, 75-year-old woman named Betty, who said she had lived in the area for 46 years. ''During the day, it's easier,'' she said. ''But at night, the weirdos come out with those funny hairdos. We want to sit in peace, as we did years ago, but they play their instruments and use their four-letter words. It's very disconcerting for old people.'' During the afternoon, the New York Civil Liberties Union handed out information on how to file complaints against police officers. Shortly after 8 P.M., a man in his late 20's claimed that he had been beaten by a police officer who approached him as he slept on a park bench. The man, James Lerke, of 103 Avenue A, said the unidentified officer first struck the bench with his nightstick and then struck Mr. Lerke, leaving him with a bloody gash beneath his right eye. At least one witness disputed Mr. Lerke's claim, asserting that the cut had been noticeable hours before the attack allegedly took place. But others corroborated the account, and an official of the New York Civil Liberties Union said his group would help Mr. Lerke file a complaint.

926-> Two Views on a Schism in the Middle East
The drama of Israeli-Arab relations is played out every day on American television. Bits and pieces emerge in sound and color. ''Worldview,'' on the CUNY cable channel today and tonight at 11 A.M., 4 P.M. and 9 P.M., tries to make the bits and pieces fall in place. It makes no concessions to viewers; some stretches are long and leaden. Stay with it the full two hours, however, and you will be enriched. ''Worldview'' - produced by the Council on Foreign Relations and City University of New York Television - uses an ancient format: people sit at a table and discuss issues. The series is about words and not pictures. The words tonight are about the demonstrations on the West Bank and in Gaza. In the first half-hour, Howard Squadron, the honorary chairman of the American Jewish Congress, is questioned; in the next half-hour, Rashid Khalidi, a Palestinian-American who teaches history at the University of Chicago, takes his place. The final hour features Benjamin Netanyahu, the former Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations. There are no heated confrontations. Loosely speaking, everyone shares the same framework of values. ''Worldview'' assumes that reasonable people can work things out. Political divisions are real, but they can be narrowed through intelligent discussion. The assumption may be optimistic; certainly it is civilized. On tonight's program, Dr. Khalidi says the outside world makes too much of the differences among Palestinian leaders. Basically, he says, they are politicians who ''all follow certain rules of the game.'' He also insists that Palestinians, whatever their differences, think of themselves as ''one people.'' Mr. Netanyahu, in a way, says much the same thing about Israelis. He says it is ''unrealistic'' to expect Israel to make major moves before the November elections. After the elections, he says, there will be ''a clearing of the air.'' Nonetheless, he says, this won't lead to a fundamental shift in policy or to weaking of Israel's sovereignty. Mr. Netanyahu says he feels disdain for ostensibly sympathetic Americans who say they know what's best for Israel. Israel, he declares, knows what's best for itself. Mr. Netanyahu becomes specific: Yasir Arafat, head of the Palestine Liberation Organization, he says, is not ''reformable''; Israel must maintain military control west of the Jordan River; Stinger missiles are a new Middle East threat. ''Worldview,'' moderated by Margaret Osmer of the Council on Foreign Relations, won't cheer you up, but it will tell you what's at stake.

927-> A Triumph for Poor Children
Stop for a moment and consider what a wonderful thing Governor Cuomo and the New York Legislature have now accomplished by enacting the Governor's Liberty Scholarship program. Forget all the passing urgencies of the moment; 10 and 20 years from now, this is one act that New Yorkers will remember, and with gratitude. The program is actually three programs. The centerpiece is Liberty Scholarships, financial assistance to help students finish high school and go on to college. A second part is Liberty Partnerships, providing dropout prevention services to students at risk, starting in the seventh grade. The third component is a hefty increase in the state's Tuition Assistance Program. When fully funded, these three programs will add $261 million a year to existing dropout prevention and college assistance programs. Liberty Scholarships will provide full nontuition assistance, including room and board and books, to students from poor and near-poor families, with incomes less than 130 percent of the poverty level. The program will also assist students from families with incomes up to 250 percent of the poverty level - or about $20,000 net taxable income. A $91 million Liberty Scholarship allocation will underwrite nontuition expenses for 94,000 students a year at colleges throughout the state - and students who can only attend part time will be eligible. The program begins in September 1991. Liberty Partnerships will be a $36 million a year grant program administered by the State Department of Education; it also takes effect in September 1989. Grants will go to colleges and community-based organizations that will provide support services, including intensive counseling of students at high risk of dropping out. These services would go to some 60,000 students a year. Enlarged tuition assistance will complement the scholarship program. Every Liberty Scholar will be eligible to receive up to $4,125 a year to attend any accredited college in the state, up from the current maximum of $2,850. Increased tuition assistance will be available on a sliding scale to all high school graduates with net taxable family income under $50,500. The current Tuition Assistance Program will be augmented by $136 million a year, phased in beginning in the fall of 1989. It took six arduous months for the Governor and the Legislature to hammer out this generous education package. The benefits, to students, parents and employers, will be evident for years.

928-> Computerland Going Public After Year of Restructuring
The Computerland Corporation, the nation's largest chain of computer stores, is planning an initial public offering of 5 million shares of its stock, to be priced at $16 to $19 a share. The preliminary prospectus, released Thursday after the registration statement was filed, sheds light on the operations of a company that has a rocky history. Among other things, it indicates that Computerland is growing more slowly than many of its competitors and that it lost money last year because of write-downs related to discontinued operations. The shares to be offered represent a 31.4 percent stake in the Hayward, Calif., company, which has 739 stores, mainly franchised, in the United States and abroad. Some 3.4 million shares will be sold by the company. The remaining 1.6 million shares will be sold by the company's founder, William H. Millard, and his wife, Patricia, who were ousted from management of the company in 1985 by a revolt of franchisees. The Millards, who would net $25 million if the stock sells for $16 a share, would still own 3.9 million shares, or 24.6 percent, of Computerland after the stock offering, but all of those shares are in trusts pending the outcome of two lawsuits in which outside investors assert that they are owed a stake in Computerland. In the main case, a jury ruled in 1985 that Mr. Millard had to surrender a 20 percent stake in the company to an investor group called Micro/ Vest and pay $141 million in damages. The 3.5 million shares that Micro/ Vest could end up winning would be worth $56 million at a price of $16 a share. An investor group led by the Warburg Pincus Capital Company now owns slightly more than 50 percent of the company. The offering is being managed by Salomon Brothers, Merrill Lynch Capital Markets and Volpe & Covington, a small San Francisco-based investment banking firm. The company is planning to go public at a time when many computer retailers are doing extremely well and at a time when the market seems to be receptive. In the last two months, Egghead Software and Babbage's Inc., two software retailers, have made successful public offerings. However, Charles Wolf, personal computer analyst at the First Boston Corporation, said Computerland might have trouble getting the price it is seeking. He estimated that even the $16 price, the low end of the proposed range, would represent a higher multiple of next year's earnings than investors are now paying for stock in such premier retailers as Businessland Inc. ''I don't see how they can sell at a premium to Businessland,'' Mr. Wolf said. Businessland has been growing far more rapidly than Computerland and has steady growth, he said, while Computerland has a spotty history. Moreover, Businessland is a company-owned chain, which usually commands a higher premium than franchise operations, which are riskier. Revenues From Royalties Computerland's network of stores sold $1.7 billion of computer goods in its fiscal year ended last Sept. 30. The Computerland Corporation, however, derives its revenues and net income from royalties it collects from franchisees, and the royalty rates have been reduced in the last few years under pressure from franchisees. In the latest fiscal year, the corporation's net revenues totaled $92.4 million, up from $85.4 million a year earlier but well below a peak of $110.3 million the year before that, before the royalty rates were cut. The company had a net loss of $3.3 million in the latest fiscal year. For the first eight months of the present year, it earned $5.6 million, or 45 cents a share, versus $2.5 million, or 20 cents a share, a year earlier. The prospectus discloses that Computerland took a write-down of $16 million in the recent year and a $5.3 million write-down in May to cover the sale or closure of company-owned stores, which had been unprofitable. Earnings from continuing operations, however, have grown 60 percent, to $10.9 million in the first eight months of the present fiscal year.

929-> 3 Dead in Explosion of Car Bomb Near Israel's Embassy in Cyprus
A car loaded with dynamite blew up about 200 yards from the Israeli Embassy here today after the police prevented the driver from parking at the embassy building. The car's driver and two Cypriots were killed in the explosion and 15 others were wounded, the police said. The embassy's press officer, Ben Matiatu, said no one in the embassy had been hurt. The police said the car had been rigged with about 300 pounds of dynamite. ''It is clear the embassy was the intended target of the car bomb,'' Interior Minister Christodoulos Veniamin said. A police statement said the driver of the car, a Mitsubishi Pajero, had tried twice to park outside the four-story embassy but was told by the police that he had to move. When they asked for his identification, the driver sped away, but the car collided with another at an intersection and the dynamite exploded. Car's Owner Is Arrested The owner of the car, a Lebanese, had been riding in it but ran out just before the explosion. He was arrested and ''is expected to assist police in their investigations,'' Mr. Veniamin said. Police officials identified the arrested man as Omar Ahmad Hawillo, 28 years old, a student at a Nicosia college who had arrived from Lebanon on March 21. He is to appear in court Thursday. The car was blown apart by the explosion, and four other vehicles were set afire. The police said a briefcase containing a remote-control detonating device had been found about 200 yards from where the car exploded. Windows were shattered in the area, and some of the embassy's windows were blown out. An anonymous caller telephoned a Middle East bureau of NBC to claim responsibility for the explosion today in the name of the Palestinian terrorist Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabry al-Banna. The authenticity of the call could not be confirmed. The explosion took place less than a month after Abu Jihad, the Palestine Liberation Organization's military chief, was killed in Tunis in an attack widely assumed to have been the work of Israeli commandos. P.L.O. Condemns Attack Palestinian groups have pledged to avenge that assassination. But the P.L.O.'s office in Nicosia issued a statement today denying involvement in the explosion. It said it ''strongly condemns this ugly crime.'' In addition to the Abu Jihad killing, P.L.O. officials have said Israel was involved in a bombing on Feb. 13 in Limassol, Cyprus, that killed three P.L.O. officials. Israel has denied involvement in that attack. The police here said the two Cypriots killed in the blast today were a woman who was trapped in her burning car and a pedestrian, Andreas Frangos, a retired diplomat. Two earlier bomb attacks, in 1979 and 1984, were staged against the Israeli Embassy here. They caused slight damage and no casualties.

931-> IN THE NATION; Lost in the Stars
You don't have to consult astrologers to know which way the stars in their courses are pointing us. As if there were not already enough greed, exploitation and sheer vulgarity in the world, ponder these recent additions: Shades of Bhopal. The remarkable skill of the crew and the near-incredible bravery of the passengers on that Aloha Airlines jet whose roof blew off in midair last week had barely brought them all safely to earth on Maui when lawyers apparently moved in. William McCorrister, president of the Hawaii State Bar Association, said he had reports that Honolulu lawyers had been prompt to seek fees from what was otherwise a story of great credit to the human race. ''We've had various unconfirmed reports of attorney solicitations, including reports that attorneys were down at the Interisland terminal attempting to hand out cards to relatives of the victims,'' Mr. McCorrister told The Honolulu Advertiser. ''We have not been able to confirm the reports but we have enough to investigate the claims and assist the Office of Disciplinary Council'' of the Hawaii Supreme Court. The bar president took out paid advertisements to remind those who were part of the epic landing that it's their decision whether or not to hire a lawyer and bring suit. What's the Hurry? Far from the glassy skyscrapers and grinding traffic of Honolulu, progress is ready to strike the quiet and isolated Hawaiian island of Lanai - now boasting 2,200 people, 1 doctor, 996 telephones, a part-time barber and the world's biggest pineapple plantation. Two upscale hotels, with rooms at $250 and $350 a night, will be built at a cost of $225 million and will provide about 700 jobs. One hotel will overlook Manele Bay, now a secluded harbor in a conservation area and much favored by island boat people for weekend excursions. I spent a day or two on Lanai last year, after a 16-hour sail from Oahu, and found it one of the more peaceful and pleasant places of my experience. But the islanders are expected to welcome its transition to a hot spot of global tourism. Robert Oda, who is managing the hotel project, described the situation precisely to Gov. John Waihee of Hawaii, who recently took his Cabinet to the 141-square-mile island. ''We will be taking Lanai into the 20th century very rapidly,'' Mr. Oda declared. But as we used to say in World War II, is this trip really necessary? Flea Market. Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, Sotheby's auction house reports that Andy Warhol's vast collection of cookie jars and other dubious works has been disposed of for $25.3 million. Never has so much been paid for so little that had been viewed by so many - 60,000 gawking visitors. The Wall Street Journal, ever alert to the vagaries of high finance, reported that one lot of Warholiana consisted of three plastic watches bearing likenesses of Judy Jetson, Fred Flintstone and Gumby, originally valued at $60 to $80. The lot went for $2,640. Two cookie jars sold for $23,100. An antiques dealer reported that some gemstones he had originally sold to Mr. Warhol for $300 had been resold for $10,000 ''and they were only quartz.'' Perhaps not the dollars but the avidity here displayed is some kind of monument either to celebrity or vulgarity or both. A sophisticated gentleman of my acquaintance, who reluctantly viewed the Warhol ''treasures,'' had a higher appraisal than the buyers. ''Awful junk,'' he said. Lawsy, Miz Scarlett. Without apparent protest from anyone, Warner Books has just bid $4.9 million for the rights to a fake novel. Never mind that the estate of Margaret Mitchell has authorized a ''sequel'' to ''Gone With the Wind.'' It's still a fake, because no one but the original author, dead these many years, could have produced a true sequel to her story and her characters. ''Gone With the Wind'' is not a great novel but it's an American classic nonetheless, with characters as familiar to most of us as Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer. To produce, in pursuit of profit, a faked version of their further lives almost surely will disappoint readers and inevitably will cheapen the original. That's life as it goes today. From it, and from these articles, I aim to retreat for a week or so on the bounding main.

932-> COMPANY NEWS; Masco Plans Operations Shift
Masco Industries said it would transfer operations with annual sales of about $250 million, representing about 15 percent of its revenues, to a new company that it expects to form late in the fall. John C. Nicolls Jr., the treasurer of Masco, said his company would exchange its military, gas cylinder, fastener and heat-treating operations for about half of the equity in the new company, which is to be called the Trimas Corporation. The remaining ownership is to go to the Masco Corporation for about $70 million in cash, and a portion of that is to be distributed to Masco Corporation's shareholders as a dividend. Masco Industries' sales totaled $1.6 billion last year, and the Masco Corporation's totaled $2.1 billion. Both companies are based in Taylor, Mich.

934-> July Incomes Up by 0.6% as Wages Rose
Bolstered by the biggest increase in wages in seven months, Americans' personal incomes rose six-tenths of 1 percent in July. The pace of consumer spending slowed in part because fewer people bought automobiles. The increase in incomes reported by the Commerce Department today was identical to the June advance. The rise would have been an even stronger eight-tenths of 1 percent if not for a big drop in farm subsidy payments. Spending on personal consumption, which includes virtually everything except interest payments on debt, rose five-tenths of 1 percent in July. While this was less than half the 1.1 percent June advance, economists said it showed that overall demand remained strong despite a decline in car purchases. Wages and Salaries Up As they have with other recent statistics, economists found signs of growing inflationary pressures in the report, primarily in the 1 percent gain in wages and salaries, the biggest rise since last December. While rising incomes are normally viewed as healthy, economists have begun worrying that demand pressures are outstripping the economy's ability to produce goods - the classic conditions for rising inflation. Concerns about inflation were heightened Thursday when the Government reported that the overall economy, as measured by the gross national product, was growing at a 3.3 percent annual rate from April through June, faster than previously believed, while a G.N.P. price index shot up at the fastest rate in six years. ''We have a lot of economic activity out there, and it is generating a lot of jobs and spending power for American consumers,'' said Sandra Shaber, an economist with the Futures Group, a Washington consulting firm. She said that for the first time since the late 1970's, consumers appeared to be basing purchases on a belief that they needed to act before prices went higher. ''Up until recently, we have had enormous resistance to price increases, but I think we are beginning to see a buildup of inflationary expectations,'' she said. White House Reaction The White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, in Los Angeles with President Reagan, called the report ''good news.'' ''The figures in the report are favorable, with steady income growth, good growth in consumer spending and in the personal saving rate,'' Mr. Fitzwater said. Wages and salaries rose $24.5 billion in July, compared with an increase of $18.9 billion in June, with increases in manufacturing contributing $3.8 billion of the increase. The overall increase was offset by a $9 billion drop in farm subsidy payments, which are extremely volatile from month to month. Americans' disposable, or after-tax,incomes rose six-tenths of 1 percent in July, down slightly from the seven-tenths of 1 percent gain in June. Savings Rate Rises With incomes rising slightly faster than spending, the personal savings rate, which is savings as a percentage of disposable incomes, edged up to 4.3 percent in July, compared with 4.2 percent in June. The five-tenths of 1 percent increase in spending followed a 1.1 percent June advance that had been the largest gain in 10 months. Total spending rose $15.7 billion, compared with a $36.1 billion June advance. The July performance represented slower growth in spending for nondurable goods and services and no change in the durable sector because of the drop in auto sales. But analysts noted that car sales have rebounded in August. The changes left incomes at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.07 trillion.

937-> BY GYPSY WAGON, THROUGH THE JURA
The Jura, in the northwest corner of Switzerland, is all wide, rolling valleys, good-sized climbs and descents and primal surroundings of unending green in the summer and gaudy colors in the fall. The gypsy wagon, called the zigeunerwagen in German, is an old, accepted mode of transport in the Jura, which is horse country. The wagon's name is simply whimsical. Gypsies haven't been spotted around here within memory. But tourists have. For up to six days, a horse and wagon can be rented and driven from town to town. Then visitors bed down for the night and continue the trip in the morning. The horse knows the way. The excursion starts at the Noirval, a country inn in Lucelle. This pinpoint on the map is about two and a half hours by car from Geneva, an hour from Basel and about two hours from Strasbourg, France. The night before the trip, the traveler sees a video describing how to take care of the horse, including washing it down. The day starts with a fine breakfast at the Noirval, whose proprietor is known for the hearty homebaked bread she produces, 200 loaves at a time, in her brick oven in the basement. It's a good idea to take along one of these loaves for lunch. At the barn, detailed instructions are given in how to drive the horse and wagon. The talks are in French or German, but an interpreter is available. The instructors are patient and will stay with the neophyte until the lessons are learned. The wagon looks like a cut-down version of America's own Conestoga wagon, the creaking rig that took settlers west. It has a buckboard wide enough for two, a tarpaulin cover and room in the back for four people to sit or stretch out. Although some work is required - the traveler is the driver - the result is a surprisingly comfortable day trip through farm country, woods and small towns. A network of country inns, equipped with stables, makes this a simple enough operation. It is comforting to know that there are grooms at all the inns along the route. And there is a detailed map showing suggested stops. Then, by uttering something like ''giddyap,'' the traveler is on his way. The route is planned so that there is time to stop to enjoy the scenery, have a picnic lunch and get to the next inn at about 5 P.M. to spend the night. To stop, we hollered ''Hahlt!'' with a Germanic inflection. Sometimes, we found, that didn't always mean much to our horse, a 14-year-old named Tarzan. But he was docile and, for the most part, obedient. And he never went faster than a leisurely walk. The sturdy, placid horses, all trained by the army, know just where they're going. They know, for example, when to go to the right for oncoming traffic. The wagon's wheels are rubberized, looking like outsize bicycle tires, so the ride, over paved roads for the most part, is not jarring. Since the wagon rides continue through October, the fall foliage season offers an especially attractive time to take the trip. We decided on the short tour - Lucelle to Pleigne, less than 10 miles away. While Pro Jura, the company that operates the excursions, gets about 400 families a year, only half a dozen are Americans. The cost of the trip includes hotels (clean, comfortable country inns) and breakfast. The company will pack a barbecue lunch, including chicken or ham, an ice chest, a five-gallon jug of water, silverware, paper plates, charcoal briquettes and bridge chairs for about $7 a person. We preferred getting our bread at the Noirval and picking up everything else at the Noirval's little grocery, where we bought the Jura cheese tete moine, as well as some Gruyere and the local fruity red wine, known simply as Gamay, which is the grape of Beaujolais. The horse moved confidently. We never were concerned about losing our way since there are yellow road markers with a picture of a horse to steer even the most dense map-reader. And, the Pro Jura people say, ''If you have a problem, ask a farmer and he knows how to contact us.'' For a time, I walked, leading the horse. We were told that it is a good idea to lead the horse down particularly steep inclines, though our path did not take us to one. The gentle pace, the clip-clop of the hooves, the slow-motion way the countryside slipped by help create a little world that we quickly felt part of. After a while, we passed a fence behind which were three horses. Our horse, Tarzan, decided he wanted to visit, so we let him poke his nose over the fence, where the three horses all trotted over to him and nuzzled him. Obviously, they knew him from his previous rounds. It was interesting, too, to see the reaction of cattle when we came upon them. They all faced in our direction at the same time, staring at Tarzan, their bells not stirring. The road we traveled was virtually without traffic. This allowed us to stop and talk to farmers who were hand-threshing their crops. They all were friendly and affable. We got into a discussion with one about soccer, and the fact that the United States was going to be the host for the World Cup matches. Another farmer invited us over for a pre-dinner drink. There were designated pique-nique spots along the way, scenic areas with a handy tree that doubled as hitching post. At one such stop we got out our bread and cheese and wine and had an al fresco lunch. We treated ourselves to a bit of dessert with the Jura specialty called totsche, a sort of sour-cream bread. It was a pastoral scene: Tarzan grazed against a background of gently rolling meadows. When the trip continued it was fun to stop at a farmhouse and say hello (the guidebook, in French and German, encourages the tourist to do so). We bought some honey at one farm and cheese at another, where a farmer showed off his horses. The short tour brought us to Pleigne at about 5 P.M. to spend the night at the Haut-Plateau Inn. There, we unhitched the horse and made ready for the night. There was a surprising sense of accomplishment, especially for one city slicker, who roughed it without ever really getting his designer jeans dirty. HITTING THE ROAD To arrange for a Gypsy Wagon tour, it is best to contact the Jura Tourist Bureau directly and make the reservations through them. The address is 12 Place de la Gare, Delemont, Switzerland. The Swiss National Tourist Office (608 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10020) has a fact sheet on the tour. A two-day trip (including horse, wagon and hotel for two nights with breakfast) will cost about $370 for two. If four people make the trip, add $150. Add $80 for a fifth. The prices go down for longer trips. You can drive to Lucelle easily from several major cities, including Geneva, Bern, Basel or Strasbourg. The wagons run from late June through October. Make sure to say you prefer an English-speaking instructor and a room with a bath.

938-> WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING; The Party's On
The invitation from several Pentagon officials associated with developments in Central America says, ''You are invited to bid farewell to Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega on Sunday, July 24th, at 4 P.M.'' Above that, however, ''Postponed'' has been stamped in big red letters. Inside is an explanation about the party for General Noriega, the Panamanian strongman and indicted drug trafficker who has successfully defied the strenuous efforts of the Reagan Administration, and particularly Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams, to force him out of Panama. ''Due to circumstances beyond Elliott Abrams's control,'' the invitation said, ''the farewell party has been indefinitely postponed.'' But since everybody was eager for a fiesta, the card continued, the gathering would still be held to honor four Pentagon officials leaving for new assignments. The names of the propounders are being withheld to protect the guilty.

939-> The Law: At the Bar
Samuel C. Klagsbrun's psychiatric training consisted in part of studying how human beings behaved in an oppressive, stressful environment, sealed off from the real world, separated from friends and family. Among other things, he examined how bright young people coped with the arbitrary and at times irrational orders of elders, and what traits helped them inch their own way up the organizational ladder. What Dr. Klagsbrun was studying was the ward room of a nuclear submarine. But the insights he absorbed under water have proven peculiarly applicable to another setting on land: the world of the large law firm. For some reason, the behavior of lawyers, separately and communally, has generally remained more the province of Louis Auchincloss than Sigmund Freud. In this void, few have observed lawyers more systematically and continuously than Dr. Klagsbrun, the medical director of the Four Winds Hospital in Katonah, N.Y. His work stems almost totally from his ties to Kramer, Levin, Nessen, Kamin & Frankel of New York, where he is known around the office as the ''firm shrink.'' For nearly two decades Dr. Klagsbrun, who is 55 years old, has taken a key role at Kramer Levin, attending the firm's annual retreat and counseling lawyers jointly and in small groups, all part of his mission to help humanize the place. Generally speaking, a psychiatrist is as welcome in the inner sanctums of most law firms as an agent of the Internal Revenue Service. Justice Brandeis's dictum that ''sunlight is the best of disinfectants'' may be fine as a matter of law, but not as firms' governance. Whether they are scared of what they might learn about themselves or simply too pragmatic to respect such ''touchy-feely'' stuff, most partners are not about to let someone in to scrutinize their psyches. Thus those who monitor lawyers' behavior generally do so from the outside. There are some who specialize in attorney angst, like Paul Avila Mayer, whose ad appears weekly in Manhattan Lawyer. ''Psychotherapy to the legal profession,'' it says. ''Depression, interpersonal conflict, self-destructive choices, performance anxiety, fear of failure.'' Mr. Mayer, like Dr. Klagsbrun, comes to the field with an unorthodox past: his background is not in medicine; he is a social worker and an eight-time Emmy Award-winning script writer for ''Ryan's Hope,'' ''Love of Life,'' ''Search for Tomorrow'' and other soap operas, all shows populated with numerous lawyers. ''They were usually crusaders, but their personal lives were always in shambles,'' Mr. Mayer recalled. But Kramer Levin was designed to be different. The firm's history seems like something out of America's colonial past. Like the Pilgrims who landed in Plymouth, the firm's founding fathers saw themselves as refugees from tyranny and oppression, in this case, autocratic law firms. To Dr. Klagsbrun, a friend of the firm's co-founder, Arthur Kramer, the challenge was tempting, particularly since, as one who generally dealt with the terminally ill and the despondent, lawyers seemed almost lively by comparison. He helped devise the system still used at the firm, in which young lawyers write annual critiques of their bosses, who then review them at their annual retreat. These can be scathingly brutal -partners find themselves accused of rigidity, egomania, condescension, irritability, abrasiveness, sexism - but can also be therapeutic. Other firms have flirted with the Klagsbrun system, but almost always rejected it. ''There are still many people in the business community who equate psychiatry with sickness,'' Mr. Kramer said. Even at Kramer Levin, things are changing. As the firm has grown bigger - it now has 130 lawyers -and become more bureaucratized, the self-criticism has become more unwieldy. Some partners complain that it is too time-consuming, humiliating and unreliable. Moreover, a firm that was once a haven to reluctant lawyers, people who half wished they had become academics or dancers or rabbis, has inevitably become yet another pea in the legal pod. To Dr. Klagsbrun, the critiques are crucial to keep the firm from becoming one more sweatshop. If it does, lawyers there will face what he views as the endemic unhappiness of large-firm lawyers, born of competition, an apprenticeship akin to indentured servitude, work he calls ''boring, tedious, emotionally unsatisfying and stultifyingly dull,'' and time pressures that wreak havoc with personal lives and marriages. Even under the best of circumstances, Dr. Klagsbrun said, lawyers can be difficult patients, and the same traits that make them difficult on the couch, such as dogmatism, contentiousness and hyperrationality, tend to torment spouses and children as well. ''A big New York City law firm is not a place where you can have a balanced life,'' he said. ''If that's what you want you have to think of working on your own, working in a small firm or getting out of town.''

940-> Call of 'Mush, You Winnebago!' Fills Yukon Air
More than 150 years after Americans in covered wagons began opening up the lands west of the Mississippi, a new brand of adventurers is out in force this summer on one of the continent's last frontiers. As they have in growing numbers throughout the 1980's, Americans using the late 20th-century version of the wagon - mobile homes that range from $1,500 pop-up shelters on the back of pick-up trucks to $500,000 palaces-on-wheels - are exploring along the Alaska Highway. They are following a trail blazed by Americans in 1942, when the United States Army punched the rough-hewn roadway through the Yukon bush to connect Alaska to the lower 48 states. For most of the travelers it is pioneering of a genteel kind, with air-conditioning, soft beds and hot-and-cold showers, along with satellite dishes atop the better ''rigs'' that capture late-run movies from Home Box Office at mobile home parks that are within a half day's drive of the Arctic Circle. But although there are no marauding Indians to unsettle these latter-day pioneers, the unexpected can still make life awkward. Recently, after weeks of heavy rain, a landslide buried a 600-yard stretch of the roadway outside this remote settlement, which lies about 1,000 miles north of the Alaska Highway's starting point at Watson Lake on the Yukon-British Columbia border. Another landslide farther north trapped hundreds of voyagers for four days, blocking the way north to Alaska or south to Whitehorse, the Yukon's capital, and to the Alaskan port town of Haines. Sharing Food and Movies Huddling together beside the road to share food and video movies, the mobile home owners watched as helicopters and DC-3's passed overhead with cruise-line passengers who had to be ferried across the blocked-off portion of the highway so as not to miss ship connections in Anchorage or Haines. Outside, a careful watch was kept for bears and wolves, which are plentiful in the thick forests carpeting the lower slopes of the St. Elias Mountains between here and the glaciers that flow down to the Gulf of Alaska. It was a rare challenge for men and women who are mostly in their 50's and 60's, travelers eager to see the world but not keen for too much of it to come as a surprise. In Dawson City, the old gold-rush town northeast of here, Glenda Bolt, a 26-year-old guide for the Canadian Government's parks service, described the American mobile home owners who account for about 60,000 of the 200,000 visitors to the Yukon each year as cautious people. ''They're people who want to go somewhere where they won't be nailed to the wall for being Americans, where people speak the right language and where they use money they can understand,'' she said. Mobile home owners from almost every state are clogging ''R.V. parks'' in the Yukon; the initials stand for ''recreational vehicle,'' the term used by an industry that has its own magazines, conventions, and an association, the Family Motor Coach Association, with more than 100,000 members. The owners include people who have driven their own vehicles, or rented ones, across Australia, through Europe, even into the Soviet Union, where many main roads make the Alaska Highway seem like child's play. A $60,000 Home on Wheels But most travelers are like Bob and Doris Radtke, a Brooklyn couple who moved to Greentown, Pa., after Mr. Radtke, now 60, retired from the New York City Fire Department. From a start tenting out with their children in the Adirondacks in 1960, the Radtkes have moved up to a 34-foot, $60,000 motor home that serves as their home for about five months every year. In November they move to Florida, Arizona or Texas. Last winter they went to an R.V. park in the Rio Grande Valley that had its own heated swimming pool, billiard parlor, and woodworking shop, as well as aerobics and dancing classes. For their trip through the Yukon and Alaska, the Radtkes paid $2,500 to join a 44-day, 25-vehicle convoy organized by a New Orleans-based company that runs such odysseys all over the continent. The payment gave them the services of a ''wagonmaster'' who had covered the route in advance, as well as guaranteed spots in R.V. parks to hook up to electrical power and to sewage disposal. Along the way the wagonmaster, George Shaughnessy, had set up entertainment, from campfires and cocktails to a night at the ''Franctic Follies'' in Dawson City, as well as cooking lessons for the ladies in such delicacies as rhubarb pie. ''It's the poor man's Hilton,'' Mr. Radtke said, as he showed a visitor over the plushly upholstered sofa and chairs, the shower room and kitchen, and the comfortable twin-bed boudoir at the rear of his rig. Nearby sat the class of the convoy, a $250,000 converted motor coach with a roof-mounted satellite dish belonging to a trucking company owner, Bob Williams. With the permanent daylight of the sub-Arctic night fading to twilight, Mr. Williams could be seen flicking through television channels that looked as clear as they might have been in his home town of Los Angeles. Emphasis Is on Slow Between agreed-on start-up hours and ''hitching'' hours at the end of each day, convoy members are free to make their own time on the road, usually slowly. ''We're more likely to be ticketed for blocking traffic than speeding,'' said Mr. Shaughnessy, a 61-year-old retired ''troubleman'' for a Miami power company. Still, a group gathered outside Mr. Shaughnessy's mobile home agreed on the greatest menace on the roads. ''The elderly person, going so slow he'll have a half-mile of traffic on his tail and not know it,'' Mr. Shaughnessy said. Beyond organized itineraries and help with breakdowns, the comforts of a convoy are those of any club. Among these, it seemed, are shared viewpoints. Much of the talk was about the cost of gasoline, which, at 30 percent higher in Canada than in the United States, raises costs considerably for vehicles that run 5 to 7 miles per gallon. More aggravating still for most owners was the state of the Alaska Highway in the northern Yukon, a gravel washboard that is slowly being paved, thanks to United States Government grants. J. G. Jarrett, a retired construction manager from Stockbridge, Ga., offered the view that Canada might be better off without a border. ''I think it should be open, clear right from Mexico all the way to here,'' he said. Away from the group, another owner was of a more philosophical bent. Over a coffee in his living area, he said that he had been reading Jack Kerouac's ''On the Road,'' a semi-autobiographical novel about a writer's wanderings across America in the 1950's. ''I don't suppose Kerouac's highways were too busy with blue-rinsed Nixon Republicans,'' the man, in his mid-60's, remarked with a chuckle. ''I guess we're chugging to a different God.''

941-> Man Jailed for Refusing To Give Up Melee Tape
Defying a court order and disdaining professional legal help, a Manhattan artist refused again yesterday to surrender his videotape of police officers and demonstrators clashing in Tompkins Square Park and was jailed for contempt. The artist, Clayton Patterson, 39 years old, of 161 Essex Street on the Lower East Side, was led from the courtroom in handcuffs after acting Justice Richard B. Lowe 3d of State Supreme Court pronounced him guilty of civil contempt and ordered him to jail for at least 90 days. A dozen supporters of Mr. Patterson attending the hearing, at State Supreme Court in Manhattan, broke into applause and shouted, ''Free Clayton Patterson!'' and ''This court is in contempt!'' Mr. Patterson's videotape of the Tompkins Square incident on the night of Aug. 6 was subpoenaed last month by a Manhattan grand jury investigating allegations of police brutality and misconduct. Maddox Was Dismissed Mr. Patterson was arrested last Thursday after his lawyer at the time, Alton H. Maddox, filed a letter telling the grand jury that the tape had been given to a Michigan Congressman, John Conyers, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Criminal Justice. The four-hour tape, which was viewed last month by The New York Times, shows police officers striking demonstrators with nightsticks and some officers wearing badges with their numbers concealed. Just before a hearing on the charge began Thursday afternoon, Mr. Patterson dismissed Mr. Maddox and said he wanted to represent himself. Judge Lowe adjourned the hearing until yesterday, released Mr. Patterson on his own recognizance and appointed a lawyer for him, saying he did not want to proceed otherwise. Mr. Patterson told the judge yesterday, however, that he did not want his court-appointed lawyer, Gerry Rosen, to represent him. At one point, when Mr. Rosen whispered, ''They're going to toss you in jail,'' Mr. Patterson interrupted him, saying, ''Excuse me. You're not wanted here. And I'm not interested, for the 100th time, in what it is you have to say.'' Action 'Hampers' Investigation After questioning the defendant, the judge said he was satisfied that Mr. Patterson understood what he was taking on in becoming his own lawyer. Mr. Patterson is a sculptor and painter and an embroiderer of hats. He and his wife, Elsa Rensaa, run a hat store, Clayton Hats, at 161 Essex Street. The Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, said in a statement yesterday that Mr. Patterson's action ''hampers the grand jury's efforts to investigate allegations of illegal police conduct.'' At least one copy of the tape exists, Mr. Patterson has said, but it is not known where it is. In an impassioned statement to the court, Mr. Patterson told the court that he was not going to turn over the videotape because of his concerns about conditions in New York City, ranging from crime to homelessness. ''It's my belief that in America, there's a certain time to stand up for your rights,'' he said, when asked by Judge Lowe why he would not produce the tape. ''It's my belief that it is wrong for the police to beat up and maim and kill people. It's wrong for the drug dealers never to go to jail and for there to be large amounts of illegal activities. It's wrong for the Mayor to separate himself from his constituents. It's wrong for the District Attorney never to effectively prosecute the police, and it's wrong to have blocks of empty buildings and the streets filled with homeless people.'' A 'Statement' in Jail He concluded, ''This is not a racial issue, but an issue that involves everyone in this city. I think my going to jail works as a statement towards that.'' When asked by Judge Lowe yesterday whether his refusal to turn over the videotape was a publicity stunt, Mr. Patterson denied it. His arguments did not convince the judge. ''I don't think the law is adequately served by making martyrs out of people who want to be martyrs,'' Judge Lowe said in delivering his verdict. ''I also don't think the law is served when the law is flouted.'' Mr. Patterson was sent to a special section of the Bronx House of Detention for Men for 90 days.

943-> THE DEMOCRATS IN ATLANTA; Houston Gathering Is More Impressed With Top of Ticket
In a middle-class home here, half a dozen Texans gathered to munch tortilla chips and watch the Democratic National Convention, waiting for Senator Lloyd Bentsen to change their minds. He did not. These were the type of people Michael S. Dukakis had in mind when he selected Mr. Bentsen, a conservative, as his running mate: Republicans who could be persuaded to defect, Democrats who had strayed and could be coaxed back, and independents who worried that Mr. Dukakis was too liberal. Disillusioned With Bush The Democrats are hoping to lure people like 33-year-old Moore Murray, who was born on Galveston Island, where he ran a lemonade stand to raise money for Senator Barry Goldwater in the Arizona Republican's 1964 Presidential campaign. He has not supported a Democrat since then, but he said he is disillusioned with George Bush and is thinking of voting Democratic. And the Democrats would like to attract people like 33-year-old David Morris, a stockbroker who describes himself as a Democrat at heart but who sat out the last election ''because I couldn't stand to vote for either of those guys.'' This year, he said, he is leaning toward Mr. Bush. But he listened closely to Mr. Dukakis tonight. The group dismissed the idea that they might vote Democratic simply because Mr. Bentsen is a Texan. ''Do you really think whoever he picks for Vice President makes any difference?'' asked Dr. Leon Dure, a Republican who ''wants to find out more about what Dukakis stands for.'' ''I don't think I would vote for a man just because his Vice President was from Texas,'' said Mr. Morris. ''But when you walk into a room and nobody knows you, you get judged just as you. When you walk in that room with a friend that everybody knows, you get judged as a pair.'' Bentsen's Speech 'Boring' Mr. Bentsen's acceptance speech, which they described as ''boring,'' did little to change anybody's mind. ''He took the easy way out,'' said Peter Schulam, a medical student who has lived in Houston for five years. ''He didn't mention any of the areas where he and Dukakis disagree.'' In contrast to his running mate from Texas, the Massachusetts Governor appeared to strike a chord among those in Mr. Morris's living room. ''He's not such a boring speaker,'' said Pamela Glasgow, a Tenneco Oil Company employee who plans to vote Democratic. ''He's doing a beautiful job of expressing who he is.'' ''The purpose of the convention is to let the voters meet Mr. Dukakis as a person, and this has helped me do that,'' Mr. Schulam said. Even those who were impressed by Mr. Dukakis agreed that their opinion was based on the emotion of the moment rather than the specifics of the speech. ''In a way I feel manipulated,'' said Dr. Dure, of Uvalde, in south Texas. ''Most of the things he said, anyone would be in favor of. He didn't tell us how he would do any of those things.''

944-> AT THE MOVIES
Vampiring 101 How does an actress become a vampire? Amanda Donohoe and Ken Russell had met a couple of times in London and Cannes before the day the director called her up out of the blue and asked to send her a script he had written. ''I don't know if you'll be interested in this little bit of nonsense,'' she remembers him saying, ''but please read it anyway.'' And, she said, ''I read it and couldn't stop laughing, and I decided instantly I would love to play the part of Lady Sylvia Marsh.'' Lady Sylvia Marsh is the beauteous vampire villain of ''The Lair of the White Worm,'' opening today. It is based on the Bram Stoker novel published 14 years after his ''Dracula'' and a year before the author's death at the age of 64 in 1912. What appealed to Miss Donohoe was ''first of all, the opportunity to play a woman who is basically a fantasy woman,'' she said. ''There are no boundaries. Therefore, I could do exactly as I chose with that lady.'' Miss Donohoe did a little boning up on vampire angst by reading Anne Rice's novel ''Interview With a Vampire'' and knew just what she wanted to do with Lady Sylvia. ''I didn't want her to be some sort of vampire bimbo,'' Miss Donohoe said. ''I really wanted her to be a sort of incredibly sophisticated and ageless woman, and I guess reading that book gave me a great insight into evil. I suppose the dividing line between good and evil is a thin line, but Lady Sylvia really enjoys her job - uses her assets, as it were, to lure her victims to their death and does it with an enormous amount of humor. Most of it is her private joke.'' Miss Donohoe has no fear that her portrayal has doomed her to a professional life as a vampire. ''The Lair of the White Worm'' is her fourth film this year, and all her roles have been different. She's played an emancipated woman in Mr. Russell's version of the D. H. Lawrence novel ''The Rainbow.'' She plays a high-class prostitute who joins an investigative reporter in bringing down a corrupt politician in '' 'Tank' Malling.'' And in ''Diamond Skulls,'' a psychological investigation of jealousy and obsession just going into production, she plays a wife whose aristocratic husband (Gabriel Byrne) thinks she is having an affair with her business partner and tries to murder her. Miss Donohoe knows what she'd like to do next, too. ''Go on vacation,'' she said. Some Changes Made When Robin Dalton was a literary agent, she tried her best to interest movie makers in ''Madame Sousatzka,'' a novel by Bernice Rubens. ''There were no takers,'' said John Schlesinger, the director who eventually became the taker and co-wrote the screenplay with Ruth Prawer Jhabvala. Along the way, Mr. Schlesinger said, the novel - about the relationship between an Old Worldly piano teacher, her pupil and the inhabitants of a London house earmarked for gentrification - underwent some changes. The movie stars Shirley MacLaine as the formidable Madame Sousatzka and an English-Indian boy, Navin Chowdhry, as her pupil. ''Music has always been very much a part of my life,'' said Mr. Schlesinger as he discussed his decision to make the movie. ''Second, I've always liked extreme characters or people in extremis. I liked the idea of a family that wasn't a family living in a house that was in jeopardy. I liked that it was about older people looking back and a young person completely on the brink of both a career and awareness. ''I liked the possibility, though not in the book - it wasn't there - of sexual tension that we were able to put in the film by up-aging the boy,'' Mr. Schlesinger said. ''The boy in the book is 10 and Jewish, in fact. So we made him 15 and Indian. ''Ruth wanted to do that, and we both felt that music is now not just the province of the Europeans or the Americans or whatever. There are so many people from the Orient or India that have come brilliantly to the fore as soloists and conductors, and we've got Amerca's two great orchestras led by Zubin Mehta and Seiji Ozawa.'' Now that ''Madame Sousatzka'' is behind him, Mr. Schlesinger is turning his attention to an opera production at the request of Herbert von Karajan - Verdi's ''Masked Ball,'' starring Placido Domingo, to be presented next summer at the Salzburg Festival When it comes to movies, Mr. Schlesinger and Miss Dalton have their sights set next on ''Oscar and Lucinda,'' a novel by the Australian Peter Carey about a young priest traveling in the 19th century from England to the colonies. ''And he meets a girl on board the ship,'' Mr. Schlesinger said, ''and discovers that they are both inveterate gamblers, which both cements their relationship and destroys it.'' Mr. Schlesinger said he knows just what he likes about the project: ''Its Dickensian characters and a wonderful kind of sweep of fate.'' Elementary Ideas How did Watson get to be smarter than Holmes? Back on the Sunday nights when Gary Murphy and Larry Strawther were students at St. Mary's College of California, in Moraga, Mr. Murphy had an alternative to studying: turning the sound down on campus re-runs of the movies starring Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson and making up his own irreverent dialogue. Jump forward to about four years ago, when Mr. Murphy had become a television writer and was watching a Home Box Office production he remembers as ''The Sign of Four.'' ''There was a moment when Watson was trying to guess the outcome of the case, and Holmes was really lording it over him,'' the 36-year-old Mr. Murphy said. ''And Watson has to sit there kind of meekly accepting this upbraiding. I believe it was in front of Scotland Yard people, and it just occurred to me - one of those moments I wish happened a lot more often - that it would be amusing if Watson were actually controlling this whole event, but that in front of Scotland Yard, Holmes was rubbing his face in it. ''It was suddenly that moment when you think there's a good idea. What if Watson is actually the genius and Holmes is this ridiculous ham in front of Scotland Yard and Watson has to restrain his sputtering rage and just picturing what's going to happen just as soon as they get home to Baker Stret.'' The upshot is ''Without a Clue,'' directed by Thom Eberhardt, opening today and starring Ben Kingsley as the brilliant Dr. Watson and Michael Caine as the thick-witted, craven, bibulous and prurient Reginald Kincaid, a third-rate actor hired by Watson to take a bow for solving a case. After the idea for the movie occurred to Mr. Murphy, he said he and Mr. Strawther, who had also become a television writer, met over a beer to discuss ideas. (Mr. Murphy and Mr. Strawther are now executive story editors of television's ''Night Court.'') Mr. Murphy mentioned his twist on the Holmes saga. ''Saying, 'Oh, you can do this, you can do that, led to: why don't we try writing it together?' '' Mr. Murphy noted. All in all, one of those ideas so obvious that it would have been labeled elementary by Holmes - or would it be Watson?

945-> S.E.C. Studies Changes On Private Placements
The Securities and Exchange Commission today proposed liberalizing trading in the private placement market, a move that could significantly cut the cost of raising capital in the United States. The commissioners voted 4-to-0 to ask for comment on a proposal that would allow certain large institutional investors to trade private placement securities among themselves without having to register them with the S.E.C. The comment period runs until Dec. 31. The market for private placements, which are either debt or equity securities sold in privately negotiated transactions, not registered with the S.E.C. and generally not traded on public securities markets, has exploded in recent years, from $18 billion in 1971 to $135 billion in 1987. In 1987 foreigners issued $6.7 billion in private placements in the United States. But most securities sold in the form of a private placement must be held for two to three years before they can be resold. If they are resold before then, they generally have to be registered with the S.E.C. According to the S.E.C.'s view, these restrictions have hindered the development of an effective secondary market in private placement securities, discouraging both foreign and domestic investors from raising capital through this means. Most market experts agree that a large secondary market inevitably lowers the cost of capital formation. ''If investors know they can sell securities within a certain time period, they may be more likely to buy in the private placement market,'' said Sam Wolf, deputy chief of the S.E.C.'s Office of International Corporate Finance. The S.E.C. today also asked for public reaction to the idea of whether independent auditors should be required to review the quarterly financial statements of public companies ''on a timely basis,'' such as quarterly, rather than at the end of the year, as is general practice. The recommendation came from the National Commission on Fraudulent Financial Reporting, headed by a former S.E.C. commissioner, James C. Treadway Jr. While the Treadway commission recommended the more timely review by auditors of quarterly reports, the S.E.C. took no position, and commissioners stressed that the request for public comment did not mean that they approve of the idea. S.E.C. officials predicted today that such a relaxation of the private placement rules and an exemption from registering with the S.E.C. could bring more foreign companies to the United States to raise capital. They argued that it could also make United States private placements more attractive to foreigners who would have the assurance that they would be able to resell the securities more quickly to United States investors without registration. The S.E.C.'s proposed rule would create a ''safe harbor'' from registration for certain institutions raising capital. The safe harbor would involve three types of transactions and investors. Anyone planning to resell securities bought in a private placement would be exempt from registering the securities with the S.E.C. provided they are reselling them to an investor with assets greater than $100 million. Moreover, no time restrictions on the holding period would apply. In the second category, private placement securities could be sold to institutional investors with less than $100 million but more than $5 million in assets like banks, broker-dealers, insurance companies or pension funds, provided the resold securities are not listed or traded on any United State exchange. The third category would permit the resale of private placements of securities that are publicly traded, provided the buyer agrees to certain restrictions, including not reselling them in the United States unless they are registered or get an exemption from the S.E.C. According to Joseph A. Grundfest, an S.E.C. commissioner, the reasoning behind the action was that regulation of the nation's securities markets and the disclosure requirements of registration were intended to protect the unsophisticated investor. The large sophisticated investor, who can do more research, does not need the protections. Thus, the agency should permit more liberalized trading of unregistered securities among institutional investors. ''Investors who are large enough are not part of the public that Congress intended to protect through the registration requirements of the securities law,'' Mr. Grundfest said.

948-> Books of The Times; Blunt's Treason: How, How Much, How Long?
Mask of Treachery By John Costello Illustrated. 765 pages. William Morrow & Company. $22.95. In ''Mask of Treachery,'' John Costello sets out to reconstruct the treasonable activities of Anthony Blunt, and to a lesser extent those of Kim Philby and Mr. Blunt's other associates in the so-called Cambridge spy ring. The publisher makes some large claims for the book, and it undoubtedly contains a great deal of fascinating material. It also has to be said that many of its judgments are naive, or naively expressed, and that it is littered with errors. Taken singly, most of these mistakes (the ones I spotted) are relatively unimportant, but they add up. A few random examples. Christopher Isherwood settled in America in 1939, not 1941 as stated. The Ukrainian nationalist leader Simon Petlyura is misleadingly characterized as a ''Menshevik.'' The British Home Secretary who granted Mr. Blunt immunity from prosecution was Henry Brooke (''Humphrey Brooke'' was somebody else). And Mr. Costello goes wrong over the names of numerous other figures - the art historian F. G. Klingender, for example, who was one of Mr. Blunt's intellectual mentors, and the historian Eric Hobsbawm. Archibald Maule Ramsay, a former member of Parliament, becomes ''Archibald Maule, the M.P. for Ramsay.'' Again, he speaks of ''an Edwardian generation of Cambridge graduates raised on the precious Victorian homoerotic poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins.'' Apart from anything else, this overlooks the fact that Hopkins's poems were virtually unknown until the first collected edition was published in 1918. In a book where you are asked to accept the author's word on all kinds of esoteric matters, it gives you a particularly sharp jolt to come across so many inaccuracies on matters where you are in a position to check up. In a book that seeks to re-create a cultural milieu, blunders like the one about Hopkins, and others like it, plant a firm suspicion that the author is out of his depth. My chief concern, however, is that Mr. Costello may have given hostile critics a rather easy stick with which to beat him. For despite its shortcomings, ''Mask of Treachery'' raises issues that are well worth taking seriously. Its great virtue is the amount of new material that Mr. Costello has assembled. His biggest haul comes from American archives - the files of the State Department, where he tracked down a large volume of British M.I.5 (counterintelligence) reports, and supplementary Federal Bureau of Investigation reports that he obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. But he also consulted many other neglected sources, and obtained interviews with such valuable witnesses as Felix Cowgill, the M.I.6 (British intelligence) officer who was in line for the post of head of anti-Soviet operations when Mr. Philby edged him out, and Michael Straight, who adds substantially to the story of his dealings with Mr. Blunt that he told in his 1983 book ''After Long Silence.'' What does all this testimony add up to? We are left with a mass of facts, suspicions, hypotheses and proliferating subplots, which defies easy summary; but I think it is fair to say that Mr. Costello has three basic contentions. First, Mr. Blunt's role in the spy ring was a good deal more important than has generally been supposed, and he himself suggested. Second, the ramifications of the ring went further than has ever been officially admitted: the British authorities have persistently muddied the waters, and held information back from their American counterparts. Third, the ring could only have achieved what it did with the support of a senior figure in British intelligence. I found the opening sections of the book the most convincing. Mr. Costello makes a good case for Mr. Blunt's having come under Soviet control in 1933-34, at least two years earlier than the date he gave after he had been unmasked. It follows that far from having been recruited by Guy Burgess, as he also claimed, he preceded him - and probably recruited him too. At the same time, the files make it clear that in the 1920's British intelligence had been notably efficient in its monitoring of undercover Soviet activities in Britain. It was well aware that universities were likely to be a prime Soviet target, and Cambridge was one of the chief places where it kept an eye on Communist sympathizers. Then why wasn't Mr. Blunt detected early on? Incompetence, perhaps; but then how did he manage to get into M.I.5 during World War II? He had friends who helped, possibly friends who shared his political aims; but as the questions multiply, friendship plus incompetence no longer seems an adequate explanation. Why wasn't the atomic spy Klaus Fuchs picked up much earlier, for example? How did Mr. Burgess and Donald Maclean manage to get away? Such questions have been asked innumerable times - for the very sound reason that they have never been properly answered; and in raising them yet again, Mr. Costello (with the help of F.B.I. testimony in particular) casts a good many fresh doubts on the official British version of events. The only ultimate explanation, he argues, is that there must have been a mole at or near the top; and his candidate for the honor is Guy Liddell, who was deputy director of M.I.5 when he retired in 1952. Liddell's name has been put forward before, and while Mr. Costello adds his quota of potentially damaging evidence, the question necessarily remains an open one. Will the mystery of the mole and all the lesser mysteries ever be solved? Only if there is glasnost all round (in Britain as well as Russia), and rigorous professional historians are given access to the files. Meanwhile, it is clear that Mr. Costello is far from rigorous, and that he speculates much too freely. (He has a very unconvincing ''scoop'' about the Nazi records dealing with the Duke of Windsor, for example.) But that doesn't mean that he doesn't ask many of the right questions, or that the answers he suggests can be wholly discounted.

950-> THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Profits Fall at Washington Post
The Washington Post Company said yesterday that its third-quarter net income dropped 37.8 percent, to $38.1 million, or $2.96 a share, compared with $61.3 million, or $4.77 a share, a year earlier. The 1987 figures included a one-time after-tax gain of $30.2 million from the sale of certain cellular telephone and SportsChannel interests. Excluding these gains, the 1988 quarter's net income was up 22.6 percent, mainly because of an increase in interest income and a lower effective tax rate. The company said that income from operations was flat at about $59 million. Revenue amounted to $329.4 million, a 5.3 percent rise from $312.9 million a year ago. The company said that newspaper revenue for the quarter rose by 8 percent. Advertising at The Washington Post increased by 5.4 percent. The quarter's revenue from Newsweek magazine, however, was flat. The number of advertising pages dropped to 491 pages from 501 pages in the period last year. For the first nine months, Newsweek's domestic advertising totaled 1,671 pages compared with 1,744 pages a year earlier.

953-> As Dukakis Struggles for Comeback, States' Leaders Are Apprehensive
As Michael S. Dukakis battles to revive his Presidential campaign, there is a palpable mood of anxiety, frustration and apprehension among the leaders of state Democratic Party organizations. These Democratic leaders have not given up, and, for now at least, some of their worry is on hold. In some key states, like California, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas, local party leaders said the Dukakis organization has shown a new pugnacity, the sort of campaigning they believe is mandatory, even if it should have started long ago. But conversations with party leaders and other top officials in more than two dozen states this week were dominated by a sense of lowered spirits, lackluster phrases of optimism, the nearly universal view that Mr. Dukakis, his aides and the party had let the moment slip away in late summer, and the fear that no one is listening any more. ''I hear it's going well in Greece and the message is working pretty well in the Mediterranean states,'' was the sarcastic analysis of J. Joseph Grandmaison, Democratic chairman in New Hampshire. Downhearted Feeling Mark Siegel, a Democratic National Committee member from Maryland, observed: ''It's not impossible, and I don't want this to sound like a post-mortem, but there's no particular reason for optimism at this point.'' Most of the party officials said that with less than three weeks left until Election Day, the Democrats are only just starting to counter the picture that Vice President Bush has painted of Mr. Dukakis, still searching for a way to tell Americans why they should vote for the Massachusetts Governor. This was true even in Ohio, where Jim Ruvolo, the state Democratic Party chairman, was enjoying a renewed enthusiasm. ''I think most people are looking for a reason to vote in this race,'' said Mr. Ruvolo. ''We haven't given people enough of a reason to be for our guy, while Bush has given them lots of reasons not to be for our guy. What saves us at this point is that Bush hasn't told them why to be for him, either.'' Only a few state party leaders sounded genuinely fired up, like Mr. Ruvolo and Richard Weiner, state party chairman in Michigan, where Mr. Dukakis had a enthusiastic day of campaigning on Tuesday. 'Going Great' in Oregon The Oregon state chairwoman, Judy Carnahan, said things were ''going great,'' but seemed perturbed that she was not hearing the same from other places. ''Oregonians know we're the heartbeat of America,''she said. ''It's just that the rest of America hasn't figured it out.'' Some officials had the defensive sound of a camp under siege. ''We are doing fine out here - F-I-N-E,'' Karen Marchioro, chairwoman of the Washington Democratic Party, shouted down the telephone line. ''We are doing well -W-E-L-L. The state of Washington is going to vote for Michael Dukakis no matter what you and The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal say.'' In areas where the campaign was given little chance at the outset and is now going the worst, such as Alabama and Mississippi, there was an unsurprising air of dejection. And in states where there was once a hope, but not a strong one, the mood is close to that. ''We'd still be holding on if there wasn't this overwhelming sense that we can't win nationally,'' said Buie Seawell, Democratic chairman in Colorado. ''It's depressing.'' But there were also some dejected assessments in places where the campaign should be going better, such as New Jersey, where a prominent Democrat said: ''You know and I know that it's over.'' Some of the positive assessments were hesitant, oblique. 'It Could Happen' ''The Democrats have not been blown out of the ballpark,'' said Todd Patterson, the party's executive director for Missouri. ''But believe me, the potential is there, it could happen.'' Larry Yatch, state party chairman in Pennsylvania, offered the assurance that ''we're doing reasonably well here'' at countering Mr. Bush's attacks. ''I don't find the campaign in a slump,'' he said. ''But he should be farther ahead than he is now.'' The most enthusiastic party officials were in those states where Mr. Dukakis's staff has started to concentrate. Peter Kelly, the California chairman, could only be happy about the 30,000 volunteers and 500 paid workers the Dukakis campaign has fielded. ''There's very much of a fighting mood,'' he said. Still, Mr. Kelly said: ''The preponderance of evidence is that Bush is ahead at the moment. You could speculate forever about why that happened. The only thing that's really productive is to figure out what to do about it now that we've got only three weeks to go.'' Signs of Optimism Some local party officials said that after weeks of bad communications, Boston headquarters has started responding to advice from the field. In Ohio Mr. Ruvolo bubbled over about new television commercials tailored for the state. He said Mr. Dukakis had started following a schedule laid out by the local campaign organization when he is in Ohio, not one determined entirely in Boston. In Texas, where Mr. Dukakis has been hit by a storm of advertising on gun control, abortion and law and order, Ed Martin, the state party's executive director, said ''frustration'' was starting to abate after Boston authorized a saturation campaign of response advertising on radio. ''It took us a month to really convince Boston that they were doing to us what they were doing to us down here,'' Mr. Martin said. He could barely contain his glee at recent Texas newspaper articles saying that the Texas prison furlough program was more lax than the one in Massachusetts, which Mr. Bush has repeatedly used against Mr. Dukakis. But Mr. Martin added: ''I think anyone who wanted to dislike Mike Dukakis had more than enough reason with the Bush ads. How much of it has sunk in, how much of it can be eroded, remains to be seen.'' Worries About Polls Some state officials were worried that national polls would be felt in their areas. ''We're within three points,'' said James J. Brady, state party chairman in Louisiana. ''The fear I have is that all the media stories about the gap widening nationwide - and we've got some problems there -might cause some people to jump off and get with what appears to be a winner.'' There is also some concern that the tactics so effective against Mr. Dukakis will be used against Congressional and state candidates. In some places, that has happened, with unclear results. In Florida, the Republican Senate candidate, Connie Mack, on Wednesday started broadcasting a new commercial against the Democratic candidate, Kennethy H. MacKay, that says, ''When it comes to national defense, Buddy MacKay and Michael Dukakis are just too liberal for Florida.'' In South Carolina, Knox White, a Republican candidate for Congress, has tried to use the state prison furlough program against the incumbent, Representative Liz Patterson, even though the state has a Republican governor. The liberal, soft-on-crime images Mr. Bush has pressed on Mr. Dukakis have left state officials in places where Mr. Dukakis was at best a long shot despairing that their fortunes could ever improve. Frank Holleman, South Carolina state chairman; Ed Cole, Mississippi state chairman; and John Baker, state chairman in Alabama, said Mr. Dukakis had blown a chance to challenge Mr. Bush by not responding to the attacks in August and September. Looking for the Blame As might be expected, Democratic leaders were looking for reasons why things had gone sour. Sometimes, they blamed themselves. ''We all ought to take some responsibility for it, not just Dukakis,'' said Mr. Seawell of Colorado. More often, blame was placed attributed to Mr. Bush. ''Just once, I'd like to see a campaign where Republicans run against Democrats without negative advertising, where you have an honest-to-god discussion of the issues, where you don't use cheap and dirty tricks,'' said Suellen Albrecht, party chairman in Wisconsin. Sometimes the fault was placed on the Boston headquarters. Sometimes it was placed on the press. Sometimes it was placed on the candidate. ''Is the leadership there?'' asked Samuel P. Goddard Jr., party chairman in Arizona. ''Is there the kind of leadership like Kennedy's, or Roosevelt's or Truman's or even, heaven preserve us, Eisenhower's? The answer is, No.''

955-> Market Place; Polaroid Battle And Kodak Suit
THE smart money on Wall Street is increasingly beginning to feel that the outcome of Roy E. Disney's slowly simmering takeover battle for the Polaroid Corporation depends more on the Eastman Kodak Company than on Mr. Disney. A key reason is that Polaroid's patent-infringement trial against Kodak is only four months away. Rather than sell now, near the stock's 12-month high, some investors may find the trial worth waiting for. ''Some guys who own Polaroid stock may want to reserve judgment till then,'' one analyst said. It's not far away.'' Polaroid has already won the first half of the lawsuit, which established that Kodak had infringed on Polaroid's instant-photography camera. Next January the Federal District Court in Boston will conduct a trial to determine the damages. They could total at least $1 billion, but some experts are estimating as high as $2 billion. Mr. Disney announced in July that he headed an investor group with 8 percent of Polaroid and proposed to its board that the group would be willing to pay $40 a share, or $2.3 billion, for the rest. He subsequently changed the proposal so that now he would be willing to pay $40 a share plus 40 percent of whatever Kodak is ordered to pay. Wall Street, however, was less than overjoyed. If Polaroid were to collect as much as $2 billion, that would be the equivalent of $20 a share. But Mr. Disney, who heads Shamrock Holdings, proposes paying only 40 percent to shareholders, or $8. Thus, his best offer would total only $48 - less than the stock might reach on its own or if a better offer emerged. After Mr. Disney's latest offer, Polaroid stock slid $1, to $42.125. Yesterday, Polaroid stock rose 37.5 cents, to $41.25. Mr. Disney's ability to get the money for a Polaroid deal is unquestioned because his main backer is Drexel Burnham Lambert, one of Wall Street's biggest fund raisers. But whether he would succeed in taking it over at anywhere near his latest price is doubtful. One reason Wall Street should wait, one analyst maintained, is that if Kodak is ordered to pay, say, $1 billion, it would mean $10 a share for Polaroid stockholders. And, of course, 40 percent of that is only $4, placing the Disney proposal at $44 a share. Mr. Disney's proposal is not regarded too highly , according to this analyst, partly because of Polaroid's own cost-cutting. Last July, Polaroid said it expected to save $50 million a year starting in 1989 through voluntary retirement from as many as 800 people. Other cost cuts, it said, would save $20 million more a year. Without further announcement, Polaroid has almost doubled its voluntary retirement program to 1,500. These savings, possibly $100 million or more a year, could increase Polaroid profits very quickly to $3 a share, this analyst estimated, up sharply from $1.88 a share last year and the Standard & Poor's estimate for this year of $1.40. Using a standard benchmark of 10 times earnings to determine the value of the stock, this analyst maintained that if Polaroid's earnings reached $3, the stock could be worth at least $30, just on the basis of earnings. And if Kodak were ordered to pay as much as $2 billion (or $20 a share), the stock might reach $50, the analyst argued, ''So, why rush to take $40 plus 40 percent from Shamrock?'' Analysts expect one or more offers for Polaroid to develop before long, including one perhaps from a Japanese company. Kodak itself is viewed as a possible bidder, to resolve the huge damage award expected. One of Wall Street's most prominent Polaroid watchers, who asked not to be identified, said he regarded Polaroid as ''dead meat'' and that it would almost certainly change hands. Still unresolved is Mr. Disney's charge in Delaware Chancery Court that in a deliberate plan to entrench Polaroid's executives and prevent a takeover, Polaroid handed 14 percent of the company to employees in an employee stock ownership plan. To pay for the stock, Polaroid eliminated profit-sharing benefits and began cutting employee salaries 5 percent, effective Sept. 1. The company has already allocated the first half of the 1988 stock and, unless the court rules against the plan, would allocate the rest by Dec. 31. Under Delaware law, any hostile bidder trying to take over Polaroid would have to buy more than 85 percent of the stock at one time. Mr. Disney argued that this was impossible, not only because employees hold 14 percent and are ''believed to be friendly to management'' but also because ''5 percent of a corporation's shares are simply unresponsive to any offer.'' In assessing Polaroid's ESOP, the Delaware Chancery Court is expected to look for guidance to the Delaware Supreme Court, which ruled three years ago that the directors of the Unocal Corporation acted reasonably when it decided to buy back its own stock but refused to buy back Unocal stock held by T. Boone Pickens, the Texas oilman. In reversing a lower court in that case, the Delaware Supreme Court said ''a corporation does not have unbridled discretion to defeat any perceived threat by any Draconian means available.'' The court ruled, nevertheless, that ''unless it is shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the directors' decisions were primarily based on perpetuating themselves in office, or some other breach of fiduciary duty such as fraud, overreaching, lack of good faith, or being uninformed, a court will not substitute its judgment for that of the board.'' Wall Street analysts tend to see Polaroid as the winner in Delaware. Peter J. Enderlin, who follows the company at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, said, ''I think there's a good chance the court'll rule in Polaroid's favor; most analysts agree on that one.''

956-> Ungaro and Valentino: Firm Footing
The 10-year reign of the shoulder pad is just about over. Long skirts are a fact of life. Fabrics have been lightened to the point of transparency, and the new shape of clothes is gentle, following the lines of the body. These significant developments in the spring and summer fashion showings this week are not likely to provoke consumer resistance for several reasons. The clothes are pretty, the changes often subtle (shoulder pads are reduced in size and prominence, not totally banished, for example). And some designers are going their own way, staying with the kind of clothes that made them famous. Emanuel Ungaro's collection is still mostly snugly draped and flower-laden. Valentino's tailoring is crisp and close to the body. Both designers emphasize short skirts that clear the knee, though they experiment with ankle lengths and trousers. Valentino opened his show with black culottes at below-calf length, accompanied by easy jackets and white blouses. Fluffy black knitted cardigans or neat boleros were also shown with the culottes. Soon he was back on familiar ground, however, with small checked jackets and narrow short skirts. The new notes were the vests and ornamental blouses decorated with lacy borders and insertions that made the skirts look important even without jackets. Soft crepe smocks and tent dresses introduced a looser line leading to long caftan-like styles for evening. Silver embroideries, muted madras plaids and chunky jewelry reflected the taste for fashions from India. But there were many choices for dressing up at night, from embroidered trousers to bouffant long skirts to sinuous 1930's dresses. It is a rich collection for women who put glamour before trendiness. Ungaro's fashion garden continues to grow, with each outfit a distinctive bouquet. As usual, the skirts and jackets are in different colors and patterns, and, also as usual, the clothes are draped so they cling to the body like a second skin. Don't fight with a successful formula, the designer obviously believes. With silk jersey a prominent material and with more low necklines than usual, the dresses are more revealing than ever. The designer tries a few longer skirts, though his heart evidently is not in it. They too follow the lines of the body, breaking into a little flip at the ankle-length hem. Wide-leg trousers are not for him. He shows some tapered pants with folded fullness below the waist, but his major pants experiment is with knee-length knickers, some in flower prints. What is astounding is how Ungaro sustains his joyous flower motifs. As the models moved around the stage in their lime-green, violet, sun-yellow and rose-colored dresses, nothing seemed to clash. Even leather skirts -some in yellow, violet or pale-green shades, and some lacquered for an even shinier finish - fitted in. Like well-placed foliage, they heightened the floral display. Jacqueline de Ribes said she tried to give her clothes a lighthearted feeling suitable for spring dressing, and she succeeded with full-skirted silk dresses, some with undulating hemlines, all floating above the knees. But this most sophisticated woman could not resist some rather intriguing necklines. Some undulate in a curving decolletage that looks more precarious than it is; those cut across the chest and filled in with net seem more secure. The De Ribes clothes are those the designer herself likes to wear, and because she has a commanding sense of style, her clothes are always dashing. This time, as with the full-skirted day dresses, they can also look soft and pretty. Martine Sitbon is giving new life to Chloe, the house where Karl Lagerfeld got his start. After a few tentative collections, she has found her own voice. Her clothes have exotic overtones that fit well into the current scene. Her off-beat fashion contributions include her versions of the sarouel, a draped full skirt from North Africa; jodhpur suits; embroidered organza dresses, and pleated pants with curvy jackets in silks from India. The House of Nina Ricci is carrying on after the death of Robert Ricci, the son of the founder, in August. Gilles Fuchs, Mr. Ricci's son-in-law, is now at the helm, and the designer Gerard Pipart is showing an unpretentious collection daily at the Hotel Plaza Athenee. Store buyers like the colorful linen and silk-print dresses. The designer's favorites are the pastel checked wool jackets with cropped pants.

957-> Education Group Warns of Increasing Alcohol Use Among Children
While drug use among American youths is edging down, a rising number of children are drinking alcohol more often and at a significantly earlier age than in the previous generation, the National School Boards Association said today. The organization said in a report released today that schools would have to reassess the effectiveness of their drug prevention policies and start educating students about drugs and alcohol in kindergarten. ''Fundamentally, substance abuse is an issue of education,'' Leonard Rovins, president of the association, said at a news conference here. Concern About Crack While neither association members nor the report cited figures to back up the statement about underage drinking, Mr. Rovins said school officials had been reporting ''spreading alcohol abuse'' among their students. And Mr. Rovins, who is also a member of the Westport, Conn., Board of Education, said he had encountered children as young as 8 years old who drank. Members of the association also expressed concern about the prevalence of crack, a highly concentrated, extremely addictive form of cocaine, among high school students. According to a poll by the University of Michigan cited in the report, 6 percent of American high school seniors surveyed in 1986 had used crack. The university conducts the survey annually for the Federal Government's National Institute on Drug Abuse. In its most recent poll, which was not mentioned in the association's report, it found substantial declines in the use of cocaine and marijuana among high school seniors. It also reported that 92 percent of seniors in 1987 had used alcohol, 66 percent within 30 days of the survey and 37.5 percent reported drinking heavily on at least one occasion within the two weeks before the poll. Three-Point Approach The association recommended that each school conduct an anonymous survey to determine the extent of drug and alcohol use among its students, and it outlined this three-point approach to combat and discourage illegal substance use: * Schools should establish clear policies that expressly forbid the use of drugs and alcohol, defining the forbidden substances and publicizing the consequences of violating the rules, the report said. ''Such rules give kids an added reason to 'just say no to drugs' '' Mr. Rovins said. * Schools should develop a drug education curriculum that begins in kindergarten and continues through the 12th grade. It should ''deliver a consistent message that is increasingly comprehensive with each succeeding grade,'' Mr. Rovins said. The programs should explain what substance abuse is, what its effects are and who to avoid peer pressure to use drugs and alcohol, he said. * School officials should also confront students believed to have drug problems and hire trained drug counselors to assist them and refer them to support groups or rehabilitation services, the report said. School officials should stay in contact with students undergoing treatment, it said. Mr. Rovins discouraged methods like schoolwide drug testing or searches of students' belongings. ''Mass drug testing'' of students or school employees raises ''serious'' constitutional issues, he said. And searches of entire classes or schools are probably not reasonable, he said, because ''they are not based on individualized suspicion.''

958-> Condor Chick Starts Process Of Hatching
The first California condor chick conceived in captivity cracked a tiny hole in its eggshell today, beginning a struggle to break free that could last three days. ''We're very pleased to see it has pipped,'' said Tom Hanscom, a spokesman for the San Diego Wild Animal Park, referring to a dime-size hole the chick has punched in the egg. ''It shows that the bird is still strong and progressing toward hatch.'' The chick's exhausting process of pecking its way out of the blue-green egg could take until Friday or Saturday to complete. If the chick has not emerged from its shell by 4 A.M. Saturday, keepers are planning to help it out. A successful hatching would raise the population of the nearly extinct species to 28. All 27 California condors are in captivity, 14 at the Wild Animal Park and 13 at the Los Angeles Zoo. 'Only Hope for Survival' ''The chick that hatches from this egg represents the regeneration of this species,'' Mr. Hanscom said. ''Captive breeding is their only hope for survival.'' ''At this point, it will continue to push at the pip hole and situate itself so that it will attempt to cap the egg,'' Mr. Hanscom said, referring to the chick's chipping all the way around the egg so it can push the upper third of the shell away from the rest. ''It does take breaks. It rests within the shell.'' The egg is being watched continually on a remote television monitor, but keepers are reluctant to help the chick out prematurely because of the danger that blood vessels linked to surrounding membrane will rupture, which could cause fatal bleeding. Since 1983, there have been 14 successful California condor hatchings at the Wild Animal Park and the affiliated San Diego Zoo involving eggs taken from the wild. All of those hatchings occurred with human help, although one of those chicks died of an infection 24 hours after birth. Moved to Incubator Mr. Hanscom said that should the chick need help, keepers would use forceps and tweezers and ''very gently, very cautiously chip small bits of the shell until they can pull the chick from it.'' The egg was laid March 3 in the first mating of captive condors in a 15-year effort to save North America's largest land bird. California condors, which are scavengers, have wing spans of up to 10 feet. Shortly after it was laid, the egg was taken from the parents and placed in an incubator. State and Federal wildlife officials overseeing the condor recovery program decided to remove the remaining condors in the wild to focus efforts on a captive breeding flock as the last best hope for the species' survival. The last known California condor in the wild was captured in April 1987. The success of the program will not be known for years, as the oldest bird hatched in captivity is 5 years old and condors reach sexual maturity around the age of 7, Mr. Hanscom said.

959-> Cartwright Thrives After Hard Times
Bill Cartwright leaned his 7-foot-1-inch frame back against a metal folding chair and offered a condensed theory on the importance of perspective. To Cartwright's way of thinking, it isn't so much the course of events that affect a person's life, but rather one's perspective on those events. ''That's what it comes down to, really,'' he said earlier this week as the Knicks prepared for their playoff series with the Boston Celtics. ''It's just like the first time I broke my foot. That's when my oldest son, that same year, had to have a heart operation. All of a sudden my foot was nothing, nothing compared with that. It put everything in perspective.'' Cartwright has had to draw quite heavily on his sense of perspective. After averaging between 14 and 21 points per game in his first five pro seasons, the 30-year-old Californian was hobbled by a broken foot that took two years to heal. Even before the injury, he had been criticized for being too soft to carry the Knicks to a championship. At the beginning of this season, the Knicks - and Cartwright in particular - were greeted with hearty boos at Madison Square Garden as they began their exhibition schedule. The team had been terrible for three straight seasons, and Cartwright, the Knicks' first-round draft pick in 1979, was a convenient and frequent target for the fans' frustration. Indeed, from October to February, Cartwright was such a regular subject of daily trade rumors that the idea of the trade overcame the trade itself: he'd go to Houston for Olajuwon, or Los Angeles for Kareem, or perhaps to Golden State for Mullin. Plays a Full Season Again Two months later, Cartwright remains a Knick, and perhaps because of it, the Knicks are making their first playoff appearance since 1984. Cartwright, often called ''Invisa-Bill'' in leaner times, played 82 games this season, the first time he had not missed a game since 1982-83. He averaged just over 20 minutes and 11.1 points per game. Sometimes teaming with Patrick Ewing, sometimes manning the pivot by himself, Cartwright gave the Knicks power and versatility on the inside and helped unlock Rick Pitino's running, pressing game. Cartwright's most valuable contribution, however, may have been his steadying influence on a talented but youthful team that has run hard for two months, sometimes blindly, toward a far off and not always discernable goal. ''I can't begin to say how much Bill Cartwright means to this basketball team,'' said Mark Jackson, the Knicks' rookie guard. ''It's a credit to his character the way he's handled this whole season. When the trade rumors were going around, he continued to play as hard as everyone else in practice. You never saw him depressed, though I'm sure it bothered him. He just kept playing basketball and it made us a better basketball team. I know there'd be no way we'd be in this position without him.'' Finally, the 'Comeback' Cartwright, for his part, has allowed himself a small measure of satisfaction for the season he has had, but he has also taken pains not to read too much into it. ''I never get too excited, I never get down,'' he said. ''Is this a career highlight?'' he said. ''No. This is the comeback. This is not a highlight, this is not a finale by any means. I plan on playing for a while yet.'' Cartwright missed the entire 1984-85 season and all but two games of the 1985-86 campaign with a stress fracture of his left foot. He was scheduled to return in October 1986, but then suffered a partially torn tendon in the middle finger of his left hand and missed three weeks of the regular season. With the Knicks floundering and their onetime symbol of better times seemingly star-crossed, the idea of trading Cartwright practically became a cult movement among Knick fans. Pitino, however, remained steadfast in his insistence that Cartwright could help the team. Intensity Picks Up Cartwright has not only helped the team but has also escalated his intensity just in time for the playoffs. Last Saturday, in the pivotal, season-ending game against Indiana, Cartwright played the entire fourth quarter and ignited the Knicks when he nearly got into a brawl with a Pacer. ''I've never seen him that intense, not to the point where he was about to exchange blows,'' Jackson said, ''It was very motivating to see Billy get into something like that because he's such a quiet guy. It sparks everybody else because if Billy gets ticked then everybody's going to get ticked.'' ''That's what the playoffs are all about,'' Cartwright explained. ''Every game is important, every game is crucial. Really, every possession is very important. You just want to make absolutely sure that you're into the game. You should be ticked off. This is the ultimate challenge. We have to understand that the Celtics are not a good basketball team, but a great basketball team. And for us to beat them or even to play with them, we have to play the best basketball we can play. If we don't play the best basketball that we can possibly play, we're not going to win.'' What happens to Cartwright after the playoffs? He has improved his marketability, re-established himself as a star-quality player and has given the Knicks a unique offensive look. ''I'm still on my way up,'' he said. ''Right now, the bottom line for me is winning, getting that ring on my finger. That's all that's left. I've established myself, I've got a position where I've been paid well and now the only thing that's left is to win. Can it happen here? Obviously, I want to play more, I want to contribute more. If I can do that and win, I can do that here. Right now I'm happy because we're in the playoffs and that's where I want to be.''

960-> De Gaulle Is Thrown A 1-2 Punch
One clear loser in the first round of France's presidential election Sunday was Charles de Gaulle. The founder of the Fifth Republic died in 1970, but two of his surviving foes are having posthumous revenge on his legacy. One of them is Jean-Marie Le Pen, the leader of the National Front, which has divisively painted third-world immigrants as the scapegoats for France's ills. Mr. Le Pen's surprising showing made him a possible arbiter of the runoff vote between President Francois Mitterrand and Prime Minister Jacques Chirac on May 8. The other surviving foe is the Socialist President himself. Mr. Le Pen appeals to a disaffected electorate that is troubled by unemployment and by immigrants in France. But as a former paratrooper in colonial Algeria, he has tapped a vein of anti-Gaullist resentment and a lurking sympathy for Marshal Henri Philippe Petain, who headed the collaborationist Vichy Government during World War II. Ex-Colonists at the Forefront It is not by accident that some of Mr. Le Pen's most fervent supporters are former colonists from Algeria who still loathe de Gaulle for allowing the North African nation to become independent in 1962. The National Front counts in its ranks a number of former officers who plotted against de Gaulle in a violent, last-gasp effort to keep Algeria French. One of the most conspicuous is Pierre Sergeant, a National Front legislator and a former Foreign Legion officer who was condemned to death for his role in the 1961 anti-Gaullist putsch in Algeria but later granted amnesty. In that failed army coup, four generals opposed to Algerian independence plotted the seizure of Algiers, but most regular officers remained loyal to de Gaulle. Suggestively, at Mr. Le Pen's most recent electoral rally, the crowd wildly cheered in memory of Gen. Raoul Salan, the leader of the 1961 putsch and the instigator of last-ditch efforts in 1962 to block Algerian independence through terrorist strikes. ''It is the revenge of Vichy and the war of Algeria,'' said Jean Lacouture, the author of a three-volume biography of de Gaulle, speaking of the upsurge of support for Mr. Le Pen. ''There are still 10 percent of Frenchmen who remain attached to Petain and another 10 percent who have not forgiven the loss of Algeria.'' A Sense of Mission Awry Mr. Lacouture said that de Gaulle had tried to give France a ''noble and melancholy'' sense of mission after its defeat in war and the loss of its colonies. Mr. Le Pen, the historian argued, represented another response to ''the post-grandeur'' phase of the nation's history. ''Le Pen is the nasty, horrible and dirty face of the Gaullist experience, the face that de Gaulle tried to endow with a certain pride,'' he said. ''Gaullism was a positive response, but Le Penism is a vengeance, the inversion of Gaullism.'' Another posthumous blow to de Gaulle has been landed by Mr. Mitterrand, who fiercely opposed the general and who three decades ago denounced the Fifth Republic constitution as ''a permanent coup d'etat.'' In fact, the de Gaulle-Mitterrand animosity had its origins in their first meeting in Algiers during World War II, a demonstration of the longevity of political feuds in France. Revival of Factions At 71 years old, Mr. Mitterrand is within reach of something no leader of the Fifth Republic ever attained: his second election as President by universal suffrage. But many Gaullists are convinced that if Mr. Mitterrand is re-elected to a seven-year term he intends to transform the nature of the Fifth Republic, reviving the primacy of political parties and factions that the general so detested. ''One of the constants of Mitterrand's career is that he wants to destroy the Fifth Republic and justify his opposition to the Constitution in 1958,'' said Olivier Guichard, a former Gaullist minister who is a member of the National Assembly. ''His objective,'' continued Baron Guichard, seated in a small office off the Place du Palais Bourbon, ''is to create an Assembly where there is no majority and where he can have the kind of success he did under the Fourth Republic. After all, this is a man who was a minister 11 times with a parliamentary group of 12 people. Not bad.'' At the stately Senate building, overlooking the Jardins du Luxembourg, Maurice Couve de Murville, the veteran former Gaullist Foreign Minister, was asked what the general would think of France's murky political situation in 1988. The white-haired senator answered softly: ''He would not be proud.'' Savoring the Prerogative Whatever historic hostility Mr. Mitterrand may harbor toward the Fifth Republic Constitution, he has savored, and jealously guarded, the prerogatives of the Gaullist presidency. But he has said that he favors an end to the ''monarch-presidency'' and would be a referee, not a commanding officer, in a second term. As far as Gaullists are concerned, the vote on Sunday was ignominious for a final reason. The standard-bearer of the latter-day Gaullist movement, Prime Minister Chirac, won only 19.9 percent of 30.8 million votes cast, only 5.5 percentage points more than Mr. Le Pen, the fourth-place finisher. Raymond Barre, a conservative former Prime Minister, finished third. Opinion polls before the ballot had put Mr. Chirac's percentage in the middle 20's. A good Gaullist, explained Pierre Sudreau, a politician who helped write the Fifth Republic Constitution, should rally the broadest coalition possible. Alas, Mr. Sudreau remarked, President Mitterrand was doing a far better job than Mr. Chirac in this regard. ''If Mitterrand had not harassed him so much, well, I cannot say that de Gaulle would have actually voted for Mitterrand,'' Mr. Sudreau said. ''But he would not have voted for Chirac. He would have abstained.''

961-> Cup Sail-Off: New Dispute
Potential challengers for the America's Cup are jockeying for a spot in a sail-off against Michael Fay's New Zealand boat this summer. But Fay, as official challenger, is claiming the right to screen each bid. Iain Murray, skipper for Australia's Kookaburra syndicate in the 1987 America's Cup races, notified Fay yesterday that he planned to challenge in a monohull similar in size to New Zealand's 90-foot waterline boat. The British Blue Arrow syndicate, led by Peter de Savary, has said it plans to challenge with a smaller monohull. Yesterday, Fay refused to accept the challenge unless the British boat was built to the same dimensions as the New Zealand contender. Fay is expected to accept Murray's bid. The 30-year-old Murray has plans for a 90-foot waterline monohull which, he said, could be built within three months.

962-> Du Pont Soars On Profit Jump
Shares of E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company surged today after the nation's largest chemical company reported a 51 percent increase in first-quarter profits and predicted that 1988 earnings would top last year's $1.79 billion, or $7.39 a share. ''Based on what we've seen so far, we have every reason to expect that our 1988 earnings will exceed last year's good showing,'' Du Pont's chairman, Richard Heckert, told the company's annual meeting. Du Pont stock jumped $1.875 a share today, to $86.375, on the New York stock Exchange after the company's first-quarter results were announced. The company reported net income of to $590 million, or $2.45 a share, for the quarter, compared with $391 million, or $1.62 a share, a year earlier. Revenues increased 12.6 percent, to $8.11 billion in the most recent quarter from $7.20 billion a year earlier.

963-> Court Told of Threat To Close Lord, Geller
Martin Sorrell, chairman of the WPP Group, told executives of the Lord, Geller, Federico, Einstein advertising agency last month that he would close it because of the mass defections, according to testimony yesterday in New York State Supreme Court. Six senior officials of Lord, Geller left on March 18 to form a new agency. Three days later, Mr. Sorrell made a threat to close the agency, Marianne Caponnetto, a former senior vice president at Lord, Geller, testified. Ms. Caponnetto left earlier this month to join the new agency, Lord, Einstein, O'Neill & Partners. In testimony at a hearing before Justice Herman Cahn of State Supreme Court, Ms. Caponnetto said Mr. Sorrell warned of closing Lord, Geller after failing to persuade two executives, Barry Hoffman and Bruce Albert, to remain. They, too, joined Lord, Einstein - as have about 40 former Lord, Geller employees and at least two clients. Mr. Sorrell is expected to testify next week. He could not be reached for comment yesterday. But a lawyer for Lord, Geller, discounted yesterday's testimony about a possible shutdown. ''It was a rumor,'' said the lawyer, Patricia Hatry of Davis & Gilbert. ''Lord, Geller is alive and well and living in New York.'' Restraining Order Issued WPP has filed suit, seeking to bar Lord, Einstein from soliciting or accepting any old clients or personnel. WPP has also sued the Young & Rubicam agency, which financed the new agency and provided it with offices, seeking damages. Justice Cahn has temporarily restrained the new agency from such activities. The six executives, who were led by Richard J. Lord, the chairman, and Arthur Einstein Jr., the president, said they had left Lord, Geller because they lost their autonomy last year after WPP bought the JWT Group, which owned Lord, Geller. Lord, Geller has charged that the executives who left were part of a conspiracy to sabotage the business before striking out on their own. ''Mr. Sorrell tried to get the men to stay, at one point saying to one that he could be a rich man,'' Ms. Caponnetto said in her testimony. ''But at a certain point he lost his patience.'' '' 'I'm tired of playing games,' '' she said, quoting Mr. Sorrell. '' 'I'm closing the agency tomorrow and it will be on your hands.' '' Ms. Caponnetto met later that evening with Mr. Albert, who she said was ''physically trembling'' after he met with Mr. Sorrell in Manhattan. She said she told other employees at Lord, Geller the next day that she believed it would be closing imminently, and then spoke to the partners at Lord, Einstein about working there. Reports Denied On the following day, J. William Wardell, now president of Lord, Geller, circulated a memorandum at the office that denied reports that the business would be closed. Lord, Geller, however, has lost much of its creative staff and two clients - The New Yorker and WNBC-TV - to Lord, Einstein. Earlier in the day, a partner at Lord, Einstein testified that an executive of the International Business Machines Corporation was told of possible resignations at Lord, Geller two days before the walkout. I.B.M. accounted last year for more than half of Lord, Geller's $220 million in billings. The most famous Lord, Geller advertising campaign involves I.B.M.'s use of a Charlie Chaplin lookalike to promote its personal computers. I.B.M. has continued its accounts with Lord, Geller but said earlier this month that it would give short-term assignments to Lord, Einstein. C. Ray Freeman, an executive vice president of Lord, Geller before he joined the new firm, testified that he had told an I.B.M. marketing executive, Darby Coker, that he expected resignations of senior executives soon. The two men, who are friends, were driving from work in Manhattan to their homes in Connecticut on March 16, two days before the executives walked out. ''I told him things weren't going well,'' Mr. Freeman said. ''I told him if things didn't work out, we may resign.'' ''I absolutely did not solicit Darby Coker,'' he added.

964-> De Beers Lifts Diamond Price
The De Beers diamond cartel said today that it was increasing prices for rough gemstones by an average of 13.5 percent. Sales of diamonds, which are priced in dollars, have benefited from the drop in the United States dollar, which makes them cheaper to holders of Japanese yen and European currencies. De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., a Johannesburg-based concern that controls 80 percent of the world's rough-diamond market through its London-based marketing arm, Central Selling Organization, said the price increases for a broad range of uncut diamonds would take effect next Tuesday. De Beers last increased its prices by an average of 10 percent on Oct. 5. The cartel, which sets prices for rough diamonds only, operates a pipeline of diamonds from its mines in Africa and Australia to dealers and cutters in the world's leading diamond centers: New York; Antwerp, Belgium; Bombay, India, and Tel Aviv. De Beers reported record sales of $3.075 billion in 1987, up 23 percent from the 1986 figure.

965-> U.S. Accuses Airline in Buffalo Of Operating After Losing License
A Buffalo charter airline formed by a Continental Airlines pilot was charged by Federal authorities yesterday with operating illegally for seven months after its airline license had been revoked. The Federal Aviation Administration said it was seeking a penalty of $950,000 against the carrier, known as Buffalo Express Airlines, and its two principal owners, David Broderdorf, the Continental pilot, and his wife Laura. This would be one of the largest civil penalties ever proposed by the agency on an air-charter operation. The airline initially had its license lifted on Jan. 2, 1987, after the F.A.A. said it had violated a number of rules, including using unairworthy planes and operating them in a ''careless or reckless manner.'' But, the agency said, Buffalo Express subsequently conducted more than 200 flights in nonscheduled passenger and scheduled cargo service. The agency said it discovered this only after one of its small twin-engine planes crashed in July. The plane developed engine trouble on a night takeoff from Midway Airport in Chicago, plunging into two garages and killing the pilot, the only person on board. Another Airline Involved Loretta Alkalay, acting counsel for the F.A.A.'s eastern region in New York, said in an interview there had been no way to know that Buffalo Express was still operating after its license had been revoked because its planes had been listed on the operations certificate of another air-charter line, Air Maryland. The license of Air Maryland was lifted last month for safety violations. It was only when investigators began looking into the Midway accident that Buffalo Express was found to be the operator of this and other flights, Ms. Alkalay said. Mr. Broderdorf, who has been a co-pilot on Continental DC-10 jumbo jets, could not be reached for comment. But his wife denied the F.A.A.'s charges. She said Buffalo Express had made a legal agreement for Air Maryland to take over Buffalo Express planes and for Buffalo Express to open a sales office to solicit business. Robert Cadwallader, chief pilot and operations director of Air Maryland, said: ''I disagree with the extent of the case against Buffalo Express.'' He denied allegations made by the agency in revoking his company's license, including the charge that it had participated in a deal to operate illegally. Ms. Alkalay, whose office brought the case against Buffalo Express, said the agency hoped the size of the proposed fine would ''act as a deterrent to other illegal operators.'' She said the agency's actions taken to date were part of a larger continuing inquiry into related small-airline activities.

966-> Topics of The Times; Serious About Plastic Pollution
By halting the purchase of plastic foam cups, plates and other products by New York City agencies, Mayor Koch sets a welcome example. The new policy reflects a growing national concern about plastic waste. Plastic packaging does not decompose, straining landfills. When burned, it emits harmful chemicals. In October, Berkeley, Calif., became the first jurisdiction to ban use of foam packaging by fast-food restaurants. Rhode Island, Seattle and Suffolk County in New York are weighing similar steps. Last month Richard Kessel, head of New York State's Consumer Protection Board, asked McDonald's to stop using plastic foam packaging. A spokesman for McDonald's responds that no suitable substitute has been found. Yet Burger King, McDonald's chief competitor, manages to keep its burgers warm using biodegradable paper wrappers. Mr. Koch, following Vermont's example, has rightly decided to curb city agency use of plastic foam products, which now totals up to $10 million annually. If McDonald's doesn't voluntarily show the same responsibility, the city and the state ought to consider a ban.

967-> The Big East Race Begins in Earnest
While the Big East season began a month ago, the bitter battles that distinguish conference play began when Georgetown and Pittsburgh squared off Wednesday night in the season's first true heavyweight bout. Georgetown emerged with a 62-57 victory, its fourth straight over Pittsburgh - ranked No. 2 in the Associated Press poll - and its sixth consecutive victory at the Capital Centre. But in the long run, the point the Hoyas made may loom larger than the victory. ''We wanted to let people know that we're not going to be pushed around,'' said Perry McDonald, Georgetown's 6-foot-4-inch senior swingman. ''People see our size and they think they can go over our back for rebounds and push us around. We want teams to know we play hard, we play to win. Pittsburgh came in here fired up and ready to play tonight. They didn't expect us to play as hard.'' The game was about nine minutes old when pushes became shoves and then erupted into a brawl involving Mark Tillmon, a Georgetown guard, and Nate Bailey, a Pittsburgh forward. ''We were defending very closely, as we all do, and Bailey turned and Mark said he hit him with the elbow, and Mark pushed off,'' John Thompson, the Georgetown coach, said about the incident. The officials, however, saw only Tillmon and gave the 6-2 sophomore a personal foul and a technical foul and threw him out of the game. Bailey was not called for anything. Thompson was also assessed a technical foul, for leaving the bench area to lodge a protest at the scorers' table. A Double Technical Late in the game, Paul Evans, the Pittsburgh coach, was given a double technical - one for protesting the lack of a walking call against a Hoya player with 22 seconds left in the game and Pitt trailing by only 58-56, and the second for protesting the first. After the game, the second-year coach exchanged angry words with two Georgetown assistants before all of them stalked off to their locker rooms. Forty-five minutes after the game, Evans had still not cooled down. ''If John can go out on the floor and not get a technical, and they can blow a call at halfcourt, and I walk over the line and he calls me for walking on the line - not even being on the floor - with 22 seconds to go, it is just crap,'' Evans said, overlooking the fact that Thompson, too, had been given a technical. ''I will do it again tomorrow because I'm not going to be intimidated by him and I'm going to make a point of this thing.'' Asked whom he was referring to, Evans said, ''John Thompson and the way he controls officials.'' Thompson dismissed the flare-ups, saying they were simply a part of Big East competition. ''The league is intense,'' he said. ''The coaches get along very well with one another. We're probably angry with one another now; a lot of nasty things'll be said. But I don't think it's that big a thing, really.'' Evans, informed of Thompson's comments, replied, ''Yeah, right.'' Both teams now have 9-1 records. A Freshman Performance Georgetown certainly made its point to Pittsburgh's freshmen backcourt, which, until Wednesday, had been highly praised for playing like upperclassmen. In the face of the Hoyas' withering pressure, however, Sean Miller and Jason Matthews were suddenly freshmen again. The two had averaged in double figures in the Panthers' first nine games and were a large part of the reason that Pitt had been ranked in the top five all season by The Associated Press. In their Big East debut, Miller had 8 points and Matthews had 7 with six turnovers. ''I can understand what they went through,'' said Sherman Douglas, the all-conference Syracuse guard. ''When I was a freshman, I was playing behind Pearl Washington, but I was pretty nervous playing down there just coming off the bench. I know they must have gotten a little rattled. Georgetown throws a lot of guards at you, and they wear you down. It just takes some getting used to.'' Demetreus Gore, the Panthers' 6-5 senior swingman, said that he planned to take his freshman teammates aside sometime this week and explain the realities of Big East competition. ''I tried not to bother them about it before this game so they wouldn't think about it,'' Gore said. ''I just wanted them to try to play the way they'd played the rest of the games. Now I'll probably have to talk with them and tell them it's going to be a little harder.'' How will the loss affect the Panthers going into the game tomorrow with St. John's? Jerome Lane, the 6-6 forward, said that a burden had been eased and that the loss could serve as a catalyst. ''We'll win the next nine, 10 games straight,'' he said. ''That's not a big problem.'' It could be. Pittsburgh hasn't defeated St. John's since January 1984. In the last four of those games, the Panthers found a way to lose at the last moment, despite having superior talent.

968-> Elizabeth S. Kean, 90, Mother of Governor
Elizabeth S. Kean, the mother of Governor Kean, died early today at her home in Livingston. She was 90 years old and had been ill for a month. Mr. Kean, who left Wednesday for the annual meeting of the World Wildlife Fund and the Conservation Federation in Costa Rica, flew home after being told of the death. Mrs. Kean's husband, Robert Winthrop Kean, died in 1980. He was in the House of Representatives from 1938 to 1958. She was born in New York and was a direct descendent of Peter Stuyvesant and John Nielson, a colonel in the Revolutionary army and a founder of Rutgers University, according to the Governor's office. She was a daughter of Thomas H. Howard and Rose Anthony Post Howard and lived in New York City and Hyde Park, N.Y., until moving to Livingston in 1924. Mrs. Kean was a hospital volunteer in Washington during World War II. Also surviving are two other sons, Robert Jr., of Livingston, and Hamilton, of New York; three daughters, Elizabeth K. Hicks of Greenwich, Conn., and Rose K. Lansbury and Katharine W. Kean, both of New York; 22 grandchildren, and 18 great-grandchildren.

969-> COMPANY NEWS; Tate & Lyle Adds $3 To Its Offer for Staley
Tate & Lyle P.L.C. raised its offer today for Staley Continental Inc. to 1.42 billion, or $35 a share. The cash tender offer, which expires May 10, came a week after Staley, a maker of corn syrup, rejected Tate & Lyle's bid of 1.33 billion, or $32 a share. Tate & Lyle, a London-based sugar producer, made its first offer on April 8. Shares of Staley, which is based in Rolling Meadows, Ill., rose 50 cents yesterday, to $37, on the New York Stock Exchange. Staley declined to comment on the new offer. ''We haven't seen anything on it yet,'' said G. David Satterfield, a Staley spokesman. Tate & Lyle is Britain's second-largest sugar refiner; Staley is the second-largest refiner of corn sweeteners in the United States, behind the ARcher-Daniels-Midland Company of Decatur, Ill. Industry analysts had said that Tate & Lyle's initial bid for Staley's 3.04 million common shares outstanding was well below the company's fair-market price, which some estimated to be about $40 a share. The new offer ''indicates the seriousness by Tate & Lyle to make a deal with Staley,'' said Clinton Mayer 3d, an analyst in New York with Bear, Stearns & Company. Tate & Lyle owns about 5 percent of Staley's stock and is interested in the A.E. Staley Manufacturing Company subsidiary, which produces corn sweeteners. Staley Continental also owns CFS Continental Inc., a leading food-service supplier that it acquired in early 1985.

971-> SPORTS PEOPLE; Cards Contact Horner
The St. Louis Cardinals, starting an immediate search for power after the loss of Jack Clark, have held preliminary discussions with Bob Horner. ''At this point, we're talking,'' Horner said last night from his home near Dallas. ''Obviously, there's a fit there.'' Clark signed a free-agent contract with the Yankees Wednesday, leaving the Cardinals without their only proven power hitter. Clark hit 35 of the club's 94 home runs last season. The Cardinals' general manager, Dal Maxvill, said the Cardinals would consider dipping into the free-agent pool, a practice they have avoided in the past. Horner, 30 years old, is the only home-run hitter remaining among free agents. He played last season in Japan and batted .327 with 31 homers and 73 runs batted in for Yakult. The first baseman said he wants to return to the United States. Horner made $1.8 million in 1986, his last year with the Braves. Yakult signed Horner for about $2 million, including benefits and incentives. Atlanta and the Texas Rangers have expressed interest in Horner, although neither has offered more than $1 million.

975-> THEATER; AN EERIE TALE OF CIVILIZATION AND THE JUNGLE
In ''Juan Darien,'' by the Uru-guayan short-story writer Horacio Quiroga, a woman's compassion transforms an orphaned tiger cub into a child. Then the fear and cruelty of her neighbors change the boy back into a savage jungle beast. Elliot Goldenthal, the co-author and composer of a new production inspired by this 70-year-old story, says that the tale has haunted him since he first encountered it 12 years ago. ''It has fragments of mystical resonances. It's not exactly a Passion Play. It's not exactly Joan of Arc, not exactly the Inquisition. But it has a heartbeat in that area.'' In 1980, when he met Julie Taymor, the director, puppeteer and designer, he suggested that they stage the piece together. ''A story about transformation is so perfect for the use of puppetry and masks,'' Ms. Taymor explains. The two New York-based artists began to work together, but on other projects - a version of Thomas Mann's ''Transposed Heads,'' and, most recently, ''Liberty's Taken'' and ''The Taming of the Shrew.'' Now, eight years and six collaborations after Mr. Goldenthal first proposed it, their ''Juan Darien'' is coming to life, opening at St. Clement's Church on West 46th Street on Tuesday. At an early rehearsal in the church, the work's disturbing themes lurk in the background as everyone concentrates on logistics. ''To make things move magically,'' Ms. Taymor says, ''there are a lot of quirks to work out on the technical end of things.'' In one scene, a skeleton in a derby is hoofing a little jig - but the actor handling the life-size puppet can't get its head to cock quite right. In another, a canopy of jungle foliage that must descend from the ceiling requires three people to control it, but all except two are busy at the moment with giant lizards and tigers. The actors running the butterflies are being forced to operate at half-speed, because the musicians haven't gotten the wildly complex ''Gloria'' - on keyboards, marimba, Indonesian drum, trumpet and tuba - up to tempo yet. But even with the quirks and creaks not yet ironed out, with the all-important lighting not yet plotted, a magical and dangerous world is crystallizing. Just after a miniature funeral procession mounts the paths of a hillside village, past tiny terra-cotta-roofed stucco houses, giant close-ups of mourners appear around the stage. Oversized masks and bas-relief puppets present sharp-planed copper faces distorted with grief; sculptured hands hold heads or reach out in supplication. Meanwhile, the sound of a dirge swells in from behind the village. Ancient Mayan clay pipes wail and flutter dissonances above church harmonies; a tuba bellows from below. In the tiny village, a foot-high house-wall lights up as a shadow screen. In silhouette, a mother cradles her child. Then the entire village rotates, and the scene changes to the inside of the hut. The mother is cradling a coffin. In visual imagery as well as music, Ms. Taymor and Mr. Goldenthal tried to capture the Quiroga story's sense of living at the border between the jungle, with its natural beauty and savagery, and civilization, with its refinement and cruelty. They describe their play as a ''carnival Mass.'' Ms. Taymor says, ''It's showing the conflict between religion - specifically in South America the Catholic church - and the jungle, the natural state of man. You have the theme of the beast, the jaguar, against the human. From the human point of view, the jaguar is constantly devouring the human. And the human fights back against the primitiveness and the baseness with religion.'' To create a sense of earthiness, Ms. Taymor used natural materials in her staging. ''Even though I have in the past used different kinds of mirror-plexiglass and electric light for shadow puppets, I'm going back to using leather and fire here. It's much more tactile and sensual and really supports the story. We use real torches, candles and a Bengal light structure, our own version of fireworks.'' Ms. Taymor, who is 35 years old, has studied masks and puppetry in Eastern Europe, Japan and Indonesia. (She went to Indonesia for three months on a grant and stayed for four years.) ''Juan Darien'' incorporates and adapts ideas from all over. Its techniques include a Punch-and-Judy style schoolhouse with little glove-puppet urchins; a life-size Bunraku-type doll, manipulated by three handlers; masks that recall the Bread and Puppet Theater; a version of Indonesian shadow puppets, and ''black theater'' effects, in which handlers, shrouded in black, disappear behind walls of light. The use of masks and puppets in ''Juan Darien,'' she says, intensifies the action. ''All those gestures are even more touching because it's an inanimate object, and you know that. You see gesture anew; you don't take it for granted. Every single thing is like being under a microscope.'' Only three actors in the 11-member ''Juan Darien'' company - Barbara Pollitt, Stephen Kaplin and Willie C. Barnes - had done puppetry before. The others brought a range of talent and experience. The South-African-born singer Thuli Dumakude played Lady Macbeth in the Zulu ''Macbeth'' and the title role in ''Poppie Nongena.'' Nicholas Gunn was a principal dancer with the Paul Taylor Dance Company for 10 years. Ariel Ashwell performed movement-theater in Mexico for eight years. Andrea Kane has studied Beijing Opera technique. This diverse ensemble has risen to the exceptional demands of the work, Ms. Taymor says. ''It's not a normal art form. To puppeteer means you have to survive hundreds of pounds on your back, be hidden under black cloth, be in painful positions. And your own person isn't there. You're putting all your talent into manipulating another creature.'' In an uncanny way, these ''other creatures'' have become part of the company. During one break, an actress rescued the infant-Juan doll from the dancing skeleton and casually held him, like a baby, while she consulted Ms. Taymor. Later, the stage manager called out a direction, ''Juan, look at your mother''; she was addressing a puppet. While the plot of this new ''Juan Darien'' mostly follows the Quiroga tale, its text comes from the Catholic Requiem Mass - plus the ''Gloria,'' a bit of Quiroga's original story, and a poem written in Spanish by Mr. Goldenthal. The play is entirely sung, in Latin and Spanish. Ms. Taymor explains: ''We felt that if you didn't understand the words, the musicality of the language would be much more apparent. Latin and Spanish have so much beauty. And in the Requiem Mass you don't need to understand what each of the words means to get incredible feeling from the language.'' In the few places where the audience needs to understand the text literally, staging devices fill the gap. In one case, little Juan recites his school lessons in Spanish while writing them in English; in another, an old-fashioned ''cranky,'' a hand-rolled scroll, gives the translation. It would fracture the feeling too much, Mr. Goldenthal says, ''if someone came in and said in English, 'Oh, my God! The boy's a tiger!' '' The Mass, in Mr. Goldenthal's hands, is an eclectic mix of refinement and rawness. While he uses only one excerpt of the traditional ''Dies Irae'' music, ''played by a tuba in a carnival manner, over and over again, maniacally,'' he weaves plain-chant melodies and church harmonies all through the work. ''It's very common in Spanish songs, even in Caribbean music,'' he says, ''to hear 'Ave Maria' in the middle of a very sexy song.'' Mr. Goldenthal's aim has been to ''try to create a multilayered work that has a tremendously developed rhythmic and contrapuntal structure and still brings us back to the terra-cotta world that the set and the masks evoke.'' The musical fabric of ''Juan Darien'' includes Japanese taiko drums, African shakers and slit drums, Indian temple gongs, Mayan clay flutes and death whistles and an Australian aborigine didjeridu. The non-tempered scales and pitches of these instruments mix in with sounds of a marimba, tubas, trumpets, a violin, an upright piano ''that's slightly out of tune, the way I like it'' and four ''hopelessly in-tune synthesizers that we're kicking around enough to make them blend.'' The global bent in his music, the 33-year-old Mr. Goldenthal says, developed from his love of American jazz. Through his older brother, who had connections with some jazz artists, he met such legendary performers as Charles Mingus and Miles Davis. He started out, he says, ''appreciating the underbelly of musical culture and then fell in love with the European masters, Mahler and blah, blah, blah.'' Although he has explored other traditions a little (''I like the boniness and edginess of two-part harmony that I've heard in some Hispanic and also Bulgarian culture''), the non-Western sound in his music, he says, is home grown. ''It is in the air -somewhere in Brooklyn, at Smith and Ninth Street, possibly - but it's there.'' Despite his affinity for jazz, Mr. Goldenthal leaves no room for improvisation in ''Juan Darien.'' Every note has been written, reconsidered and set: ''My main instrument,'' he says, ''is the eraser.'' It is a difficult, virtuoso score for eight musicians: ''It can't be read in a four-day rehearsal. It must be worked up, almost in mountain-climber fashion, day by day, until the gig.'' For all its technical complication and exoticism, ''Juan Darien'' is personal and immediate for its creators. ''It's about compassion,'' Mr. Goldenthal says, ''and it's about bigotry. My mother was Catholic, and my father's Jewish. When that's going on, it heightens your awareness of bigotry. Maybe you're the outsider on Wednesday and then on Thursday you're not. So why shouldn't you identify with a boy who's perceived as the enemy?'' Ms. Taymor adds: ''Juan doesn't know he's a jaguar. He's a little boy. It's the people's fear and hatred that make him become the jungle beast they accuse him of being. He's turned into a jaguar forever.''

976-> ECONOMIC SCENE; Slower Spending And Fed's Policy
THE American economy grew faster in the final quarter of 1987 than most economists expected. But since most of the gain was due to an unintended surge of inventories, a sharp slowdown in the economy appears to be in the works. While it is not yet the general view, some economists think a 1988 recession may have begun. The Commerce Department estimates that the real gross national product ran at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $3.87 trillion in the October-December quarter, up 4.2 percent. The consensus of economists surveyed by Blue Chip Indicators this month was for a fourth-quarter gain of only 2.1 percent. Yet the economy was, oddly enough, not stronger but weaker than expected in the fourth quarter. Final sales - real G.N.P. minus the increase in inventories - barely rose, at an annual rate of six-tenths of 1 percent. Inventories increased by $58.3 billion, measured in 1982 dollars, in the fourth quarter; that was more than twice as much as the $24.6 billion inventory rise in the third quarter. Much of the extra bulge in inventories was involuntary, as consumption, in 1982 dollars, fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $2.5 trillion, from $2.52 trillion in the third quarter. Apparently the ''wealth effect'' - the damage to consumer spending resulting from the October stock market collapse - took a considerable toll in the final months of 1987. And the sluggishness of consumption appears to be continuing into the new year. But is it fallout from the stock market plunge that is hurting consumer spending or, as some economists think, an excessively tight Federal Reserve monetary policy, which could push the economy into recession? William Niskanen, a former member of President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, said the data released this week ''suggest we've got a recession under way unless there's an easing of monetary policy.'' Clearly the money supply grew very slowly during the second half of 1987. M-1 - the sum of currency, traveler's checks, demand deposits and other checkable deposits - grew 3.1 percent from December 1986 through December 1987, but its monthly rate of increase dropped from more than 14 percent in the first half of 1987 to less than 3 percent in the six months through November. Similarly, M-2 - a broader measure of the money supply, comprising M-1 plus overnight repurchase agreements, Eurodollars, money market funds and savings and small time deposits -grew at a trifle faster rate of 3.4 percent for the year as a whole, but again monetary growth in the second half was markedly slower than in the first. And M-3 - a still broader measure, with M-1, M-2 and such other items as large time deposits and institutions' money market funds - grew 4.9 percent last year, with slower second-half growth. What explains the second-half slowdown in the monetary aggregates? The obvious explanation -but not necessarily the correct one - is the accession of Alan Greenspan in midsummer to the chairmanship of the Federal Reserve Board, replacing Paul A. Volcker. Was Mr. Greenspan, a Republican who had been close to President Reagan since the 1980 political campaign, seeking to prove his independence as Fed chairman and his anti-inflationary fervor? Was he behaving more as a monetarist, with greater concerns about reducing the growth of the monetary aggregates than the pragmatic Mr. Volcker? (After testing ''operational monetarism'' as a way to stop inflation in 1981-82, Mr. Volcker swung to monetary stimulus when the deep recession threatened to get out of hand.) It is far from clear that Mr. Greenspan meant to slow the growth of the monetary aggregates as much as occurred. Prof. Philip W. Bell of Rice University stresses that the Fed does not have as complete short-run control over the growth of the money supply as many people assume. He explains this by distinguishing between the monetary base (the Fed's deposit and currency liabilities, which are altered by open-market purchases and sales of securities) and M-1 (deposit liabilities of commercial banks plus currency liabilities of the Fed). ''The monetary base, over which the Fed can exercise tight control,'' Professor Bell says, ''often goes in opposite directions to M-1 for considerable periods of time because of changing actual reserve ratios of commercial banks.'' Did the Fed really mean to slow M-1 growth so much? From December 1986 to December 1987 the monetary base grew 7.2 percent, more than twice as fast as M-1. The currency component of M-1 grew 8.8 percent, bank reserves only 2.1 percent. Whatever its reasons, the Fed does appear to have held an extremely tight grip on monetary expansion during the second half of 1987. The threat of an unbalanced economy and a recession, manifest in the new G.N.P. data, may cause the Fed to ease its monetary policy and bring down interest rates. That hope gave a lift to the bond market, pushing yields and interest rates down.

977-> THEATER; The Theme Is War at 2 Theaters
IN ITS pursuit of out-of-the-way plays, which is just what makes the company distinctive, the Penguin Repertory can go wildly astray. And so it has with ''Waiting for the Parade'' by John Murrell, which was produced Off Off Broadway in 1981 and is holding forth at the Barn Playhouse through next Sunday. An American playwright who lives in Calgary, Alberta, Mr. Murrell interviewed women in the town about their home-front experiences during World War II. The play, culled from their reminiscences, consists of five women, each representing a member of the Red Triangle Hostesses, a volunteer group that reportedly operated a U.S.O.-like center in a Calgary train station where soldiers dropped in. In short, choppy scenes and in addressing the audience, the women tell about the effects of the war on their uneventful lives. When dramatic inspiration or momentum runs out, which is often, they burst into period songs (''The White Cliffs of Dover'' and ''You'll Never Know''), which also are played live on an on-stage piano or heard on off-stage recordings. Indeed, the Andrews Sisters provide the most welcome sounds of the evening, and the women are jitterbugging in the very first scene, thus giving the play an instant nostalgic angle. Which amounts to a handy gimmick, for Mr. Murrell has not transfused his research with the stuff of theater. Out of ordinary people and ordinary talk, he has come up with a less-than-ordinary play. Even though one hardly sees the women engaging in activities more varied than bandage-rolling or filling paper bags (''air raid evacuation parcels'') with supplies, the director Joe Brancato and a good cast have imparted some energy to Mr. Murrell's perfectly dreary, synthetic material. Occasionally, slides render an ominous reminder of the war or an evocative sign of the times, as seen through the windows of Dennis W. Moyes's amorphous but appropriately drab set. The actresses assembled herein appear able enough to cut through Mr. Murrell's stereotype characters. Penny Templeton plays a wayward wife whose husband is reported missing in action. Referred to as an ''Ann Sheridan type,'' she offers the observation that ''everybody is a war widow.'' Ms. Templeton suggests that she has the resourcefulness to reveal the insecurity behind the facade of carefree sensuality, but this is such a stock role that it doesn't give her a chance to do much more than giggle and look good. Lori Wilner, no doubt, can transcend her character type: The bossy, disliked woman in charge. And if there were a smidgeon of coherence to the scene in which she loses her reserve and delivers a monologue to her husband, a radio newscaster who has avoided the draft, one might have seen a dramatic moment come to life. Judy Stadt convincingly goes through the stoic heroics of a German-born shopkeeper whose father is arrested as a spy. And then there are Mary Diveny as the dour, lonely mother of two sons, one of whom is arrested for passing around anti-war propaganda, and Eileen Shea as a prim schoolteacher who is infatuated with Leslie Howard - and gets to hear the news of his death. By the time melodramatic revelations roll around, or plot resolutions, such as who will die and which characters will burst into a brawl, the predictability factor has already made it all redundant. And with the announcement that the war is over, the women, presumably, get the parade that the title refers to while the audience is still waiting for the play. * It has been more than three years since ''Tracers'' was first presented in New York City by the Vietnam Veterans Ensemble Theater Company, and seven and a half years since its premiere in Los Angeles. Since then, the horror of Vietnam has been the subject of a spate of films - highlighted, perhaps, by the prize-winning ''Platoon'' - and numerous television series and documentaries. Still, the primal, kinetic force of ''Tracers'' is undiminished. And as a piece of theater, it remains unrivaled. Plays ranging from David Rabe's ''Sticks and Bones'' to Lanford Wilson's ''Fifth of July'' have dealt with the war's harrowing effects, and some playwrights have attempted, badly, to recreate, in graphic theatrical terms, the Vietnam experience. However, it is not likely that any one writer could capture the authenticity and rhythms of language -spaced out, profane, funny, lyric and military, and all with a sense of time and place - of such a collaborative work as ''Tracers.'' It was written by eight veterans, who developed the work through improvisations, rap sessions and various other techniques combining theater and therapy, and it evolved and changed over several years. For all its initial power, ''Tracers'' could have gone down as one striking, freaky flash-in-the-pan, to be remembered but not revisited. What is being proved by the co-production between Montclair's Whole Theatre, where ''Tracers'' concluded a three-week run last Sunday, and New Brunswick's George Street Playhouse, where performances will resume on Wednesday and run through April 3, is that ''Tracers'' has a lasting value, not just an instant impact, and that it is as stirring a piece of writing as it is a stage collage. For the current New Jersey engagement - a touring version, consisting of one-night stands performed mostly on college campuses, passed through the state last year - John DiFusco, who is credited with the original conception and direction and is one of the listed writers, has returned to the cast in the role of Dinky Dau. In fact, the entire cast is still composed of Vietnam veterans. Of the remaining seven members, Anthony Chisholm (as Little John) and Jim Tracy (as Scooter) appeared in the New York production at the Public Theater. ''Tracers,'' which refers to bullets that make streaks in the sky, can rightfully be called a play. This is a genuine piece of dramatic literature, what with all its reliance on military simulations, choreographic and pyrotechnic effects, strobe lights, cacophony and a powerful, indispensible rock and roll score by the Doors, Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, Bruce Springsteen and others. As a piece of writing, ''Tracers'' explores the violent urges, the nightmare as well as the lure of war. In fact, right up to its final recurring lines - ''How does it feel to kill somebody?'' - the play is devastating.

978-> About Men; Rights and Choices
WHAT CAN A MAN do when the woman carrying the child they both deliberately created has a change of heart? What can a man do when the woman he loves wants an abortion and he passionately does not? I should be a contented husband this winter morning. And a new father as well, delighting in the things all new parents delight in - the pink, squinched face; the perfect, impossibly small feet; the mouth at the mother's breast. Instead, my once-betrothed and I are 1,000 miles apart, both of us heartbroken, recovering slowly from the demolishment of our love. We have not spoken much in more than six months. Her voice on the phone only awakens a crushing sadness in me that flattens anything I try to say, and her misgivings about what she did are too terrible to hear. Relationships are complicated nowadays. Especially for those of us who've been around the track a time or two. When we met, summer before last, she was on the verge of what was bound to be a wrenching divorce - her second, in fact. She and her husband lived on the West Coast and had a 3-year-old daughter. She had come to Vermont, where I live, to visit a friend we had in common, and to gather the will and stamina she knew she would need to end the marriage. Shaking hands that sunny afternoon in our friend's studio, she and I fell in love with a jolt we could see and feel in our amazed expressions. I was 38 then, and had never been married. Like many men (and women) these days, I set aside that intricate issue in my 20's to devote myself to the singular pursuit of a career, in my case as a freelance writer. Although from the beginning I've known I wanted kids, I had plenty of time, I believed, to work out the particulars. Meanwhile, my comfortable romance of several years with a woman who could not have children helped keep that distraction (and that wistful dream) at bay. Until. . . . ''I want your babies,'' she whispered the first night we made love. No one had ever breathed such words to me. I could not have imagined they would render me so suddenly ready and willing, although I understood we would endure some hard times before we would be able. Her divorce was not contentious, but it was long and painful. Eventually, she returned to the Middle Western city in which she had grown up. Love is famously frustrating enough in its unsmooth course. But when you have to lurch along for a year or more with the scanty sustenance of phone and pen in place of simple day-to-day contact, the course can prove especially difficult. Yet we made progress, and as I got to know her exceptional daughter and to admire her skills as a mother, I grew more eager than ever to marry her and have a child of my own. Our own. In time, she got herself settled in an old neighborhood of brick houses and landed an excellent position with a good company. Her family liked me and approved of our being together. And her daughter, who was to spend summers with her father on the West Coast, was pleased with the prospect of having two dads. Naturally, we wrestled with certain appropriate qualms. Could she wholeheartedly accept a partner with the uneven income of a self-employed writer? Could I, without too much resentment, leave the peace and beauty of Vermont for a drab suburb? Was she really ready - so soon - to risk commitment a third time? After being selfishly single for so long, was I really ready for instant fatherhood? But of course, in decisions as momentous as this one, you'd worry if you didn't have qualms. The love, I thought, would see us through. By last March, it seemed it had. One evening, when her daughter looked up at us from the tub and asked if we could please see about getting her a baby brother, our eyes met in promise. In early April, I surprised her with a ring. We set a date and told our parents. Once we'd declared our intentions, we decided to forge ahead with the larger agenda. Not only can it take several months for a woman in her 30's to get pregnant, but we figured a baby on the way would help us banish our more stubborn doubts. So she put away the diaphragm. By June, all of spring's sweet burgeoning wasn't occurring outside our windows. We thought up names, planned where we'd put the crib. But, as the wedding day drew nearer, her residual doubts intensified. Back in Vermont by then, trying to finish a book, I felt maddeningly at the mercy of her oceanic ambivalences. Our nightly phone conversations got us nowhere. She explained she needed more time, more time to be sure of me, and sure of herself, and to work her way clear of the pain of her divorce. Getting pregnant had been a mistake, she told me. Terrible as she knew it would be, she said she wanted an abortion. Stunned, disbelieving, convinced I could talk her out of it, I flew back there. On the plane I went over and over what I saw as the unarguable argument for having the baby. The pregnancy had imposed on us a crisis, yes, but also a wonderful opportunity. One that obliged us to act now out of faith in our love. She had to find the courage to do the positive thing, I told myself. She simply had too much love in her to default on it. The next week was the worst week of my life. She had turned leathery and cold. To her, my passionate reasoning and pleading seemed sentimental, manipulative, illogical, unfair. I was miserable and desperate. Who would help me? What was I supposed to do? Nothing. There was nothing to do. Nothing but make a lot of phone calls. My family was baffled, angry, sorrowful. Women in organizations like Right to Life and Birthright expressed helpless sympathy and sent me pamphlets. Finally, one morning I had to tell her that if she truly meant to have the abortion, I could not bear to stay with her while she did it nor to look at her afterward. If she meant to do it, I would leave now. She could accept that, she said. We kissed and wept, and I flew home. I phoned a friend of hers a week or so later and learned she had gone through with it. Now, months later, I still can't comprehend it. I believe in every woman's right to choose - not as zealously as I used to, maybe, yet I continue to support that right. But what about a man's choice? Who, I need to know, will believe in that?

984-> After the Primary Primaries
Nouvelle Hampshire, The Washington Post called it, and the change can be seen in the old brick factory buildings in Manchester. Forlorn eight years ago, they now gleam with electronics businesses. Boutiques abound. Parking spots do not. Something else has changed. The once-crotchety voters of New Hampshire took their screening responsibility seriously. For one thing, they turned out in great numbers. The Democratic vote rose to 125,000, up a quarter from 1984. The Republican vote, uncontested in 1984, doubled, to 159,000. In the process, the voters clarified two broad themes. What's striking among the Republicans is the similarity of their two leading candidates. The Democratic race, meanwhile, may once more turn on the difference between two Democratic parties. The campaign now charges on toward the 20 election events of March 8, Super Tuesday. That primitive national primary may or may not impel further change in the screening process. But either way, given the present system, New Hampshire, like Iowa, did its job. Historically, primaries polarize their parties because they attract the most active partisans. This year is different, at least among the Republicans. With the departure of Alexander Haig and Pete du Pont, the race between Vice President Bush and Senator Bob Dole grows steadily more tense. Bitter over his nine-point New Hampshire loss, Mr. Dole lets his cold-eyed temper show. But the tension is personal. This is not a battle for the soul of the Republican Party. Both men have long experience and centrist Republican views. It is hard to distinguish between them on substance. Mr. Dole, declaring the deficit the first priority, would attack it with a spending freeze. Mr. Bush claims he has a better way: a ''flexible'' freeze, permitting some choices - choices Senator Dole would probably approve. Vice President Bush declares his unswerving support for the Euromissile treaty. Senator Dole claims higher credit because he took pains to study the treaty before declaring his support. To be sure, further over on the right, Jack Kemp and Pat Robertson still fight for a share of the spotlight. But the Bush-Dole competition turns on personality and preparation, not policies or proposals, thus reflecting how far right Ronald Reagan has moved the Republican center. The Democrats strongly supported Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts. But Richard Gephardt of Missouri, the Iowa winner, found reason for cheer in the voters he won. There is a dismaying ring of protectionism and farm favoritism in Mr. Gephardt's positions. His opponents mock his flip-flops on issues like the Reagan tax cut and the MX missile. But in New Hampshire as in Iowa, he connected with a sizable slice of voters. They are not just blue-collar, not just rural, not just elderly, not just people upset about America's slipping world trade and prestige. They are the voters analysts call ''disaffected Democrats.'' It's a familiar slice of the spectrum. Indeed, for years, Democratic politics could be decoded by thinking of two parties, liberal versus conservative - enthusiasts for George McGovern versus those for Scoop Jackson. Jimmy Carter bridged the gap in 1976; in 1980, many conservative Democrats defected. And in 1984 the gap widened. In the Democratic South, 66 percent of white men voted Republican. Can Mr. Gephardt position himself, especially against Senator Albert Gore, as the candidate of the conservative Democrats? Is it possible to do so without driving liberals away? Super Tuesday will help decide. Though once focused on conservative Southern Democrats, the event will reach across America. That explains why Governor Dukakis positions himself as a national candidate. Super Tuesday may transform America's views of the screening process, perhaps enhancing the likelihood of a national primary next time around. This time, under these rules, Iowa and New Hampshire did their work and did it well.

987-> Strategies for the Dollar-Wise
>Despite all of the dollar's gyrations over the last year, American travelers should not be disheartened -traveling in many countries costs only slightly more than it did a year ago, and in many places Americans will find it costs less. Americans will, of course, find life overseas far more expensive than it was in 1985, when the dollar was so strong that a record number of Americans - some 6.4 million - flocked abroad. They knew that a life of affordable luxury was within their grasp as soon as they hopped on an overseas flight. That sunny picture clouded over in 1986, when the plunging dollar and fears about terrorism caused the number of American tourists to fall far below the previous year. In 1987, tourists regrouped as terrorism receded, and their numbers recovered some lost ground - despite an even weaker dollar. Now, in 1988, many travel experts predict that at least as many Americans - estimated at 6.1 million - will venture abroad as last year. ''Since the dollar stabilized in January, bookings have been picking up,'' said Nicholas Tarsh, president of Insight International Tours, a London-based travel company. ''People are less anxious that the dollar is going to keep on falling.'' Luigi Coppe, an official with the Rome Tourist Board, added: ''The level of the dollar is pretty much about where it was last year, so we're expecting about the same number of American tourists and perhaps an increase.'' Over the last year, the dollar has fallen just 4 percent against the Italian lira, 6 percent against the French franc and 7 percent against the German mark. At the same time, it has fallen more than 10 percent against the British pound and Japanese yen. These declines are part of a plunge that has seen the dollar fall 40 percent or more against most major currencies since it experienced its extraordinary surge of strength in 1985. Tourists who take the long-term view can take heart, however, that the dollar remains stronger in France, Britain, Italy and many other countries than it was in 1981 - a more normal year than 1985. Latin America, Australia, India, Greece and Portugal are all very affordable. In Athens, $25 will still buy a respectable meal for two, while at Gato Dumas, one of Buenos Aires's finest restaurants, dinner for two costs about $32. In Rio de Janeiro, a ticket for a Las Vegas-type floor show at the Scala or Plataforma costs just $16. Even in the pricier tourist destinations, such as France, Britain and Italy, you don't have to be a Sherlock Holmes to uncover good buys. In London, a ticket to a West End play averages $21, compared with an average of about $10 more on Broadway. For about $7 you can buy a ticket to an excellent play at one of London's fringe theaters. In many scenic French villages far from Paris, it is not hard to find a surprisingly good four-course dinner for $20 a person. ''There are still a lot of bargains in France,'' said Colette Martin, an official with France's Ministry of Tourism. ''If you know a little French and have a little resourcefulness, it's easy to find good deals if you go somewhere other than Paris, the Riviera or the Loire Valley.'' But, then, there's the other side: The price of a room at Munich's prestigious Vier Jahreszeiten hotel has inched up from 335 German marks in 1985 to 365 marks today. But, in dollar terms, the price has soared from $100 to $215. And at a nearby beer hall, a beer that cost you 70 cents in 1985 now goes for $1.50. Like West Germany, Japan prides itself on stable prices. Thus, while a ticket on the Shinkansen super express train from Tokyo to Kyoto has remained at 12,600 yen for two years, the price for Americans has soared from $53 to $100. In the big cities of Italy, domestic inflation caused in part by the nation's economic boom has combined with the plunging dollar to create ''lira shock'' for American tourists. At La Rosetta, a fine Sicilian seafood restaurant near the Pantheon, meals that went for 45,000 lire a person in 1985 now cost 93,000. In dollar terms, prices have risen far more: what used to cost $30 now costs $75. To attract Americans, dozens of hotels have pledged to freeze their rates. For example, several of London's best hotels, including Claridges, the Savoy and the Berkeley, have promised not to raise prices through September. Of course, double rooms already run around $300 a night. Meanwhile, the French Government is starting a $4 million advertising campaign designed to convince Americans that France remains affordable. A Government brochure notes that the elegant Pullman Windsor off the Champs-Elysees is offering rooms for $89 a night this summer, while elsewhere in France the Pullman chain is offering rooms for $69. Probably the best index of how much prices have changed for the American tourist is the State Department's per diem travel allowances for Federal employees traveling abroad on business. Those allowances, which cover food and lodging at moderately priced establishments plus tips, tax and laundry, take into account local inflation as well as the effects of the falling dollar. According to the State Department figures for January, Paris is the most expensive city in Europe, with a daily allowance of $194, up 15 percent from last year and 106 percent from 1985. For Rome, the allowance is $156, up 8 percent from last year and 90 percent from 1985. (Remember that in Italy there are many spectacular towns that are far cheaper than Rome. In Siena, for example, the per diem allowance is $116). The rate for London is $192, for Geneva it is $161 and for Cologne $182. According to the State Department, the most expensive city is Tokyo, which thanks to the soaring yen is $242 a day. The per diem allowances provide an excellent guide to finding less expensive places to visit. For New Delhi, the allowance is $96, up 22 percent from last year. Even so, a couple can stay at the Hotel Imperial, not a luxury hotel but still quite respectable, for about $58 a night. A good seat to a concert or dance performance costs about $4, and the most lavish meal in town costs about $25 a person. For Mexico City the per diem rate is $74, compared with $65 last year. A double room in a good hotel in Mexico City costs $40 to $60 a night and, in a luxury hotel, $80 to $120. Dinner for two at any of the city's better restaurants costs $20 to $35. Admission to many museums, including the famed National Museum of Anthropology, costs less than a dollar. For a couple, a week in Mexico City will cost from a spartan $400 to a very comfortable $1,400, but in such beautiful towns as Oaxaca, Guanajuato and San Miguel Allende, a week will cost a third less. Among the best shopping bargains are ceramics, Oaxaca rugs for $25 and brass-framed mirrors for about $30. Like many other Latin American currencies, the Mexican peso has been deval-ued recently as a result of the third world debt crisis. Such devaluations aim to make local goods cheaper for Americans, but also make foreign goods more expensive in Latin America. American visitors should remember this if they are sitting in a bar in Buenos Aires or Rio and thinking of ordering an imported Scotch. An American couple in Brazil was recently charged $9 for a whisky. To see how far your dollar goes in Australia, go to a pub and you will pay just 85 cents for a 10-ounce bottle of beer. A good hotel in Sydney costs about $70, while for $50 you can have a fine meal for two while trying some of Australia's wines. IN Europe, Greece remains a magnet for cost-conscious travelers, with the per diem allowance for Athens set at $84. That city's taxis are the cheapest in Western Europe, costing just $1.40 for a two-mile ride. A room for two at the President Hotel costs about $38. In Greece, shopping bargains include leather (a good leather handbag sells for $75) and jewelry (a 14-karat gold bracelet averages $250). In Lisbon the per diem rate is $115. A good fish dinner at the Espelho de Agua, a fashionable riverside restaurant in Belem, a Lisbon suburb, costs just $30 for two. Good buys include leather goods, linens and hand-painted tiles. Indeed, travelers can find one of Europe's most breathtaking buys in Portugal: a glorious ferryboat ride across the huge Tagus River costs just 40 cents. One way to save money while traveling is to take public transportation rather than private. In Stockholm, the airport bus costs about $6.50; a taxi runs about $45. It also helps to do comparison shopping. ''Government price controls have been eliminated for two- and three-star hotels in Paris, so it really pays to shop around to compare the different rates,'' said Marie Christine Bourgeois, an official with the France National Hotel Association. If you plan to visit many cities in a short time, a Eurail pass might be for you. Such a pass costs $298 for 15 days of unlimited travel. Many countries have their own rail passes. In London, for $:2 ($3.50) you can obtain a ''Go as You Please'' travel pass entitling you to unlimited use of London's buses and underground for a day. Paris has a similar pass. Before you buy rail passes or Metro passes, make sure you are going to do enough traveling within that period to make the investment worthwhile. Buying a package is often cheaper than arranging your hotel and air fare yourself - especially in the age of a seesawing dollar. Many travel companies bought airline seats, theater tickets and chartered buses late last year at group rates when the dollar was stronger than it is now. An admittedly biased observer, Mr. Tarsh of Insight International Tours, said, ''We did a lot of bulk buying in December at a better rate for the dollar, whereas anyone buying individually has to pay individual prices and at a less good exchange rate.'' There are other ways to stretch your dollars: Many hotels are starting to have weekend discounts, and a few have senior citizen discounts. If you want a nice meal, it often costs less to have it at lunch than at dinner. For example, at Kallaren Diana in Stockholm's Old Town, a respectable fish or game meal, without drinks, costs $10 at lunchtime. At dinnertime, a similar meal costs $45. Music and theater doesn't have to be expensive. London and Paris have half-price ticket booths like those in New York. At the summer Proms concerts in London, you can see world-class conductors for about $5 a ticket. If you're intent on buying clothes abroad, the bargains remain in leather goods. In Lisbon, Portuguese-made Charles Jourdan shoes sell for $40. Spain and Argentina are excellent places to buy leather jackets, but in recent years the price of leather goods has risen in Italy and Brazil. Although luxury hotels and restaurants in London have risen steeply in price in recent years - in not only dollar but also in pound sterling terms - London still offers many affordable places to stay and eat. Moderate-priced hotels and bed and breakfasts have not jacked up their prices as much as deluxe ones. ''PEOPLE often think only about staying at the Ritz, but there are an awful lot of nice London hotels that cost a lot less than that,'' said Duncan Bluck, chairman of the British Tourist Authority. ''And as you move out of London into the country, the bargains become much more obvious.'' Travelers should also remember that, even in expensive cities like Tokyo, they should not abandon all hope of finding good value. The secret is, when in Japan do what the Japanese do. Thus, while a hotel breakfast in Tokyo often runs about $16, at a coffee shop around the block, where the Japanese eat, you can have a cup of coffee, bread and an egg for about $3. Many restaurants offer a bargain lunchtime menu called Teishoku for about $8. Another option is to sit next to some white collar workers who often crowd into Yakitori restaurants, where a filling meal with drinks costs about $20. While a room for two in a moderate hotel in Tokyo can easily run to $150 a night, you can get a room in a Japanese inn for about $60 - while enjoying the experience of sleeping on a futon. Indeed, by following this advice, an American couple can, miraculously enough, spend a week in Tokyo for about $1,000.

989-> 26 Cruise Ships Fail on Health
Only 32 of the 58 cruise ships that regularly sail to the United States met Government health standards, the Centers for Disease Control has reported. The Jan. 9 inspections also showed that poor health conditions on ship or shore probably caused three recent outbreaks of diarrhea. One outbreak -defined as an illness reported by more than 3 percent of the passengers - affected 60 percent of the passengers on a cruise ship arriving on the East Coast from South America. Critics of shipboard sanitation said the report is not a good omen for the Reagan Administration's plan to turn the job of inspecting cruise ships over to private contractors. Vernon N. Houk, director of the C.D.C. Center for Environmental Health, who released the figures, denied that the ''privatization'' plan already under way would reduce health standards. The C.D.C., he said, will review the work of the private inspectors. The C.D.C. has no power to block the ships, almost all of which dock in Florida, from sailing. Cruise industry leaders who reviewed the figures at a C.D.C. meeting in New York City on Wednesday said failure to meet the Government's standards doesn't necessarily mean a cruise ship is unsafe, or that conditions aboard ship cause an illness that can come from other sources. The leaders said the rate of reported illnesses has dropped to less than one per million passenger days. But two health consultants warned that the Government should not abandon its own inspections amid deteriorating health standards on some ships.

Mr. Symington, the assistant editor at the United States Tax Court in Washington, graduated from the Deerfield Academy and Yale. His father, a Democrat, was elected to Congress in 1968 from the Second District of Missouri and served through 1976; he is now a partner in the Washington law firm of O'Connor & Hannan. The future bridegroom is a grandson of Stuart Symington of New Canaan, Conn., a former Democratic Senator from Missouri, and of the late Evelyn Wadsworth Symington; and a great-grandson of the late James W. Wadsworth Jr., a Republican Senator and later a Representative from New York. He is a grandson also of the late Carl H.

992-> SPORTS PEOPLE; N.H.L. Kills a Penalty
ONE game after Bob McCammon began serving a five-game suspension, the National Hockey League has rescinded the suspension and a $1,000 fine levied against the Vancouver coach in the aftermath of a brawl between the Canucks and Islanders last Tuesday. But the league increased the Canucks' team fine from $10,000 to $25,000 and upheld the 10-game suspension of Dave Richter, a Vancouver defenseman. Richter left the penalty box at the end of the second period and got involved in a shouting match with Billy Smith of the Islanders, sparking a free-for-all. The league originally ruled that the coach was responsible for the actions of his players. But he argued that he had no chance to prevent the confrontation because he was 85 feet away from Richter when the defenseman left the penalty box.(AP)

993-> A Bad Judgment on a Good Law
A divided Federal appeals court panel has ruled that there can be no special Federal prosecutor independent of the executive branch. This country is in trouble if the judgment stands. Without a law creating special prosecutors by court appointment with safeguarded independence and tenure, there is no trustworthy way to investigate high-ranking executive branch officials who come under suspicion. At present that means that the nation must rely on Attorney General Edwin Meese, the inadequate investigator of the Iran-contra affair who has himself come under independent- counsel scrutiny. The appellate court majority finds that the law violates broad separation-of-powers principles. The court says, in agreement with the Reagan Administration, that the Constitution assigns total control over the prosecutive function to the executive branch, even when the executive has a conflict of interest in investigating itself. Fortunately, the last judicial word remains to be spoken. Unless the full 11-member appeals court acts, the Supreme Court will pass on this ingenious feature of the Ethics in Government Act, a Watergate reform that Congress has twice renewed and strengthened. It is in the high court that the separation-of-powers doctrine must be tested against equally valid constitutional principles. One is checks and balances. The Constitution specifically permits Congress to vest the appointment of certain officials in the judiciary, and not just in the President. Congress did just that to prevent a recurrence of the 1973 ''Saturday night massacre,'' when President Nixon fired Archibald Cox, the Watergate prosecutor. In the absence of this independent source of authority the Reagan Administration is free to claim, as it does, that even Lawrence Walsh, the Iran-contra prosecutor, can be fired if he disobeyed a White House command. Surely the Constitution is not so rigid that high-level investigations must be incredible as well as ineffective. Does anyone think that Edwin Meese's Justice Department could have credibly investigated Michael Deaver, his former White House sidekick? Would anyone credit Mr. Meese's exoneration of criminality three years ago had it not come from a special prosecutor? The law on the independent counsel is a good law, so overwhelmingly popular in Congress that Mr. Reagan felt forced to sign it. It deserves vindication in the Supreme Court.

Actually, they are clusters of countries. The giant lending institution has 151 members. For easy reference, officials try to put them into neat little groups. Thus the HIC's are 17 Highly Indebted Countries, such as Brazil, Mexico and Argentina; the NIC's are the well-to-do newly industrialized countries, including South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong; and SSA's are 43 Sub-Saharan African countries, generally reckoned among the poorest in the world.

996-> Film: 'The Tree We Hurt'
IT'S summer 1960, in the picturesque Greek town of Chios, where people get around by donkey. School is ending, and a present-day narrator is calling up memories of the idyllic weeks he spent between fourth and fifth grades. They compose ''The Tree We Hurt,'' an unassuming Greek movie that opens today at the Public Theater. In the course of this brief holiday scrapbook, the boy assists his mother in cutting the bark of the gum tree -''the tree we hurt'' - so the gum may drip out like tears or jewels. He frolics with a stray dog, joins in anouting on the beach, frees some trapped birds and is shot at by the bird catcher. He develops a crush on a pretty girl visitor. He and his best friend, Runny-Nose Vangelis, also known as the Cat Strangler, participate in funeral processions to earn a few coins. They splash in a tiny pool, eat ice cream and smoke a cigarette. With some other kids, they make war on wasps and pick on the local lunatic. ''So the days slipped by,'' a caption informs us. Dimos Avdeliodis, who wrote and directed and plays the lunatic, was born in Chios in 1952, which would make him close to the right age for this reminiscence, and it has the feel of autobiography. The mild adventures of his young heroes seem authentic in the manner of an unusually good home movie consisting of lightly connected episodes. There are lovely scenes, such as a line of women in white kerchiefs seated on donkeys moving between whitewashed buildings. The kids, who occasionally seem to be awaiting directions from off camera, are likable and fun to be with. That's about it. Mr. Avdeliodis makes no effort to develop a story or propound a message, and his symbolism is not intrusive. ''The Tree We Hurt,'' his first feature, may leave you feeling slightly unsatisfied, but you'd have to be W. C. Fields to kick a sun-splashed movie about kids and a dog and a cat and birds and donkeys. Childhood Nostalgia THE TREE WE HURT, directed and written by Dimos Avdeliodis; directory of photography, Philipos Koutsaftis; edited by Costas Fountas; music by Dimitris Papadimitriou; produced by Mr. Avdeliodis; released by Greek Film Center.

997-> Dole and Bush: Dramatic Contrast of Styles . . . but There Is a Striking Similarity in Goals
Since the Presidential campaign began, Gerald M. Boyd has been covering Vice President Bush while Bernard Weinraub covered Senator Bob Dole. Last week they switched assignments to report how the campaigns compared in style and substance. Even as Vice President Bush and Senator Bob Dole dispute who can boast a better record of leadership, to say nothing of their discord over who is the more guilty of unfair personal attacks, the two leading Republican Presidential contenders are presenting strikingly similar models of where they would lead the country. At times almost echoing each other, they both speak of moderating the eight years of President Reagan's conservative agenda in domestic policy while continuing a course in national defense and foreign affairs that is tough and marked by skepticism about the goals of the nation's adversaries. As they appear before campaign audiences, the candidates offer the same basic approaches in areas from education to the environment to deployment of a space-based shield against nuclear attack. For example, Mr. Bush, who has made his desire to be ''President for education'' a central theme of his campaign, says that while he would not expand the Federal role in the schools, he would try to direct education's course toward solving illiteracy and returning to the ''common values'' of ''reading, writing, arithmetic and respect.'' Issuing an education policy statement at a speech in Iowa this week, Mr. Dole similarly called for re-emphasis of instruction in the basics. And he, too, argued that while education was a national concern, it was a state responsibility and a local function. ''To be blunt,'' the Senator said, ''it's not for Washington to come steal the show from parents and educators, who care the most, who are trying to address the problems and who are in the best place to judge what works.'' A Few Differences Aides to both candidates observe that some differences do exist, like Mr. Dole's conditional support for a small tax on imported oil and Mr. Bush's rigid opposition to it. Indeed, Mr. Dole is fine-tuning these differences in detailed policy statements that he has begun issuing on such domestic matters as education and the environment. While Mr. Bush says his top domestic priority would be education, Mr. Dole says he would focus more on deficit reduction, proposing an immediate across-the-board freeze on all Federal spending except that benefiting low-income people. Mr. Bush opposes that approach, arguing that the deficit can be tackled by providing the President the authority, which Mr. Dole also endorses, to eliminate individual items in a money bill without having to veto the entire measure. But the similarities between the two candidates outnumber the differences, especially in tone, which tends to be more moderate than that of their four Republican campaign rivals. While both agree with such party standards as the proposition that welfare should give way to work among those who are able, they also talk about the need for a government role in helping the homeless and combating AIDS. Dole Stresses Access to Party Mr. Dole especially has made compassion and access to the party by a wide range of groups an issue from the earliest days of the race. ''If I don't do anything else, I hope to demonstrate that the Republicans are just as sensitive, just as caring, just as compassionate,'' the Senator has said repeatedly, most recently at an appearance Friday before a group of 50 senior citizens in Grundy Center. ''There is the perception out there that we don't care. 'If you are poor, don't bother us.' '' Both candidates also evoke Theodore Roosevelt in speeches, arguing that the party must again be perceived as championing the environment, as he did. Although intractable foreign policy issues like South Africa and the Middle East seldom come up in the two candidates' speeches, in answer to questions they make similar points. Both oppose sanctions against the South African Government, while the Vice President says he would ''speak out against apartheid'' and Mr. Dole asserts, without saying what the policy should be, that ''we need a more visible'' one. Similarly, in talking about the Middle East, both candidates voice uncertainity about what can be done to bring peace to the region, although endorsing, as a first step, an international peace conference involving the United States. Support for the Contras Both candidates, too, are strong supporters of continued military aid to the rebels fighting the Government of Nicaragua, arguing that it is needed to counter Soviet influence in Central America. If there is one foreign policy issue that acutely separates the two from the rest of the Republican Presidential field, it is their support for President Reagan's treaty with the Soviet Union that, with Senate approval, would eliminate ground-launched medium-and shorter-range nuclear missiles. The other candidates have opposed the accord, which Mr. Dole endorsed after the Vice President did - a point Mr. Bush makes frequently. ''I didn't have to stand around with my finger in the air, figuring where public opinion was blowing,'' Mr. Bush has said of the treaty. ''I know it's good based on experience.'' As the two assess Soviet-American relations, they reach similar conclusions. Both call Mikhail S. Gorbachev a new brand of Soviet leader, insist that he is not to be trusted and argue that the United States must deal with him from a position of strength. But while some of their rivals, primarily Representative Jack F. Kemp of New York, have pushed for early deployment of the space-based antimissile shield, Mr. Bush and Mr. Dole caution against that approach, although supporting continued research on it.

998-> Shipmates by Choice and Chance
As the harbor of Monte Carlo came in sight, our eyes sought out and found the sleekest of sleek white vessels, quiet at her moorings. ''She's beautiful,'' I said, meaning it. Our cab-driver, a native of Nice, agreed with me. ''Oui, monsieur, but that sheep belongs to a Greek gentleman. Your sheep is over there.'' Anyone can make a mistake, and, as it happened, our sheep turned out to be just as sleek and as white as the Greek gentleman's. At 4,250 tons, Sea Goddess II is, if such an adjective may be applied to a lady, as handsome as one could hope for. We are no sooner on board than Champagne comes fizzine from one direction and the captain from another. He is a Norwegian: handsome, tanned, bearded. During the first of our two weeks on board, he will shake hands with us perhaps a dozen times, causing my wife - whose memory, if not actually bad, tends to be peculiarly selective - to say, ''Who is that man?'' At 7 P.M., we are given colored streamers for throwing, and two members of the ship's three-piece orchestra launch into a vivacious rendering of ''Anchors Aweigh,'' followed, to no one's surprise, by ''Sailing.'' As we glide out of the harbor, we raise our glasses and wave merrily toward the balconies of the aerie-like apartments where Monacans are sipping their preprandial Cinzanos. Of a breed that is not easily impressed - being at least twice as well-heeled as those on board Sea Goddess II - they look back at us stonily. From the outset, passengers were invited to treat the ship as their private yacht. During the first day or so, this led to a certain amount of glowering as Mr. A from Seattle wondered who in Sam Hill had dared to invite Mr. B from Baton Rouge, La., on board his personal ocean-going property, and Mrs. X, from Torquay in Devon, toyed with the idea of asking Mrs. Y, from Cheltenham in Gloucester, if anyone had ever told her what a stowaway was. You do not, of course, need to be rich - well, not very - to sail on board this most dreamlike of cruise ships or on her sibling, Sea Goddess I. There are hints of what you are in for, however, when you learn from the brochure that tipping is discouraged and drinks are ''complimentary.'' If I use quotes for that adjective, it is because it is synonymous with ''free,'' and nothing ever is. The cost of what one drinks is buried - or drowned, rather - in the price of the cruise. This means that the teetotalers are subsidizing their tipping brethren. It is most unfair, and I, for one, try to sympathize with them. Being Irish, I do not always succeed. Our first port of call is Bonifacio in sourthern Corsica. The town seems not so much to perch on the cliffs that loom over us as to grow out of them. We take a Disneyland-toy train from the port to the town itself. The streets are steep and narrow; the houses lean toward one another like drunkards homeward bound. Through open doorways, we see interior staircases that are precipitous, running the height of several stories without even a handrail. In the local church there is a secret passageway, now blocked up, that was once used by disenchanted Foreign Legionnaires fleeing toward Sardinia, a few miles to the south. Back on board ship, faces begin to acquire names. There is George, for example, a lawyer who, with the light behind him, is W.C. Fields come back to life. Once, he played trumpet for Paul Whiteman. Now, as if proof were needed, and to everyone's joy, he produces a cornet and embarks on the first of a series of late-night concerts. And there is Frank, a most amiable young man, who responds to even the mildest witticism with ''Touche!'' If you tell him that the sea is calm or the moon shining, he gravely responds with ''Good news,'' while any tidings that are less than cheerful evoke a worried look and an invariable ''Hubba, hubba.'' There are, happily, not many occasions for hubba, hubba-ing on Sea Goddess II. Those who have a taste for oak bulkheads and creaking timbers and who go around muttering ''Aargh, Jim lad'' under their breath may raise an eyebrow at the ubiquitous chrome and, at every turn, the experience of looking back at themselves in a glass darkly. One might as well have checked into a small, exclusive hotel. The sea, with all that is maritime and therefore unbiddable, is kept firmly in its place: on the outside. If I am to grumble, and since Cunard lays claim to standards that are not much less than perfection, let the bad news be told and have done with it. On a vessel a mere 340 feet long and with a beam of 48 feet, one does not expect menus that g on forever like those on board, say, a P & O liner such as Sea Princess, but on this first of our two weeks, the food is bland and uninteresting. If the world is divided between those who eat to live and those who live to eat, it is the former who emerge more happily from the dining salon. As far as wine is concerned, Sea Goddess II strives to perpetuate the common fallacy that whatever hails from a French vineyard, no matter how harsh or how vinegary, is by the very fact of its existence superior to a local wine from, say, Sicily or the Abruzzi. The evening came when our table, at last, dug in its heels and pronounced a supposedly fine claret an impostor, traveling on false credentials. It was, in short, undrinkable. To his credit, the sommelier thereafter plied us with regional wines taken on board along the way. It was a pity that the other passengers continued, uncomplainingly, either to knock back their vin (very) ordinaire or to venture into the area of what the bill of fare described as ''premium'' vintages, available at premium prices. To drink local wines may be a gamble, but off our port bow each day, unheeded, were vineyards yielding the dry red Aglianico del Vulture of Basilicata and the Lacrima Christi of Campania. One should never be too posh or too perfect for an adventure. OUR NEXT PORT OF call, Sorrento, is not, contrary to musical sentiment, a place to come back to with any urgency, unless you need a springboard for Pompeii and the Amalfi coastline. It is a bustling, dusty little city on a clifftop, not nasty but anonymous, and the resort hotels, rococo like melting wedding cakes, block off any sense that the day visitor is within a few hundred yards of the sea. We rush through Pompeii rather in the spirit of Darryl F. Zanuck leading a party into the Louvre with the imperishable cry, ''We gotta be out of this joint in 20 minutes.'' As we round the toe of Italy under a balmy late-September sun, the summons continues to be heard, but by now world-wearily and quite without its earlier self-consciousness - ''Steward, Champagne and caviar for four in the Jacuzzi!'' The staff is tireless in its determination to please. The face of the barman, Walter, for example, is smiling in the piano bar at 2 A.M., and the smile is still in place when the pool bar opens at 10 A.M. There is little formal entertainment on board. A singer, Roy Edwards from Liverpool (''the capital of Ireland,'' he unblushingly tells me), provides a cabaret spot every second evening. And there are none of the customary announcements from the bridge, telling us how far we have cruised since yesterday or where we are at this moment. At first, this lack causes bewilderment; later, everybody just stops caring. A lady, who is so exotic in appearance that I privately call her ''Cobra Woman,'' tells me that she teaches balletic swimming in New York. Her wickedly funny imitation of Esther Williams - backstroking the length of the ship's pool, with a flower clenched between teeth frozen in a rictus of a smile that threatens instant snow blindness - is such that I can never again look at ''Jupiter's Darling.'' DUBROVNIK, IN yugo-slavia, is an unexpected delight: a medieval city where the main - and, as such, only - street is paved with limestone polished by age. You can walk the circuit of the old ramparts; they enfold an infinity of red roofs; you then turn and look the other way and almost swoon from vertigo as, beyond a waist-high wall, cliffs plunge sheer to the Adriatic. One of the bulwarks of Communism is, of course, the equal distribution of wealth, and we are shown this in action at lunchtime when, for the simplest of meals, three of us are ripped off to the unmelodious tune of $80. What makes it worse is that the waitress, knowing us for despicable capitalists, does not even rob us with a smile, but scowls murderously throughout. At an adjoining cafe, a fistfight begins. It is worthy of the mandatory brawl scene in a John Ford western, but we pretend not to notice in case we are charged extra for the floor show. In the evening, local musicians come on board Sea Goddess II. Since we are, so to speak, just up the street from Greece, I not only ask them to play a syrtaki but then sweep our party into a blur of gyrating hips that Zorba would have envied. It seemed, as they say, a good idea at the time, but less so as I now write about it, after the Liffey-side attentions of one doctor, one physiotherapist, two osteopaths, one faith healer and - finally and instantaneously triumphant - one aroma therapist. Our ship's draft is shallow, which may be why we can weave a northward course through a seemingly endless labyrinth of islands. It is the Dalmatian coast. At times, we seem to be inextricably landlocked; then a way out, hardly wider than Sea Goddess herself, opens just ahead. Next morning, as if by magic, we are in Venice. To most of the passengers, this is the end of the line. The few who are making the return trip to Monte Carlo are dubbed - and only half in jest - ''The Decadents.'' Farewells are said in Harry's Bar, but my wife and I, acting on a tip, find our way instead across the Grand Canal to the fish market, next to which, over its own tiny bridge, is the 16th-century Poste Vece. THERE, ON A TINY patio, we lunch magnificently on spaghetti with clams, followed by Adriatic sole, the whole accompanied by a bottle of pinot grigio and all for a fourth of what we would have paid at Harry's Bar. By the time we are back on the ship, next week's passengers are arriving. They include a best-selling novelist and his entourage of eight, including a once-famous chanteuse. One of our band of Decadents greets them with a friendly cry of ''Welcome on board the good ship Cirrhosis!'' None of them smiles. We leave Venice at sunset. The city is bathed in golden light. The Campanile and Basilica of San Marco and the dome of Santa Maria della Salute become mist-swathed silhouettes, then fade as we round the island of the Giudecca. ''My God,'' I hear a voice saying, ''have you ever in your life seen anything so . . . so . . . . '' He pauses, seeking the precise word, and then he finds it, '' . . . so Italian?'' As of this evening, the ship's cuisine has improved dramatically. I mention this to the headwaiter. He coughs softly in a manner long ago patented by headwaiters and says, ''We . . . hem, have got a new chef.'' The Cunard people will get it right, if it kills them. Next morning, the best-selling novelist moves among his eight friends with the benign urbanity of a cardinal dispensing indulgences to pilgrims. We do not need to ask who he is, for each member of the faithful is sporting a T-shirt of many colors, emblazoned with the leader's name and that of his latest book, both writ large. However, as an actor once said of playing a love scene with Greta Garbo, this does not constitute an introduction: none of them speaks to the rest of us. We duplicate only one of last week's ports of call, and it is Dubrovnik. There is an Irish proverb to the effect that only a true jackass trips over the same stone twice, and we demonstrate our unimpeachable bloodline by being ripped off all over again, this time in a mountain tavern. Still, the coastline is magnificent and, as a special treat, a storm comes roaring out of nowhere with a 75-mile-an-hour whirlwind that uproots scaffoldings and hurls the city's pigeons into the air. Sea Goddess II runs for shelter, and Champagne is served to dispel the vapors caused by such unseemliness and restore the pampering level to normal. Two days later, at Taormina, one of my favorite places in the world, a gray veil of rain hides Mount Etna and all but obscures the town itself, high on its crag. Still, remembering a morning in May when I sat in the garden of the San Domenico Palace and read Hilaire Belloc's account of a long and beautiful walk, ''The Path to Rome,'' I decide to go on a pilgrimage of my own, slopping through the town's endless main street, which has been compared to the bridge of a zeppelin. With a half-mile still to walk, I become aware that, thanks to last week's Greek dancing, there is such a thing as a sciatic nerve. I give the garden of the San Domenico Palace a miss and limp toward a cabstand. It is as if Belloc himself had reached Rome and failed to see the Pantheon. OVERNIGHT, THE weather clears, and we all but kneel in gratitude, for Capri in the rain would have been too cruel to bear. The cliffs are out of a Dore engraving. From the harbor, we ascend by funicular to the town itself, an enchanted dream place when, as on this out-of-season day, the crowds have gone. It is not just that Capri has charm (although it does) or that it is ravishing to the eye (although it is), but that its scale is exactly right. It is the world's biggest and prettiest doll's house. My wife ventures into a boutique and all but weeps on finding a dress that cost her five times as much back home, so we buy it all over again to expiate her guilt. After lunch at the Ristorante ai Faraglioni, we take a little bus to Anacapri, my vertigo and I wedged tight against the window. Looking at the sea far below, I calculate that if we crashed through the absurdly low wall, the news would be on television before we stopped falling. At Anacapri, we visit the villa of San Michele. Axel Munthe was either a prodigious liar or a prodigious human being - perhaps both - but his semimagical autobiography, ''The Story of San Michele,'' was part of my teenage mythology. I dreamed of coming here, and now there is Munthe's bedroom and study, and I am in his garden at last and standing by his sphinx - discovered where and how, heaven knows - as it looks blindly over a precipice and toward Sorrento. Our final stopping-off place is Elba. We moor, stern first, in the center of its chief town and port, Portoferraio. The city is old, dusty, sleepy, a place in which to wander about or sit and watch the eons pass. I cannot think why Napoleon left it for such an overcrowded resort as Waterloo. THE NEXT MORNING, we are back at Monte Carlo. Goodbyes are said, addresses given, promises made. Our cab arrives to bear us to the heliport, and, as we are leaving the ship, a white-clad ship's officer is coming on board. He shakes our hands. ''I know you told me who he is,'' my wife says when he has gone, ''but it's slipped my mind.'' Of course, it was the captain. MEDITERRANEAN SAMPLER Many cruise lines - among them Princess Cruises, Paquet, Sun Line, Raymond & Whitcomb, Swan Hellenic, Astor Cruises and Epirotiki - offer a wide range of cruises in the western Mediterranean this year; choices range from no-frills, cruise-only packages to all-inclusive luxury voyages. Most begin sailing in April, with departures scheduled through the beginning of October. The following are only a few of the options available; details may be had from travel agents, or from the cruise lines themselves. Cunard offers a series of 7- to 11-day cruises around Italy on its 116-passenger, 4,250-ton Sea Goddess II, beginning in April. One-week cruises departing from Monte Carlo include stops at Porto Cervo, Sorrento, Taormina, Corfu, Opatija and end in Venice. Voyages originating in Venice visit Korcula, Dubrovnik, Taormina, Capri and Portoferraio. Price for a one-week cruise is $4,800 a person, double occupancy; luxury double suites are available at $8,400 a person. Ten-day cruises start at $6,700 a person. (Cunard, 555 Fifth Avenue, New York 10017; telephone: 800-458-9000.) Swan Hellenic cruises are designed to educate as well as entertain. For example, the ''Renaissance and Pre-Renaissance Italy'' cruise from Aug. 22 to Sept. 8 on the Orpheus departs from Venice, calling at Trieste, Ravenna, Ancona, Taranto, Catania, Syracuse, Porto Empedocle, Palermo, Naples, Civitavecchia, Elba, Leghorn and Portofino and ending at Nice. Guest speakers will lecture on Greek, Roman, Byzantine and Renaissance influences in the Western Mediterranean. Prices start at $2,805 a person, and include round-trip air fare from New York, two overnight stopovers in London, all meals, excursions and tips. (Esplanade Tours, 581 Boylston Street, Boston, Mass. 02116; 800-426-5492.) Soviet-registered ships offer some of the cheapest cruises in the area. For example, an 8-day voyage on the 14,000-ton Odessa, departing from Genoa on April 12 and visiting Civitavecchia, Palermo, Tunis, Malta, Corfu, Dubrovnik and Venice, costs from $920 to $2,280 a person, including on-board meals. (International Cruise Center, 185 Willis Avenue, Mineola, N.Y. 11501; 212-517-8346, 516-747-8880; outside New York State, 800-221-3254.)

1002-> Rival Moslems Clash in Lebanon; 13 Killed
Rival Shiite Moslem factions, using machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades, clashed in southern Lebanon today for the second consecutive day, and the police said 13 people were killed and 40 wounded. The battles between the members of the mainstream Amal militia and fundamentalists of the Party of God were centered in the market town of Nabatiye and neighboring villages. The combatants ignored repeated calls by clerics for an end to the bloodshed. Tension between the Syrian-backed Amal and the Iran-supported Party of God has been building since the abduction in Feb. 17 of a United States officer serving with the United Nations forces in southern Lebanon. Amal, led by Justice Minister Nabih Berri, supports the peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon. The Party of God says United Nations forces hinder attacks against Israeli troops occupying a strip of land near the Lebanese border. A clandestine group that says it is holding the American, the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, is believed to be linked to the Party of God.

1003-> DANGEROUS RELATIONS
BY SILENCE BETRAYED Sexual Abuse of Children in America. By John Crewdson. 267 pp. Boston: Little, Brown & Company. $17.95. IT has been said that we talk around cruelty because we don't want to talk about it. And when we are forced to confront it, we call it sadism. By turning the conversation to the pathological condition we deny its relevance to us. In other words, what is most unacceptable about cruelty is not that it exists but that, in the words of the political philosopher Judith Shklar, it is an ''ordinary vice'': something that, although horrible, is expectable, something our neighbor could very well do. For how can we face one another, thinking our neighbor may be cruel, may be sexually abusing his children - or ours? The answer is, of course, that we can't. So we remove cruelty from the neighborhood and make it the sickness of perverse strangers. We warn our children: Don't take candy. Don't open the door. In ''By Silence Betrayed,'' John Crewdson's new book on the sexual abuse of children, we learn that in doing so we defend them against a minor threat and leave them open to a major one. Far greater than the danger of being raped by a stranger is the danger of being seduced by a family member. This play of warning and silence, of what we will speak of and what we will deny, is a major theme in Mr. Crewdson's book. Drawing on history, sociology, psychiatry, jurisprudence and investigative journalism, it presents a compelling survey of the field, illuminated by interviews and personal statements of the abused and the abusers, as well as those who defend, prosecute and psychiatrically treat them. A Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who now directs the Los Angeles bureau of The Chicago Tribune, Mr. Crewdson offers no simple solutions. But he has written a work that is stunning in its statement of the facts and unrelenting in its attacks on our myths. According to a 1985 national survey conducted by The Los Angeles Times, which is cited by Mr. Crewdson, nearly 38 million Americans were sexually abused as children; 1 in 10 American men has sexually abused a child; thus, if the experience of the current generation of children follows that of their elders, 13 million of them, according to Mr. Crewdson, will be sexually abused before they reach their 18th birthday. Most sexual abuse is not accompanied by violence and the abusers are well known to the child. The adults who abuse children are not the sleazy, suspicious-looking characters we have been warning our children about. They are more likely to be fathers, baby sitters, teachers and next-door neighbors. Moreover, the abused do not fit any simple stereotypes. They can be freshly scrubbed, solidly middle-class kids on their way to Bible class and Cub Scouts in a Midwestern town such as Jordan, Minn. They can be rich kids, outfitted in designer jeans and dropped off each morning at a prestigious preschool in a seaside community such as Manhattan Beach, Calif. But at home they have incestuous relationships with parents. Or when they get to school they are raped and sodomized and agree to keep it to themselves. In Jordan, two dozen men and women, ''most of them married, most of them parents, many of them solid citizens,'' were accused of sexually abusing and torturing their children. In Manhattan Beach, 350 children testified to having been sexually abused at the McMartin Pre-School - in operation for more than 20 years. Mr. Crewdson takes these recent cases as the dramatic center of his narrative. He makes the point that although both of these prosecutions were unsuccessful, the abuse to children was real. It was real and, as is the case for many victims, it was not an isolated, violent episode. It had become part of the everyday. In the Jordan, Minn., case, Mr. Crewdson writes, ''one boy seeking to pinpoint one of the many occasions on which, he said, he had been abused by his parents remembered that 'we had pizza that night because Mom and Dad went shopping.' A girl recalled being abused by a neighbor lady who had just finished fixing her hair into a ponytail.'' Another said ''her grandmother had abused her with a pair of scissors before giving her macaroni and cheese for lunch.'' Mr. Crewdson's presentation of such facts, gathered over two years of reporting on hundreds of sexual abuse cases, is an effort to get people to face them. For he is well aware that we work hard to deny that such things exist. Mr. Crewdson recounts that when he would tell friends and colleagues what he was working on, he got two reactions: from some, a slow, hesitant confession that ''something like that'' had happened to them when they were children; from most, the reaction that the children who claimed to be sexually abused were lying. ''Because it hadn't happened to them, it seemed, they simply couldn't imagine its happening to anyone.'' When, as in Jordan and Manhattan Beach, charges are dropped and a case disappears from the news, people use this to support their desire to believe that it really didn't happen. Children are betrayed not simply by silence but by active disbelief. Those who call children liars are, so to speak, standing on the shoulders of giants. Near the turn of the century, Sigmund Freud claimed that the principal cause of neurosis in adults was sexual seduction during childhood. And then, two years after proposing this theory, Freud began to doubt it. ''Surely such widespread perversions against children are not very probable,'' he wrote to his colleague Wilhelm Fliess. Freud turned his original theory upside down. The adult did not seduce the child. The child wanted to seduce the adult. It wasn't that large numbers of children were having sexual experiences; large numbers of children were wishing they were. Children repress this desire, and Freud concluded that the repression takes its toll as neurosis. We suffer the insidious effects of the unconscious wish. In the last few years, Freud's about-face has become the subject of intense controversy. Mr. Crewdson's sensible and restrained treatment of this issue includes a discussion of the proposal that Freud might have been essentially right the first time around, but that there might be truth in both of Freud's theories. Those who are not abused follow some variant of the Oedipal path. But for abused children the forbidden fantasies are brought to life, interfering with normal processes of repression, interfering with the formation not only of the superego but of the mature and differentiated self. ''If this is so,'' Mr. Crewdson observes, ''it may explain why so many victims of child sexual abuse, and particularly victims of incest, enter adulthood so utterly lacking in self-esteem, and why so many sexually abused children grow up to become child abusers themselves.'' By the time the reader gets to the account of how Freud came to believe that children fantasized being attacked, what seems most striking is how sadly familiar it sounds. By then we have heard person after person say that, despite the evidence, when it comes to sexual abuse children lie. Freud's authority in psychology and psychiatry has often undermined children's credibility. But when children face not only therapists but jurors they fare about as well as Freud's patients. Jurors, Mr. Crewdson says, ''have an instinctive need to feel that intelligent, successful people like themselves wouldn't abuse a child. They may empathize with the children involved, but they identify with the adults.'' As the reader struggles with this painful material, he or she may feel a growing sense of complicity in the conspiracy of silence and disbelief. What Mr. Crewdson describes is a social pathology. But the illness is not just adults' sexual aggression toward children. It is also that we allow abuse to be an unspoken and invisible social fact. And when this fact is let out as a spoken reality we displace and distort it. The social illness of speech and silence is itself open to Freudian interpretation. It is marked by the mechanisms of defense that we employ when we cannot bear to confront something directly. There is repression: the silence. There is denial: the claim that children lie. And there is the displacement of the problem onto other things that seem less threatening. Just as Mr. Crewdson makes the point that we would rather think children are liars than that adults who seem otherwise ''normal'' are having sex with them, he also makes it clear that we would rather think children are being violently kidnapped than that they are being skillfully seduced. Mr. Crewdson forces us to re-examine the way we have made the issue of missing children a national priority. The nationwide hunt for missing children - their pictures on milk cartons and grocery bags - and for their sadistic kidnappers, can be reassuring. It is certainly more reassuring than the idea that our children are at risk at their day-care center or from their uncle or aunt. In 1985 The Denver Post won a Pulitzer Prize for a series of articles on what Mr. Crewdson calls ''the true dimensions of the missing-children problem.'' Mr. Crewdson notes that most missing children have run away from home or have been stolen by a parent on the losing side of a custody battle. Fear of what a parent of a child who was abducted and killed called ''the sick, sadistic molesters and killers who roam our country at random'' is an understandable reaction, but it can also be a way to displace our anxiety about a problem whose villains are far less transient. For the most part, child abuse is quiet work. Mr. Crewdson describes how it can happen when a father, under the stress of a problem on the job, turns to his daughter for reassurance, or when a father who knows that he wants a relationship with his daughter prepares her from infancy to expect and enjoy his touch. Mr. Crewdson speaks of how mothers too, claiming disappointment with their spouses, turn their sons into lovers. Abuse can be the careful courtship by a pedophile who forms friendships with lonely children. Like any wise suitor, he is trying to build sexual intimacy on the most solid base he can. Interviews with abusers and abused and portraits of their family life make it clear that sexual abuse is nonetheless abusive for the fact that it is not necessarily done against a child's will. Mr. Crewdson says outright: a child may not complain because he or she may not know there is anything to complain about. Indeed, it is not impossible that a child may enjoy the abuse. The physical contact may feel good. And the emotional contact may be gratifying. Faced with cruelty, we tend to idealize its victims. By thinking of them as always innocent we redeem our image of human nature. But what is wrong about adults having sexual relationships with children does not depend on children's innocence but on their powerlessness. Children are no match for adult authority. For example, in most cases of father-daughter incest, the natural authority of the father is enough to quell the little girl's doubts. He is able to define the parameters of her relationship with him. What is terrible about his assault on her does not depend on her being repelled by his touch. It depends on his putting her in a situation that denies her a normal sequence of development. The incestuous father robs his daughter of a relationship to a parent. And like any moral cruelty, it is a humiliation so great that the victim eventually trusts neither herself nor anyone else. When and if sexually abused children come to have doubts and trust themselves enough to express them, they find themselves embroiled in a legal system that tends to render them silent. It may dismiss them because it is too busy or because they do not seem to be credible as witnesses. They will face defense attorneys who are well prepared to discredit and embarrass them. One lawyer who teaches a seminar on defending those accused of sexual abuse begins it by saying: ''Children are insidious liars and they're practiced liars. They are the best. They can lie at the drop of a hat.'' What makes this book so disturbing is that it will put any reader right into the picture. We were all children and, even if we were not abused, Mr. Crewdson's stories must remind us of our past powerlessness and vulnerablity. They remind us too, perhaps, of our own complicated sexuality as children. Whether or not Freud was right in laying all neurosis at the door of repression, the fact is that when it comes to childhood sexuality we protect our process of forgetting. Moreover, we are right there in the picture because as adults we enjoy or at least tolerate a culture that eroticizes children. We read cosmetic ads in which 12-year-old models are made up to look like 18-year-old seductresses. In the movie ''Manhattan,'' we root for Woody Allen in his pursuit of the adolescent Mariel Hemingway. The boundaries of childhood are, after all, not exact. Tennessee law prohibits having sex with a 13-year-old girl only if she is not your wife. The emotional confusion this book arouses is understandable. So much more than silence keeps the sexual abuse of children a persistently subterranean issue. No matter how much it is ''discovered'' and reported by the news media, it seems after a while to go away, only to re-emerge when it is periodically ''discovered'' again. This emotional confusion even explains some of the difficulties we have in designing policies and institutions that deal more adequately with child sexual abuse. But it is no excuse for our failures. Mr. Crewdson's eloquent book allows all the complications and psychological nuances to emerge, but he doesn't allow them to obscure the terrible facts of the case. SOCIETY IS SLOW TO CATCH ON In the spring of 1984, soon after he became the Los Angeles bureau chief of The Chicago Tribune, John Crewdson realized that an unusually large number of child sexual abuse cases were being reported in southern California. Mr. Crewdson said he approached the story with skeptical curiosity because he had not known any sex abusers or victims. ''For me it was just an interesting question,'' he recalled in a telephone interview during a recent stopover in New York. ''I just wanted to know what everybody else wanted to know, which is what the heck is going on here? Who is telling the truth? Is this really possible?'' He devoted much of the next year to studying and writing about the McMartin Pre-School case in Manhattan Beach, Calif., and other allegations of child sexual abuse. ''The more I learned about this,'' he said, ''the more persuaded I was that it was real, that it was widespread, that it was serious and that it was too bad that our society was so reluctant to come to terms with it.'' ''By Silence Betrayed,'' Mr. Crewdson's second book, grew out of his desire to correct ''an awful lot of misunderstanding and misinformation'' about the sexual abuse of children. ''I had come to believe that the victims in these cases were not getting a fair shake, that it was an unfair fight,'' he said. ''In most cases,'' he continued, ''these were rather young children who had been victimized through no fault of their own. They were embraced by a judicial system that was not set up to deal with children as accusers. Then they were further traumatized when, perhaps unable to convince a jury or a judge of the truth of what had happened to them, they were branded as liars and the adults who had abused them were treated as heroes.'' Mr. Crewdson, who is 42 years old, has specialized in complex and sensitive topics. In 1981 he received a Pulitizer Prize for his articles in The New York Times on illegal immigration. His first book, ''The Tarnished Door,'' was based on that reporting. For the last year he has written primarily about AIDS. ''There is a kind of chain reaction that takes place,'' he said. ''The more you find out about subjects like these, the more you want to find out.'' MICHAEL FREITAG

1006-> '84 Reagan Campaign Fined Over Donations
The Federal Election Commission fined President Reagan's campaign committee $10,000 for accepting excessive contributions in the 1984 primary election, newly released records show. The commission is winding up its work on the 1984 election, and documents released Monday include a settlement signed Jan. 26 by the Reagan committee. An audit by the election commission found that Mr. Reagan accepted more than the $1,000 maximum from 285 individuals, for a total of $193,674 in excess receipts. Of that, the campaign transferred $172,624 into a fund used to comply with various commission regulations in the general election. But the transfer would have been legal only if the donors gave written permission, which was not obtained, the F.E.C. report said.

1007-> Dole and Bush: Dramatic Contrast of Styles . . .
Since the Presidential campaign began, Gerald M. Boyd has been covering Vice President Bush while Bernard Weinraub covered Senator Bob Dole. Last week they switched assignments to report how the campaigns compared in style and in substance. In the front cabin of Air Force 2, Vice President Bush sits quietly, invisible to most of the passengers in the rear. After the plane lands, Mr. Bush climbs into a limousine, and a 20-car motorcade then moves to carefully staged rallies and Rotary Club luncheons crammed with supporters. Questions are rarely asked by the audience. Reporters are kept behind barricades by Secret Service agents. The Vice President uses back entrances to avoid questions and then returns to the cocoon of Air Force 2. Nearly 100 aides, Secret Service agents and journalists and technicians accompany him. In striking contrast to Mr. Bush, Senator Bob Dole, the Vice President's chief rival for the Republican Presidential nomination, leads a frenetic, free-wheeling campaign with only two or three aides joining him, several cars, no Secret Service escort and a small retinue of reporters, with whom the Kansan enjoys political gossip. Late the other night, boarding a small private jet in Rapid City, S. D., Mr. Dole sat down with reporters and asked if there were any more questions. That day Mr. Dole had at least four news conferences. Mr. Dole was greeted with silence. ''You've finally beaten us down -you've won,'' said one newcomer. Politics as Theater If politics is good theater, then Mr. Dole's campaign is improvisational, chaotic and unpredictable. Mr. Bush's campaign, on the other hand, resembles a tightly directed drama that is both skillfully performed and shrewdly produced. Nothing is left to chance. The pitfalls for Mr. Dole are considerable. Unlike Mr. Bush, the Kansan controls a national organization that remains short on experience, personnel and planning. For example, by midday Thursday, with the Iowa Presidential caucuses four days away, the Dole camp had no idea in what state the Senate Republican leader was spending Friday and Saturday nights. Moreover, Mr. Dole's organization has inexplicably lost all of its reserved rooms in Iowa and was scrambling to find rooms for the candidate and his staff. Such chaos has marked the Dole campaign from the outset, and it plainly damages Mr. Dole's efforts to overcome the formidable Bush organization. In terms of personal style, and the way Mr. Dole and Mr. Bush campaign, the contrasts between the two are also vivid. Both candidates are seeking to overcome what are perceived as ''negatives'' against them: Mr. Dole's ''meanness'' and Mr. Bush's ''wimpiness.'' Accompanied by Pilot Mr. Bush was accompanied in New Hampshire by Chuck Yeager, the retired Air Force general and test pilot, and the Vice President spent much time talking about his World War II record as a Navy fighter pilot, referring to starting his own oil business in Texas and, of course, his recent confrontation with Dan Rather. Mr. Bush also uses some unusual oratory, calling Nicaragua ''the cancer of the pancreas'' in Central America and comparing Cuba to ''cancer of the thumb.'' Mr. Dole, who is trying to live down a reputation for vitriolic partisanship, goes out of his way to praise many of the Democrats running for President, calls them ''my friends,'' and is, in fact, far more critical of Mr. Bush (''a qualified loser'') and Representative Jack F. Kemp (''that football player'') than of Democrats these days. Mr. Dole's standard speech, especially in Iowa, plainly resonates among many audiences, especially farmers and elderly people who are cool to President Reagan and welcome Mr. Dole's criticisms of Reagan budget, economic and education policies. But Mr. Dole seems far less comfortable in New Hampshire, where he essentially refrains from criticizing President Reagan. Moreover, many of the Republicans in towns such as Concord and Amherst - stockbrokers, business people, women in mink coats and men in expensive clothes - plainly find Mr. Dole's message and style far tougher, and less welcome, than Mr. Bush's. 'I'm One of You' The Senator's Midwestern message, ''I'm one of you,'' is underlined by a forceful, emotive delivery that focuses on the dangers of the Federal budget deficit, Mr. Dole's leadership role in the Senate, attacks on Mr. Bush's tenure as Vice President and, most central, a discussion of his hard-scrabble childhood in Kansas and the war wound that crippled his right arm. ''There was this feeling that you've got to open up,'' Mr. Dole said recently. ''Everybody said you've got to know what people are really about, where you're from, what do you really know about life.'' Mr. Bush seems extremely wary of talking about himself and his family, in part because he grew up amid Eastern Establishment wealth and in part because he is simply personally uncomfortable discussing his background. In recent days, though, Mr. Bush has talked about his ''Dad,'' Senator Prescott Bush of Connecticut, who warned against ''getting personal finances messed up with the public trust.'' It was an obvious reference to Senator Dole's embarrassment about the questions raised involving the ''blind trust'' held by his wife, Elizabeth Hanford Dole. 'Loyalty Is a Strength' Mr. Bush's standard speech, compared with Mr. Dole's, comes across as desultory, in part because Mr. Dole's comments about his childhood and World War II injuries hold audiences rapt. The Vice President, on the other hand, tends to ramble with snippets of personal biography about his year as Director of Central Intelligence and service as Ambassador to the United Nations as well as China. Mr. Bush introduces many of his sentences with ''Hey, in my family loyalty is a strength; it's not a character flaw.'' He said the other day, ''My Dad was in public service 20 years and not a hint of scandal - I think.'' To a women's group in Concord, N.H., he said, ''I'm not an apologize-for-America kind of guy.'' Unlike Mr. Bush, who seems ambivalent about the campaign grind, Mr. Dole is a self-confessed political junkie. ''My father actually loves being on the road, campaigning 12 hours a day,'' said his daughter, Robin Dole, a Washington lobbyist. The other morning, when snowy weather forced Mr. Dole to cancel airplane campaign appearances, the Kansan decided to take a car and, with an aide, Mike Glassner, drive across Iowa for the day. Like Mr. Bush, Mr. Dole sometimes has difficulty controlling his temper. Although the 64-year-old Kansan enjoys bantering with reporters, forceful questions bother him. ''What did you watch - a bad movie last night?'' Mr. Dole snapped to a persistent reporter last week. Hostile questions from college students are often greeted with derision. And Mr. Dole's temper is plainly visible when he has to wait even a few minutes for reporters or others to board his plane. Personally, Mr. Dole seems embarrassed about the contrast between his ''he's one of us'' campaign theme and recent disclosures tions of his and his wife's wealth. He wears tailored suits and tasseled loafers and, recently, in northern New Hampshire wore a new fur-collared overcoat. Someone asked him, jokingly, if the coat was purchased in his hometown, Russell, Kan. Mr. Dole grinned sheepishly, and an aide later said that the coat was actually purchased at Brooks Brothers. Mr. Dole hasn't worn the coat since.

Taiwan's trade surplus reached a four-year low in March, officials said today. They said the decline should help to ease the island's trade frictions with the United States. The surplus fell to $160 million (American), from $990 million in February and $1.45 billion a year earlier. March exports totaled $4.51 billion, up a bit from $4.31 billion in February, but imports came to $4.35 billion, a sharp rise from $3.32 billion.

1011-> 5 Die in Blast Outside U.S.O. in Naples
At least five people were killed, including an American sailor, and 15 others, including several American sailors, were wounded tonight by an explosion in front of a club for American troops in Naples. Hours after the explosion, the police were still trying to determine its exact nature, but they said witnesses and physical evidence indicated that a bomb had been placed in or under a car parked in the narrow downtown street outside the U.S.O. club. ''It was a very powerful bomb probably made of a large amount of explosives,'' said a police investigator in Naples. Several parked cars caught fire, filling the street with flame and smoke, the police said. Navy spokesmen in Washington were intially quoted in news agency reports as saying at least one sailor was dead. The Navy withdrew the report later, saying no American sailor had been killed. But late tonight the Pentagon confirmed that a Navy enlisted woman had been killed in the blast. Her name was withheld until her family is notified. Injuries were suffered by ''an unidentified number of sailors'' from two United States Navy frigates, the Capodanno and the Paul, which are in Naples as part of a routine deployment with the Sixth Fleet, according to Capt. George Vercessi, a Navy spokesman in the southern Italian port. The Capodanno is based at Newport, R.I., and the Paul at Mayport, Fla. The police counted 4 Americans among the 15 wounded who were taken to local hospitals. Date of Raids on Libya A senior officer at the Naples police headquarters said that there were no immediate claims of responsibility but that the nature of the explosion pointed toward ''anti-American terrorism of Middle East origins.'' He noted that today was the second anniversary of the United States bombing raids on the Libyan cities of Tripoli and Benghazi, but he added that no evidence was immediately available to indicate who might be responsible. The bombing in April 1986 of a West Berlin discotheque frequented by American military personnel prompted the air raids on Libya after the Reagan Administration charged that Libya was responsible. Clubs for American soldiers in Greece have also been targets of bombings, and a grenade attack on a U.S.O. club in Barcelona, Spain, in December killed an American sailor. A police officer in Naples said that three men and two women were known to have been killed in the blast tonight and that several of the victims were so badly mutilated that their identities or nationalities could not be immediately established. The officer said some of the wounded were badly hurt. The club, operated by the voluntary United Service Organization, lies on a back street just a block from the docks used by American warships. Many sailors may have escaped injury because the U.S.O. center's most popular sections, a game room and a television room, are in a basement that was fully shielded from the blast. A party for the commander of the Paul was being held in the basement at the time, Navy officials said. Street Was Crowded A spokesman for the United States Embassy here said American consular officials on the scene had reported that ''a car bomb-type explosion'' had taken place in front of the club. A policeman who was on the scene moments after the blast said four of those killed had been standing on the street or sidewalk and appeared to have died instantly. The explosion took place at 8 P.M., when the street was crowded with pedestrians. Most of the force of the blast was apparently expended in the street. Nelson Moe, an American who teaches at the University of Naples, walked amid the wreckage on the street, the Calata San Marco, about three hours after the explosion and gave this description: ''For about 50 yards around the U.S.O. club everything on the little street seemed wrecked. Shattered glass and pieces of steel were all over the place. The carcasses of at least five cars lay there burned out, and one, the one that had the bomb, was just in pieces. There were still pools of blood in front of the club.''

1012-> Nepal
To the Editor: If there are any readers remaining who will venture a Nepal trek after reading Marcia R. Lieberman's article, may I add one additional caveat. The only thing worse than having no doctor along is having several! On our 1971 trek, 5 of the 11 members were physicians. The discussion among the group, at 12,000 feet above sea level and a three-day walk from the nearest hospital, as to how to best treat a nonphysician member with a bad cough and high fever can only be compared to the scene in the Israeli Knesset. As I crawled out of the patient's tent, having administered the penicillin tablets that had won in a closely contested split decision, the patient said, ''You know I'm allergic to penicillin.'' None of us had asked. Fortunately he then vomited, and did fine. HERBERT KAPLAN M.D. Denver

1014-> Review/Recital; A Soprano Who Reveals Herself
Since her New York debut in the Young Concert Artists Series in 1981, Marvis Martin has gone from success to success, amassing awards, medals and glowing reviews as a song recitalist, concert singer and opera performer. On Tuesday evening the Florida-born soprano took another step up the career ladder when she appeared at Alice Tully Hall under the auspices of the same invaluable organization as recipient of its Michaels Award. For some singers, and not only young ones, a song can be something to hide behind, a shield against self-revelation. In extreme cases, a highly sophisticated artist such as Elisabeth Schwarzkopf may end by wearing a song like a suit of armor. In a program of songs in German, French and English, Miss Martin often demonstrated that she wanted something different from that. There was a good deal of obvious calculation and artifice in her performances, as there must be in any serious recital, but the person behind the interpretation always could be discerned. That, after all, is what interpretation is all about. Certainly Miss Martin had little to hide vocally. The voice, rather light but remarkably resilient, sounded free of strain on top, and what problems it encountered lower were skillfully minimized. A Strauss group made the strongest impression, the evening's high point being a transfixing performance of ''Morgen.'' Here the soprano and her pianist, Warren Jones, found a time-suspending tempo that let the music unfold without seeming in danger of collapsing at any moment, as is sometimes true in this contemplative song. Miss Martin also produced a convincingly Straussian tone for ''Heimliche Aufforderung,'' ''Das Rosenband'' and ''Muttertandelei.'' A problem, especially early in this recital, was Miss Martin's tendency to equate seriousness and deep emotion with ponderous tempos. Schubert's ''An die Musik'' and Schumann's ''Widmung'' both dragged. Stolzel's ''Bist du bei mir,'' mistakenly attributed in the program to Bach, also took on needless weight. Miss Martin's is not a voice of enormous variety in timbre, but as the night progressed she exploited its range with refinement and musicality. One could have done without some of the recitalist's broader illustrative gestures, too obviously practiced. The inherent coyness in ''Muttertandelei,'' for instance, need not be overemphasized visually. A group of four Chausson songs brought some exquisite sounds, especially in the lithe and graceful ''Le Colibri'' and ''Les Papillons.'' Less successful was ''La Caravane,'' whose heavy symbolism and general clumsiness seemed ill-suited to Miss Martin's temperament and voice. Copland's setting of Emily Dickinson's ''Why Do They Shut Me Out of Heaven?'' almost invariably tickles an audience and, except for a flourish of girlishness at the end, Miss Martin's sassy interpretation did not disappoint. More significantly, she caught the affecting simplicity and mood of repose in Barber's ''Desire for Hermitage'' (from ''Hermit Songs''), fondly remembered as a Leontyne Price specialty. A group of spirituals, fervently sung with no hint of condescension or over-interpretation, closed the wildly cheered program. The Program MARVIS MARTIN, soprano. Warren Jones, pianist.

1016-> Consensus in the Home
To the Editor: Tipper Gore's Op-Ed article (March 14) ends on a particularly chilling note, namely with the suggestion that we ''forge a moral consensus for the 1990's.'' Whatever her motivation, political or otherwise, we don't need a moral consensus to solve what's troubling her. Her concern that children are being exposed to excessive sex and violence in rock music and videos may or may not be true, but what's dangerous is her proposed solution, which focuses on government and the marketplace. It's time to stop placing responsibility for moral training where it does not belong, in this case with the record industry, the media and government. The responsibility for child rearing belongs to parents. The family is still the best and by far most appropriate place for moral education - not Congress or the marketplace. Let Ms. Gore and her sympathizers forge their consensus where it belongs -within the family and with their children. RICHARD A. KAGAN New York, March 14, 1988

1017-> STAMPS; Interpex '88 Will Open In New York City
THE multi-faceted appeal of stamp collecting will be on display at Interpex '88, the annual show staged by the American Stamp Dealers' Association. It attracts dealers and collectors from around the world. This year's four-day event will be held this week at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Show hours are Thursday, 11 A.M. to 7 P.M., Friday, 10 A.M. to 7 P.M., Saturday, 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. and next Sunday, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. The $3.50 admission charge includes a souvenir card. Children under 14 are admitted without charge. Interpex '88 will be a well-rounded affair with attractions for the collector in search of knowledge as well as the buyer seeking additions. Once regarded as an organization with a narrowly-based interest in its dealer-members, the association under executive director Joseph B. Savarese has extended its mandate and now serves as an important source of information and consumer protection for collectors. Lectures are scheduled for almost every hour of the show. There will be two first day of issue ceremonies. On Thursday at 11:30 A.M., the San Marino Postal Administration will issue its annual ''Europa'' set. On Friday at 10:30 A.M., the United Nations will conduct a ceremony to honor the new ''Survival of the Forests'' set. Guests who attend this ceremony will receive a complimentary first-day commemorative folder. Two hundred frames of exhibits will present visitors with a wealth of information and a dazzling display of interesting and valuable stamps and covers. Specialized exhibits of the United States and foreign countries as well as collections by topic will be featured. Other attractions will include a Youth Booth, a free appraisal service and a souvenir card that features the Signing of the Declaration of Independence. The American Philatelic Society will have a booth where collectors can learn about its services and obtain answers to some of their specific philatelic questions. For the buyer in search of stamps and covers, there will be seven postal administrations representing 55 countries and 120 stamp dealers. These sales booths often feature displays of some of the finest stamps and covers and are staffed by experts. For the Forests The United Nations Postal Administration has created an exciting new set of three sheetlets on the theme ''Survival of the Forests.'' The sheetlets will be issued Friday at United Nations Headquarters in New York City, Geneva, Switzerland and Vienna. They are intended to proclaim the need to replace forest exploitation with management. Each of the sheetlets consists of 12 stamps in two horizontal rows of six. The stamps in each row are the same, but the top and bottom rows differ. When combined on the sheetlets, they create the effect of a vast forest panorama. The stamps on the United States-denominated sheetlet bear face values of 25 cents and 44 cents in anticipation of United States Postal Service rate increases. This sheetlet depicts a tropical rain forest. The Austrian sheetlet, with face values of 4 and 5 schillings, has a fall foliage scene and the Swiss sheetlet, with 50 centimes and 1.10 Swiss francs, illustrates a pine forest. The spectacular issue was designed by Braldt Bralds of the Netherlands, who now resides in New York City. His illustrations have appeared in numerous periodicals and exhibits. As part of the new issue, the World Federation of United Nations Associations will issue an equally beautiful cacheted first day cover. It features a reproduction of ''Forest Gardens,'' an oil painting by Tony Curtis, the actor. It also will be offered in a limited edition lithograph. Mail order information and an order form for the stamps can be obtained from United Nations Postal Administration, United Nations, New York, N.Y. 10017. The Federation's products range from blank envelopes with the painting by Tony Curtis for 25 cents to the signed, numbered lithographs for $75 each. The Special Courier covers, with six stamps and the Geneva, Vienna and New York City first day cancellations on two covers, are available for $15. Orders and requests for information can be directed to W.F.U.N.A., Room DC 1-1177, United Nations, New York, N.Y. 10017.

1018-> DINING OUT; COZY, CHARMING AND IMAGINATIVE
AS I glided through Bellport last fall on my bike, I got a glimpse of a white frame 19th-century charmer. It was called the Old Inlet Inn. Was this a find? Would the food live up to the exterior charm? I pumped my Bellport sources about the inn, but the replies were noncommittal. ''It used to be good.'' ''I haven't been there lately.'' ''I think the chef left.'' It's true, a new chef did take over last fall, and I'm pleased to report that he's excellent. So too is the first-class service staff working in harmony with him. The inn, which is on the National Register of Historic Places, is a 19th-century oasis of candlelight, roaring fires, fresh flowers and commodious captain's chairs. All of this spells cozy comfort. The headwaitress, in a skirted version of a tuxedo, is top-notch. She is gracious and informed and is a master of tableside cooking. The Caesar salad and a flambeed dessert were merely good, however, in the hands of a different waiter on the third visit. The support team of clean-cut young people keep water glasses full, decrumb tables and replace used silver with seamless efficiency. Charming surroundings and efficient staff are two ingredients for a felicitous meal, but good food is still primary. There are no shortcuts here. Unusual rolls - whole grain, garlic and herb, and pumpkin - spill from the breadbasket. Ice creams (with wonderful flavors like praline and white chocolate) and sorbets are homemade, as are all desserts. And what other Long Island restaurant serves lamb that has been brined and smoked on the premises? One of the best ways to begin the meal is with the warm salad, which combines pink tidbits of smoked lamb, wild rice, goat cheese and endive. The ingredients marry beautifully. Another heavenly marriage is hot, runny Roquefort cheese enclosed in flaky pastry and nestled on a bed of arugula and cold tomato coulis. The contrast of texture, temperature and taste delighted. Mushroom lovers will gravitate to the saute of seasonal mushrooms encircling a satiny garlic-thyme custard. A threesome of exciting pasta appetizers also merits diners' attention: angel-hair pasta in a light cream sauce flecked with shards of smoked salmon and snow peas, gossamer tortellini tossed with porcini mushrooms and tomatoes, and salmon ravioli glossed with cream, garlic, cheese and oregano. Soups sound standard but taste special. Cream of mushroom was dark, rich with minced mushrooms, and served with a splash of cream. Excellent clam bisque was as hardy as a chowder. Duck soup, a delicate broth with floating duck slivers, wild rice and carrot and scallion shavings, was exceptional. All salads are recommended. The house salad sets a standard rarely matched elsewhere. The greens are distinctive: oak leaf lettuce, salinas, radicchio and arugula. The sesame vinaigrette dressing, good Mediterranean olives and rings of red onion are unexpected treats. Entrees that drew raves were all hearty fare: pink slices of breast of goose arrived with wild rice and a mellow wild mushroom tartlet; braised veal shoulder blanketed with an exemplary brown sauce dotted with slices of sweet roasted onions; fork-tender filet mignon enriched by a wine sauce and glazed shallots; butter-tender calf's liver enlivened with herbs and balsamic vinegar; good-quality steak with a spirited crust of four types of peppercorns, and moist chicken breast garnished with a tangy cranberry-apple relish. Don't skimp dessert. Nearly everything sampled deserved curtain calls, but at our table the most praises went to the hot apple tart and the white chocolate ice cream drizzled with dark chocolate sauce. The wine list of about 50 labels is typical of many Long Island restaurants' lists in size, price and selection. We chose a bottle of Peconic Bay cabernet sauvignon (1984), fairly priced at $17. The Old Inlet Inn may have the most pleasant winter dining room on Long Island. While lacking the views characteristic of summer favorites, it enchants with cozy comfort: a real wood-burning fireplace, Colonial atmosphere and sound ribbons of classical music in the background. Exciting, imaginative food and a competent, pleasant staff to serve it mean you're not settling for charm alone. OLD INLET INN Excellent 108 South Country Road, Bellport. 286-2650.

1019-> STATE-OF-THE-ART FOUL UP
WILD BLUE YONDER Money, Politics, and the B-1 Bomber. By Nick Kotz. Illustrated. 313 pp. New York: Pantheon Books. $19.95. It is easy to make fun of the B-1 bomber. Meant to shoot its way into the Soviet Union, drop nuclear bombs and shoot its way out, it is no match in speed or invulnerability to the most ordinary ICBM. Despite its sleek radar-evasive body and improvements in its speed, the range and accuracy of Soviet surface-to-air missiles in the years since 1970, when the bomber was originally proposed, have forced designers to add 24 tons of defensive avionics just to guarantee the B-1's own safety. Yet, the plane cannot survive a collision with a pelican. Nick Kotz's ''Wild Blue Yonder'' is a masterly story of the failed attempts by America's finest engineers and Air Force strategists to design, sell, build and deploy a state-of-the-art bomber. There is one point on which the author and proponents of the bomber would agree: the B-1's deficiencies are not the result of failed engineering, but of the politics of the procurement process. The problem is that weapons are selected by defense-industry insiders with interests and agendas of their own and that the availability of this kind of prize in an industry having basically but one customer - the Pentagon -turns engineering experts into crass lobbyists and finely conceived airplanes into ornaments. This is not to say, and certainly Mr. Kotz does not say, that the B-1 has no redeeming features. But as was the case with the B-70 before it, the time taken to gold-plate the B-1 and to construct and deploy the first 100 planes has rendered the bomber essentially obsolete before its time. Apart from its scope and detail, the book's strength lies in the subtlety of its argument. By rooting the story of the B-1 in that of its predecessor, the B-70, Mr. Kotz, a former reporter for The Washington Post who teaches at American University's School of Communication in Washington, gives himself three decades of bomber politics to discuss. The story begins in 1957, with the proposal of the B-70 in the shadow of Sputnik, whose technology very soon shifted intercontinental bombardment from the bomber to the ballistic missile. And the story ends in 1987 when, the B-1 project having been canceled by President Carter and revived by President Reagan, the last of the 100 bombers finally rolled off the production lines. Even after Francis Gary Powers's U-2 spy plane was shot out of the sky in 1960 at altitudes previously considered safe for the B-70, the vulnerability of that aircraft was not conceded until the Air Force had another design in range: a plane that could fly farther, faster, higher and lower than any other aircraft ever built. The B-1 made its first public appearance in proposal form (75 volumes of 9,772 pages) in 1970, and while the price tag was high - $10 billion for 240 planes (eventually $28 billion for 100, the largest weapons procurement program so far) - the outlook was bright. In 1970, Mr. Kotz reminds us, Boeing was building the 747; McDonnell Douglas had the contract for the F-15; General Dynamics, the Trident. It was important to spread contracts around to maintain the financial health of the defense contractors. Richard Nixon was President, and North American Rockwell (now Rockwell International) promised to distribute 43,000 jobs in southern California and let out 7,000 contracts elsewhere. ''Wild Blue Yonder,'' however, is not just another tale of waste, fraud and abuse. Nor does the author merely rail against the military-industrial complex. Mr. Kotz makes clear that bomber politics is not just that of special-interest lobbying, or venality or the corruption of a few politicians willing to exchange votes for campaign contributions and the delivery of pork (though this is an important subtext of the story). Rather, it is the result of a skew in our economy that has given one sector of the aerospace industry, in collaboration with its military partners, an unhealthy power. Even after the lock on seniority previously held by a handful of legislators was broken in the mid-1970's and Congress began to seek more control over defense policy and spending, the weapons contractors were able to maintain their hold by distributing their bounties more widely than they did previously. Rockwell, for example, arranged to contract out elements of the B-1 it could just as well have built itself. Today, the B-1's mission is unclear: Is it to clean up after intercontinental missiles have done their job? To chase mobile missiles on the ground? Or to be redesigned to carry conventional bombs for the next war in the third world? Mr. Kotz suggests that a revised science advisory committee, truly independent of the defense community, and a public more confident of its right and its ability to evaluate weapons systems could make a difference. But the story of the B-1 builds rather toward what Mr. Kotz calls his ''harsher view'': that ''the defense network, pursuing its goal with relentless determination, can wear down and outlast any opposition.''

1020-> CRITICS CHOICES; Dance
The Ohio Ballet, which opens a week's season at the Joyce Theater (175 Eighth Avenue) Monday, has the look and feel of a well-tuned single instrument. Celebrating its 20th anniversary this year, the company is the creation of Heinz Poll, its director and chief choreographer, and Thomas Skelton, the lighting designer; and it bears the imprint of an informed and articulated artistic vision. New this season are Mr. Poll's ''Adagio for Two Dancers'' and ''Games,'' set to music by Albinioni and Mozart, respectively, and ''Solstice,'' a piece by company member David Shimotakahara. The Joyce repertory also includes two dances by Laura Dean and additional works by Mr. Poll. Ann Carlson is a daring performer and choreographer. And ''Animals,'' at the Bessie Schonberg Theater (219 West 19th Street) Sunday and Thursday through next Sunday, promises to be an imaginative and well-crafted shocker of a program. These performance pieces are inspired by animals, whom Ms. Carlson sometimes draws into the dance. But they take animal imagery and extend it through the world of humans and into cultural and social history. If traditional African music and dance seem somewhat outside the province of the wild experimentalism represented at Performance Space 122, guess again. Western artists have long been influenced by the art of third world countries, and the Dinizulu company's repertory of dances from West and South Africa has its postmodernist elements. The company also puts on a rousing good performance. It can be seen Friday through Sunday at P.S. 122, 150 First Avenue at Ninth Street.

1021-> Margaret M. Heyman; Professor, 77
Margaret M. Heyman, a social worker and retired professor at Hunter College who researched industrial programs on alcoholism, died of a cerebral hemorrhage last Sunday at New York Hospital. She was 77 years old and lived in Manhattan. She was born in Central Islip, L.I., and was a supervisor in the New York City Department of Welfare. She joined the faculty at Hunter in 1964, retiring in 1972 to serve as principal investigator and project director for a national study on alcohol programs in industry. There are no immediate survivors.

1022-> THE NATION; Assessing the Effects of Airline Deregulation
ONCE hailed as enlightened economic policy, the landmark deregulation of the airline industry 10 years ago is coming under a cloud. Talk of gridlocked runways producing untold numbers of delayed flights and tales of frustrated travelers elbowing each other out of the way at ever-more crowded airports have led to lament in some quarters for the days when the Federal Government designated the price of tickets and the routes commercial carriers could fly, and businessmen and the affluent were the principal jet travelers. Indeed, the airline industry's announcement just last week of a cutback of some discount fares and substantial increases in full coach fares, normally used by business travelers, led to new discussion of reregulation on Capitol Hill. But many economists and analysts caution that before any move to reverse the Carter Administration measure, Congress should look carefully at at what deregulation has wrought. Americans, these specialists say, are traveling at lower cost, more often, to more cities and more safely. According to a Brookings Institution calculation, the lower fares and additional routes and flights brought by deregulation are worth more than $12 billion a year to consumers. Moreover, airline experts note that while deregulation has led to cuts in service to some small cities, in passing the Essential Air Services program of 1978 and extending it another 10 years last December, Congress has already played a key role in insuring that airlines maintain service to 150 small communities. They argue that safety, fares and airport congestion are affected by more than just the competitive dynamics of deregulation. The five-year economic expansion has been a primary engine stimulating the record levels of air travel, they note, and a lack of airport capacity and management problems are to blame for much of the congestion. 'Since the old regulatory policies tended to keep long-haul fares relatively high, the greatest reductions in discount fares have occurred for longer flights. For example, discount prices for flights over 2,500 miles have dropped by 35 percent in real terms.' - Council of Economic Advisers, Economic Report to the President, 1988 'On average, both business and pleasure travelers have benefited from deregulation. An additional beneficiary is the traveler who under regulation found it too expensive to fly, and thus stayed home or traveled by an alternative mode.' - Clifford Winston, Brookings Institution 'Only one indicator of safety - near midair collisions - has increased since deregulation. The majority of near midair collisions involve general aveiation aircraft, which were not subject to Civil Aviation Board regulation and which are typically not flying under air traffic control when they are involved in near midair collisions. More restrictions on general aviation may be required to reduce near-collisions to desired levels.' - Federal Trade Commission, ''The Deregulated Airline Industry: A Review of the Evidence,'' January 1988.

1023-> DECEPTION ON BUDGET LAID TO GULOTTA IN SUIT
IN a move that could have a significant impact on Nassau County government, a businessman is asking the State Supreme Court to rule on what he contends is County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta's ''manipulation'' of the county budget to ''mislead the people of Nassau County.'' The businessman, Richard J. Korn, a Democrat from Old Brookville, contends that Mr. Gulotta deceived the voters when Mr. Gulotta announced before his election in November that his proposed 1988 budget would produce a reduction of 16 cents per $100 of assessed valuation on all property and would produce an $80 million surplus that would be used for tax stabilization in future years. Right after the election, the tax reduction shrank to 2 cents per $100 of assessed valuation, at least partly because of a $20 million increase in county health insurance premiums, which Mr. Gulotta and other county officials were informed of before the election. The surplus will be less than half the $80 million, according to County Comptroller Peter T. King, who will soon give a final report on 1987 tax revenues. Those revenues will determine the surplus in the 1988 budget. Mr. Gulotta's press spokesman, Ken Cynar, declined to comment on the court action and referred all questions to the Nassau County Attorney. Bonnie Chaikin, a deputy county attorney, said there is ''no merit'' to the Korn case. ''He only presents a misunderstanding of the budget process,'' said Ms. Chaikin, saying that the proposed budget can rely only on estimated figures because final quarter revenues for 1987 are not computed until this month. These revenues in turn affect the 1988 budget. She said she had found ''no inconsistencies'' between the Gulotta press release before the election and his budget message. Mr. Korn is arguing that the state stabilization fund is actually a device for Mr. Gulotta to provide a tax reduction next year, when he will be running for a full four-year term. His election in November was to fill the remaining two years of the term of Francis T. Purcell, who resigned early last year. Mr. Korn wants the surplus returned to the taxpayers in the form of a tax reduction this year and has asked for an explanation of the discrepancy in the pre- and post-election figures. Mr. Korn, who acknowledges that he might have his own political agenda and that he might seek political office in the future, has already scored a victory in the legal skirmish. That victory pointed up the close ties between the Nassau Republican organization and county government, including the judiciary. Mr. Gulotta and most other members of the Nassau Board of Supervisors also hold top party as well as public offices. Mr. Korn's lawsuit was to be heard by Justice Joseph Goldstein of State Supreme Court, but Mr. Korn moved that the judge recuse himself because of his Republican ties. In court papers, Mr. Korn argued that Judge Goldstein's law secretary, Edward J. Hart Jr., is the son of the lawyer who represents both the Nassau Republican organization and the Town of Hempstead. Joseph N. Mondello, one of the respondents in the Korn suit, is both the Nassau Republican leader and the Presiding Supervisor of Hempstead. Mr. Korn also cited one of Edward J. Hart Sr.'s partners, State Senator John R. Dunne, who, Mr. Korn said, had submitted a testimonial for Judge Goldstein in proceedings before the State Commission on Judicial Conduct. Finally, Mr. Korn cited a party in Judge Goldstein's chambers for the judge's mother the day before the return date on the Korn petition at which Hempstead Supervisor Gregory Peterson read a town proclamation praising the judge's mother. Mr. Peterson is also a respondent in the action. Mr. Korn said in his court papers that the party and the Hart law firm ties ''demonstrate a close personal as well as professional and political relationship between Justice Goldstein and certain respondents that creates the appearance of partiality and impropriety.'' He said the judge had not informed either Mr. Korn or his lawyer of those ties. Coincidentally, the State Commission on Government Integrity is investigating similar close ties between judges in Queens and the Democratic organization in that county, including rulings by the judges on matters affecting the organization. Confronted with the motion, Justice Goldstein recused himself and a Democratic judge, Andrew Di Paoli, was assigned. He has scheduled a hearing for Wednesday. The case could be significant, since it is not uncommon for politicians to use budgets and taxes for political purposes. In Suffolk County, for example, the former County Executive, Peter F. Cohalan, imposed record-breaking real-estate tax increases in 1986 that allowed his Republican interim successor, Michael A. LoGrande, to propose substantial tax reductions last year when Mr. LoGrande unsuccessfully sought election for a full term. In the meantime, Suffolk residents had paid the tax increases for a year, an issue that was emphasized by the Democratic candidate for County Executive, Patrick G. Halpin, who defeated Mr. LoGrande. At the other end of the state, the budding political career of Erie County Executive Edward V. Rutkowski, a former professional football player, foundered on a similar move. He had said before his re-election in 1983 that he had a budget surplus and that tax increases were not necessary, a surplus that disappeared after the election. Mr. Rutkowski was resoundingly defeated last year in an election in which his 1983 unfulfilled promise was an issue. Mr. Korn, in his suit, cited a legal opinion by the State Comptroller, Edward V. Regan, that ''the practice of simply accumulating surplus moneys from year to year, for investment or any other purpose, is illegal.'' Mr. Korn said that even taking into account the health insurance increases, there is at least a $60 million surplus that should be returned to Nassau residents as tax reductions. He accused Mr. Gulotta of ''unprecedented pre-election-day overzealousness in his desire to manipulate the people of Nassau County into believing that he is a prudent fiscal conservative.'' Mr. Korn, in his court papers, contended that Mr. Gulotta does not have the right ''to take $62.4 million out of our tax dollars hostage and place them in some secret fund - only to be paraded out and rediscovered when it suits his political benefit.'' Mr. King, the County Comptroller, who is not a defendant in the action and was the only Republican county official willing to be interviewed, said that the $80 million ''surplus'' was only ''an estimate'' and that the 1987 revenue figures would not be known until mid-February. He said the use of the surplus, whatever its size, for a tax stabilization fund was ''an excellent idea.'' Mr. King said it had taken time to ''work out the numbers'' on the health insurance increase just before the election. ''I think it was done in a prudent way,'' he said. Mr. Korn, who is 37 years old, is a partner in a Manhattan film editing and special-effects company. One of his specialties is political commercials, which he edits after they have been produced. He has worked for Republican and Democrat candidates, including Walter F. Mondale, President Reagan, Governor Cuomo, Andrew P. O'Rourke and Mayor Koch. Mr. Korn does not hold any Democratic Party office but unsuccessfully sought a State Senate nomination in North Hempstead in 1976. In the late 1960's and 1970's, he said, he was active nationally in the Association of Student Governments. Mr. Korn said he had first made his assertions of deception at a meeting of the Board of Supervisors in early December. At that time, he said, Mr. Gulotta testily asked him: ''What's your game, Mr. Korn?'' At the next meeting, Mr. Korn had subpoenas served on Mr. Gulotta and the entire board. ''I don't think they thought I was serious until then,'' he said.

1024-> Ten Days That Shook the Campaign
It took the Wisconsin primary to put Jesse Jackson's progress back into perspective. Ten days before, Michigan's Democratic caucuses created turmoil. In a campaign that has been minutely measured for months, they constituted an oddly casual event. There were no meetings, as the term caucus implies, and no voting lists. All who claimed to be Democrats could vote, yet relatively few people did. And there weren't any of those valuable exit polls that make it possible to tell which kinds of voters voted for whom. The media, reflecting a weakness for weekly campaign melodrama, nevertheless trumpeted Mr. Jackson's 2-to-1 triumph. Stunned Democrats seemed to lose all perspective. They had politely patronized him as a can't-win-anyway candidate; did he, suddenly, have a chance? They twisted in torment: The country's not ready for a black nominee. Yet there's no way to stop him without looking repugnantly racist. Finally, Wisconsin showed just how much misconception the Michigan caucuses had fostered. They attracted only a fraction of the number likely to vote in a proper primary. David Rohde, a Michigan State University political scientist, contrasts the turnout, 210,000, with the 1.5 million who voted in Illinois. And with an extremely heavy black vote, the 2-to-1 Jackson triumph certainly looked atypical, unfairly obscuring even Mr. Jackson's own longer-term progress. The Wisconsin results make Michigan look much more like molehill than mountain. Mr. Jackson's 28 percent share of the Wisconsin vote, as against Michael Dukakis's winning 48 percent, is much more consistent with other recent results, like those in Connecticut. Mr. Jackson's Wisconsin campaign was hardly flawless. Writing privately to Gen. Manuel Noriega of Panama was reckless, and invited critics to recall his past contacts with other unsavory foreign figures. Nevertheless, Mr. Jackson attracts white support. In Iowa he got 9 percent of the white vote, in Connecticut about 20 percent and now in Wisconsin about 23 percent. And that was in a state with about 4 percent black voters. Attention now turns to the April 19 primary in New York, where more than a quarter of the electorate is likely to be black. Even stripped of the Michigan exaggeration, this progress demonstrates how Jesse Jackson's appeal transcends race. The Democrats will have to find a way to bottle the Jackson magic. What, they ask, does Jesse want? The question has already become a crass cliche. Mr. Dukakis, to his credit as a person and a politician, has not asked it. The question demeans the man and misses the point. Mr. Jackson embodies the aspirations of blacks, the Democrats' most loyal voting bloc. Will the party recognize that loyalty with a significant voice in its councils, perhaps even with a place on the ticket? Mr. Jackson also has become the favorite of the Democratic left. How will the party accommodate those interests? Finally, for many Americans, Mr. Jackson's campaign has truly become ''a campaign of hope,'' sorely welcome after the discouragements of the Reagan years. Mr. Jackson, by pledging to support the Democratic ticket in any case, demonstrates his respect for the system. By keeping those he represents in fair perspective, the system can do the same.

1025-> Film: 'Mammame,' Tribe of Dancers
''MAMMAME,'' which will be seen in its first New York screenings today and tomorrow at Film Forum 2, is the work of Raul Ruiz, the Chilean expatriate film director, and Jean-Claude Gallotta, the French experimentalist choreographer. Mr. Ruiz is a surrealist. Mr. Gallotta is a fabulist. And the surprisingly immediate private worlds of these two enfants terribles of the arts are complementary here. This filmed version of Mr. Gallotta's ''Mammame'' remains true to and even extends his dance, which fixes on the tribe of quirky, physically imperfect humans that has romped and nudged its way through other pieces by the choreographer. The dance is essentially a suite of duets in which one couple or another attempts to grab a few private moments together as members of the tribe engage in a series of small skirmishes, both sexual and tribal, taut and warily abandoned. The child's cry for its mother suggested in the title is muted in this dreamlike film, which has few words and is set to a serviceable score by Henry Torque and Serge Houppin. But the dancers do surge and scamper fitfully through an overwhelming and incomprehensible environment for most of the film. And Mr. Gallotta and Mr. Ruiz have in their individual ways turned dance over and coaxed it loose from familiar moorings. Jacques Bouquin's photography and Mr. Ruiz's visual conception abolish the frame for dance that exists even in nonproscenium spaces. The camera moves up at the dancers from below them and low to the ground, and views them from high above, rather than at eye level. The dancers move in corridors and crannies that do not open out to anywhere. They are caught in compressed, concrete rooms perfect for forced confessions. And ''Mammame'' has an urgent, confessional feel, but of abstracted confessions made up of embraces and partings, small savageries and soothing caresses. Mr. Gallotta, the engineer of those ''confessions,'' wanders through, popping up from time to time with a look of perplexed curiosity that enhances the streak of goofiness and Gallic insouciance that is generally and perversely present in his dances. The dancers spring free a little, still compulsive, in a long stage-like space that appears to be part of an open-air theater, in which the company is enlarged by the dancers' shadows. Their sudden appearance on a beach at sunset is another freeing of sorts, but in this idyllic but fidgety apotheosis the film loses steam and becomes a puzzling and pretentious bore. ''Mammame'' is accompanied by ''From an Island Summer,'' a curiously sophomoric short film by Charles Atlas and Karole Armitage. Surreal Romp MAMMAME, directed by Raul Ruiz; screenplay by Jean-Claude Gallotta and Mr. Ruiz; director of photography, Jacques Bouquin; edited by Martine Bouquin; music by Henry Torque and Serge Houppin; production designer, Mr. Ruiz; choreography by Mr. Gallotta; produced by Arcanal/Cinematheque de la Danse, Maison de la Culture de Grenoble and Theatre de la Ville de Paris; released by Pacific Film Archives. At Film Forum 2, 57 Watts Street. Running time: 65 minutes. This film has no rating.

1026-> SPORTS PEOPLE; Olympic Springboard
More than a single race will be on the line for Rod Dixon and Gianni Poli today when they head a strong field for the third running of the Los Angeles Marathon. The runners, both former winners of the New York City Marathon, are hoping to use a victory in Los Angeles as a springboard to the Olympics. For Dixon, the race is an official part of the New Zealand Olympic trials, but for Poli the situation is less clear-cut. Although it would not gain him an automatic bid, he hopes a good showing will persuade Italian athletic officials to name him to the Olympic team.

1028-> Behind the Timetable
To the Editor: As principal investigator in the physicians' health study of aspirin and beta-carotene, I wish to respond to the news analysis on the New England Journal of Medicine's publication of our preliminary findings by Lawrence K. Altman (front-page, Jan. 28), who has given me permission to mention that he is one of the 22,071 participants in the study. Following the recommendation of the trial's data monitoring board Dec. 18, 1987, to discontinue the blinded aspirin component of the study, and given the public health implications of our findings, we adopted a time-table to insure timely release of the results to the participants, the scientific community and the public. Our first commitment was to convey the results by a letter from me to the participants. In addition to summarizing the results, we wished to inform each participant whether he had been taking aspirin or placebo. It took about a month to compose, address with identification number, print and mail a letter and questionnaire to each participant. Our second priority was to disseminate the information as quickly as possible to the scientific community by preparing a report of the findings for publication in a peer-review journal. We wished release of this report to be close to, but not before, the date participants would receive their letters. We, therefore, approached the editor of The New England Journal, Arnold Relman, about publication of our preliminary report. Dr. Relman provided us a prompt and most useful peer review. The journal was willing to publish the article as early as Jan. 21; we requested an extra week to allow us to mail the letters to the participants. Consequently, publication was set for Jan. 28, with the letter to the participants to be mailed Jan. 25. Since information in articles published in the journal is embargoed until 6 P.M. the night before publication, our hope was the majority of participants would have received their letters by then. But the results were released by the press Jan. 26. Because many participants would not yet have received their letters by then, I felt it imperative that our research group respect the embargo and not give live interviews until Wednesday evening as agreed. I also felt an obligation to uphold my written acceptance of the journal's policies. The breaking of the embargo disturbed us. Premature release of the results occurred in a haphazard manner and led to considerable confusion. CHARLES H. HENNEKENS, M.D. Brookline, Mass., Feb. 1, 1988

1029-> STAMPS; A Celebration for the French Comic Strips
A booklet of 12 stamps from France re-create the works of French comic strip artists. The set is a salute to the comic strip as a form of communication and a belated celebration of the 1987 centennial of the appearance of the first French comic strip story. The first international comic strip gallery was opened in Angouleme, France in 1974. The gallery now hosts more than 180,000 visitors each year and presents awards for superior achievement in the medium. All 12 comic strip artists, whose work appears in the set, are Angouleme prizewinners and most are graduates of the school affiliated with the gallery. The comic strip as literature and graphic art has only recently come into its own. Long considered a sub-literature, comic strips are now studied in college courses. The medium is recognized as having tremendous communication and teaching potential. The first story told in captioned pictures in France was ''The Humorous Tale of Master Pierre.'' It appeared in Mon Journal under the signature of Christophe, a pseudonym for Georges Colomb, a professor at the Sorbonne, who created some of France's most famous comic strips. The popularity of comic strips accompanied the growth in youth publications. The strips' heroes accompanied soldiers to the front in World War I. During the occupation of France in World War II, the German police censored seditious drawings and texts found in the comic strips. The French regarded the comic strip art form as important enough to protect it from American comic strip importation that followed World War II. A 1949 law curbed this importation and led to the creation of many new comic strip magazines during the 1950's. The comic strip entered the adult world in France in the 1960's, moved to an emphasis on science fiction and avante-garde self-expression in the 1970's. The 1980's have seen a return to favor of the classic adventure story. On Music A collection of music-related postage stamps is now on exhibit in the National Museum of American History at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. Five wall frames depicting one aspect of the overall theme will be on view through June 30. They feature composers, festivals, folk dances, musical instruments and advertising. The stamps are part of the Charles Haywood Collection that was donated to the Smithsonian's National Philatelic Collection by Charles Haywood, a retired professor of music at Queens College in New York City. Professor Haywood was inspired to form the collection when he noticed some music-related stamps in his son's collection. The display is part of the National Museum's Hall of Postal History. On Paper A primer on stamp paper is available to collectors who send a stamped, return-addressed N10 envelope to the American Stamp Dealers' Association, 5 Dakota Drive, Lake Success, N.Y. 11042. The pamphlet shows a $35 stamp and a $60,000 rarity that differed only in the paper on which they were printed. It also introduces the subjects of paper manufacture and paper types. It was written by Leo Scarlet of Flushing, N.Y.

1030-> Delaware Takeover Curb Near
Delaware will soon have a new law that makes hostile takeovers of corporations more difficult. The Delaware Senate yesterday passed a new provision to the state's corporate laws, and Gov. Michael Castle is expected to sign the measure next week. The state's House of Representatives passed the bill earlier this week. Delaware is the legal home to more major companies than any other state in the country. Almost 18,000 corporations are chartered in Delaware, including 45 percent of the companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange and more than half of the Fortune 500 companies. Takeovers on Rise Again The action by Delaware comes as takeover activity in corporate America has begun to heat up again, after falling off sharply after the stock market plunge in October. Until then, 1987 had been a banner year for hostile bids. Under the new law, an unwanted buyer who acquires more than 15 percent of a company's stock cannot complete the takeover for three years. But the law also contains provisions that make it less onerous than antitakeover laws in other states. For example, a takeover could be completed if the buyer, while crossing the 15 percent threshold, manages to buy at least 85 percent of the outstanding stock. The 85 percent excludes shares held by directors who are officers and certain shares held under employee stock plans. Applies Retroactively A takeover could also be completed if it is approved by two-thirds of the shares voting in a special election, excluding the shares held by the bidder. Every company incorporated in Delaware is covered by the law unless its board and shareholders decide they do not want to be. Once adopted, the new rule will apply retroactively to Dec. 23, 1987. The Senate passed the bill, 19 to 1, with no debate. According to Reuters news service, the negative vote came from the Democratic majority leader, Thomas Sharp, who had considered introducing a different version. The measure unanimously passed the state's House of Representatives earlier this week. Opposition by S.E.C. The proposal had been opposed by three commissioners of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including David S. Ruder, chairman. Mr. Ruder has proposed to Congress that there be one national rule governing takeovers. He has also asked that the S.E.C. be given more authority to make rules about takeovers. T. Boone Pickens, the Texas takeover specialist, had financed a group that lobbied hard against the measure. A number of institutional investors also objected to the proposal. The move by Delaware is one of the most signicant corporate law developments since a ruling by the United States Supreme Court last spring on state corporate laws. The court ruled that an Indiana law intended to curtail hostile takeovers was not unconstitutional or pre-empted by Federal securities laws. After the court's ruling, legislatures in 13 states adopted laws that curb unfriendly acquisitions.

1031-> Russia's Old and Rival Capitals
WITH JUST FOUR WORDS - ''LOVED LENINGRAD, hated Moscow'' - first-time visitors to the Soviet Union have been summing up their feelings ever since Intourist hung up its shingle. The twofold reaction is visceral, irrepressible and virtually universal. In Leningrad, visitors feel bouyant, alert and subtly flattered. ''All this is for me?'' they ask themselves. In Moscow, by contrast, they feel baffled, pushed around, disoriented and unloved. They are quite right, too. Initially, Moscow is hard to decipher and hard to take, whereas Leningrad comes on like a beautiful woman who has been waiting for us all her life. Even on maps, there is no mistaking the antithetical character of the two cities. Leningrad is made of long, straight streets that streak away into a northern infinity. Moscow is a bustling place, all starts and stops; even today, it often seems to cry - ''Enough!'' and hanker for the countryside. As for the concentric boulevards - which in the late 19th century were like huge, easy-going, well-shaded promenades - they have been rolled flat and widened. To sample these contrasts, the visitor has only to stand at the bottom of Gorky Street in Moscow at the end of a working day and try to walk uphill at leisure, looking idly at this and that. It will not be easy. Down the hill, heading for home with some last minute marketing to do, an impenetrable multitude of thickset men and even thicker-set women comes pounding. With big shapeless bags at the ready, they peel off in unanimity at whatever shop looks faintly welcoming. We feel them - even in the soles of our feet - shaking the earth with their force, their frantic energy, their determination to succeed. In the historic center of Leningrad, on the other hand, the city is as if preserved in an aquatint. A delicate yellow predominates, with a brilliant blue that dares the sky to go one better, and a rich, cushioning green. Silence prevails, almost everywhere. The geometry of the city is exactly as it was when the first plans were drawn up, going on 300 years ago, and the first householders gritted their teeth and built their palaces, and the first dogs moved into the kennels that had been penciled into the city plans and can be seen to this day. PETER THE GREAT had an unlimited ambition, even when his construction workers were drowning by the hundreds before they were able to lay a foundation. (A mixture of tyrant and geometrician, he took pleasure in noting that in his own little house the level of water was precisely 21 inches above the floor.) But his city got built straight, and his streets and canals got built wide. (When the canals on one of the adjoining islands were built too narrow for his liking, Peter told his master of the works to start them all over again.) Somewhere at the back of his mind was the horror, as he saw it, of Moscow. He remembered the twisty, turny, up-and-down roads; the tumultous side alleys, so impossible to police; the boyars, so often insubordinate, and the rebellious Streltsy, whose widows came to the walls of the Kremlin and made such a confounded noise after their husbands had been executed. Why couldn't Moscow be more like Amsterdam, where he could go roistering in seamen's bars, or London, where he could roll downhill and go through a thick thorn hedge without anybody making a fuss? He disliked Moscow not only because it was there at all, but because of what it stood for - a Russia in which he had played no part. He wanted his own city, with his own ideas, and he got it. To a remarkable degree, that city survives intact. Looking at the little house where Pushkin lived, just across the way from the Winter Palace, we remember how Czar Nicholas I would ride past those same corner windows, day after day. (He later told Pushkin's wife, whom he was known to admire, that it was really too bad of her never to raise the blinds.) Walking along a quiet and unfrequented stretch of the Moika Canal, we turn right at the Nevsky Prospect and stop at No. 18, which was then Wolf's confectionery shop, the place at which Pushkin arranged to meet his second before the duel that killed him. Or we can sit in the Summer Garden, likewise little changed since Vladimir Nabokov walked there with his tutor. ''A public park on the Neva Embankment,'' he called it many years later, ''with avenues of crow-haunted shade trees (imported elms and oaks) and noseless statues of Greek deities (made in Italy).'' How could these two cities not nurture an ancient rivalry? Between them, no love was ever lost. From the moment that Peter the Great turned his back on Moscow and built a great new city in a featureless swamp 400 miles to the northwest, that new city could only be the enemy, the elegant predator that had made Moscow unimportant. IN 1918, AFTER THE BOL-shevik Revolution, Moscow became the capital again, while the erstwhile St. Petersburg became, in political terms, a second-class city where nothing much would ever happen. That, too, did not promote mutual affection. The final and definitive blow to reciprocal cordiality occurred in the late summer of 1941, when it became clear that Stalin would not hesitate to deliver Leningrad to the advancing German troops rather than weaken his reserves elsewhere. After that episode (chillingly recounted in Harrison E. Salisbury's ''900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad''), hatred and contempt for Moscow were written, as if in marble, into the consciousness of Leningrad. Nearly 50 years later, not many of those who were adults during the siege are still around. But folk memories are very long in Russia: the people of Leningrad see the people of Moscow as coarse, power-oriented, tainted by ancestral brutalities and at the bottom of the class when it comes to cultivation. In Moscow, by contrast, the people of Leningrad are regarded as effete, nostalgic, narcissistic and stranded in a backwater. Though sometimes ready to agree that Leningrad is pretty, in a Western way, Muscovites believe that in terms of vitality Leningrad is to Moscow as Bruges - forever daydreaming among its stagnant canals - is to Brussels, the economic capital of continental Europe. They rather like to act all this out, when an opportunity comes along. Many years ago, I was in a resort on the Black Sea at the height of the season. The entertainments offered every evening in the dining room could not be called subtle, but people from Moscow loved them. They sang, danced, laughed, horsed around, wore crazy hats. At a far corner table was a party from Leningrad. Well dressed in the fashion of many years earlier, and with table manners so good as to seem second nature, they averted their faces in disgust from the convivial scene and made disparaging remarks in an accented French that came straight out of Pushkin's ''Eugene Onegin.'' Even in Moscow, the same prejudices sometimes prevailed. Hanging out with young theater people while Khrushchev was in power, I found that by Friday afternoon they got restless. ''You really ought to come with us to Leningrad,'' they would say. ''No one spends the weekend in Moscow.'' IT HAS TO BE SAID THAT, in these matters, Moscow is its own worst enemy. Year by year, it tears itself apart. Once-vivid neighborhoods become like everywhere else. If you tell first-timer visitors what the Arbat district or Kitai-Gorod were like, even 30 years ago, they don't believe it. In the Arbat, once upon a time there were tranquil streets of elegant stuccoed villas painted yellow and white, with little gardens to match? In Kitai-Gorod, traders from far places, each in distinctive dress? Muscovites themselves do not seem to mind the destruction of their old city. If a great blundering intersection with hideous apartment blocks goes up in the middle of the Arbat, they will say only that this makes it possible for more people to live in Moscow. In this and other ways, they downplay the fact that the cultural history of Moscow since the middle of the 18th century has been quite as distinguished as that of Leningrad. Moscow was often a decade or so behind Leningrad in coming to terms with novelties from the West, but to this day the visitor can find, within walking distance of one another, the hall (the Manege) in which Hector Berlioz gave a concert that 12,000 people are said to have attended, the houses of Dostoyevsky, Scriabin and Tchaikovsky and the house in which Isadora Duncan set up her school of dance. If we add to those the idiosyncratic mansion of the great avant-garde collector Ivan Morosov, it should be clear that Moscow had a cultural history that was rich, dense and continuous. With a good guidebook and a list of opening times, you can get into many, though not all, of the surviving houses of this sort. Although the house museums are sometimes disappointing, they can work upon us with a compelling resonance as we creep up on the great men in question, inch by inch. We have to remember, however, what the German critic Walter Benjamin wrote about Moscow as long ago as 1927: ''Nor is there any Western city that, in its vast squares, looks so rurally formless and perpetually sodden from bad weather, thawing snow or rain.'' As to that, the tour bus cannot cope, and the tour guide must vamp with statistics until we reach our destinations. MOSCOW HAS A GREAT deal of intellectual energy and, for those who can find them, it has pockets of strangeness and silence, poetry and paradox. It will probably help if you can attach to yourself a real live Muscovite whose interests tally with your own. Failing that, a point of reference here and there and a readiness to get lost in a constructive way are fundamental. They will allow you to glimpse the rare surviving shops that have a personality all their own, the courtyards that in springtime turn into a kind of kitchen parliament, complete with chicken coops, and the interiors - some of them still very seductive -that can be glimpsed toward evening in the much-mutilated Arbat quarter, between the lighting of the amber lamps and the drawing of the blinds. There is still such a thing as a soft-spoken, private Moscow. Even so, I would not lay money on your finding what Walter Benjamin found 60 years ago - signs like the one, outside a shoe shop, that showed a Pomeranian running away with a sandal in its mouth, or pendants that hung outside a Turkish restaurant and showed, in each case, a customer wearing a fez and sitting at a little table for one. Gone too are many of the foreign names that proliferated in Benjamin's day - the casino called Alcazar, the hotel called Liverpool, the boardinghouse named after the Tyrol. Rather than grieve over nuances of this kind, it may be better to take Moscow at its strongest - that is to say, in the Kremlin. It is, of course, the center of Soviet power and, as such, a place of mystery and dread, suspicion and misgiving, to many a foreign visitor. ''What are they hatching out now?'' that visitor says to himself. As to that, nothing will be vouchsafed. But the timorous foreigner may be surprised and pleased by the pacific aspect of what greets him once he is through the great gates. FOR THIS IS NOT, IN ES-sence, a great glowering fortress, even if there are rooms here and there to which it might be rather alarming to be summoned. The Kremlin has, in fact, a layout that could almost be called casual. Churches and cathedrals - no longer in use, but impeccably kept -nestle beside palaces that have nothing to do with tyranny. Asymmetry reigns. There are no daunting vistas, no staircases that ask us to sink to our knees. We come and we go, guided or unguided. As to whether we dream or dread, that is up to us. What we should not fail to see is the Armory Museum, newly reopened after a lengthy refurbishment. Visitors are often put off by the name, thinking it to be all about bows and arrows. But the Armory Museum is the very kernel of Moscow, the sight of all sights that brings the visitor to a realization of the city's original stature as the epicenter of Russia, to which all riches flowed as water flows downhill, the place in which power was absolute and undivided, if sometimes precarious. WEAPONRY OF AN AN-tique but nonetheless intimidating kind plays its part in the Armory Museum. (No single object could speak more clearly for the far past of Russia than the helmet that was worn in the 13th century by Prince Yaroslov II, the father of the national hero Alexander Nevsky.) But this is not a war museum. It is a museum of everything that was grandest and most spectacular about the Russian court in the days before Peter the Great came to the throne in 1682. There are objects of later date -costumes and carriages from the 18th century, a Sevres service given to Czar Alexan-der I by Napoleon, the crowns said to be worn by Pushkin and his wife at their marriage, jeweled Easter eggs made by Faberge for the Imperial Court not long before the Revolution - but this is fundamentally a show of strength by the Moscow primacy that came to an end in the early 18th century. It is, in fact, the real Russian thing, the pre-Peter the Great thing, the thing that made Peter the Great leave Moscow and drag his court with him, whether they liked it or not. It dates from the time when the Kremlin was self-sufficient. It had its own armorers, its own goldsmiths, its own silversmiths and its own jewelers (who never went short of raw materials). Gifts were welcomed, if they were grand enough; we can see, for instance, the state carriage that was given to Boris Godunov by Queen Elizabeth I of England. Set before us, we see the dream of an ancestral Russia, a Russia more than able to look after itself in terms of luxury and display. Russians thrive on the big firm statement, and when you are done with the Armory Museum you are likely to reel away, gorged and stunned to the edge of disbelief. The Museum also makes us understand why a city that once had so flamboyant an identity should now have trouble redefining itself. Present-day Moscow has not the architectural unity of central Leningrad, where just about the newest major building is the former German Embassy that was built in 1911-12 by the German avant-garde architect Peter Behrens. Nor has Moscow the idyllic, almost supernatural climate of Leningrad in early summer. In terms of their approach to us, no two cities could be more different than Moscow and Leningrad. The one is all thumbs (but what strong ones!), the other, all delicate fingerwork. Early summer in Moscow has a gorgeous, blossomy, strongly corporeal flavor that tackles the huge city block by block, winning some and losing others. As to the same season in Leningrad, no one could hope to rival what was written by Joseph Brodsky, the Nobel Prize-winning poet and a great, though misused son of Leningrad, in his book of essays, ''Less Than One.'' Here he is on the white nights in Leningrad: ''It's the most magic time in the city, when you can write or read without a lamp at two o'clock in the morning, and when the buildings, deprived of shadows and their roofs rimmed with gold, look like a set of fragile china. It's so quiet around that you can almost hear the chink of a spoon falling in Finland. . . . On such nights, it's hard to fall asleep, because it's too light and because any dream will be inferior to this reality. Where a man doesn't cast a shadow, like water.'' Moscow's highs are of another kind; they belong as much to a certain driven actuality as to the past, majestic as that may have been. We have to learn to read them. But when we have done that, Moscow will appear to us not as the rival, still less as the enemy, of Leningrad, but as its boisterous complement. GETTING READY FOR RUSSIA GROUND RULES Travel to the Soviet Union is expected to reach a record high this year, when ''glasnost'' and ''perestroika'' have become household words. Since accommodations are limited (many older hotels, among them Moscow's Berlin and Metropole and Leningrad's Europaiskaya and Astoria are either undergoing renovation or scheduled to be renovated this summer), advance planning is essential. Intourist, the official Soviet travel agency through which all travel to the Soviet Union must be arranged, is primarily equipped to handle groups, although individual travel may be arranged through Intourist-authorized travel agencies. GROUP TOURS A wide variety of tours is available, from special interest trips for students, clergy, social workers, physicians and peace activists to a plutocrat's package with champagne on every supper table. What follows is a sample of shorter tours focusing on Moscow and Leningrad. Anniversary Tours, 250 West 57th Street, New York 10107 (telephone: 245-7501), offers an 11-day tour with 4 nights in Leningrad, 1 night in a sleeper on the train to Moscow, 3 nights in Moscow and 1 night in Prague. Prices range from $1,429 to $1,799 a person, double occupancy, depending on season. The package includes all meals, city sightseeing, two cultural performances, two visits to Soviet social institutions and round-trip air fare from New York on Czechoslovak Airlines. Anniversary Tours also offers Voices of the Future youth tours and Russian language programs, in conjunction with the State University of New York, New Paltz. General Tours, 770 Broadway, New York 10003 (598-1800), has a 10-day tour with 3 nights in Moscow, 1 night in a sleeper on the train to Leningrad and 5 nights in Leningrad. Prices depend on season and range from $1,749 to $2,149 a person, double occupancy. Meals, city sightseeing and two cultural performances are included, as is round-trip air fare on non-stop Pan Am and Aeroflot flights between New York and Moscow. General Tours also has a number of tours combining destinations in the Soviet Union with cities in Scandinavia, Eastern Europe and Turkey. Russian Travel Bureau Inc., 225 East 44th Street, New York 10017 (986-1500), has an 11-day tour with 4 nights in Leningrad, 4 nights in Moscow and 1 night in Prague.

1032-> 7 in Baseball Collusion Case Win Free Agency
The arbitrator who found that baseball club owners acted in collusion against free agents after the 1985 season yesterday ordered that seven of those players be given a chance to be free agents again. The players, including Kirk Gibson, the star outfielder of the Detroit Tigers, are free to negotiate with teams until March 1 without relinquishing their existing contracts. If they have not made a decision by then, they have to tell their present clubs if they want to remain under contract to them or continue to be free agents. If they choose free agency, they give up their existing contracts. Thomas Roberts, the arbitrator who is hearing testimony in the case, created a new-look, free-look free agency for Gibson, his teammate Tom Brookens, Carlton Fisk of the Chicago White Sox, Joe Niekro of the Minnesota Twins, Juan Beniquez of the Toronto Blue Jays and Butch Wynegar and Donnie Moore of the California Angels. Gibson was sought in trades by several teams last month, including the Yankees and the Los Angeles Dodgers. The players' union has contended that the owners' collusive action resulted in lower salaries than would have otherwise been gained, not only for free agents but for all players. This is the first such case in baseball history and is only the first of the remedies that Roberts could order to bolster his Sept. 21 ruling that the owners acted in collusion. Lawyers on both sides expect the arbitrator also to award monetary damages to the group of free agents. The new-look free agency part of the remedies could also set a precedent for subsequent grievances and free agents, including Tim Raines, Andre Dawson and Jack Morris from the 1986 group. Sixty-two players were free agents after the 1985 season, but only 14 are now bound to major league teams. Roberts, who issued his decision in Los Angeles, where he has conducted remedy hearings and discussions this week, did not order free-agency opportunities for 7 of the 14 players because they had been free agents subsequent to their free agency after the 1985 season. For the seven he declared free agents, Roberts said he would monitor their status, and if disputes arose about compliance with his order he would resolve them on an expedited basis. First of Three Cases Roberts's action stemmed from the first of three conspiracy cases brought by the Major League Baseball Players Association against the 26 major-league clubs. The Players Association filed the third grievance - for the 1987 free agents - earlier this week, just five days after another arbitrator, George Nicolau, finished hearing testimony in the second case, which involved the 1986 free agents. The effect of the first two cases on the 1987 free agents was not clear. More free-agent movement occurred this winter than in the previous two winters, but the players continued to believe that the owners were orchestrating the market and withholding signficant offers from significant free agents, if they made offers to them at all. In his ruling Sept. 21, Roberts found that the clubs had violated the labor agreement between the owners and the players by acting in collusion to restrict the movement of the free agents and to dilute their bargaining power. Article 18H of the labor agreement covers ''individual nature of rights'' and states, ''Players shall not act in concert with other players and clubs shall not act in concert with other clubs.'' Roberts found that the owners had substituted a ''contemplated benefit of a common goal'' for the individual efforts called for in the agreement. When Gibson, a left-handed-hitting outfielder who was considered the most attractive of the 62 free agents, was available, no one but his 1985 team, the Tigers, made him an offer. He re-signed with them, accepting a three-year contract for $4 million. 'A Lot of Options' Gibson was traveling and not available for comment on the latest ruling, but his agent, Doug Baldwin, said: ''It opens up a lot of options for him. It gives him more flexibility. He doesn't want to make a sideshow of this. We're not going on a caravan. There are a few teams he'd like to talk to, especially in light of the trade talks involving him in December. The first thing Monday morning there should be some action.'' The Yankees talked to the Tigers last month about a possible Dave Winfield-for-Gibson trade and the Dodgers discussed a Pedro Guerrero-for-Gibson swap. The Yankees have since signed Jack Clark as a free agent to a two-year $3 million contract but would still like a left-handed-hitting outfielder. George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' owner, did not return a telephone call to discuss Gibson, and Lou Piniella, the general manager, declined comment. It is conceivable that Gibson could extract a new contract from the Tigers. He has one year remaining with a salary of $1.3 million. Gibson is by far the most attractive player in the group of seven. Fisk, Niekro and Beniquez are 37 years old or older, and Wynegar and Moore were injured most of last season. Brookens is Detroit's regular third baseman but is not considered a solid everyday player. Agents for Brookens and Moore said they would see if any teams were interested in their clients. Fisk, Niekro and Wynegar were not available for comment so their plans were not known. Fisk recently signed a one-year contract for $700,000 with the White Sox. Moore ($850,000), Niekro ($800,000) and Wynegar ($700,000) each have one year left. Beniquez has filed for salary arbitration, but because he has been in the majors for six years or more, the Blue Jays have the option of not going to arbitration and instead making him a free agent. They have until Monday to decide that, but they apparently plan to let Beniquez go. Donald Fehr, executive director of the Players Association, viewed the ruling as ''a good, solid first step.'' Barry Rona, the owners' chief labor representative, said the decision didn't surprise him. ''I expected it,'' he said. ''I disagree with it. We will comply with it.'' After issuing the decision, Roberts returned to the remedy hearing and listened to testimony from Alan and Randy Hendricks, two Houston-based agents who represented several players in the 1985 free-agent group. A SECOND CHANCE These are the seven players who yesterday were given the chance to be free agents again, with the length of the contracts they signed as free agents after the 1985 season, the value of those contracts and their salaries for 1988. In all cases except Juan Beniquez's, 1988 is the last year of their existing contracts. An arbitrator is scheduled to decide Beniquez's 1988 salary, either $344,000 or $450,000. However, the Blue Jays have apparently decided not to go to arbitration with him but instead make him a free agent.

1034-> INDIAN COMMANDOS CLOSE IN ON SIKHS
Indian commandos smashed several Sikh fortifications in the Golden Temple complex and trapped several militants in an underground bunker today in the fiercest assault of the nine-day blockade of the temple. ''We are in control of the towers, the old community kitchen, as well as the basement'' where the militants are trapped and ''have no option but to surrender or die,'' the Punjab police chiefsaid tonight. The chief, K. P. S. Gill, said, however, that the commandos had not physically taken the basement. Militants Hide in Tunnel The police have said that about 15 people are hiding in the fortified basement tunnel linking the 18th-century towers, which dominate the complex. The attack began this morning when commandos and paramilitary troops used machine gun fire to rip a huge hole in one of the towers, then threw in tear gas shells. Troops in bulletproof vests and carrying automatic weapons rushed the building. A commando was slightly injured, and a senior commando official said the troops found a decomposed corpse in one of the towers. More than 70 militants are thought to remain in the complex, and 35 to 40 of them have taken refuge in the shrine set in a lake within the complex. At least 26 Sikhs have been killed in the assault, and 146 Sikhs surrendered Sunday. More Deaths in Punjab Five more deaths attributed by the police to Sikhs were reported today, raising the toll to 59 in three days of killing in Punjab state. About 970 people have died this year in the violence. The commandos at the temple are under Government orders not to fire at the main shrine even if fired upon. The Government is worried that the building may be damaged. An Indian Army assault on the temple in 1984 to crush an uprising based cost hundreds of lives and heavily damaged the shrines here, including the inner sanctum. There has been little damage to most of the buildings during the current operation, except to the clock tower, which was burned in a fire two days ago, and to the towers that were hit by machine gun fire and grenades. New Delhi's strategy seems to be to wear down the militants in the central shrine while encircling the temple. Many Have Cyanide An official associated with those who surrendered Sunday said that several Sikhs were given cyanide by Surjit Singh Pentavn, who surrendered with the 145 others but then killed himself by biting on a glass vial of cyanide. The official said that cyanide vials were found on others who surrendered. Several of those hiding in the central shrine are thought to have the poison, the official said. Earlier this morning, several Sikhs in the temple drew several buckets of water during a half-hour cease-fire before rushing back. Two men with their hands above their heads also walked out of the shrine as if to surrender. But they dashed inside a storeroom, brought out a sack of food and walked back toward the shrine. When commandos yelled at the men to stop, the men ran. They dropped the bag when commandos fired over their heads, and then, pretending to surrender, leaped back into the room before sniper gunfire erupted. There seems to be little response to appeals by Sikh high priests for a march on the Golden Temple to try to end the Government assault.

1035-> IN THE NATION; Star Wars in Decline
In case you haven't noticed, President Reagan's notorious Strategic Defense Initiative has fallen into money, political and technological trouble - not just in the Democratic Congress or with traditional opponents but even among devout Star Wars advocates. The program is by no means dead. But declining confidence in a space-based missile defense and slackening pressures for its early deployment mean that a new President could more easily limit the program to sensible, long-term research. The Soviet Union has made the United States' development and deployment of such a defense a major obstacle to a strategic weapons reduction treaty. The substantial delays S.D.I. almost certainly faces therefore may enhance prospects for Start. The most serious blow to S.D.I. was dealt by the Defense Science Board, an independent scientific panel convened by the Secretary of Defense, Frank C. Carlucci. Though S.D.I. contractors are heavily represented on the board, it recommended scaling back spending and substantially slowing deployment. The first of six suggested stages would employ available technology in deploying 100 ground-based defensive missiles to protect against accidental launches and to complicate any real attack on U.S. missile silos. Only the fifth stage, coming sometime after the turn of the century, would put weapons into space, and only the last - many decades in the future -would employ laser beams and other exotic technology. The last three stages would require renegotiation of the Antiballistic Missile Treaty with the Soviet Union. The most important consequence of this report may be to force the Pentagon itself to lower its sights and de-emphasize quick deployment of S.D.I. That would lessen the urgency with which Congress and a new President could be pressed to pursue Star Wars - the huge cost of which is already a limiting factor. The Science Board caustically criticized the Reagan Administration's efforts to reinterpret the ABM treaty to permit advanced Star Wars testing. The reinterpretation has backfired, the report declared, causing Congress to cut back funding and impose testing restrictions to keep the S.D.I. within the previously accepted limits of the ABM treaty. Mr. Carlucci is believed to be in general sympathy with the Science Board's recommendations, not least because of Congressional budget restrictions, technological difficulties and arms control pressures. Little progress, for example, was made at the Moscow summit meeting on resolving United States-Soviet differences on the ABM treaty and on testing strategic defenses; partly for that reason, the Start treaty also made little progress. After two years of research substantially aided by the Pentagon itself, the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment also has reported that U.S. deployment of a space-based missile defense would quickly provoke Soviet countermeasures to destroy American weapons and sensors in space. The Russians would make extensive efforts, moreover, to overwhelm the U.S. defense with offensive weapons, forcing a new arms race in space. This study also concluded - as has virtually every non-Pentagon assessment - that Mr. Reagan's original vision of a space-based shield over U.S. cities ''seems infeasible.'' Even the computer software for such a defense is not available and, if developed, might not work under actual attack conditions. Still another report - by staff researchers for Senators Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, Dale Bumpers of Arkansas and William Proxmire of Wisconsin, all Democratic opponents of quick S.D.I. deployment - argued that a scarcity of heavy rockets would prevent a missile defense from being launched into space before 1998 at the earliest. Pentagon estimates are that two to five million pounds of weapons, satellites, sensors and platforms would have to be launched in the first phase of S.D.I. deployment. The staff researchers estimated that the entire U.S. rocket supply would lift only about a million pounds; but a new ''advanced launch system,'' even S.D.I. officials say, is now estimated to cost about $17 billion. The Senate staff study concludes, moreover, that first-phase S.D.I. defenses would stop only about one-sixth of incoming warheads from reaching their targets. That hardly seems worth the $171 billion the researchers suggested that the first phase might cost.

1036-> EDUCATION; Midwestern College Beseiged by Applicants
Except for the Latin motto engraved in stone above the leaded windows, the Gothic archway at Washington University in St. Louis looks for all the world like Blair Hall at Princeton. And well it might. Built in 1900, the ivy-covered towers were designed by the same canny architects who sold an almost identical set of plans to Princeton a few years earlier. For years the Ivy League reference was an apt one. Washington University was best known as a backup choice for students who did not get into to Ivy League colleges. But in the last few years this medium-size liberal arts university has dramatically come into its own. ''When I applied here, it was a school to fall back on,'' said Yung-Hsing Wu, a senior. ''My sister is applying and now it's a reach.'' Even as colleges across the country report record numbers of applicants, Washington University stands out: applications increased 50 percent over the last two years. Last year the college received 7,129 applications for a freshman class of 1,297. This year, 8,919 applications were received for a class targeted for 100 fewer students. Changes in Ranking Moreover 94 percent of the students offered admission for next fall's freshman class ranked in the upper fifth of their high school class, up from 80 percent last year. The average score of applications on the Scholastic Aptitude Test rose this year to 1218 out of a possible 1600 from 1198 last year. ''It seems clear, therefore, that we will be welcoming a class of 1,200 freshmen with the strongest academic credentials of any freshman class we have ever known,'' E. B. McDonald, the acting Dean of Admissions, wrote to 250 high school counselors who have usually directed students to Washington University to explain why so many good students were being denied admission. Like many of their peers at other selective institutions, college officials here are groping for explanations of their success. Chancellor William H. Danforth said the explosion in applications had resulted from a campaign to make the college better known, an effort that included invitations to high school counselors from around the country. Other factors, according to interviews with the chancellor, admissions officials, financial aid officers, deans and students, included these: * The growing academic reputation of the college. A survey that all admitted students are asked to fill out indicates that the leading reason for applying was ''a growing understanding of Washington University's academic prestige.'' * A recently completed $630 million campaign, which doubled the original goal of $300 million announced in 1982. * Intensified efforts to recruit more students nationally and to increase financial aid options. * An effort to attract black students. * A $13 million renovation of athletic facilities and membership in the new eight-member University Athletic Association made up of similar liberal arts institutions. Applications Soaring In a sense, selective colleges around the country are on a roll. Applications have been soaring for the last two years in a period when college officials feared they would be tightening their belts because there are fewer 18-year-olds. While no one is quite sure why so many more students are applying to college, it is clear that a college education is increasingly being viewed as worth the considerable financial sacrifice it has become. In addition, the word has spread to students that inability to pay tuition at a good college is no longer a certain barrier to a qualified student because of the increased availability of financial aid. Washington University instituted a cost stabilization plan in 1977 under which parents can borrow money from the university and use it to pay four years' tuition all at once. This means they avoid the yearly increases they would be subjected to if they paid on an annual basis. The payments to the university can be made over 10 years at an interest rate of 9.2 percent. Two years ago the plan was expanded to include room and board. It was also made available to parents whose children were receiving financial assistance based on need. These parents can now pay the portion of the tuition for which they are responsible under the same cost stabilization plan. Participation in Tuition Plan In the 1985-86 school year, the parents of 75 students participated in the plan. Last year the parents of 342 students signed up. Full tuition, room and board is $17,049. ''Families like it because it offers stability in long-term planning,'' said Dennis J. Martin, director of financial aid. ''They see it as part of a statement from the university. We could afford to be a university where each student pays the full freight, but we are looking for a diverse student body.'' For the last 10 years, 50 to 60 percent of the students have received financial aid. The average income of these students' families is $43,000. ''We have been a school that has not alienated the middle class as much as many other schools have,'' Mr. Martin said. The college, which has 4,440 students, has also recently instituted a special scholarship program for black students. Under this plan, 10 black students, selected in a competition, receive full tuition plus a $2,500 stipend. The university works through church groups, black alumni and high school guidance counselors to inform talented black students of the program. This year the college had a 21 percent increase in black applications. The college, with its Gothic buildings of red Missouri granite and white limestone, its series of courtyards and its abundance of grass and trees is made up of five schools -arts and sciences, business and public adminisration, architecture, fine arts and engineering. A high-quality research institution, it has long been attractive to pre-medical students because of its medical school, which runs a faculty exchange program with the undergraduate biology department. ''Our theory from the start was that if people knew about us, people would come,'' said Chancellor Danforth. ''If students visit the campus, they are more likely to come. We are a Midwestern university. We're friendly.''

1037-> Israel Awaits Modern Plague
Israel set up emergency telephone hot lines Tuesday and prepared insecticide-spraying planes to fly into action against a possible plague of locusts, the desert insects dreaded since biblical times. Only a small number of locusts were sighted in southern Israel and the Jordan River valley, but officials warned of a possible larger invasion from the south.

1038-> COMMENCEMENT
The New School In a commencement address critical of American intervention in Latin American affairs, the author Carlos Fuentes said yesterday that ''United States policy in Panama looks like it is being run by Inspector Clouseau.'' He said Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the Panamanian military ruler, ''has not been overthrown, but the Panamanian economy has.'' Mr. Fuentes spoke at the 52d commencement of the New School for Social Research. The school awarded 206 undergraduate and 503 graduate degrees in ceremonies at the First Presbyterian Church on Fifth Avenue at 12th Street. Because of the Reagan Administration's policies, Mr. Fuentes said, Panama's ''private sector is flat on its face'' and ''private institutions are ripe for collectivization.''

1039-> Landlords Rally to Protest Rent Laws
In what has become a springtime ritual here, more than 1,000 landlords rallied outside the State Capitol today and then fanned out through its corridors to lobby against a variety of rent-regulation bills. Many of the landlords complained that Governor Cuomo and the Assembly neglect the needs of owners of small properties. After an hour-long demonstration, they marched to the Governor's office, where they chanted slogans before breaking into small groups to visit legislators. Democrats in Albany, who control the Assembly, have traditionally pressed for tougher rent rules, while the Republican-controlled Senate has generally supported measures favored by the landlords. This year, the landlords want changes in rules governing the succession of rent-controlled or rent-stabilized apartments when the tenant named on the lease dies or moves. Widows and Orphans Only ''We came to Albany today not to cause housing shortages, but to solve them,'' said John J. Gilbert 3d, president of the association. ''New York's future depends on the strength of its housing, yet each year it becomes more difficult to operate a rental building.'' Mr. Gilbert said succession had taken on special urgency this year because of a recent ruling by the appellate division of State Supreme Court in Manhattan. The court ruled that a 45-year-old man whose mother had died could not continue to live in the rent-controlled apartment they had shared. Mr. Gilbert said his group wants protection for widows and orphans, but no one else. Aides to Senate Republicans said such a bill was likely to pass before the session ends. One Senate proposal would let members of the immediate family, including stepchildren and grandchildren, succeed to a lease. The Assembly passed a succession bill in February. If the Senate followed suit, the two versions would likely have to be reconciled. There were these other developments here today: Mitchell-Lama Housing Although tenants are to deliver their rebuttals on rent regulation next week, some tenants were busy today on another subject. They were lobbying to extend laws covering state-subsidized, moderate-income apartments under the Mitchell-Lama program, which granted owners tax and mortgage subsidies in exchange for low rents and other concessions. Mr. Cuomo proposed an extension last month, and Assemblyman Edward C. Sullivan, a Manhattan Democrat, has introduced a bill of his own. The problem is that owners who receive loans through the Mitchell-Lama program may prepay their mortgages if their building has been occupied for 20 years or more. Once the mortgage has been paid, rents are no longer regulated by the state or by New York City. Tenant groups argue that in many buildings, this would drive up rents and force out poorer residents. The Cuomo and Sullivan bills would prohibit such buyouts before a building's 35th anniversary. Both bills would provide for some increases for landlords. Scott Stringer, a leader of the Mitchell-Lama Residents Coalition, said there were some differences between the two bills, but the important thing was to pass an extension. Affirmative Action As part of an ongoing dispute over a measure to promote the participation of minority-owned businesses in contracts let by the state, the Ways and Means Committee of the Assembly today reported out a version of the measure that the Senate passed last month, but then requested back. It is rare that one house does not honor a request from the other to withdraw its bill, and the Assembly's refusal to do so indicates that relations between the two houses were damaged by recent budget disputes, some legislators said. Assembly leaders have said that while they believe the Senate version of the measure is too weak, they would prefer to see it enacted than no measure at all. The Senate appears to have passed the measure on the assumption that the Assembly would not act on it. This is not an uncommon move by either house. By reporting the bill out of committee, the Assembly is, in essence, threatening to break with political protocol and call the Senate's bluff. The dispute has held up agreement on several major spending bills, including a $3 billion bond issue and a $326 million housing program.

1040-> CBS Is Awarded '92 Winter Games
The American television rights to the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France, were awarded yesterday to CBS Sports, whose bid of $243 million exceeded the International Olympic Committee's expectation by $43 million and NBC's bid by as much as $68 million. In a one-bid auction involving only the two networks, NBC bid $175 million plus 50 percent of any advertising sales over $325 million. ABC did not participate in the bidding. Despite the vast difference in the two bids and ABC's loss of $65 million on rights fees of $309 million paid for the Calgary Games last winter, Neal Pilson, the president of CBS Sports, said he expected CBS to achieve a ''modest profitability'' on its investment, which will paid through installments over the next four years. ''If you subtract ABC's losses from what they paid, although that is not how we determined our bid, you get very close to our number,'' Pilson said at an afternoon news conference. ''We project a market growth by 1992 and that the sales climate will be somewhat better. We feel comfortable with our bid.'' To say nothing for the representatives of the I.O.C. and the Albertville organizing committee. ''A good day, a very useful day,'' said Michel Barnier, a co-president of the organizing committee. ''We had hoped for around $200 million.'' 10 Percent to U.S.O.C. Besides the organizers and the I.O.C., the chief beneficiary was the United States Olympic Committee, which, according to the I.O.C.'s television rights distribution formula, will receive 10 percent off the top, or $24.3 million. Of the remaining $218.7 million, the organizing committee will get $116.64 million for its general fund and $43.74 million for facilities, which are spread throughout the Savoie region of central France; the I.O.C. will receive $58.32 million. The award procedure was much simpler than it was in 1981, when ABC succeeded after five rounds of bidding. This time, a minimum figure of $200 million was placed in a sealed envelope, after which the two participating networks submitted their offers. The networks were told that the Games would be awarded to the higher bidder, provided the offer at least equaled the secret number. ''We figured $200 million was a sensible minimum to expect,'' said Richard Pound, a vice president of the I.O.C. and chairman of its television negotiation committee. ''We recognized that Calgary was an aberrational bid at the time and that this time, there would not be as much live, prime-time coverage.'' By comparison, ABC paid $91.5 million for the 1984 Winter Games in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia. CBS last televised the Winter Olympics in 1960. Puzzlement Over ABC Pound said that he thanked Arthur Watson, the president of NBC Sports, for his active participation, but that he was mystified over ABC's decision not to bid. ''It's incomprehensible to me why they dropped out before the bidding,'' Pound said. ''I don't know on what basis they made their decision.'' In preliminary discussions with ABC, he said, the network asked about negotiating a package deal that would include the Albertville Games and the Barcelona Summer Games later the same year. The I.O.C responded by saying it was unable to negotiate on behalf of both organizing committees. By the end of the I.O.C's discussions with ABC, it was clear to Pound that the network wanted ''some kind of edge'' in the bidding for the Albertville Games, such as a chance to match the higher offer. But in the end, the procedure was designed to give each network an equal chance. Watson, whose network paid $300 million for the rights to the Seoul Olympics later this year, said that he was disappointed to lose the bid, but that his offer still put NBC at ''a considerable risk,'' based on his analysis of the market. ''You're always disappointed when you lose,'' he said. ''We came in with what I thought was a reasonable figure, but that was as far as we wanted to reach.'' ABC officials have declined to comment since their decision not to participate in the bidding.

1042-> Tipping for Wine
To The Living Section: Your article ''Service Charges Gain as Tips Are Taxed'' [ April 13 ] made general sense. There is one area, however, that necessitates different treatment: wine by the bottle. I have no objection to a 15 percent or 18 percent gratuity on drinks or food requiring specific performance on the part of the server. Wine by the bottle is another story. Most enophiles recommend a separate tip for wine service. This recognizes that a meaningful profit already has been built into the price and that service can vary considerably, ranging from the attentive sommelier, who may decant and see to it that all people at the table are properly served, to the ''wine steward'' who plunks down your favorite and disappears for the remainer of the evening, leaving you to attend to yourself. If any reader (other than self-interested parties) can defend the proposition that the service on every bottle of wine is worth 20 percent of its price, other than by saying the waiter needs the money, I would be interested to read the rationale. Does paying a $9 gratuity on a $45 bottle of wine provide one with better service or added value than paying a more customary $4 or $5? I think not. JOSEPH F. KOLODNEY Stamford, Conn.

1044-> American Brands' Earnings Rose 15% in First Quarter
American Brands Inc., a diversified consumer products company, yesterday reported a 15 percent increase in first-quarter earnings and announced plans to sell its Andrew Jergens Company unit for an undisclosed price. The Kao Corporation of America, a unit of the Japan-based Kao Corporation, has agreed to buy the Jergens unit, which produces and markets hand and body lotions, soaps and other personal-care products. Kao manufactures soaps, detergents, hair-care products, disposable diapers and industrial chemicals. American Brands said its quarterly earnings rose to $150.4 million, or $1.40 a share, from $130.8 million, or $1.15 a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Revenues rose 31.8 percent, to $2.9 billion from $2.2 billion. The company partly attributed the rise in earnings to currency exchange rates. It also said it had bought back about 13 million of its shares, including shares acquired in the acquistion of E-II. In February, American Brands acquired E-II, a consumer products conglomerate spun off from the Beatrice Companies, in a deal valued at $2.5 billion. As a result of that acquisition, the company said, sales from its office products division more than doubled and sales in its hardware and home products business increased by 59 percent. American Brands' core businesses are tobacco, distilled spirits and financial services, in addition to its emerging businesses in office products and home and hardware products. The company's major brands include Lucky Strike and Pall Mall cigarettes, Jim Beam bourbon and Windsor Canadian whisky. It also owns the Franklin Life and Southern Life Insurance companies. American Brands had announced plans in December to divest itself of Jergens. It said yesterday that the deal with Kao was subject to approval by American and Japanese regulators. Kao said that it expected earnings for the year ended March 31 will be more than $100 million, on sales of about $4 billion. Last year, it reported earnings of $88.4 million on revenues of about $3.18 billion.

1046-> Rep. Chappell Says Lies Are Used to Tie Him to Investigation
Representative Bill Chappell Jr., the chairman of the House Defense Appropriations subcommittee, said today that press reports naming him as a target in the investigation of weapons procurement fraud were based on lies and were fueled by election-year politics. Justice Department officials identified the nine-term Florida Democrat last week as one of at least two House members whose offices were under scrutiny in connection with the Pentagon inquiry. Since then, news organizations have named several other House members said to be under investigation, citing Justice Department sources or unnamed people active in the inquiry. Mr. Chappell characterized publication of the Congressmen's names as ''an injustice to people in public office.'' In Toronto, President Reagan said today that there was no way that he or his top aides could have prevented the scandal ''because you can't be down there watching several million people every day.'' [ Page A10. ] Mr. Reagan, asked about the case at a news conference concluding the three-day economic summit conference in Toronto, was asked: ''Who's in charge and where does the buck stop? Why aren't you accountable to the public trust?'' ''We are accountable,'' the President replied. All the Congressmen whose names have arisen in news reports have responded with vigorous denials of their involvement in any wrongdoing. Today, Democratic Representatives Thomas J. Downey and Samuel S. Stratton of New York and Republican Representative Andy Ireland of Florida, who were named by CBS News on Monday as being under scrutiny, were the latest to do so. The Justice Department officials who identified Mr. Chappell as one of those under scrutiny said his name turned up in wiretapped conversations of weapons industry consultants, who are the primary focus of the investigation. ''They are absolute lies,'' Mr. Chappell said of the reports. ''In my opinion, it's just a lot of bunk. I know of no person in the U.S. Congress that is involved as a target in this investigation. All of us know this is an election year, the season when insinuations and innuendos fly rampant.'' At the Pentagon, documents released today disclosed that Melvyn R. Paisley, the former Assistant Secretary of the Navy who is said to be a central figure in the case, obtained the approval of Pentagon lawyers last year before beginning work as a consultant to military contractors when he left his Government job. The Pentagon's general counsel told Mr. Paisley that a new law restricting post-Government employment would not block his accepting the work because he left office on March 31 and the law applies only to people who left office on or after April 16. Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci today directed that Pentagon employees who are subjects of the investigation be given new assignments that will remove them from contracting and purchasing activities pending the outcome of the inquiry. Pentagon officials declined to say who or how many employees were subject to the action. Some Said to Cooperate Government officials reported today that some of the people under investigation in the case had begun to cooperate with the Justice Department, but this could not be confirmed independently. One Justice Department official said he understood that James Gaines, a Navy Department official whose office was searched last week, was among those now cooperating with the investigation. So far, officials noted, there have been no arrests in the case. People familiar with its progress since the first search warrants were served a week ago said investigators had played tapes of recorded telephone conversations to people whose voices were recorded and asked them to cooperate in the investigation. So far lawmakers have refrained from overt partisan finger-pointing in the unfolding procurement scandal. But publicity about the investigation has given new impetus to a number of Congressional proposals for procurement reform that have been quietly percolating on Capitol Hill and could become issues in this year's Presidential election campaign. For example, Senator David Pryor, an Arkansas Democrat who heads a Government affairs subcommittee that has been looking into the use of consultant services in the executive branch, declared today that the Pentagon was seriously understating its costs for private consultants. Mr. Pryor released figures compiled by the General Accounting Office, a Congressional watchdog agency, showing that the Pentagon spent at least $2.8 billion on consulting contracts last year, many times more than the $155 million the Pentagon reported. 'Where the Cheese Is' ''We are seeing only the light side of the moon,'' Senator Pryor said. ''On the dark side is where the money is, where the cheese is, and it attracts mice.'' Senator Alan J. Dixon, an Illinois Democrat who is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, renewed his call for legislation to strengthen the role of the Defense Department's Under Secretary for Acquisition, and he urged the committee to begin immediate hearings on the department's procurement practices. Mr. Dixon said his previous efforts to legislate procurement reforms ''were opposed by elements within the Department of Defense who are now subjects of the investigation into procurement abuses.'' Mr. Chappell's comments came at an unruly Capitol Hill news conference in which several dozen shouting reporters pelted him with questions about his relationships with military contractors and about sources of his campaign contributions, and they demanded to know why he might be under scrutiny. Responding calmly to all the questioners, Mr. Chappell said he considered his contacts with individuals in the weapons industry entirely proper in light of his duties on a committee that directly oversees the Pentagon's budget. ''I hope over the years our committee has developed a relationship where we can talk with all knowledgeable people,'' he said. ''We get some of our best information out of industry on how we can acquire our weapons systems more efficiently. In every instance we follow explicitly the law.'' Money for Army Noted At his news conference, Mr. Chappell conceded willingly that the committee he heads had been instrumental in adding money to Army budgets for an artillery control system produced by Litton Data Systems. The company's office in Van Nuys, Calif., was searched last week as part of the investigation. Army officials said today that the service had resisted the subcommittee's addition of funds. It is not known whether the contract is directly connected to the investigation of procurement fraud. ''Congress does a lot of things the Pentagon doesn't like,'' said Mr. Chappell, when asked about an article in The Washington Times today about the Litton contract. ''We've been trying to put that system in place for 10 years, and the Army has dragged its feet.'' As Mr. Chappell spoke, the House was preparing to vote on the $282.6 billion military appropriations bill his panel has recommended for the coming year. The bill, which was later approved by a vote of 360 to 63, contains $80.7 billion for procurement - $798 million more than requested by President Reagan and $3.5 billion less than the amount for the present fiscal year. Its detailed provisions allot money for a variety of equipment and weapons systems requested by the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps, specifying in each case how many missiles, submarines, aircraft, tanks, helicopters, ships and the like will be built. The bill will now go to the Senate, where Senator Pryor has vowed to seek an amendment that would reduce by 15 percent the amount of money the Pentagon can spend to hire consultants. Other Amendments Sought The Senator said he would seek to attach similar amendments affecting consulting contracts at other Federal departments and agencies to each of the 13 appropriations bills that will come before the Senate this year. Mr. Paisley, a few weeks before leaving the Pentagon last year, where he was in charge of Navy weapons research and acquisition, filed papers saying he was considering employment with three major contractors, including two whose relations with him are now under scrutiny in the inquiry. He worked for the McDonnell Douglas Corporation and the United Technologies Corporation. The offices of both companies have been searched for records of his dealings with them. He also worked for the BDM Corporation, which is not known to be under investigation. The papers help to establish that Mr. Paisley intended, upon leaving office, to work for military contractors, including some of the Navy's largest suppliers. But they give no indication that he was holding discussions with the contractors over prospective employment while he was in office. Instruction From Carlucci Today Mr. Carlucci issued a brief instruction to Pentagon officials reminding them to adhere to existing Pentagon standards of conduct and regulations. He specifically cited rules prohibiting the disclosure by Pentagon officials of confidential information received from contractors. The Pentagon refused to say how many employees were affected by Mr. Carlucci's order that they be reassigned or to give their names. Pentagon officials who requested anonymity said the decision affected at least five employees, whose offices were searched last week by investigators. In a statement, the Defense Department said that reassigning the individuals ''in no way reflects any judgment about the guilt or innocence of any individual.'' The statement said the step was taken to assure ''that the ongoing procurements of the department are free from question.'' At a news briefing, a Pentagon spokesman, Dan Howard, said Mr. Carlucci had been given only a general briefing on the investigation by Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d. ''I don't think he has much in the way of specifics,'' Mr. Howard said. Request for a Briefing Other Pentagon officials said that members of a task force considering changes to regulations and possible reversals of contracts because of the investigation asked for a briefing by the prosecutor handling the case, United States Attorney Henry E. Hudson, but that this was refused for the time being. In a Capitol Hill news conference, a former Pentagon official backed charges by some lawmakers that the Justice Department had known for years of fraudulent activities but had not initially investigated them. The former official, Robert L. Segal, had worked one year as the Pentagon official in charge of criminal investigations policy and was the Defense Department's liaison with the Justice Department. He said that there was ''substantive evidence that there was massive fraud'' in military contracting but that authorities were ''not prepared to handle'' a complex case involving procurement fraud. The Pentagon has said that its own investigators first uncoverd the present case, then handed it over to the Justice Department for prosecution when people not assigned to the Pentagon were implicated.

1047-> Texaco's Deal Advances
Texaco Inc.'s plan to sell Saudi Arabia a half-interest in three United States refineries and associated marketing properties can go forward without the approval of the Federal committee that reviews foreigners' purchases of American companies, a Treasury Department official said yesterday. ''It's not going to be reviewed,'' said Stephen J. Canner, director of the Treasury's Office of International Investment and the coordinator of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a multi-agency committee. The committee, which has no authority to block deals, coordinates the governmental to see if any antitrust laws or technology export laws might be violated. ''The committee didn't meet in formal session,'' Mr. Canner said. ''I talked to the people who would have an interest in this transaction, the Energy Department and the Defense Department,'' he said, adding that neither thought a review was warranted. The committee's other members are drawn from the State Department, the Council of Economic Advisers and the Office of the the United States Trade Representative. Texaco and Saudi Arabia hope to complete the deal by the end of the year.

1048-> Like a Real Candidate, Tanner Falls Flat in Hollywood
The Democratic Presidential candidate Jack Tanner came to Hollywood recently for the usual purpose - to raise money. The movie industry, which is generally apathetic this year about the real Presidential candidates, was equally unmoved by the fictional one. Almost no one showed up for the fund-raising party. Tanner, the dark horse, is a creation of Garry Trudeau, the Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist who draws ''Doonesbury.'' The liberal Democratic candidate is played by Michael Murphy in a series of half-hour programs directed by Robert Altman and presented by Home Box Office. Carrying his own suit bag, against the advice of his campaign managers, Tanner moves with the primaries from state to state, interacting with such real candidates as Bob Dole in New Hampshire. In future episodes, Tanner will be interviewed by Linda Ellerbee and share bagels and philosophy with Bruce Babbitt, the former Arizona Governor, who warns Tanner not to make the same mistakes he did in running for the Presidency. The Hollywood fund-raising episode will be broadcast on June 6, the eve of the California primary. Ignored by Hollywood Stars Although Mr. Altman says the ABC correspondents David Brinkley and Sam Donaldson have asked to interview Tanner, Hollywood didn't rush to join the fun. The only well-known actor at the Beverly Comstock Hotel, where the cocktail party was shot last week, was Rebecca De Mornay, the co-star of ''Risky Business,'' and Ms. De Mornay is engaged to a member of the cast, Richard Cox. ''I couldn't get any name actors,'' said Mr. Altman. ''Their agents wouldn't let them come. Sue Mengers was horrified.'' He was referring to the head movie agent at William Morris. '' 'All our actors are working,' she said. I said, 'On a Sunday?' '' According to Mr. Trudeau, the original idea of ''Tanner'' was ''to let the audience feel they're eavesdropping, to create a sense of authenticity by observing the process, to follow campaign culture in all its tribal rites - not to make a topical movie about 1988.'' In the Hollywood episode, as elsewhere along the campaign trail, Jack Tanner is beset by ''the small moments of humiliation that pile up during the day,'' Mr. Trudeau said. ''The Hollywood party is a party by and for the young. Jack, who has presented himself as a generational candidate and prides himself on knowing the names of the Beatles, has to be briefed about the actors and doesn't even know what movies they were in. After all, the Beatles were 20 years ago. Jack has a look of befuddlement, like he's visiting Tibet.'' 'Never Had So Much Fun' ''Jack is a decent guy who gets in over his head,'' said Mr. Murphy of his character. ''His basic decency is what I have to protect. More than with any other character I've ever played, if the audience doesn't like him, they won't watch. Tanner isn't corrupted, but he comes out of the process less naive.'' ''I've never had so much fun in my life,'' Mr. Altman, the director of ''M*A*S*H,'' said of ''Tanner.'' ''It's two-thirds scripted and one-third found art.'' The encroachment of reality in the show was originally accidental but has since been nurtured. When Tanner hands out campaign buttons to real Tennessee politicians, the buttons carry a proper union inscription because that's the first thing politicans look for. ''Everybody just accepts it when I'm at a shopping center and I say, 'Hi, I'm Jack Tanner, I'm running for President,' '' said Mr. Murphy. ''I guess they get so used to people hustling them. And one woman said, 'We see stuff for you on television we don't see for other candidates.' '' Mr. Altman said: ''CNN wanted to cover us, and I said, 'Fine, but we'll shoot you, too. We'll be in your picture. You'll be in our picture.' I think in terms of filling in the squares, like a cartoon. Like a political cartoon -and hopefully as educational - we are disclosing a process that people are generally not aware of.'' During one of the two California episodes, Jack Tanner is coached by Dorothy Sarnoff, who has taught numerous real candidates how to appear charming on television. Tanner thus gets his image polished in the land of polished images.

1051-> THE DOWNING OF FLIGHT 655; An 'Accident,' Iraq Chief Says
President Saddam Hussein of Iraq said today that the downing of an Iranian airliner by a United States warship in the Persian Gulf on Sunday was a ''regrettable accident.'' President Hussein, whose country is locked in a seven-year-old war with Iran, made the comment in a talk to youth and sports ministers from 15 Arab countries meeting in Baghdad, Iraq's capital. He said Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's leader, had reiterated Teheran's ''wicked intentions'' against the Arabs ''after the regrettable accident of the Iranian civil passenger plane.'' The plane was shot down by the cruiser Vincennes in the southern Persian Gulf, with the loss of all 290 people aboard. Last year, an Iraqi jet attacked the United States frigate Stark in the gulf with Exocet missiles, killing 37 American sailors in what both countries said was an error. President Hussein warned Iran's leaders against continuing the war, saying, ''They will reap more defeats and setbacks if they continue on the path of evil.''

1052-> Deportation Possible For Polish Defector Released From Jail
A Polish seaman who jumped ship in a bid for political asylum has been released from jail after two months, still facing possible deportation but flooded with offers of money and shelter. ''It's wonderful - finally free,'' the 27-year-old seaman, Andrzej Piotr Prajzner, said after paying bail and leaving the Snohomish County jail on Monday. Mr. Prajzner, who jumped ship in British Columbia on March 15, was arrested on charges of entering the United States illegally on March 23, when he crossed the Canadian border in Blaine and requested asylum. The Immigration and Naturalization Service said he did not have permission to be in the United States. Offers of aid, including donations to meet Mr. Prajzner's $1,500 bail, began arriving when news reports described his plight after he was jailed by a United States immigration judge. Fear of Imprisonent Mr. Prajzner had been a cook aboard a fishing vessel. If he is forced to return to Poland, he said, he will be ''imprisoned for jumping ship and applying for asylum.'' At his immigration hearing on May 13, the State Department supported his plea, saying he had a ''well-grounded fear of persecution'' if he were returned to Poland. The immigration judge, Daniel Kuhn, denied asylum and ordered Mr. Prajzner deported. He had no legal representation at the hearing and was held in jail until his story became known. Mr. Prajzner has since received offers totaling more than $3,000 to pay his $1,500 bail. Fifteen families, mostly from the Seattle area, volunteered to take him in. Others have offered him jobs, said Daniel P. Danilov, a lawyer who is now representing Mr. Prajzner. Mr. Danilov said he filed an appeal in behalf of Mr. Prajzner on Monday and was waiting for a court date. Mr. Prajzner, speaking through an interpreter, said he was a little nervous about the future but was happy about the prospect of staying in the United States and thankful for the efforts of those who had helped him.

1053-> I.B.M. Set To Close 5 Factories
The International Business Machines Corporation said yesterday that it would phase out manufacturing at five domestic factories and further reduce its headquarters staff. In the next 18 months, the headquarters staff in Westchester County is expected to be cut by several thousand employees. I.B.M. said 10,000 of its 228,000 domestic employees would be affected by the changes. Based on experience, it said it expected 3,000 to 4,000 of them to retire rather than accept transfers. The changes, which were larger than expected, are likely to cost about $600 million, which will be charged against earnings in the current quarter. The impact on I.B.M.'s quarterly earnings will be largely offset by the adoption of a new accounting standard for deferred taxes, I.B.M. said. I.B.M. shares finished the day on the New York Stock Exchange at $127, unchanged. Manufacturing Advances Cited Terry R. Lautenbach, who was appointed general manager of IBM United States in January's reorganization of the computer giant into five major operating groups, said the decision to close five factories ''does not reflect the level of demand for any of our products.'' Rather, he said, the consolidation ''was driven by advances in manufacturing technology and product design that allow us to be more efficient.'' The manufacturing changes will not eliminate all I.B.M. operations in any community, but they will reduce the number of manufacturing sites in the United States to 14 from 19. The Main Losers The main losers will be Boca Raton, Fla., home of I.B.M.'s personal computer operations, and Tucson, Ariz., where I.B.M. has manufactured disk drives for its larger computers. In Austin, Tex., and Santa Clara, Calif., manufacturing operations that are being ended will be shifted to nearby locations. In Brooklyn, a manufacturing operation will be replaced by a diagnostics and service center. I.B.M. said that its new products required fewer microchips and other components, making it easier to assemble them quickly and test them. Modern production lines are also more flexible, allowing individual plants to react more quickly to changes in demand. And today's computer-controlled manufacturing techniques, which tie together such tasks as purchasing and production, create opportunities to cut inventories and overhead. Analysts generally agreed with I.B.M.'s analysis and praised the moves announced yesterday. But some said it was not entirely accurate to portray consolidation as the result of the benefits of new technology. ''I wouldn't read anything into this about how particular products or executives are doing at the moment, but it has to be seen as the latest of a series of actions emanating from mistakes in the early 1980's,'' said Stephen Cohen, who follows I.B.M. for the Gartner Securities Corporation in Stamford, Conn. ''They overinvested then. Now their sights are lower and it is natural to reduce capacity.'' In terms of personnel, the impact will be smaller than that of the streamlining program announced in 1986 that resulted in 15,000 retirements and 21,000 job moves. Savings of Hundreds of Millions Peter Labe, who follows I.B.M. for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said, ''This will mean savings of hundreds of millions of dollars annually in years to come and is more aggressive than I expected.'' Some of the savings will come from the continuing drive to decentralize. In addition to the changes in manufacturing, several thousand jobs will be shifted to other locations from Westchester County, where I.B.M. has its corporate headquarters in Armonk and numerous other corporate facilities nearby. The plan calls for production of the Personal System/2 personal computer line to be shifted gradually from Boca Raton to Raleigh, N.C., where a highly automated plant already makes several lower-cost PS/2 models. PS/2 development and marketing operations will remain in Boca Raton. I.B.M. had invested millions of dollars in manufacturing facilities there and has frequently showed them off to visitors in its efforts to publicize its personal computers. Dispute Over Florida Tax But, according to analysts, I.B.M. has steadily cut back its commitment to the Boca Raton complex in recent years after squabbling with Florida over its unitary tax policies, which had the impact of taxing I.B.M.'s Florida operations on the basis of the company's worldwide earnings. Computer storage product manufacturing will move from Tucson to I.B.M. plants in San Jose, Calif; Charlotte, N.C., and Poughkeepsie, N.Y. Research and development operations will remain in Tucson. Telecommunications systems and manufacturing operations in Santa Clara and Austin that I.B.M. inherited when it acquired the Rolm Corporation are being consolidated with nearby I.B.M. production lines in San Jose and Austin. I.B.M. also shuffled responsibilities at two other sites. Some assembly operations will be moved from Toronto to Charlotte and Austin, while software development work will be stepped up in Toronto. And assembly operations in Brooklyn, which have employed about 350 people, will be replaced by diagnostic and servicing work that has been scattered around numerous manufacturing sites.

1054-> Ottawa Ousts 17 Soviets Amid Spying Allegations
In what is being called the most serious case of its kind in Canada in years, the Government said today that that it had expelled or barred from returning to Canada a total of 17 Soviet diplomats involved in what Prime Minister Brian Mulroney described as ''improper and unacceptable behavior.'' The affair reportedly involves allegations of industrial espionage by the Russians. Confirmation of the incident came as Mr. Mulroney met reporters at the end of an economic summit meeting at which the leaders of the seven leading industrial democracies, including the United States, gave a cautious endorsement to the changes taking place in the Soviet Union under Mikhail S. Gorbachev. A Terse Confirmation Asked about reports that the 17 Soviet diplomats had been involved in industrial and commercial espionage, Mr. Mulroney replied, ''I will confirm that indeed the Government of Canada took such action last week in regard to the improper and unacceptable behavior by representatives of the Soviet Government in Canada.'' The Prime Minister said officials acted swiftly after being briefed on the affair by the Canadian Security and Intelligence Service, the civilian agency responsible for counterespionage activity. ''Certain people were expelled,'' he said. The External Affairs Minister, Joe Clark, is scheduled to give more details on the affair when Parliament meets in Ottawa tomorrow. But officials familiar with the case said it involved two diplomats at the Soviet Embassy in Ottawa, six officials at the Soviet trade mission in Montreal and nine other Soviet personnel who were out of Canada when the case broke and will not be permitted to return. Not Tied to U.S. Base Case The official said the case was not linked to another spying incident disclosed last week, one involving a Canadian, Stephen J. Ratkai, who was charged in three offenses under the Official Secrets Act with procuring secret documents and information from a United States Navy station in Newfoundland. The station primarily tracks Soviet nuclear submarines in the Atlantic, and Mr. Ratkai, 25 years old, was accused of working over a 13-month period to pass details of the operation to the Soviet Union. In a speech to Congress in April and again today, Mr. Mulroney emphasized the need for wariness in assessing the political and economic reforms instituted by the Kremlin. Reiterating concerns about continuing growth in Soviet military strength that were expressed in a political statement issued here yesterday by the leaders of the seven industrial nations, Mr. Mulroney said at a news conference, ''I am under no illusons about the Soviet Union.''

1055-> THE MEDIA BUSINESS: TELEVISION; NBC Tries a Quieter Way Of Breaking Into Cable TV
ROBERT C. WRIGHT, the president of NBC, went to Washington last week and complained about what a lousy business network television has become. He observed that there may not be enough advertising money in the marketplace to support two broadcast networks, much less three or four, and lamented, ''Network advertising revenues are about as flat as sales on the Ollie North doll.'' Mr. Wright's lament has been a theme in the 20 months since he was selected from the General Electric Company's executive ranks to run G.E.'s glamorous new property. He became the first head of a network whose principal mission was not only to run the network but to move it into new businesses, on the premise that network broadcasting has seen its best days. Last week, even as Mr. Wright was sounding gloomy about NBC's old business, NBC lawyers were putting the finishing touches on the first piece of NBC's new age - the $21 million acquisition of Tempo Television, a cable network. The moment could have been framed and stored away for history, a picture of the American television business in transformation. When NBC announced the $21 million deal last month, it seemed on the surface an unspectacular move. Why was NBC, the colossus that reaches 89 million households, bothering with a relatively obscure Tulsa-based cable network that reaches fewer than 8 million households? It was not for Tempo's programming (a mix of light features) or for its name; NBC means to scrap both, turning Tempo into a financial news and sports network. But the Tempo deal demonstrates a hard-earned savvy on the part of NBC after two failed efforts to break into cable, analysts said. Two and a half years ago NBC tried to crash into cable with an all-news network, intended to compete with Ted Turner's Cable News Network. But cable operators, loyal to Turner, did not exactly throw out the welcome mat. After concluding that the all-news network would not be carried on enough cable systems to attract enough advertisers, NBC dropped the idea. Then, last year, NBC went after Turner, trying to buy a controlling piece of CNN. NBC wanted editorial control, Turner declined to yield and the deal fell through. Both attempts were big-plunge efforts. The Tempo deal is the opposite of that; it represents NBC's new understanding that the future of television is fragmentation, and that the key is to begin to control some of the fragments, however small. When NBC buys Tempo Television - and there were some last-minute glitches last week, although the deal figures to go through - it will be buying not so much a network as a relationship with cable operators. Telecommunications Inc., the Denver-based cable giant, is helping to engineer the NBC entry into cable, in exchange for the right to buy into a partnership with NBC, by vowing to carry NBC's sports and finance channel on all of its systems, representing eight million subscribers, or 20 percent of the cable universe. NBC will offer to sell equity partnerships to cable operators that carry the new NBC sports services. Cable promises unlimited variety, but its marketplace is crowded, and the most difficult challenge for a newcomer - even one with the resources of NBC - is to find space on the cable systems' channel boxes. ''If you don't get cable operators to carry your stuff, you don't have a business,'' said Sharon Armbrust, a cable industry analyst for Paul Kagan Associates. The NBC executive directly in charge of leading NBC into the new worlds of television is Thomas S. Rogers, vice president of policy planning and business development, and there is irony there. So far, Mr. Rogers's focus has been almost exclusively on cable programming, because Government restrictions limit the broadcast networks' expansion into almost any other field. ''We can't buy cable delivery systems, we can't start a second over-the-air network where we could spread costs and resources, we can't syndicate shows and we're limited to what we can produce in-house,'' Mr. Rogers said, sounding the company line in opposition to Federal regulations. ''We can't have joint venture financial interest in programming, and we're limited as to the number of stations we own. Cable programming is one of the very few areas where we can grow.'' The irony is that not long ago Mr. Rogers was in the business of maintaining the Federal restrictions on the networks. He was senior counsel to Representative Timothy E. Wirth, the Colorado Democrat who as chairman of the House telecommunications subcommittee was a leading proponent of keeping the rules limiting network expansion. Now Mr. Rogers speaks of the need to educate people in Washington about the ''economic erosion the networks are facing'' until there is a ''realization of the need to undo the regulations that are harnessing us.'' In the meantime, NBC has made a small but significant first step into the new world. The new NBC cable network will use the resources of NBC News and NBC Sports for its programming, thus reducing the cost of both its broadcasting and its new cable businesses. The hope is that NBC's $300 million news operation will seem less bloated if it is servicing a second revenue source. And Mr. Rogers, the new convert, will continue to look for fragments for the NBC empire. ''This is not,'' he promised, ''the end-all and be-all of NBC's business base expansion.''

1058-> Metropolitan Diary
DEAR Diary: I've lived on the Upper West Side for 12 years but it wasn't until the other day that I took the subway at 72d Street and Central Park West. It required journeying two levels below ground. When I got to the platform, I saw a solitary woman staring intently at something on the tracks. I walked over to see what she was looking at. ''See!'' she commanded. ''There's a hurt puppy on the tracks.'' I looked down t see a furry, hairy, matted gray thing. ''I really don't think it's a puppy,'' I told the woman. ''And even if it is, it's got to be dead.'' ''It's a puppy,'' she maintained, ''and we've got to do something fast!'' She turned in the direction the train would be coming from. None could be heard approaching, but a man on the platform was heading our way. ''Look!'' the woman said to him. ''What do you think that is down there on the tracks? I say it's a puppy and it's badly hurt. What are we going to do about it?'' The newcomer peered down. ''I don't think it's a puppy,'' he said. ''Could be a cat. Maybe a big, hairy rat. Whatever it is, I don't think it's alive.'' ''It is,'' the woman insisted. ''Look, you can see it breathe.'' I detected no signs of life at all. Several more people appeared, waiting for the train. The woman asked if anyone would jump down to rescue what she was certain was an injured puppy. No one volunteered, but there was a great debate as to whether it was a puppy, a cat or a rat, or if it was alive at all. The woman was becoming agitated. ''In the time we've been arguing one of you could have jumped down, picked it up and taken it to the vet,'' she cried. ''We just can't let it stay there and die.'' Just then an imposing man of commanding mien arrived. ''Pardon me, sir,'' I said, ''but what do you think that is?'' He looked in the direction I was pointing. His answer was matter-of-fact and amused: ''What? You mean that wig?'' By now a train was approaching and we all took one last look at the thing on the tracks before boarding the train in an explosion of laughter - all except the woman, who appeared mortified at having repeatedly declared that she saw a puppy. Her embarrassment, though, was probably nothing to that of the person whose wig had blown off in a swift gust of subway air. But that's obviously another story. CHRISTINE LAVIN When Louise R. Roberts of Mount Vernon, N.Y., attended the recent graduation ceremonies at Swarthmore College, she saw this sign displayed at the Howard Johnson Motel in Chester, Pa.: CONGRATULATIONS! SWARTHMORE GRADS ALL YOU CAN EAT 7:30 BRKFST BUFFET $4.99 HELP WANTED! Dear Diary: It was one of those mall medicine-jar lamps, and I found it in the rented house when we moved in. Its shade was shabby, and though the light it gave off was nondescript it helped me to thread a needle when the occasion demanded. When I learned that the Off Broadway theater where I was working needed a small bedroom light for a particular late-night husband-and-wife scene, I offered to lend mine, indicating that the crew could keep it if they chose. When the play opened and I saw my lamp quite visible in the last act - it was switched on by the woman, who confronted her husband in the next bed - I experienced a small thrill. I saw the play four times in its 16-week run. After the closing, the stage manager called me to reclaim the lamp. By now I sensed my prop had gained in stature, so I took it home. I discovered that the shade had been lightly sprayed with glitter, which, stage presence aside, had given it glamour. I sit near it during the evening, frequently writing letters by hand, which seems a most appropriate thing to do alongside an Off Broadway lamp. DORIS B. GOLD ANNIVERSARY After the downpour, clusters of purple buds stretch in the sun. A forecast of fragrance, gentle at first, breathes and we break into blossom. Lilacs arrange themselves over our lives. This is how we began trc01with heart-shaped leaves. CYNTHIA SOBSEY The scene: a men's room in the Federal Building, downtown Manhattan. The cast of three: Ben Ruggiero; another fellow taking a smoke break, and an acquaintance who dashes in, out of breath and agitated. ''You won't believe this,'' the breathless man begins. ''I was almost killed on the way to work this morning.'' He pants and goes on: ''I had just walked out of the deli where I buy an egg sandwich every morning. A police car with its sirens and lights on was chasing another car down the street. The police car rammed the other car and stopped it. The guys in both cars tumbled out. There was shouting, ordering, threats. Guns were drawn. For crying out loud, shots were fired! I was right in the line of fire. I could hear the bullets whiz right over my head. Garbage pails were knocked over, glass shattered, cars and trucks mounted the sidewalk to get to safety. I tell you I'm lucky to be alive!'' Obviously concerned, the quiet smoker finally speaks. ''You eat an egg sandwich every morning?'' he asks.

Recent fans of the ad game and old participants as well will find interesting reading in ''Emperors of Adland,'' a new book by Nancy Millman, advertising columnist for The Chicago Sun-Times. It is a readable guide to, and background study of, the merger mania that has infected the industry worldwide. Ms. Millman tells her story by focusing on the leading players in the game but not forgetting Marion Harper, who pioneered it all with the establishment of the Interpublic Group of Companies in the early 1960's.

1062-> Review/Television; Challenge to Perspectives In a Postwar Romance
The grab bag of international television that is Channel 13's ''Channel Crossings'' series is entertaining and - deep breath before the word that some programmers view as a death sentence - educational. The viewer sees a kaleidoscope of fun, drama, problems, art and how-we-live presentations in terms that may differ from those we know. It's not a matter of thinking while looking (in summer, that's beyond the call of duty on television), but those who take the trouble to ponder may find their own perspectives on things being challenged. The first of two offerings in a program tonight at 10 o'clock is a case in point. ''To the Camp and Back'' is a Granada Television production from England. It is a play that can be touching at times, and the fact that it is not more so may be attributed by an American observer to the laconic tradition in Britain. Christine (Phoebe Nicholls) is a student at Oxford in 1947, and she is still mourning the death of her fiance, who was shot down by the Luftwaffe in the war. Her cousin Michael (Gary Waldhorn) is a teacher, a pacifist and one of those thoughtful types so often sent from central casting to portray the intellectual and man of word and logic rather than of action and quick emotion. Although the war is over, German prisoners are still being held at a nearby camp, with limited liberty to venture out and to work on farms. Michael is invited to lecture to them on Shakespeare in his bad German, and among the few who show up is Thomas (Jan Niklas), an earnest Luftwaffe pilot. Michael tries to make a point about humanity by having bitter Christine meet eager Thomas, and there is a brief liaison, but one born of loneliness more than of understanding. While looking on, one may resent the tenderness both English people feel for the pilot, who says that he swore an oath to Hitler, although he is now furious at having been deceived by his Government. It is a very apologetic business and will annoy those who feel that sometimes it's too late to say, ''I'm sorry.'' Written by Stephen Wakelan and directed by John Glenister, ''To the Camp and Back'' is based on a short story by Francis King. It is short-story-telling in the classic tradition, a taut tale and an ending with a twist. The tape, although made in the mid-1980's, is in a gritty black and white that reflects the drabness of that wet English countryside. It is a far from perfect show, what with its propensity for long silent stretches that may have significance for British telly but approach a nullity on American television. Even with its drawbacks, ''To the Camp and Back'' gives us something to chew on, a meaty kernel buried deep in a trifle. If you want a bite of something else, the English show is followed by a Tanzanian drama, ''Mama Tumaini,'' about the friendship of two women, one poor, the other the wife of a racist expatriate. It's a big world, but ''Channel Crossings'' helps pull it together.

1064-> COMPANY NEWS; Northrop to Drop 700 MX Workers
The Northrop Corporation said it will dismiss about 700 employees working on the MX missile-guidance system in Hawthorne, Calif., by year-end as the company's engineering requirements decline. The move represents 18 percent of the 3,800-member division work force and will primarily affect engineers and support staff. Northrop makes the inertial measurement unit, the primary component that guides the MX. Because of production delays, the Air Force is withholding $86 million in payments to Northrop and has found a second source to make the units, although the company expects to be back on schedule by fall. Northrop has delivered 79 units, making it nine behind schedule, a spokesman for the Air Force said.

1066-> Far-Flung Gobs of American Military Gravy
To the Editor: ''To Mop Up Military Gravy'' (editorial, April 29) points to a number of domestic military installations that are no longer necessary for our defense. Unfortunately, this network of ineffectual U.S. military installations extends around the globe. Camp John Hay, in the Philippine mountain resort of Baguio City (where I have lived for several months), surely stands out as one of the most egregious cases of military waste abroad. Encompassing more than 600 acres, this Air Force facility is ostensibly operated as a rest and recreation center for American forces at Clark Air Base and Subic Naval Base. In fact, it would appear that the ''base,'' which is open to the public, serves primarily as a means to placate important segments of the Manila-based Filipino elite, many of whom have weekend vacation homes in Baguio. In exchange for their acquiescence to bargain-basement prices for retention of the two large bases, these influential businessmen and government officials are given open access to Hay, a first-rate recreation facility that rivals our national parks in beauty and upkeep. Among the attractions available to - and regularly utilized by - these select Manila residents at Camp John Hay are a nine-hole golf course, bowling lanes, tennis courts and a movie theater. To satisfy their palates, the visitors can choose to eat in one of the club houses, snack shops or restaurants, all of which offer food and drinks imported from the United States. One rarely sees an active member of the American Armed Forces using these facilities, which, even at subsidized U.S. dollar prices, are certainly out of reach for the vast majority of hard-working Filipinos. Perhaps the only significant benefit from Camp John Hay for the local population are the salaries received by approximately 500 base workers. While this arrangement may be part of an unstated, seemingly successful strategy for keeping remuneration for the bases to a minimum, it does not serve the long-term interests of the United States. Indeed, as popular perception grows in the Philippines that the United States is unwilling to pay a fair price for use of the bases, Filipino nationalism will not be assuaged by public relations measures that benefit only a privileged few, like Camp John Hay. One need only look at the present situation in Honduras to understand the consequences of an overbearing presence that offends delicate national sensibilities. The bases, as well as several smaller support facilities, are said by many military officials to be essential for Pacific and Middle East operations. If the United States wishes to avoid adding the Philippines to our list of former friends, we must redress the present inequities during the upcoming base renegotiations. By closing bases that are extraneous to our defense needs and fairly supporting those that are vital, we can strengthen our position, as well as that of our allies. GERARD A. FININ Ithaca, N.Y., May 1, 1988 The writer is a Ph.D. candidate in international relations at Cornell University.

1067-> EDUCATION; Students Turning to Nonprofit Companies for Tuition Loans
Margaret E. Hankard, a 23-year-old student at the University of Massachusetts, learned last year that scholarship and marriage are not always a happy union, at least as far as the Federal Government is concerned. Mrs. Hankard suddenly found that her marriage to a correction officer with a modest income made her ineligible for the Government grants that financed her previous four years of college. ''In my fifth year we found out rather late in the process that my husband and I had made too much money,'' she said. ''The Federal Government figured we could contribute upwards of $14,000 to my education, even though our combined income before taxes was $27,000.'' Mrs. Hankard's banker referred her to the Education Resources Institute. Students in the Middle The Boston-based company, known locally as TERI, is one of a growing number of private, nonprofit corporations trying to help students like Mrs. Hankard. These students cannot afford college tuition and expenses and may lack the assets to get commercial loans but have too much income to qualify for the increasingly narrow restrictions of Federal loan and grant programs. These concerns lend money supplied by commercial banks at interest rates that are higher than available for commercial loans but are on terms that are favorable to college students. Borrowers need not put up collateral, have up to 20 years to repay and are excused from paying on the principal while still in school. With college costs rising, loans have become a regular feature of higher education, More than 43 percent of the students from four-year colleges graduate in debt, according to the American Council on Education. The College Board estimates the average size of the debt at $6,700 for graduates of public institutions and $9,100 for graduates of private colleges and universities. The surprise, though, is the number of middle- and upper-middle-income people who now find colleges unaffordable and are turning to such companies as TERI. Average Income Is $52,000 Ernest T. Freeman, president of the institute, said the average annual income of applicants for TERI loans was $52,000. He also said his company lent $32 million last year, its second full year of operation, and expects to nearly double that amount this year. Other companies with similar loan programs are the Concern Loan Program of Washington, the Education Credit Corporation of Texas and the Student Loan Marketing Corporation, which was formed by an act of Congress. Tuition and fees exceed $12,000 a year at many private institutions served by TERI, and $2,000 a year at public colleges and universities. At the same time, Federal programs offering tuition loans at 8 percent generally exclude families with incomes exceeding $30,000 if one dependent is in school. Restrictions and Expenses With such restrictions and expenses, many of the most frugal families do not have the resources to save for their children's education. ''I have a young M.B.A. working for me with two children,'' Mr. Freeman said. ''He recognizes the need to save, but he also has to pay the bills and feed his children.'' Nearly 80 percent of the institutes's loans, which averaged $7,635 a year as of February, are to students attending four-year private schools. More than 1,500 schools either refer students to the TERI or have enrolled students whose education is being financed by the institure. The Education Resources Institute and the other companies fill a need that many banks cannot. They do not require collateral, just a good family credit history and enough income to support the loan. The institute's interest rates float at two percentage points above the prime rate, which is generally higher than a commercial loan backed by collateral - home equity, for example. Only Seven Have Defaulted But borrowers have 20 years to repay the loans instead of the 10 normally available at banks, and payment on the principal can be deferred while the student is in school. Mr. Freeman said only seven families have defaulted on loans - about one-half of 1 percent of his borrowers. The participating schools help reduce the risk by calculating the amount each student needs. Their participation helps prevent loans for frivolous expenses. While TERI has found a niche in the educational marketplace and has received much applause, Mr. Freeman said he worries that it could become a victim of its own success if it is seen as an argument for further cutbacks by the Federal Government. ''A fear I have is that our programs will become so successful that the Federal Government will look at us as an alternative to their programs,'' he said. ''It can't work. We could not afford the risk.''

1068-> Review/Music; Experimental Tempos and Phrasing in Beethoven
David Zinman's Beethoven concerts with the Baltimore Symphony at Carnegie Hall this week were heralded with the promise that the conductor's experimentation with tempos and phrasing would yield fresh, exciting and perhaps provocative interpretations. Such claims are not all that rare in these times of powerhouse marketing. But in his Tuesday evening concert, which included the Fifth and Sixth Symphonies, Mr. Zinman delivered on his promise of interpretive novelty, and he did so in a way that focused on the music's details without losing sight of its broader sweep. He also challenged some longstanding notions about how the music should be played and, consequently, what it really says. There were times when his innovations seemed more fussy than insightful, and not all his solutions were equally convincing. But they raised points worth arguing about, which is something few Beethoven performances do these days. Overall, Mr. Zinman's approach is a compromise in which he has adopted aspects of the performance style pioneered by early-instrument groups while retaining both the instrumentation and deployment of the modern orchestra. Thus, he led a large ensemble, with violins massed to the left rather than divided. But through careful and constant manipulation of balances, Mr. Zinman elicited a sound that combined the transparency of a chamber orchestra with the heft and warmth of a full-size one. Add to that an insistence on Beethoven's brisk tempo markings (the Fifth, with every repeat, lasted 34 minutes and the Sixth 2 minutes longer), and phrasing that frequently focuses on textural details that are typically buried and you have an idea of what Mr. Zinman offered. In the Sixth, the ''Pastorale,'' this made for an account in which the traveler is swept quickly into a cheerful dance, rather than being left time for idle ruminations on being in the country. At the start of the ''Scene by the Brook,'' Mr. Zinman's accenting of the usually innocuous underlying triplets helped to suggest the burbling of a stream; and he had his flutist add embellishment to the nightingale call (later giving the oboist in the first movement of the Fifth a similar opportunity). By highlighting not only the bass and percussion but also the chromatic string lines in the fourth movement, he painted a remarkably vivid thunderstorm scene. But in the closing ''Shepherd's Song,'' instead of offering a moment of serenity and afterglow, Mr. Zinman returned to the sunny zestiness of the opening movement, suggesting (debatably, but not indefensibly) a cyclical rather than a straightforwardly narrative structure. If Mr. Zinman's reading of the Fifth was less striking, it was because he had already revealed so many of his tricks in the Sixth that there were few surprises left. As in the Sixth, inner voices emerged and subsided, not unnaturally, tempo relationships within movements were pointed up, dynamic contrasts were broad and textures were often luminous (especially in the blazing finale), and the speed of the performance allowed the orchestra more than a few virtuosic turns. The orchestra, which Mr. Zinman has directed since 1985, boasts a rich, warm string sound, crisp wind playing that is full of character, and a brass section that lost some of its unity in the Fifth but played with admirable solidity most of the evening.

1069-> THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Spanish-Language TV Grows Up
Helped by the deep pockets of new corporate owners and growing interest from advertisers, Spanish-language television in the United States is shedding its status as the stepchild of the broadcasting industry and maturing into a more professional and competitive business. Once a ragtag collection of UHF outlets, the industry is now dominated by two companies that are not Hispanic-owned but that see Spanish-language television as one of the fastest-growing segments of the industry. The companies, each of which owns a group of stations as well as a network, are Hallmark Cards Inc., the greeting card company, and the Reliance Capital Corporation, the investment concern controlled by Saul P. Steinberg, the New York financier. Competition Speeds Change While Spanish-language television has been evolving for some time, the changes have accelerated in the last two years as Hallmark and Reliance entered the business and started competing for viewers and advertisers. Hallmark has acquired a group of the industry's 10 strongest stations, including WXTV in New York, KMEX-TV in Los Angeles and WLTV in Miami, and a programming network now called Univision. Reliance has acquired or started five stations, including WNJU-TV in the New York City area, KVEA-TV in Los Angeles and WSCV-TV in Miami, and has started a rival network called the Telemundo Group. Univision has more than 450 affiliates, many of them low-power outlets with small audiences. Including the 5 stations it owns, Telemundo has 18 affiliates. Hispanic broadcasters have changed significantly in recent years. They were once distinguished by programming that consisted almost exclusively of imported melodramatic serials called ''novelas'' and were supported by advertising for local stores and ethnic food products. Today Hispanic broadcasters produce their own entertainment and game shows, broadcast commercials for Pepsi-Cola, Ford and Bartles & Jaymes wine coolers, and this year will send teams of news correspondents to cover the national political conventions. Some Victories At the strongest stations, Spanish-language television has become a force to be reckoned with. KMEX-TV in Los Angeles, for example, despite broadcasting on UHF Channel 31, regularly beats out some English-language VHF stations in attracting viewers. In May, KMEX-TV's weekday prime-time ratings were higher than those of KHJ-TV, Channel 9, an independent station, according to the Arbitron Ratings Company. The domination of the industry by the two non-Hispanic corporations worries some Hispanic leaders, who wonder whether the companies can be responsive to the needs and tastes of the diverse Spanish-speaking communities in the United States. But the entry of Hallmark and Reliance also amounts to a recognition by corporate America of the fast-growing Hispanic population's economic power as well as the growth potential of Spanish-language broadcasting and advertising. The growth has been solid, if not spectacular, in recent years. Total advertising revenues for Spanish-language stations and networks last year came to $223 million, according to Hispanic Business magazine, up 21 percent from 1986 and almost double the $118 million in 1984. Revenues Jump Advertising revenues this year are expected to be about $275 million, up more than 20 percent from last year. By contrast, advertising revenue for English-language networks and stations increased 4.1 percent last year, according to the Television Bureau of Advertising in New York. Many of the nation's best-known consumer companies, including the Procter & Gamble Company and the Coca-Cola Company, already show commercials in Spanish, and more companies are joining them. E.&J. Gallo's Bartles & Jaymes wine coolers are now being advertised on Hispanic stations, complete with the Frank Bartles character trying out his ''Espanol.'' But despite the industry's rapid growth, executives of Hallmark and Telemundo point out that total Spanish-language television advertising revenues last year were still less than 1 percent of the $23 billion for all television advertising. ''The major job for both us and Telemundo is to convert the advertising community to the Hispanic market,'' said Irvine O. Hockaday, Hallmark's chief executive. Continued Growth Expected The two companies and many analysts are convinced that strong growth will continue until Hispanic advertising revenues fall more in line with the size of the Hispanic population in the United States, which is estimated to be at least 20 million, or almost 8 percent of the total population. Because millions of Spanish-speaking people have entered this country illegally, there are no precise population figures. But the Strategy Research Corporation, a market research concern, estimated that the Hispanic population grew by 29.4 percent between 1980 and 1987, compared with an increase of 10.4 percent for the overall population. ''The potential for profit growth in this sector exceeds that for general broadcasting because the market is so underdeveloped,'' said Alan J. Gottesman, an analyst at L.F. Rothschild & Company. Although Hallmark's operations have a much larger share of the audience, executives at both Hallmark and Reliance say the most significant trend is that overall Spanish-language viewing is up. ''There are a lot more viewers watching Spanish-language television than before,'' said Henry Silverman, president of Reliance's Telemundo Group. ''If you give people a choice of more programs to watch, they'll watch more TV.'' More Shows Made in U.S. Viewers are also beginning to see less of the industry's traditional imported programming and more fare made in the United States. In September, Telemundo will introduce the first novela produced in the United States. Like its counterparts made in Mexico and South America, it will primarily be a love story, Mr. Silverman said. But he added, ''It will have sub-plots topical to the United States experience of Hispanics, like the difficulty of getting green cards, and street gangs.'' It will also have segments shot on location in San Antonio, Los Angeles, Miami and New York. That should help the program, as yet untitled, appeal to Mexican-Americans in California and Texas as well as Puerto Ricans in New York and Cubans in Florida - groups whose cultural and economic differences are often greater than the common language that binds them. Univision is also producing more shows in this country, as are its stations. One of the industry's highest-rated shows is ''Sabado Gigante,'' a splashy cross between ''The Gong Show'' and ''The Tonight Show'' that is produced by Univision's Miami station.

1071-> Patents; Thwarting Counterfeit Dollar Bills
Crane & Company of Dalton, Mass., a family-held concern now 187 years old, is best known for making expensive stationery. It also says it is the nation's largest supplier of wedding invitations. What is generally not known, however, is that Crane is also the sole producer of the paper used to make United States currency. To that end, the company has long looked for ways to thwart counterfeiting. This week, Crane won patent approval for a method of hiding a message inside currency paper that can only be seen when light is passed through the bill. Today's dollar bills incorporate randomly dispersd woven color fibers, but the Treasury Department worries that forgers can fool cashiers by drawing lines under the surface of fake notes. Crane's invention is a plastic strip, carrying a phrase like ''Federal Reserve Note,'' which is imbedded into the paper itself. The phrase would be invisible under normal light and could not be imitated on the bill's surface. When placed in front of a light, however, it would immediately appear. If adopted, the new method would force counterfeiters to develop their own highly complex paper-making process (also covered by the patent), as well as copy a bill's outside design. Crane officials refused to comment on when or even whether the Government plans to use its invention. Timothy T. Crane, a Crane researcher and a seventh-generation descendant of the company's founders, received patent 4,761,205.

1074-> Nicaragua Officials Allow Radio Station To Return to the Air
Nicaragua's Roman Catholic radio station, which was ordered shut last month, has been given permission to reopen, an Interior Ministry spokeswoman said today. ''They are being told that they can go back on the air with the sole condition that they respect the law,'' said the spokeswoman, Capt. Nelba Cecilia Blandon. ''They are as free as they were before.'' The station was closed for what was called an indefinite time on July 11, after it carried what the Government said were distorted reports of an anti-Sandinista protest rally the previous day in the town of Nandaime. Opposition groups had asked the Government to allow the station to reopen. They were joined this week by the Roman Catholic Primate, Miguel Cardinal Obando y Bravo. No Action on Prisoners There have also been growing demands that the Government release 38 prisoners arrested during and after the Nandaime protest. Among them are five prominent opposition leaders. Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, arrived in Managua, the capital, today. Because he has negotiated the release of prisoners here before, lawyers for the Nandaime defendants had expressed hope that he would persuade President Daniel Ortega Saavedra to free the 38. Mr. Dodd, however, left Managua late in the day without announcing any progress on the prisoners. During a morning meeting with Ramiro Gurdian, an opposition leader, Mr. Dodd pledged to bring up the prisoners' case with President Ortega. But Mr. Ortega apparently rejected the possibility of freeing them. ''What we are doing is applying the laws,'' Mr. Ortega said after his two-hour meeting with Mr. Dodd. ''There is a constitutional framework in Nicaragua, and this has to be respected.'' 'Got to Be Optimistic' Before leaving Managua, Mr. Dodd said he remained optimistic that talks between the Government and contra leaders, which ended in acrimony June 9, might be resumed. ''I still think you've got to be optimistic,'' Mr. Dodd told reporters. A cease-fire between contra and Government forces has been in effect since March as they attempt to negotiate a permanent settlement, but there have been sporadic violations. The official newspaper, Barricada, reported today that contra forces attacked a settlement on Tuesday in the northern province of Jinotega, killing three children and one Sandinista defender.

1076-> Our Towns; Hikers' Census Counts Noses, Beaks and Bills
Jon Livingston, a camp maintenance director, sent word of a green-backed heron and a black-crowned night heron he saw near a remote earthen dam in Harriman State Park. ''I've never seen them here before,'' he said. Ed Harding, bulldozer operator at the park landfill, also had an odd sighting - an albino woodchuck. And Bev Brooks, a park ranger, saw a red fox near Turkey Hill Lake. ''It was the nicest, prettiest reddish-orange color, with a white tip on its tail,'' she recalled. Besides handling their regular work at Harriman State Park and adjacent Bear Mountain State Park, all three, plus about 50 co-workers, are now wildlife spotters, helping compile the most detailed survey of birds and animals in the 79-year history of the parks. Jack Focht, assistant director of the Trailside Museum and mastermind of the study, calls them the parks' eyes and ears. Park police and rangers, handymen and sign painters, camp directors and carpenters, engineers and water treatment specialists make up Mr. Focht's legion. They're watching and listening on remote woodland trails and park highways, in rugged ravines and soft meadows, near high mountain lakes and lowland marshes on the Hudson River. By their accounts, these well-trekked parks 60 miles upriver from Manhattan are brimming with wildlife, to everybody's surprise and delight. Turkey and deer abound. Black bears have come back, and coyotes, grey fox, and eagles, too. They've spotted ravens, twice the size of their cousin the crow, and summer tanagers and bobwhites and bobcats. ''This exercise has given the workers a new pride in the park,'' Mr. Focht said. ''It's something we've always noted,'' said Chuck Meyer, manager at Lake Tiorati. ''Now we can funnel the information to somebody. It's telling the naturalists a great deal about the ecology of the parks.'' Mr. Focht started the survey a year ago after finding a 1938 directive for a similar study. But it had no record of sightings. He also found a 1965 list of park species. But it had no dates or locations of sightings. Enlisting the spotters began slowly last summer. The first list of sightings had only 21 entries. But word of the project spread and more and more workers joined. Mr. Focht's latest list, for last January and February, contains 44 species, including mute swan and whistling swan, turkey vultures and kestrels, red-tailed hawks and ring-necked pheasant, four types of woodpeckers, beavers and long-tailed weasels. The typewritten entry for bald eagle sightings is three inches thick. ''We figure we have six or seven eagles here now,'' Mr. Focht said. Mr. Focht's file for post-winter sightings is bulging. Some notes are tidy, on fancy stationery. Others are scrawls on torn envelopes and wrinkled slips of paper big and small. Violence is in this record, both nature's -seven coyotes killing a doe on ice-covered Lake Stahahe, and man's - three goslings mangled by cars. And there is giddiness in the wild -two river otters sliding down a muddy slope at Upper Cohasset Lake. Chuck Meyer watched them one September morning. ''They were having a ball,'' he recalled. ''Running up the hill and sliding down, running up and sliding down. They did it repeatedly.'' The wildlife-watching knows no holiday. Last Christmas, Andy Smith, a ranger, saw four tom turkeys and spotted old logs torn up by bears digging for food. On New Year's, Carl Stephens, a park policeman, came across a flock of eight turkeys. Three weeks ago, Leroy Conklin, the park welder, was in Doodletown, an abandoned housing project, cutting up junked autos. He saw six turkey hens and 45 chicks feeding in a field. Maria Roth works in the sign shop on Iona Island, which sits in the Hudson under steep bluffs. The windows look out on marshes and birds that wade and feed there. She has seen peregrine falcons and northern harriers, great blue herons, great egrets, and ospreys. Previously, Ms. Roth worked in the park's zoo and tended a caged bald eagle. ''I always wanted to see an eagle in flight, and I finally did,'' she said. ''I'm amazed we have eagles on the Hudson.'' Hikers also help. Perhaps the most prolific spotter is Al Aliotta, a 63-year-old retired state trooper. Twice a week, he hikes eight miles to and from Pine Meadow Lake to feed birds sunflower seeds and steak suet. ''The birds come from all over, all types and all kinds,'' he said. ''There's a great variety up there. I've seen coyote and turtles three and four feet across the top. And once there were three pileated woodpeckers having a territorial dispute. It was something. The best Fourth of July fireworks displays in New York don't compare.''

1077-> Pennwalt Plans to Sell Unit to Fisons
The Pennwalt Corporation said today that it would sell its pharmaceutical operations to Fisons P.L.C. of Britain for $460 million as part of a two-phase restructuring. Edwin E. Tuttle, the chairman and chief executive of Pennwalt, said the sale of the operation would include a special distribution of proceeds to shareholders. The deal, which is subject to approval by shareholders, is expected to be completed within two to three months, he said. 2d Phase of Restructuring Mr. Tuttle said the second phase of Pennwalt's restructuring would be the sale of its equipment operations. He added, ''We are confident that this will also be achieved in the near future.'' Mr. Tuttle said the board of directors would consider various alternatives on handling the proceeds from the sale. ''These alternatives could include a special dividend and/or a stock-repurchase program,'' he said. Pennwalt's stock rose $2.25 today, to $84.25, in New York Stock Exchange trading. J. S. Kerridge, the chairman and chief executive of Fisons, said the acquisition was ''an excellent fit for Fisons, reinforcing its success in the U.S. pharmaceuticals market and accelerating its growth plans.'' On Aug 11, Fisons bought an Italian pharmaceutical company, Italchimici S.p.A. Mr. Kerridge said the sales forces, 275 for Fisons and 260 for Pennwalt, would be combined and trimmed to 400. The Pennwalt operation, based in Rochester, has a total of 1,200 employees. Pennwalt had pharmaceutical sales last year of $129.3 million, mostly in the United States, representing 11 percent of the company's total 1987 sales of $1.1 billion. Pretax earnings for pharmaceuticals were set at $20 million. Pennwalt's pharmaceutical division's prescription medicines include cardiovascular, anti-depressant and anorectic products and products for coughs and colds. Name brands include Microx, Zaroxolyn, Adapin, Ionamin, Tussionex and Penntuss. It also makes over-the-counter products, including Desenex, Cruex, Sinarest, Caldecort and Allerest. The division also includes the Pharmasol Corporation, a specialized aerosol manufacturer. Fisons, which makes pharmaceuticals, scientific equipment and gardening products, reported sales of $:760.3 million, or about $1.29 billion, in 1987 and net earnings of $:81.3 million. Mr. Kerridge said the new United States pharmaceutical operation of Fisons would retain the personnel and headquarters in Rochester. Fisons currently operates out of Bedford, Mass. The Bedford operation, with 500 employees, will be moved to Rochester next year, Mr. Kerridge said.

1078-> Senate Won't Seize Site Near Manassas, Head of Panel Says
The Senate will not go along with a plan to seize land adjacent to the Manassas National Battlefield Park in northern Virginia to prevent a shopping center from being built there, the chairman of the committee involved said today. The House voted last month to take the 542-acre tract and to provide up to $30 million in compensation. Such a seizure of land is rare and leaves to a later court determination how much the owner should get. The House passed the bill by a vote of 307 to 98 on Aug. 10 The authorities in Prince William County have already approved the shopping center, which is to be accompanied by office and residential development on the tract. The controversy has galvanized environmentalists and Civil War buffs who see desecration in the location of a shopping center next to the park commemorating the First and Second Battles of Manassas in the Civil War. The battles are better known as those of First and Second Bull Run. Senator J. Bennett Johnston, the Louisiana Democrat who is chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said he intended to vote for the measure and expected to send it to the floor. But the bill violates a Senate rule against bringing ''entitlement'' legislation to the floor outside of the budget process, and the Budget Committee is unlikely to waive the rule, he said. Sixty senators could vote to set the rule aside, but Mr. Johnston said, ''I frankly don't think it'll pass a 60-vote point of order at this time in this session.'' Still, he told his colleagues in a discussion of the bill at a committee meeting, ''We are at least saying this is a high priority and this kind of land should not be lost.''

1079-> METRO DATELINES; Koch to Take Steps To Protect Horses
Reacting to an uproar over the treatment of carriage horses, Mayor Koch announced yesterday that the city would take steps to protect the animals during hot weather. The Mayor said the city would provide more watering holes in Central Park, move a horse ambulance there from Kennedy International Airport and provide more shade for the animals in hot weather. He also said he would ask the city's Health Commissioner, Dr. Stephen C. Joseph, to determine the adequacy of a city regulation requiring horses to be returned to the stable when the temperature hits 90 degrees. A public furor erupted over the treatment of horses after Whitey, a 9-year-old gelding, collapsed Sunday en route from Central Park to his stable on East 62d Street. Whitey was being taken off the street in response to the hot weather - the temperature was on its way to a high of 97. He has since recovered, but the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has barred his use for 30 days.(AP)

1080-> Is It a Criminal Offense Not to Lead the Pledge?; A Formal Rite
To the Editor: William Safire's plaint (Sept. 1) that the Pledge of Allegiance is indifferently rendered by youngsters is undoubtedly true. ''One nation invisible'' is what some kids still say. However, Mr. Safire overlooks what might be called the liturgical value of voicing the pledge together in a group in grade school. It is a small but important way of chorally honoring one's national belongingness. It is a formal rite that does no harm to anyone while fitting solidly into the Greco-Judeo-Christian tradition of paying respect, as Socrates did, to the country that rears us. Pride in one's country, after all, is not the same thing as combustible chauvinism. ALBERT L. WEEKS Nantucket, Mass., Sept. 1, 1988

1082-> Rice Industry Complaint
The United States rice industry filed an official trade complaint today with the Government over what it termed Japan's illegal, unjustifiable and unreasonable rice policy. The Rice Council for Market Development and the Rice Millers' Association, representing American rice growers and millers, filed their petition with the United States trade representative seeking access to Japan's rice market. The complaint is the first to be filed under Section 301 of the newly amended trade law, and supporters of the petition said the new trade bill should strengthen the United States case against Japan. ''The new law leaves little room to maneuver,'' said Senator Pete Wilson, a Republican from California, a major rice producing state. If the trade representative accepts the complaint, ''Japan won't be able to dodge the issue any longer,'' he said. The rice industry requested that the United States negotiate an agreement with Japan to ease Japanese import quotas to allow rice imports equal to 10 percent of the country's domestic rice needs within four years. The Administration has 45 days to decide whether or not to accept the rice industry's complaint. Current Japanese policy bans virtually all imports of rice, said Stephen Gabbert, president of the Rice Millers' Association.

1083-> Rockwell Projects Reduced Revenue
The Rockwell International Corporation said it expects sales for the 1988 fiscal year, ending Sept. 30, will decline to $11 billion or $12 billion, from $12.12 billion the previous year. Since April, when Rockwell delivered the last of its 100 B-1B aircraft ordered in 1982, the company's aircraft sales have fallen off significantly, Rockwell's chairman, Donald Beall, said at a news conference Tuesday. But the nation's fourth-largest aerospace concern said it was making substantial progress in its other divisions, offsetting the decline in sales and earnings from the B-1B. The B-1 bomber has long been the flagship of the Pittsburgh-based company. Mr. Beall said Rockwell's automative operations division were posting record sales and earnings.

1084-> Malfunction Seen as Cause of Zia Crash
Experts sent to Pakistan to investigate the plane crash that killed President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq have concluded that the crash was caused by a malfunction in the aircraft, and not by a bomb or a missile, Administration officials say. They said the disintegration of the Lockheed C-130 transport on Aug. 17 was caused by the force with which it hit the ground and not by a midair explosion. The officials, who declined to be identified because of the political senstivity of the investigation, refused to say if the malfunction could have been caused by sabotage. The lack of information about the crash and the length of the investigation have prompted speculation that the plane's mechanical system failed because of tampering. The officials said the findings of the American investigating team, made up of experts from the Air Force and Lockheed, had been forwarded to the Pakistanis, but they provided no details. Thirty people were killed in the crash, including Arnold L. Raphel, the American Ambassador to Pakistan, and Brig. Gen. Herbert M. Wassom, the American military attache there. Pakistani Elections Cited Officials at the State and Defense Departments said they would not hear anything definitive from the Pakistanis about their investigation before elections were held there Nov. 16. But they said the United States had received assurances from Pakistan that it would share its findings with Washington. There has been widespread speculation that President Zia was the victim of an assassination plot. Suspects have ranged from his domestic opponents to Afghans, Russians and Indians. Recent reports that Pakistani military officers sabotaged the plane were dismissed by both United States and Pakistani officials as idle speculation and rumor. No evidence has been presented to indicate that any country or group was responsible. Phyllis E. Oakley, deputy to the State Department spokesman, said that Pakistan was responsible for the investigation and that the United States provided only technical assistance. Mrs. Oakley said it was up to the Pakistanis to make any announcement on the investigation. The Pakistani Air Force attache in Washington, Nasar Mahmoud Butt, said that the investigation was still in progress and that no statement could be made until it was completed. American officials discounted reports that a bomb was smuggled aboard President Zia's plane or that the plane was shot down by an anti-aircraft missile. According to United States Government experts, if the plane had exploded in the air, wreckage would be widely scattered. Reports from the scene indicate the wreckage was largely in one area, although some pieces, including an engine, were said to be some distance from the fuselage, indicating that at least part of the plane came apart in the air. No Flight Recorder American officials said the investigation was hampered because the plane carried no flight recorder, commonly known as a black box. Most American C-130's do not carry flight recorders either. If a flight recorder had been aboard, experts say, it would have provided information on the status of the plane and its flight systems at the time of the crash. In the absence of the recorder, the cause of the crash must be deduced from a detailed examination of the wreckage and the pattern of the debris. The crash site was disturbed by those first at the scene and by the removal of the remains of the victims before the arrival of the American investigators. This reportedly made it difficult for the team to reconstruct what had occurred. One of the mysteries is the absence of information on radio transmissions from the stricken aircraft. Normally an airplane in distress transmits emergency radio calls if the pilot and crew remain capable. There has been no hint that President Zia's aircraft did so. The existence of such a transmission would be crucial in piecing together the puzzle of the crash. Officials decline to say whether distress signals were sent in the final moments of the flight or whether there was evidence that the crew was incapacitated.

1086-> Solidarity Also a Challenge to Walesa
Even as Lech Walesa, the Solidarity founder, prepares for a second round of talks with Government negotiators Thursday, the two waves of strikes that brought him from the barricades to the negotiating table are sending ripples of unrest through his outlawed union. This situation was reflected in this week's events. Mr. Walesa's talks with the Interior Minister, Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, originally scheduled today, were postponed 24 hours after militant workers at the Gdansk shipyards, where the Solidarity leader works, threatened a walkout if the Government balked at holding talks. The incident illustrated that while Solidarity's newfound vigor forced the Government to talk to the union for the first time in seven years, it is also proving to be a challenge to Mr. Walesa, who must keep the genie in the bottle if the talks are to progress. An adviser of Mr. Walesa, talking recently in Warsaw, described the union's internal composure bluntly: ''There are conflicts of interest, of programs, and often of personalities.'' New Faces, New Dimension He explained that this was because the strikes, by bringing forth a new crop of radical labor leaders, had added a new dimension to what until now had been essentially a three-tiered Solidarity structure. The emergence of new faces was evident today, as Solidarity officials disclosed that Wladyslaw Liwak, who rose to prominence in two waves of strikes this year at Stalowa Wola, a steel and machinery complex, would be among the union leaders accompanying Mr. Walesa to Thursday's talks. Paradoxically, too, the union leader's personal fortunes appear to be rising in direct proportion to the turmoil within the organization. No serious challenger to his rank or authority has emerged among the new leaders, and indeed, personal loyalty to Mr. Walesa and enthusiasm for the union idea appeared more vigorous than ever as Solidarity's leadership and a group of intellectuals generally regarded as its extended brain trust met openly in Gdansk last weekend. Clandestine Publishing Some of those attending, including Marcin Krol, the publisher of the independent Catholic magazine Res Publica, and the lay Catholic leader, Stanislaw Stomma, had expressed views in the past to the effect that Solidarity might be a closed chapter. The Government decision to ban Solidarity formally in November 1982, after it had been suppressed with the declaration of martial law in December 1981, drove the union underground. The keystone of that underground organization became the union's clandestine publishing operation, which continues to function largely autonomous of other union bodies to print hundreds of newspapers, magazines and other forbidden lierature. Alongside the publishers are national and regional executive commitees, personifed by union chiefs like Mr. Walesa, who made their mark in the 1980 strikes that spawned Solidarity. But their role was increasingly eclipsed in recent months by a third power group that sprouted after the national leadership decided to exploit chinks in existing laws to seek court registration of Solidarity chapters. Committees and Committees In factories and enterprises throughout Poland committees sprang up with the sole purpose of seeking registration. The committees existed legally, and when the courts predictably rejected their petitions, usually on the grounds that the ban on Solidarity had never been lifted, they formed anew to repeat the petition, thus prolonging, often indefinitely, their existence. But the strikes in April and May spawned a fourth formation, consisting of the members of factory strike committees and others engaged in organizing the work stoppages. The new union leaders are not always younger than the older leaders, nor are they uniformally newcomers to union work. With his 34 years, Jacek Merkel, who figured largely in the Gdansk shiyards strikes, is one year older than Zbigniew Bujak, a leading figure from 1980-81 and still a national leader. Andrzej Milczanowski, a leader of the dockworkers' strike in Szczecin this month, is a veteran of Solidarity from its founding years.

1087-> Is It a Criminal Offense Not to Lead the Pledge?; Patriots All
To the Editor: Once again, we are seeing candidates impugn the patriotism of those with whom they disagree. This latest fuss about the Pledge of Allegiance recalls the time in the 1970's when people in the Nixon Administration wore American flag pins in their lapels, as if to show that they were the only true patriots. I disagreed with almost everything the people in that Administration stood for and most of the methods they used to achieve their ends, but I never doubted that they believed that what they did was in the best interest of the country as they saw it. But I resented their taking the flag as their symbol, because it was and is my flag, too, as it is the flag of everyone in this country. Whether or not Gov. Michael S. Dukakis should have signed a law that he had been advised was unconstitutional is an issue of image, not substance. Let us all acknowledge that the candidates for President and Vice President are all patriots in their own way, and want the best for this country. Then we can get on with an honorable debate so that we voters can decide which of them we choose to have lead us for the next four years. BERNICE SISSON Swarthmore, Pa., Sept. 2, 1988

1088-> About New York; Selling Staplers To the Pulsation Of Doo-Wop
''Ooh-wah-ooh-wah-oo-ooh-wa-ah-ooh-wah oo-ooh-wa-ah-ooh-wah why do fo-ools fall in lo-oov. Why do birds si-ing so gay? And lovers await the break of day? Why do they fall in lo-ove?'' That's right, children, they don't write 'em like they used to. That was the classic ''Why Do Fools Fall in Love'' performed for you in Central Park this blistering noontime by Performing Artists Diversified, your doo-wop office supplier. Let's hear it for the singers! Here's Lewis Lymon, from Lewis Lymon and the Teenchords. And here's Eddy Rezzonico, from the Passions; and Tommy Gualtieri, from the Chessmen; and Herman Santiago, from Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, and our singer-songwriter Bob Barrett! Sing it, boys! ''Hmmmmmmm. If you buy your office supplies from us, we will sing for you-ou!'' No. No. Keep your money, people. We're not here begging. This is a promotional thing. Pick that dime back up, boy. You guys over there, you with the boom boxes. Yeah, you! Turn 'em down. I wanna tell you a story. Most of you are too young to remember, but there was a time in the 50's and early 60's when groups were singing doo-wop on corners all over the city. Probably the best-known doo-wop song was ''In the Still of the Night'' from the Five Satins. Tightest harmony. Sweetest tenor. Every cat sang it. Still does. Shoo-do-shooo-bee-do. Brooklyn was a hotbed of doo-wop. The Brooklyn Bridge, the Passions, the Crests and the Lovin' Spoonful were coming along. Jay and the Americans. Rock-and-roll at the Brooklyn Fox - ah, one of life's sweetest memories. Anyway, one of these guys hollering his lungs out on a corner in Brooklyn was a guy named Steve Sawyer, who went on to be in the Tokens, but after the Tokens had the hit ''The Lion Sleeps Tonight.'' Ah-weem-ah-weh, ah-weem-ah-weh, remember? Doesn't matter. Actually, Steve's name was Katz, but he changed it to Sawyer after he teamed up with Freddie Natarz, who changed his name to McFinn. They're singer-songwriters, see, and the two of them think they're gonna be the next Beatles. They move to L.A. and hook up with a guy named Charlie Green, who discovered Sonny and Cher and Buffalo Springfield. They bag a contract to write, produce and record what they think is going to be the next ''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'' and come back to New York and use half the New York Philharmonic on the record, and the thing dies a slow death. Sells maybe 1,500 copies. All of a sudden, their self-esteem goes into a spin, and they go into driving cabs. They're depressed, see - listen to your D.J., children, the story has a happy ending. So they go give the left coast another shot. They're waiting tables, driving taxis, trying to write songs, trying to get bands together, and, finally, the act splits up, the Sawyer half returning to the city, the McFinn half staying on. The former Token goes back to driving a cab, and, in 1979, at West End Avenue and 91st Street he's robbed by a man with a gun. Heavy. Now one of the things you get to feeling, from behind the wheel of a cab or behind a cafe menu, is that the citizenry is mostly wet-lipped slack-jawed barbarians. Cleaned out, Steve Sawyer abandoned the cab, threw his hack license into the gutter and got a job selling office supplies. Awesome. It made him feel totally ordinary because he saw himself as a composer, and, indeed, he continued plugging along with his songs, getting a couple recorded, though they caused no stir. He even composed some scores for porno movies in this, his period of despair. Then, about 1980, he started taking his cassettes with him on his sales route, and telling people he was a composer, and asking them to listen and if they liked his music, maybe they would be good enough to buy some office supplies. It would keep an artist from waiting tables and driving taxis, he would say, listing the two occupations he detested most. Sales soared. The city showed it had heart. Con Edison stopped shutting off his electricity for failure to pay. Success comes to the lowly songwriter! Stay with us, music lovers, there's more singing in moments. So then our hero runs into a woman named Iona Passic on a train home to Brooklyn. She was a broke film producer. Next thing you know she's in the business with him. Then they start taking on singers, actors, comedians, painters - 20 in all, so far. The hours are flexible, meaning they can still follow their art and make $600 to $700 a week, to boot. Total sales are running $100,000 a month. Steve still considers himself primarily a composer, and he wants to make a rock-and-roll movie, too, Let's hear it from the horse's mouth: ''I still consider myself the best singer-songwriter in the office-products industry today.'' A-whop-bop-a-loo-bop-a-whop-bam-boom!

1089-> San Francisco Journal; A Collision Of Grime, Glamour
At a new Nordstrom department store here, customers can order tea from the dressing room or relax with an herbal body treatment after shopping. They can buy custom-blended face powder, dine in a restaurant that serves Louis XIII cognac for $500 a bottle or be entertained by a musician playing the largest piano Steinway makes. But just outside on Market Street, glamour collides with grime. On this once grand thoroughfare a women sits cross-legged on the sidewalk singing hymns, a street preacher inveighs against premarital sex and beggars extend their cups to tourists boarding the cable car. It is this stark contrast that has made San Franciscans take particular note of their newest department store, the largest in the expanding Seattle-based chain. The Market Street store opened this month with record-breaking sales and a blizzard of front-page news articles. Nordstrom shopping bags have quickly become status symbols, and on Saturday afternoons the atrium lobby is pandemonium, with long lines of people waiting to board the spiral escalators. In the famed footwear department, which has prompted a rash of Imelda Marcos jokes, customers stand and gawk at an array of shoes, 100,000 pairs in all, that seems to stretch to the horizon. San Francisco has a wealth of fancy stores, so one must look elsewhere for an explanation for all this excitement, most breathlessly expressed by Herb Caen, whose daily column in The San Francisco Chronicle is an institution, a constant paean to the city's more glorious past. Mr. Caen has called the store a ''gorgeous gamble'' and observed that its arrival gives Market Street ''an air of the Champs Elysees.'' His young counterpart at The Examiner, Rob Morse, begged to differ, characterizing the hullabaloo as an embarrassment ''for those of us committed to the notion that San Francisco is a sophisticated city.'' Mr. Morse notes that ''people are celebrating not just the opening of a great department store, but the retaking by the middle class of the city's somewhat tatty core.'' Those on both sides of the debate agree that the store is the single most significant change in the city's landscape in many years, the culmination of 20 years of civic effort to reverse the decline of Market Street and consolidate the shabby southern portion of the city with Union Square, its vibrant retail core. City planning experts predict that Nordstrom will have profound effects on the neighborhood - driving up rents, forcing out existing merchants and making life increasingly difficult for the homeless who congregate here, a stone's throw from most of the city's shelters and single-room occupancy hotels. This prospect delights Bernard Averbuch, the executive director of the Greater Market Street Association, an organization of business people who, over the years, have dressed up the area with flower boxes and raised money for increased police protection. Now - practically overnight, Mr. Averbuch said - the neighborhood's least attractive denizens seem to be getting the idea. The homeless are moving elsewhere, and so are the stag theaters and pinball arcades. ''Nordstrom in one fell swoop has done what we have been trying to do for 20 years,'' Mr. Averbuch said. Equally pleased is Officer Lee Dahlberg, who mans a police kiosk at the cable car turnaround just across the street from Nordstrom. Officer Dahlberg helps tourists find their way to the Golden Gate Bridge or Fisherman's Wharf. He helps officials of San Francisco Centre, the vertical mall that is home to Nordstrom, chase peddlers from their doorway. And he decides which of the street people are a danger to themselves and others, which to arrest and which to leave alone. Officer Dahlberg recalls coming to this intersection on childhood shopping expeditions, all decked out in a jacket and tie. His dream, he said, is to see the ''street bums'' give way to ''nicely dressed people,'' to see ''the San Francisco I knew as a kid.'' That dream is not shared by John Crew, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, who has sued the Police Department three times in the last 10 years over ''street sweep tactics,'' and has twice won changes in procedures. Mr. Crew said he was concerned that ''these tactics will reappear,'' not because of any action from the store's owners but because of public sentiment, which could put pressure on the police. ''Giving folks the benefit of the doubt, I am sure there are people looking at this store from strictly a business standpoint,'' Mr. Crew said. ''But for others, it's 'Thank God, we can get rid of the homeless.' There is a segment of the public that looks at homeless people and searches for some crime to charge them with. I'm extremely skeptical when people say that merely because a store has opened, homeless people have picked up and moved somewhere else.''

1096-> Review/Music; Sweet Honey's Messages In a Mixture of Styles
Sweet Honey in the Rock - part community sing, part singing community - performed its annual Carnegie Hall concert on Friday evening, with songs about maternal love, third-world debt, disarmament, freedom, determination and faith in God. Like the gospel music it draws on, Sweet Honey in the Rock delivers messages with luminous, virtuosic singing, and the five women's voices blend and soar in a spectrum of styles few other ensembles could match. Using just vocals and occasional percussion - gourds, rattles, tambourine - Sweet Honey in the Rock embraces black music from Africa to the United States to the Caribbean, from tribal song to quartet-style gospel to scat singing jazz to reggae. On stage, Evelyn Harris, Ysaye Maria Barnwell, Aisha Kahlil, Nitanju Bolade and the group's leader, Bernice Johnson Reagon, wear billowing African-style dresses and headdresses; as they sit or stand in a semicircle, Shirley Childress Johnson signs the lyrics for the hearing impaired. Sweet Honey's wonderfully diverse audience - white and black, young and graying - joins in warmly, applauding political points as well as vocal display. Ms. Reagon, who was active in the civil-rights movement in the 1960's, links churchy solidarity to current issues. One witty song laid out the way that cotton from El Salvador and petrochemical polyester bounced around the hemisphere's low-paid labor forces to be turned into a blouse sold at Sears, and concluded, ''Are my hands clean?'' ''Ode to the International Debt'' insisted that money for arms deals and repressive governments is ''not a debt owed by the people.'' The group also finds trenchant nontopical messages in gospel songs that call for sharing and self-respect. Sweet Honey's arrangements revel in the ways five voices can combine. Melody and accompaniment, foreground and background change with every song. In the hymn ''Let Your Little Light Shine,'' close-harmony chords carried the words; in Leadbelly's ''Sylvie,'' a phrase would set off echoes and responses, above and below. A piece based on a passage from the Book of Isaiah turned oratory into song, with voices stacked up a new way for every line; a Georgia White blues song from the 1930's backed a throaty lead with an oompahing imitation of a jug band. ''Rivers of Babylon,'' the reggae song, was cushioned in doo-wop syllables, while in ''Emergency,'' a gospelly song demanding an end to apartheid, siren and train sounds and hand clapping pushed the music along. Ingenious and luxuriant, Sweet Honey's music suggests a utopian community where individuality sings out and cooperation is a pleasure. And it's not a closed community. For the last few songs, three Sweet Honey alumnae joined the group onstage. One of them, Tulani Jordan Kinard, took over lead vocals for a gospel song that brought the audience to its feet, singing and clapping along.

1097-> Appeals Court to Study Drexel Claim
A Federal appeals court yesterday blocked Federal Judge Milton Pollack from issuing any rulings in the Drexel Burnham Lambert securities fraud case while it evaluates charges by the investment firm that the judge has violated conflict of interest laws. In a brief order, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York said it would hear the case on an expedited basis shortly after the Government and other parties in related cases file court papers next Friday. The judges who were assigned to the case are Richard J. Cardamone, Edward J. Lumbard, and Lawrence W. Pierce. Defense lawyers have been seeking Judge Pollack's removal, charging bias against them and a conflict involving a stock sale by the judge's wife, Moselle. No Stay Requested Since the defense lawyers had not requested a stay, the court's decision to issue one suggests that it has a strong interest in the conflict charge. The ruling effectively freezes all action in both the lawsuit brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the 13 private actions, most of which are more than a year old, that have been filed by investors and shareholders against the investment firm and others. Meanwhile Drexel will try on Monday in Washington to persuade Federal authorities to halt criminal racketeering charges that are being sought by prosecutors in the United States Attorney's office in Manhattan. The Government is also considering mail and wire fraud and securities charges against Drexel. Hearing Is Canceled In Manhattan, after the appeals court ruling, Judge Pollack canceled a previously scheduled hearing for the afternoon that was to have dealt with a variety of pretrial matters. Last month, shortly after the S.E.C. filed its case against Drexel, lawyers for the investment firm and four defendants who work at Drexel sought to have the judge removed. Judge Pollack's wife is in the midst of a $30 million sale of stock in Palais Royal of Houston Inc. to a company that, Drexel lawyers have asserted, is being financed in part by Drexel's high-yield ''junk bond'' department. The Government and the plaintiffs in the private actions have supported Judge Pollack. The judge is considered by some trial lawyers to be tough on defendants in white collar cases. Lawyers in the private actions have said they believe Drexel's lawyers have filed the conflict motion because they want the case to be heard by another judge who might be more sympathetic to the defendants. The Court of Appeals rejected one petition by the defendants on the conflict question because Judge Pollack had not yet ruled on it. DREXEL PROFITS RISE WASHINGTON, Oct. 20 (Special to The New York Times) -Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s net income in the first six months was nearly as high as its total for its entire 1987 fiscal year, Securities and Exchange Commission documents show. The New York investment firm reported net income of $111 million for the six months ended June 24. For the 1987 fiscal year, which ended Dec. 25, Drexel reported income of $130 million.

1100-> Rugged Route for Pistons
During their first quarter-century representing the Motor City in pro basketball, the Detroit Pistons evoked bad jokes about flat tires, stalled engines and lemons from the assembly line. They rarely won more games than they lost. They qualified for the playoffs less than half the time and, more often than not, they lost in the first round. Draft choices were squandered, strange trades were made and coaches came and went, rarely to coach again in the National Basketball Association. Their home court moved from place to place in the metropolitan area - from the Olympia to Cobo Arena to the Silverdome. Once, they played a home playoff game at a high school gym. In the minds of Detroit sports fans, the Pistons were fourth among the city's four professional franchises. Last season, after a gradual buildup through the 1980's, the Pistons gained a new level of status both locally and nationally by winning two playoff series and taking the Boston Celtics to seven games before losing a bitter and memorable Eastern Conference final series. First Divisional Title This season, their 31st since arriving from Fort Wayne, Ind., the Pistons are a respected, if not beloved, N.B.A. power. The Pistons won a divisional title for the first time. They tied with Denver for the league's third-best record (54-28) behind Los Angeles and Boston. The Pistons' front office says the team drew more than a million spectators to its 41 regular-season home games this season. Although that figure includes discounted and free tickets as well as no-shows, the front office says the Pistons lead the league in attendance with at least 17,000 fully paid admissions per home game. The players, however, complained that the home fans weren't enthusiastic enough. For the first round of the playoffs, against Washington, the crowds were of only average size. The largest was the 18,403 for the final game on Sunday. ''I just wish our crowd would yell louder,'' said Isiah Thomas. Next season, the Pistons will move to the new $70 million Palace of Auburn Hills, a team-owned arena in a suburb north of Detroit that will seat 21,000 spectators. The Pistons hope to decorate the Palace rafters with more than just a divisional championship banner. In the first round of the playoffs, the Pistons struggled, but finally beat the Bullets in five games. They faced the Chicago Bulls -and Michael Jordan - tonight in the first game of the second round. Although it still sounds strange to those who know this franchise's history, it isn't preposterous to suggest that the Pistons are contenders for the league championship. Celtics Are Chief Threat The road to the final round may lead through Boston, where the Celtics defend the Eastern Conference title. Although they have split six games with the Celtics this season, the Pistons haven't won in Boston Garden since Dec. 19, 1982. ''As long as the Celtics are on top, the Eastern Conference will be measured by them,'' said Bill Laimbeer, Detroit's rugged center. ''You've got to hammer and hammer and hammer over the years and eventually your time will come. If you bash on that door long enough, it will fall down.'' Verbs like ''bash'' and ''hammer'' might be appropriate to describe the play of Laimbeer and his teammates. Around the league, they are considered heavies by many fans and opponents for their rugged play and cocky attitude. ''I remember when Bill played with Cleveland a few years ago, he elbowed Terry Tyler in the throat,'' said Tom Wilson, the Pistons' executive director, who announces some of their games on cable television. ''I said right then, 'That's the kind of guy who you hate on the other team but you love on your team.' Then we got him.'' Laimbeer isn't the only Piston with a mean streak. In a game at Chicago in January, Rickey Mahorn grabbed the Bulls' Jordan and dropped him onto the court. This started a brawl at the Chicago bench that ended with Mahorn grabbing the Bulls' coach, Doug Collins, around the neck and throwing him aside. Mahorn was suspended for one game and fined $1,000. ''Their definition of a foul,'' Jordan said, ''is something that can hurt me.'' Even Thomas, the 6-foot-1-inch, 185-pound guard, has been involved in the brawling. This season Thomas was fined $3,000 for battling Sidney Green of the Knicks, a former Piston. Green is 6-9 and 220. Bird Incident Recalled After the game, Green said that Thomas ''showed what kind of person he really is,'' adding, ''Don't forget what he said about Larry Bird last year.'' Green was referring to statements made after the Pistons had lost to Boston. Thomas and Dennis Rodman said Bird was overrated because he was white. Thomas apologized about the Bird comments last spring and said they were misconstrued, but his reputation has taken on a mixed quality. Thomas, who organizes an annual ''No Crime Day'' in Detroit and is a favorite advertising spokesman for local businesses, is a perennial All-Star, but critics around the league say he is an egotistical player who sometimes hurts the team by trying to do too much by himself. Rodman, a speedy, leaping forward who excels at offensive rebounding, has a lot of energy. He often angers opponents and their fans by pumping his fists and waving his arms after baskets. Laimbeer, asked to describe the Pistons' team personality in a word, quickly replied ''defiant.'' To Daly, the Pistons' persona is a ''double-edged sword.'' ''We can't sneak up on people anymore,'' he said, ''and we get a lot of ridicule and harassment from opposing fans.'' Daly has molded this feisty group into a team in which no player dominates. Adrian Dantley is the only legitimate post-up player and leads the team in scoring with a 20-point average. He draws fouls on short drives and shoots free throws often and well. Laimbeer is the leading rebounder with an average of 10.1 per game. Thomas leads in assists with an 8.2 average. No individual Piston ranks near the top of the league statistical tables. Daly uses a deep bench. Vinnie Johnson, known for hot shooting streaks, is the top reserve guard behind Thomas and Joe Dumars. Rodman and John Salley, the top draft choices of 1986, are the second-line forwards and generally speed up the tempo in relief of Dantley and Mahorn.

1105-> Sandstrom Looks Back
When the Rangers face the Philadelphia Flyers at Madison Square Garden tonight, Tomas Sandstrom will be marking an anniversary that he prefers to forget. It was exactly one year ago that one of the sport's more notorious incidents of brutality occurred. In a game against the Flyers at the Garden, Sandstrom was leveled from behind by Dave Brown, who cross-checked him across the neck. The Ranger forward crumpled to the ice, the Rangers rose in protest and the league suffered yet another public scorching. The tape of the incident was shown over and over again, on television and in the offices of league officials charged with assigning punishment. Sandstrom, however, insists he rarely replayed the incident in his mind. ''It bothered me for a day or so,'' said Sandstrom. ''But those things happen. All you have to do is look around the league. I forgot about it.'' Yet it was regularly theorized that the assault had left Sandstrom a changed player, that it had lingered in his consciousness and thus affected his style of play. ''I heard the talk about how I wasn't the same player, and maybe that is what bothered me most,'' said Sandstrom.

1106-> 2D SUSPECT LINKED TO 1963 BOMBING
Law-enforcement officials here and in Alabama said today that they were interviewing a second potential suspect in the racially inspired 1963 bombing of a Birmingham church in which four black children died. Investigators said they were led to the new suspect by Gary A. Tucker, a retired Birmingham bus driver who came forward last week to say that he also participated in the bombing, one of the most infamous instances of racial violence in the history of the civil rights movement. According to the officials, there is evidence to support the claims of Mr. Tucker. They cautioned, however, that critical aspects of Mr. Tucker's account had still not been verified, and they expressed some concern over his mental stability. Family members have said that Mr. Tucker, who is now being treated for bone cancer in a Tuscaloosa, Ala., hospital, had been hospitalized in the past for emotional problems. 'Seems to Know a Lot' ''We're working on the assumption that he may well be telling the truth,'' a Justice Department official said. ''He seems to know a lot of stuff that would have only been known by somebody who was involved.'' The bombing at the 16th Street Baptist Church on Sept. 15, 1963, is considered to have been a turning point in the campaign by civil rights activists to obtain the support of Southern whites. State and Federal investigators who asked not to be identified said that Mr. Tucker had implicated another man in the bombing, a former resident of the Birmingham area who is now being held in an Alabama prison after conviction on unrelated charges. Investigators would not publicly identify the prisoner, although one person with knowledge of the investigation said the prisoner was a career criminal who apparently had no known links to the Ku Klux Klan or other racial hate groups in the South, and that he had a background in explosives. According to the authorities, Mr. Tucker, who is 54 years old, approached law-enforcement officials last week, saying he wanted to confess to the bombing and clear his conscience before dying. Interviews at Medical Center Investigators said that Mr. Tucker was interviewed last week and again on Wednesday at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Tuscaloosa, where he has been undergoing treatment since July. One Federal investigator said Mr. Tucker had told the Federal Bureau of Investigation that he drove a pickup truck carrying dynamite to the church the night before the explosion. The bomb went off at 10:19 A.M., during Sunday services at the black church, killing four girls in a basement dressing room. Mr. Tucker's account has perplexed state and Federal investigators. Until last week, they said, Mr. Tucker had not turned up as a suspect in a crime that was the subject of one of the most intensive homicide investigations in the nation's history. The Justice Department confirmed today that they were attempting to verify Mr. Tucker's statements about the bombing. ''After interviewing Mr. Tucker, investigators decided to talk to some people who could confirm his information,'' said Mark Weaver, a department spokesman in Washington. ''We're doing that.'' In an telephone interview, the state Attorney General of Alabama, Don Siegelman, said, ''At this point, no one knows whether this is something to be excited about or not.'' Caution Is Advised ''I would remain very cautious,'' he said, vowing that his office and Federal authorities ''would follow every lead and make sure ever resource available is used - clearly this is one of the nation's most heinous crimes.'' Although the F.B.I. and Alabama authorities had previously identified several men linked to the Klan as suspects in the bombing, only one person, Robert E. Chambliss, was ever formally charged in the case. A former Klan member, Mr. Chambliss, known to his friends as ''Dynamite Bob,'' was convicted in 1977 of first-degree murder and died in custody three years ago. Investigators said they knew of no connection between Mr. Tucker and Mr. Chambliss. ''That's the thing that's so confusing,'' said a Federal law enforcement official. ''How could Tucker remain in the background so long? We tracked down everybody who knew Chambliss.'' ''Hundreds, thousands of people were interviewed back in the 60's and 70's, and how could Tucker have been ignored?'' he said.

1107-> Blaze at a Rocket Fuel Plant Is Attributed to Welding Job
Fire officials have blame a welder's torch for the fire and a series of explosions that two months ago demolished a plant that produced a rocket fuel oxidizer. Two people were killed in the accident, and 326 were injured. The officials said Thursday that their inquiry showed that iron slag sprayed from the welding operation had ignited a combination of materials in a building at the Pacific Engineering and Production Company plant. They said this touched off the fast-moving blaze that caused seven explosions and leveled the plant, which was situated in Henderson, about 20 miles from Las Vegas. The Clark County Fire Chief, Roy Parrish, said the blaze could probably have been contained had it not been fueled by ammonium perchlorate spilled on the building's floor and walls. Mr. Parrish said 8.5 million pounds of ammonium perchlorate, an oxidizer used in fuel for military missiles and the space shuttle's booster rocket, was destroyed in the explosions.

1108-> The Talk of the East Village; A Neighborhood of Vigorous Opinions
James Flowers, a veteran of protests past, with ''the scars and the record to show for it,'' sat on a kitchen chair at the corner of Tompkins Square Park and reflected on why he stayed home this time around. ''I went through that in the 60's,'' he said, wiping the sweat from his face, his tight cornrow curls splayed out across the top of his head like flexed fingers. ''I'm too old to be getting hurt again - unless the reason is sufficient.'' Mr. Flowers, who said he lived and worked in Harlem through the civil rights protests of those long-gone days, and more recently led a drive to organize street peddlers in the community, now designs clothes from his home on Avenue A and occasionally sells his possessions in the street to make ends meet - like records from his collection of 1960's pop singles. He is 39 years old. ''In the 60's, we were fighting for rights, and we changed the system through violence,'' he said. ''But I think this was unnecessary violence on both sides. There was no coherent goal.'' Mr. Flowers's vision of the ''Battle of Tompkins Square,'' as it is being called by some in this neighborhood of peeling bricks and political handbills, is colored by an idealized view of 1960's radicalism, a strain of local culture that runs broadly through the roughly 90-block area of the East Village that embraces Tompkins Square. Center of Counterculture The East Village, generally said to extend from around Broadway to Avenue B, and from Houston to 14th Streets, gained much of its identity in the 1960's as a center of counter-culture, but escaped much of the violence of that period. It is an old neighborhood that has absorbed repeated waves of hard-pressed newcomers, from the Irish of the 1800's, the Italians, Poles and Ukrainians of the early 20th century, the flower people of the era of Fillmore East to the harder-edge punks that followed. It is a place of vigorous opinion and disparity, where Polish sausage stores coexist alongside vendors of used clothing and stylized shops selling $120 Japanese sunglasses. But there is often also startling conformity, where black-on-black clothing is the uniform of the young, and ''north of 14th Street'' describes a world often spoken of with contempt and fear. Yuppies, vaguely defined, come from the north. Division on the Police The community's attitude toward the police is so like much else here: sharply divided. Groups like the local community board and the nonprofit social service organizations generally support the Police Department's goals in clearing Tompkins Square Park of drug dealers and drunks, for example. But the police action itself - especially what many see as its bald brutality - has reopened fears and hostilities that have nothing to do with what most people agree was the real cause of the disturbance, the neighborhood's preoccupation with housing and gentrification. ''The police, by acting in the brutal fashion that they did, managed to link a small group of crazies to the legitimate sentiments of opposition to gentrification,'' said Valerio Orselli, director of the Cooper Square Committee, a nonprofit housing group. ''Now the issue has become police brutality, not housing. It's set everyone back.'' Assemblyman Steven Sanders, who represents the community, said ambivalence about the police predates anything done by the officers of the Ninth Precinct. ''I have made speeches down there in the last six months calling for greater police presence in the streets - a speech that in almost any neighborhood would be greeted by wild applause,'' he said. ''But about half the people who hear that speech boo. They feel that police only act on behalf of the wealthy, and they see the police as a threat to them. Maybe some of them have a case in light of what happened.'' Music of Anarchy From a handbill, at First Avenue between Ninth and 10th Streets, for a musical combo called The Backyards, looking for a drummer: ''Must be dedicated, hard-hitting, in it for life. Willing to die naked in an alley for your anti-art. Outcasts and social rejects preferred but not essential.'' All over the East Village, graffiti depicting an overturned martini glass and ''1988 - 1933'' have appeared for the last year. The symbol is the logo of Missing Foundation, an anarchist rock band that was active in last week's protests in Tompkins Square Park. The four-member group, known for its cacophonous music - the lead singer, known as Peter Missing, sings through a bullhorn - claims that industrial society is at the brink of collapse and that a police state will arise from its ashes. The overturned glass signifies that ''the party's over,'' the band's motto. The dates are an allusion to the year the Nazis gained control of the Weimar Republic. At a recent performance in C.B.G.B.'s, a nightclub in the Bowery, the band set aflame oil drums doused with kerosene and rolled them into the crowd, causing extensive damage to the club, a spokesman for its management said. Missing Foundation members fled before the police arrived. A Place to Be Free Gertrude Briggs, 77, has been selling used art, dance, and literary books at her store, Books 'n' Things, for 41 years, most recently from a stuffy little shop on East Seventh street that has books stacked to the ceiling or in boxes. ''Most of the creative people have been displaced,'' she said, as she closed a sale with a customer from the Bronx. ''Of course it still attracts a lot of freaks, because it's still a place you can be free. For a lot kids, coming here is a way to get away from the choking atmosphere of suburbia.'' ''It's almost like geographical determinism - he gravitates here because he has no choice,'' offered the customer, who identified himself only as Carlos. ''That's what attracted me in the first place when I was going through my Marxist phase. The flyers, the posters, the cracking peeling walls - it's a glimpse of Old Amsterdam, of Old New York.'' Move Along, Please Alton Starr had just witnessed a stabbing and was sipping a fresh-squeezed orange juice at the American-Thai luncheonette at 12th Street and Second Avenue. The victim, a Guardian Angel who had helped Mr. Starr detain a suspected crack-dealer several weeks ago, had already been taken to a hospital with cuts to his chest and forearm. His attacker had escaped. ''He'll recognize me, unfortunately, so I'm in trouble,'' Mr. Starr said, with an experienced, matter-of-fact tone. Mr. Starr, a 49-year-old self-employed money manager, moved to East 13th Street two years ago because the rents were cheap. In the last six months, however, he said he had seen his block, between Third and Fourth Avenues, being taken over by drug sellers where there were few before. They've been chased there, he said, from other blocks where residents, police and Guardian Angels made it inconvenient to do business. Mr. Starr, a wiry, nervous-looking man with a well-chewed pipestem jutting from one pocket and a frayed fisherman's hat, said his strategy was simply to ask the sellers to move one block and generally, he said, they oblige. Other residents are as inured to drug users are suburbanites are to pesky neighborhood pets. ''A 90-pound woman can easily fend off a down-and-outer or an addict,'' said Barbara Shawm, who has lived in worked in the neighborhood for 30 years. ''They're not dangerous. It's more dangerous uptown - what people do to each other in elevators.''

1109-> A DEFEAT FOR THE KURDS; Iraqi Drive, Tied to Gulf Truce, Compounds Guerrillas' Disunity and Setbacks in Turkey
Iraq's newest offensive against the guerrillas among its three million Kurds seems to have left the rebel forces in disarray. And the Kurdish nationalist movement that has troubled the governments in Iraq, Iran and Turkey for almost 70 years now seems weakened. The Kurds, who have their own language and culture, want more autonomy in the countries they live in, if not outright independence. The reasons for their present predicament, experts on the subject in Turkey and Iraq say, differ with anti-Kurd campaigns by different governments, but the intention is similar: to erode Kurdish aspirations for autonomy that challenge the sovereignty of the central governments. The Iraqi campaign that began last month has forced more than 70,000 Kurds across the border into camps in Turkey, which already has its own problems with a Kurdish minority. Refugees have reported that some Kurds were killed while fleeing, but there have been no reports of large numbers of deaths. Some refugees have said that the Iraqi forces have used chemical weapons against the Kurds. But none of the refugees arriving at the Turkish border in recent days have said they were victims of such weapons. In Washington, the State Department said it could not confirm reports that the Iraqis had used chemical weapons against the Kurds. State Department officials said today that the United States had formally protested to Iraq about the offensive against the Kurds. The protest was delivered over the weekend to officials at the Foreign Ministry in Baghdad by April Glaspie, the American Ambassador to Iraq, the officials said. The Iraqis have not yet responded, a State Department official said. ''We are very concerned about the human rights implications of Iraq's conduct towards civilians in its campaign to suppress longstanding Kurdish rebellion,'' the State Department spokesman, Charles E. Redman, said today. President Saddam Hussein of Iraq followed up the campaign today with an offer of amnesty to most Kurdish dissidents, but it seems likely to be met with skepticism. ''I will go back only after Saddam Hussein is gone.'' said a Kurdish guerrilla, Idris Jemil, who fled to Turkey and was interviewed before the offer of amnesty was made known. He had been asked how he would respond to clemency from Baghdad. The offer of amnesty, regional specialists said, would not have been made if President Hussein regarded the Kurds as a continuing military threat. The Iraqi drive is only one of many setbacks for Kurdish nationalists in Iraq and elsewhere. A separate campaign in Turkey has reinforced a longstanding effort to dissolve a sense of Kurdish ethnic identity, which the authorities do not even acknowledge. #20 Million in Five Countries The Kurds, who number about 20 million people, are spread over enclaves in the Soviet Union, Iran, Iraq, Turkey and Syria, Insurgencies have been mounted in Iran, Iraq and Turkey, but the effort to mold a nation called Kurdistan has been divided by conflicting clan loyalties, according to Western experts and exiled Kurds in Western Europe. In 1920, Western powers and Turkey, under Ottoman rule, promised Kurds a nation of their own. But the promise was broken with the discovery of oil on Kurdish soil in Iraq, and the area was ceded to Britain under a League of Nations mandate in 1925. Since then uprisings on narrow fronts have flared but have lacked cohesion; they have been vulnerable to the caprice of outsiders as well as the opposition of governments jealously guarding their territorial integrity. Since 1974, when northeastern Iraqi provinces achieved the status of a nominally autonomous region within Iraq, its Kurds have been divided. Some remain within the panels and councils of the region, loyal to Baghdad. Another group, led by Jalal Talabani, has wavered between co-option and revolt. Still others, led by Massoud Barzani and his father Mustafa before him, rejected Baghdad's blandishments and in the mid-1970's and 1980's, with the support of Iran, mounted revolts, only to see support from Teheran sacrificed to changes in Iraq's fraught relationship with Iran. The cease-fire between Iran and Iraq that went into effect Aug. 20 freed Baghdad's forces for a major offensive on Mr. Barzani's Kurds. Since then between 50,000 and 100,000 Iraqi Kurds have fled into eastern Turkey, guarded by the same Turkish guns that are arrayed against fellow Kurds in Turkey who are fighting a smaller insurgency. Yet the distinctions between Turkish and Iraqi Kurds are sharp, honed by the nature of Turkish policy. A Deep Contrast The Iraqi Kurds arrived clad in traditional dress, while many Turkish Kurds these days wear the Western dress that prevails elserwhere in the land. The contrast goes deeper. Iraqi Kurds lost homes and land to a Government that razed their villages. But they maintained the emblems of an identity. Conversely, Turkey's Kurds, who number about eight million, have homes and land but their identity as a people is under constant challenge. ''Ironically,'' a Western diplomat in Baghdad said recently, ''Iraq's Kurds got the best deal of any of the Kurds, at least in terms of constitutional deals offering something. ''Their identity and language were acknowledged. Turkey does not even acknowledge that the Kurds exist as Kurds,'' the diplomat said. Little is heard of the Kurdish enclaves in the Soviet Union and Syria. Iran's Kurds have been largely suppressed, a Western diplomat said. But Turkey's Kurds have been embroiled in an insurgency since 1984. The guerrillas adopted harsh tactics, slaughtering civilians deemed to have collaborated with Ankara. The absence of Baghdad's control of northern Iraq gave them easy access to Turkey's mountainous east. During Turkey's lawless late 1970's, Kurdish nationalism flourished in cities like this southeastern provinicial capital. A military coup halted dissent in 1980. In the valleys and hills of east Turkey, Government garrisons squat over villages. Few soldiers know the Kurdish language, which is not taught in schools and not recognized as an official tongue. The region's people are officially known as ''mountain Turks.'' At the same time, however, Turkey has promised economic progress to the Kurds, improving some roads in the long-neglected and depressed area. Electric power pylons march across the landscape, and Turkish-language television now reaches villages. ''The population is caught in the middle,'' said a diplomat in Ankara. ''On one side they have the guerrillas telling them to support separatism. On the other, they face this Turkification program and stiff penalties for supporting the insurgents. It's a hard choice.''

1110-> Burnita S. Matthews Dies at 93; First Woman on U.S. Trial Courts
Burnita Shelton Matthews, the first woman to serve as a Federal district judge, died here Monday at the age of 93 after a stroke. Judge Matthews was named to the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia by President Truman in 1949. At the time of her nomination, she was a familiar figure in Washington as a lawyer for the National Women's Party and an active campaigner for women's rights. Judge Matthews presided over a number of major trials, including the 1957 bribery trial of James R. Hoffa, then vice president of the teamsters' union, at which he was acquitted. Help From Friends in Senate She recalled in an interview several years ago that her friendship with a number of senators had blunted opposition to the notion of a woman on the Federal bench. When her nomination was being considered, one of the judges on the district court, T. Alan Goldsborough, said publicly that while ''Mrs. Matthews would be a good judge,'' there was ''just one thing wrong: she's a woman.'' While Judge Goldsborough told her some years later that his opposition had been mistaken, she received an icy welcome from her fellow judges, who agreed among themselves to assign her all the ''long motions,'' the most technical and least rewarding part of the court's docket. Judge Matthews never retired from the court. In 1968 she took senior status, permitting her to reduce her workload on the district court while also hearing occasional cases in other Federal courts in Washington. She sat on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and on the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals. She continued hearing district court cases until five years ago. Judge Matthews retained a strong sense of her own role as a pioneer, and never wavered in her commitment to expanding opportunities for women. In a 1985 interview with the Third Branch, a newsletter published by the Federal court system, she said she had always chosen women to be her law clerks. ''The reason I always had women,'' she said, ''was because so often, when a woman makes good at something they always say that some man did it. So I just thought it would be better to have women. I wanted to show my confidence in women.'' Burnita Shelton decided as a young girl that she wanted to be a lawyer, although professional opportunities in the law were extremely limited for women. She was born Dec. 28, 1894, in Copiah County, Mississippi, where her father owned a plantation and served as clerk of the local chancery court. She often accompanied him to court. But while the family sent her brother to law school, she was sent to the Conservatory of Music in Cincinnati, where she studied voice and piano. She was teaching piano when the United States entered World War I. Hoping to find a Government job that would enable her to go to law school at night, she moved to Washington, passed a Civil Service examination, and took a job with the Veterans Administration. She went to night school at National University Law School, which later became part of George Washington University. After her graduation in 1919, Mrs. Matthews, now married to a lawyer, Percy A. Matthews, applied to the Veterans Administration for a job as a lawyer. When the agency told her that it would never hire a woman in the legal department, she opened her own law office. More Obstacles to Legal Career There were other stumbling blocks as well. The local bar association refused to accept her application for membership, returning the check she had sent for membership dues. Judge Matthews included that check among the papers she donated to what is now the Burnita Shelton Matthews Collection at the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, at Radcliffe College. Her activities on behalf of women's rights began in law school. In 1919, she was among several dozen women who regularly picketed the White House on Sundays on behalf of women's suffrage. ''You could carry a banner,'' she recalled in the 1985 interview, ''but if you spoke, you were arrested for speaking without a permit. So when they asked me why I was there, I didn't answer.'' After women got the vote in 1920, she shifted the focus of her activities. She became the lawyer for the National Woman's Party, which was trying to persuade state legislatures to lift legal barriers to women. Mrs. Matthews researched state laws and drafted proposed bills. The National Woman's Party owned the property across the street from the Capitol where the Supreme Court's building is now located. In the 1920's, when Chief Justice William Howard Taft proposed acquiring the land for the Court, she went to the Chief Justice's home to try to persuade him to look elsewhere. Her efforts failed, but she represented the party in the condemnation proceedings and won a generous settlement for it. In the 1940's she also taught at the Washington College of Law, now part of American University. Upheld Right of Black Muslims In 1949, President Truman named her to one of 20 new district judgeships that Congress had created to relieve a backlog in district court dockets. Among her rulings was one upholding the right of Black Muslims in the local prison to conduct religious services. In a 1955 case, she refused to order the State Department to issue a passport to the singer Paul Robeson, who was accused of being a member of the Communist Party and of supporting various pro-Communist activities, . Mr. Robeson's passport was withheld from 1950 to 1958 and was restored to him when, in a similar case, the Supreme Court ruled the State Department's action unconstitutional. On the Court of Appeals, Judge Matthews ruled that the Social Security Administration could not cut off disability benefits without a hearing. In 1984, President Reagan commended her for her ''diligence, distinguished efforts and pioneering spirit.'' Her husband died in 1969. They had no children. Judge Matthews is survived by four sisters-in-law and 11 nieces and nephews. She will be buried in the family cemetery in Copiah County, Mississippi.

1111-> THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Penchina's Morale Gets a Lift
PENCHINA, SELKOWITZ, a creative little agency in the $20 million class, has just finished a project for the mighty Unilever United States that has been very good for morale. The six-year-old agency can use the encouragement that an assignment from a giant brings, since it is still fighting back from the loss of the $15 million Burroughs Corporation assignment in 1986. Some smaller accounts were also lost after that. But when Unilever's Thomas J. Lipton unit thinks enough of your creative product to give you a shot at introducing a brand - in this case a variety of Wish Bone salad dressings - that certainly helps to restore confidence even if the assignment is only for a single 15-second spot, one print ad and some limited outdoor. After all, Lipton could have turned to the big agencies in its regular stable, FCB/Leber Katz Partners (the regular Wish Bone agency); Dailey & Associates; Bozell, Jacobs, Kenyon & Eckhardt, Lintas:USA, or Young & Rubicam. But it didn't. Or it could have given the project to Ally & Gargano or McConnaughy, Barocci & Brown, both of which have handled projects in the past. But it didn't. The assignment is for a 15-second spot to introduce the new Ranch and Lite Ranch liquid dressings, a category in which Kraft and Hidden Valley are already established. So what Steven Penchina, chairman and creative director, wanted to communicate was that Wish Bone had been holding back on a ranch dressing until it had a quality brand. The copy he wrote goes like this: ''Although we've created over 30 wonderful Wish Bone dressings. We have yet to come up with a Ranch dressing we flipped over . . . until now.'' The visual accompanying the copy is of five Wish Bone quality-control people in white coats, spoons ready, standing at an assembly line. As the bowls of dressing move by, they taste. When the voice-over reaches ''until now,'' they all do back flips and come up smiling. That's when the voice-over says, ''Introducing Wish Bone Ranch and Lite Ranch dressing.'' That's followed by the mandatory product shot. But here is still another case in which a creative team's vivid imagination leads to major casting problems. As luck would have it, casting for the spot was begun during the talent strike, but was concluded after the strike had been settled, so compromises had to be made. Then there was the problem of the best back flippers, who tended to be older teen-agers, not the usual age of dressing tasters. The agency ended up with a woman and four men. She is Marcia Frederick, captain of the 1980 United States Olympic gymnastics team. The male flippers are a clown from the Big Apple Circus, an acrobat who frequently works at the Metropolitan Opera and two members of the cast of ''Barnum.'' The spot will make its network debut on Sunday. Ranch style dressing is a creamy buttermilk dressing that is particularly popular in the South and West. Kraft leads in sales in the category, as it does in all dressings. According to Arthur Selkowitz, president of the agency, last year there were 93 million cases of dressing sold industrywide, of which 70 million were liquid dressings. Kraft had almost 40 percent of the liquid dressing market and Wish Bone, which has about 30 varieties, had almost 20 percent. A magazine ad that the agency was also asked to do features the Ranch style as well as the other flavors that crowd one another right off the page. It will be running this month in women's magazines. Also included in the project was advertising for New Recipe Thousand Island Dressing. Here Penchina, Selkowitz did some imaginative outdoor ads for use in the South. Each ad in the campaign shows a single huge vegetable with the dressing being poured over it. The single word of copy is ''Ahhhhhvocado,'' or ''Celhooray'' or ''Mmmmmmushroom.'' Isn't that daaaarling?

1112-> U.S. Won't Aid Austria in Waldheim Slander Case
Austria has asked the United States for assistance in preparing a criminal slander case against the head of a major Jewish organization for saying that President Kurt Waldheim had been ''part and parcel of the Nazi killing machine.'' The United States has turned down the request. Officials at the Justice Department, the State Department and the Austrian Embassy said the Austrian authorities wanted to interview Edgar M. Bronfman, the president of the World Jewish Congress, to prepare their case. Mr. Bronfman and his organization have led efforts to investigate Mr. Waldheim's wartime record. Justice Department officials said today that they had concluded they could not support the Austrian request because the department had already investigated Mr. Waldheim and found evidence that he ''participated in activities amounting to persecution'' of Jews, Greeks and Yugoslavs in World War II. ''We developed the information on Waldheim in our own investigation,'' said John K. Russell, a Justice Department spokesman. ''It would be a conflict of interest for us to assist the Austrians with their request.'' Austria could hire private lawyers if it wanted to ask an American court for help in obtaining Mr. Bronfman's testimony, Mr. Russell said. An Austrian representative delivered a note to the State Department last week, expressing unhappiness with the refusal to cooperate in the case, a State Department official said. The case, if it reached trial, would be heard in Austria. Christian Prosl, the No. 2 official at the Austrian Embassy, said the nation's chief prosecutor was gathering evidence to support a criminal complaint filed against Mr. Bronfman last year for statements about Mr. Waldheim, the former United Nations Secretary General. The penalties for criminal slander include a fine and imprisonment, he said. The statement at issue was made by Mr. Bronfman when he arrived in Budapest for a meeting of the governing board of the World Jewish Congress in May 1987. He repeated the statement in an article on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times on Feb. 14 of this year, saying that Mr. Waldheim was ''a liar and an unrepentant man who was part and parcel of the Nazi killing machine.'' A Federal judge may order a person in this country to give testimony or produce documents for use in a proceeding before a foreign court, but the person is entitled to the rights and protection available under American law.

1113-> Pumpkin Doughnut: An Autumn Glory
AROUND 2600 B.C., the Egyptians figured out how to make leavened bread. Making a great leap forward, the Dutch in the 16th century developed the ''olykoek,'' or oily cake, a doughnut without a hole. Moving closer to home, a Maine sea captain named Hanson Gregory, in 1847, punched a hole in his mother's dough to create the modern doughnut. In the history of the Chatham (N.Y.) Bakery and Coffee Shop pumpkin doughnuts, nothing much happened after that until the fall of 1973, when Wally Steward, the owner, pulled a clipping out of a three-by-five box. ''It was a recipe for pumpkin doughnuts I'd found years before in an old bakery magazine,'' he said. ''I fried up a few and they were real grease-laden, old-time sinkers. I made them for about six weeks and they didn't sell very well. So the next fall I started experimenting: a pinch of this and a pinch of that and a little bit of love.'' By 1975, Mr. Steward was making 100 dozen of the moist, pumpkin-flavored doughnuts rolled in granulated cinnamon sugar. This fall he plans to make 4,300 dozen doughnuts over a 10-week season. This does not mean that each of the 3,000 Chathamites eats a dozen doughnuts starting in early September, moving on through the traditional show of pumpkins at Halloween and ending with the deer-hunting season in November. Rather, weekenders and ''leaf peepers'' have found their way to the bakery on the corner of Route 66 and Route 203 in Columbia County, about 110 miles north of mid-Manhattan. ''People come through on their way to Vermont to watch the turning of the leaves,'' Mr. Steward said. ''They'll come in looking for the doughnuts. If we're out, they'll be real disappointed. They'll say, 'We're coming back in two days, save some for us.' '' One man from Connecticut was buying a miniature horse from Mr. Steward's wife, Shirley, who breeds the horses at their farm in Ghent, N.Y. To guarantee that he could bag a large number of doughnuts in addition to his livestock purchase, the man scheduled his transaction during pumpkin doughnut season. Then there are the people who call from Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York City and ask bakery employees to put aside 10 dozen or so, at $3 a dozen, or 25 cents for one. (The price was raised this year, from $2.40 a dozen, but Mr. Steward said the increase has not affected demand.) Ten dozen doughnuts? ''They're good keepers,'' Mr. Steward said. ''And people freeze them. I have people call up at Easter time and tell me, 'We've just had our last pumpkin doughnut.' '' Mr. Steward, 59 years old, started his working life as a teen-age farmer. Then, in 1949, he married Shirley Vail, a baker 's daughter from Monroe, N.Y. His father-in-law, Mr. Steward said, was an old-fashioned baker who ''trained me good: doughnuts, cream puffs, eclairs, cream pies.'' The Stewards moved to Chatham to start their bakery in 1959, and to their present location in 1972. Mr. Steward starts mixing ingredients for his other bakery items - cinnamon bread, white bread, cakes, pies, buns and regular doughnuts -at 10 or 11 each night. From 1 A.M. to 3:30 A.M., he makes 70 to 80 dozen pumpkin doughnuts. Jealously guarding the recipe, he allows only his eldest child, Jeffrey, 37, who owns the bakery with him, to help. (''I've had requests for the recipe, but I would not divulge it because there are bulk ingredients a housewife can't buy,'' Mr. Steward said mysteriously.) He mixes the dough in an 80-quart mixing machine, but ''the doughnuts are mostly handmade with a crank machine,'' he said. His fryer holds only 18 doughnuts at a time. ''They are very frail,'' he said. ''If I leave them in too long, they get greasy. I've got to be careful with them.'' Late at night, when the bakery is otherwise closed, the local constabulary - members of the Chatham Police Department, the Columbia County Sheriff's Office and the New York State Police - stop by. ''At night, if someone needs a cop, they'll call here,'' Mr. Steward said. ''They pay, too,'' he said. ''They put money in a little box on top of the refrigerator. And they put more money in than if I was charging them.'' Caught up in the manufacture of pumpkin donuts until early morning, Mr. Steward will not finish baking his other items until 6 or 7 A.M. The bakery opens at 5 A.M., when farmers come in, and Mr. Steward does duty at the grill making scrambled eggs, French toast and the Wally Poached Egg Special (an English muffin, a slice of ham, a poached egg and a slice of American or Swiss cheese). The Chatham Bakery employs 25 people, including the three Steward children (Jeffrey, Vicki, 34, and Joel, 22) and Jeffrey's wife, Coleen, 34, but Mr. Steward complains that he cannot get enough help. As a result, he closes the store at 3 every afternoon except Fridays when it is open until suppertime, and Sundays, when it closes at noon. Not everything Mr. Steward has tried at the bakery has been a success. A few years ago, for example, he introduced ''The All-American Wallyburger,'' a meatloaf-type patty on homemade bread. It flopped. ''When you try to fancy something up, people don't like it,'' he said. But they like his pumpkin doughnuts. He begins advertising the doughnuts during the Columbia County Fair, held in Chatham every Labor Day weekend. This year two computer-generated banners announcing ''Pumpkin Donuts September 12'' stretched across the dining room. On Sept. 12, a week after the fair, ''People were lined up,'' Mr. Steward said. As much a sign of autumn in this upstate town as out-of-state license plates and hunters in red plaid jackets, the doughnuts will remain a seasonal item. ''I look forward to making pumpkin doughnuts,'' Mr. Steward said, ''because I know it makes people happy. But if I made 'em all year long, people would get tired of 'em.'' A man who looks as if he has spent several decades sampling his own cooking, Mr. Steward admits that he used to eat four pumpkin doughnuts during his coffee break. This year, he said, ''I'm supposed to be on a diet. I've only had two doughnuts so far.'' But when asked how many calories there might be in a pumpkin doughnut, Wally Steward gives a level look and says, flatly, ''I don't care.''

1114-> Buildings With Asbestos Shunned
Only a few years ago, hardly anyone worried about renting or buying an office building that contained asbestos, the cancer-causing construction material. But that has suddenly changed. Owners of asbestos-filled buildings are having more difficulty attracting tenants. Sellers have to offer steep discounts. And buyers are having trouble lining up lenders or investors. The key reason for the turnabout is new state laws. Led by New York, 22 states have adopted anti-asbestos laws in the last year alone, raising the number of states regulating asbestos to 38, according to Asbestos Abatement Report, a newsletter. It is only a matter of time, experts say, before the remaining states pass asbestos laws, which typically require a landlord to remove asbestos before a building is demolished or renovated and regulate how it shall be removed. ''Over the last two years, asbestos has really taken off as a problem,'' said Kevin F. Haggarty, executive vice president of Cushman & Wakefield Inc., a national real estate firm. ''You're seeing a much smaller universe of players willing to get involved'' with buildings containing asbestos. Outlawed in the 70's Until it was outlawed in the early 1970's, asbestos was used to insulate, soundproof and fireproof buildings. The vast majority of buildings constructed in major cities between 1920 and 1970 contain asbestos. These structures include some of New York's most famous - from the Pan Am Building to Madison Square Garden. Now, in the wake of the new laws, real estate professionals say prices for asbestos-containing office buildings have fallen 5 to 10 percent in Manhattan and even more in other cities. That can translate into tens of millions of dollars when such buildings command hundreds of millions of dollars. ''I don't know one who will buy a building with asbestos,'' said Mr. Haggarty of the dozen or so Japanese insurers he deals with. Such companies as the International Business Machines Corporation and reportedly the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company will not lease office space in buildings containing asbestos. And fearing a tide of asbestos-related lawsuits, institutional investors - including banks, pension funds and insurance companies - are increasingly refusing to lend against or buy into asbestos-containing buildings. ''Aggressive lawyers will target everyone; lenders, owners, contractors, anybody who had anything to do with a building could be the object of a lawsuit,'' said Daniel J. Sitomer of Sitomer & Drexler, a New York law firm specializing in asbestos cases. For years, scientists have argued that asbestos fibers, while safe when contained, can cause cancer when torn from walls and ceilings and allowed to float freely in the air. Only in the last 12 to 18 months, however, as states began to adopt ordinances requiring the removal of asbestos before renovation, has the real estate industry begun to consider the harmful impact of asbestos. A Sensitive Issue Understandly, asbestos remains a sensitive issue. Of three major insurers that invest in real estate -Prudential, Metropolitan Life and Equitable - only Equitable agreed to discuss asbestos in an interview. Moreover, when asked to discuss buildings where asbestos has impaired value, killed a sale or prevented financing, ordinarily outgoing real estate professionals will not talk. They say that once it becomes public that a building has an ''asbestos problem,'' the building could be in trouble for years. ''These people are still trying to sell their buildings,'' said John S. Lillard, president of JMB Institutional Realty Inc. The Chicago-based real estate investment firm says it has walked away from more than a half-dozen purchases in the last year because the buildings contained asbestos. 'An Economic Factor' Real estate specialists who requested anonymity identified several notable deals affected by asbestos: * The Chase Manhattan Bank has been having trouble selling 1 New York Plaza, an office tower that went on the market last winter. In response, a Chase lawyer called asbestos ''simply an economic factor for buyers to consider.'' He added, ''It is not the kind of thing that would cause an otherwise interested buyer to change its mind.'' * When the General Electric Company recently tried to refinance the Gulf and Western Building, a high-rise at Columbus Circle in Manhattan that G.E. jointly owns, a major insurer refused to lend. Even when G.E. offered to indemnify the insurer against any asbestos-related lawsuits and to increase the interest rate it would pay on the loan by one-half percentage point, the insurer still said no. Jonathan Wexler, a partner at the First Winthrop Corporation, G.E.'s partner, agreed that the effort to refinance the building ran into difficulty because of asbestos. But he said plans to refinance it were scrapped for other reasons. * If the Exxon Building at 1251 Avenue of the Americas at 50th Street had not contained asbestos, a dozen or so bidders would probably have competed for the building, sold in late 1986. Instead, the auction attracted only three serious bidders, people familiar with the deal say, and the ultimate buyer, Mitsui of Japan, cut its price by more than $20 million when it learned it would have to spend that much to remove the asbestos. Edward S. Gordon, president of the Edward S. Gordon Company, the real estate firm that arranged the deal, declined to comment. * In 1986, both the Shuwa Corporation, a big Japanese real estate company, and Olympia & York, the Canadian developer, set bids lower for the ARCO Plaza, a huge office complex in downtown Los Angeles, after learning it contained asbestos. Shuwa bought the building. Sales Eventually Made That most buildings containing asbestos have eventually been sold and financed suggests that asbestos is a hurdle that can be cleared. Indeed, a minority of real estate professionals take the view that asbestos has simply become another cost of doing business. They calculate the cost of asbestos removal at $5 to $30 a square foot, depending on whether the material is throughout a building or only in selected areas. They estimate ''down'' time - when a building must remain vacant while the asbestos is being removed. And they estimate how much less rent an asbestos building can command. They also say that while more costly, financing of asbestos-containing buildings can be obtained. Although rules of thumb are rough, lending experts say asbestos can increase the interest rate on a loan by one-half to one percentage point. ''If the conditions are right - if the risks can be identified and managed - people will lend,'' said Craig M. Hatkoff, a managing director of the Chemical Realty Group, the real estate arm of the Chemical Bank. When It's Not a Problem Other experts note that asbestos is often not a problem - for instance, when it is wrapped around a few pipes in a building's boiler room. Others note that in New York City, such factors as location are far more important in determining value than asbestos. ''I'd rather have an asbestos-filled building on Park Avenue than a clean building on Second Avenue,'' said John Forelle, a partner at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, a law firm that represents Japanese investors in real estate. Still, a growing number of people in the real estate industry want to avoid asbestos-filled buildings. Besides worrying about the cost of removing the asbestos, these people have another worry: how much lenders or owners will have to pay if they are sued by cancer victims for owning or financing a building that has asbestos. Although there have been no court cases dealing with the issue, building owners would appear more vulnerable than lenders. Owners of properties of all types are responsible for maintaining safe conditions inside their buildings. Lenders Also Fearful But lenders also fear being taken to court by victims of illness who might argue that the lenders never should have facilitated the sale of a building. ''Nobody is really sure how far the liability extends,'' said Mr. Sitomer, the asbestos lawyer. ''Banks are concerned that if they foreclose on the building, they are responsible for that asbestos.'' In fact, according to Mr. Sitomer, the concern does not stop there. Because Federal and state laws dictate how asbestos shall be transported and disposed of, banks fear they could be sued if the asbestos is mishandled long after being removed from their buildings, he said. Yet another fear, he and others say, is that asbestos laws will become stricter, placing greater pressure on building owners to remove asbestos and making loan defaults more likely. The result is great uncertainty, real estate experts say - more uncertainty than many lenders are willing to bear. The net result could be fewer players in real estate lending, still higher rates on loans, and higher rents as landlords pass on their increased costs to tenants.I.B.M.

1116-> Arthur G. Odell Jr., 74; Acclaimed for Designs
Arthur Gould Odell Jr., a prominent architect, died April 21 at Charlotte Memorial Hospital in North Carolina after a long illness. He was 74 years old and lived in Charlotte. Mr. Odell was an award-winning architect whose contribution to Southern architecture was design creativity rather than imitation. After graduation from Cornell University in 1935 and graduate studies at L'Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, he apprenticed in New York City with Harrison & Fouilhoux, architects of Rockefeller Center. He was elected a Fellow in the American Institute of Architects in 1955, and in 1965 he became the first Southerner to head the national organization. In 1966 he was recognized for his achievements by his home state, receiving the North Carolina Award. Among his internationally recognized buildings are the Burlington Industries Corporation headquarters in Greensboro, N.C.; the North Carolina Blue Cross and Blue Shield Building in Chapel Hill, NC; and the Hampton Coliseum in Hampton, Va. His firm has won more than 75 design awards. In the mid-1960's, Mr. Odell was in charge of the United States Department of the Interior's Potomac Planning Task Force to develop a plan for the Potomac River basin. Mr. Odell, who retired as chairman of Odell Associates in 1982, is survived by his wife, Mary Walker Odell, of Charlotte; three children, William Robinson Odell, of Charlotte, Alexandra Odell Dalbeck, of Edgemoor, S.C., and Charles Alexander Odell, of Charlotte; a brother, John K. P. Odell, of Concord, N.C.; and four grandchildren.

1117-> U.S. IS CONSIDERING A NEW INITIATIVE FOR MIDEAST PEACE
As a result of the continuing violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, the Reagan Administration is conducting internal deliberations on whether the United States should take a more active and visible role in pursuing peace efforts in the Middle East, American officials said today. ''The disturbances have quickened the interest,'' a State Department official said. ''But the more we look at it, the more we realize that the fundamental elements that have made it difficult to move over recent years have not changed, so I think progress is unlikely.'' Both Israel and Egypt appear to be increasing their diplomatic pressure for more involvement by the United States. Israel Wants U.S. to Send Envoy Yossi Beilin, Political Director General of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, visited Washington this week and appealed to the State Department to send a high-level envoy to try to help set up negotiations between Israel and Jordan on the future of the West Bank. This is an election year, both in Israel and the United States, so no diplomatic effort can last very long. Any American initiative will be interrupted when the Reagan Administration leaves office in a year. Some American officials see Mr. Beilin's appeals for increased activity by Washington as a part of Israeli election campaigning. The Labor Party, in which Mr. Beilin is a top aide, is eager to make peace a central issue in the campaign. To do that, it needs a clear peace proposal on the table and, preferably, negotiations under way. Mubarak Expected to Press U.S. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, who is scheduled to visit Washington next week, is also expected to press for greater activity by the United States, a Middle Eastern diplomat said. In addition, the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, proposed that in light of the ''popular uprising'' in the occupied territories, the foreign ministers of the United Nations Security Council discuss convening an international conference on the Middle East. The suggestion came in a letter, made public today, to the United Nations Secretary General, Javier Perez de Cuellar. Israel's methods of dealing with rioters came under renewed criticism today from the State Department spokesman, Charles E. Redman. ''We are disturbed by the adoption of a policy by the Government of Israel that calls for beatings as a means to restore or maintain order,'' Mr. Redman said. Israel, he added, could maintain order ''through the use of humane measures which do not result in civilian casualties.'' The appeals by Israel and Egypt reportedly grow out of increased concern that the cycle of rioting and retaliation that has left at least 38 Palestinians dead since early December is leading to a hardening of the extreme positions on both sides of the Arab-Israeli conflict, eroding the middle ground and making compromise more difficult. However, American officials are skeptical about the Administration's ability to get negotiations under way unless Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel drops his opposition to an international conference as a prelude to Israeli-Jordanian talks. King Hussein of Jordan has said that he will not enter negotiations with Israel without first holding a broad conference that includes the Soviet Union. Secret Talks Fell Apart Last spring, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of Israel, who leads the Labor Party, reportedly met in secret with King Hussein in London and agreed on the general organization and powers of a conference. But Prime Minister Shamir rejected the concept, fearing that radical parties, like Syria, would try to thwart a Jordanian-Israeli accord on the West Bank. Mr. Shamir's Likud bloc wants to keep the West Bank under Israeli control. In October, Secretary of State George P. Shultz visited Israel and proposed a variation of the conference idea to Mr. Shamir: a meeting with just the United States and the Soviet Union presiding. Mr. Shamir gave qualified acceptance. One idea was to have King Hussein and Prime Minister Shamir meet in Washington during the Soviet-American summit meeting in December. But when Mr. Shultz flew to London to see King Hussein, the Jordanian reportedly rejected the idea, insisting on a broader conference that would include his powerful neighbor, Syria. King Hussein then had this concept written into a resolution at the Arab summit meeting in Amman, Jordan, last fall. Concern, but No Action Since then, the Reagan Administration has been fairly dormant on Mideast initiatives. Although officials are convinced that the current clashes illustrate the need for Israel to find a way out of the territories, the Administration has not been able to come up with a plan of action. ''The violence, so intense and so prolonged as it has been,'' a senior State Department official said, ''confirms that the status quo is not sustainable and there is an even more urgent need to identify the problems and get the peace process going.'' But there is little interest in Washington for sending an envoy to Israel, he added. ''There the old idea that you can send an envoy out and beat up on all sides until they come around,'' the official said. ''Frankly, that doesn't sound very appealing to the Administration.'' He said Mr. Beilin, the Israeli emissary, was vague in formulating his ideas. ''It wasn't a very clearly thought-out proposal,'' the official said. ''He wanted greater U.S. visibility and activism and engagement. But he didn't have any ideas about how to bridge the gap in Israel or how functional U.S. involvement would be in bridging that gap.'' Israel's elections may also work against flexibility by Mr. Shamir, American officials said, because the Prime Minister will not want to be outflanked on the right by former Defense Minister Ariel Sharon and others. Consequently, the Administration does not seem inclined to do anything dramatic without some sign of movement by Mr. Shamir. And officials note that neither Mr. Shamir nor King Hussein has called for increased American activity.

1118-> Sports People; Snyder Defended
In a coincidenal twist to the Jimmy (the Greek) Snyder flap, Gene Upshaw, executive director of the National Football League Players Association, said yesterday in Washington that he was supposed to have dinner with Snyder last Friday night. Earlier in the day, Snyder made his remarks on blacks in sports that led to his dismissal last Saturday by CBS. Upshaw said he went to the restaurant and got a call from Snyder, who invited him to his room, where they talked for three hours. He and Snyder have been friends since Upshaw's career with the Oakland Raiders. Upshaw said he did not find Snyder's remarks offensive. ''He never really had a chance publicly to say what he meant,'' Upshaw said. ''I know Jimmy, and I can't imagine him being a racist.''

1119-> At Latin Parley, Charges of Bad Faith
The leaders of five Central American countries opened a final stage of peace negotiations here today amid accusations of bad faith and strongly differing interpretations of the regional treaty they signed five months ago. The Presidents of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica began what appeared certain to be extremely difficult negotations over the application of the peace accord they signed last August. In an indication of the tensions surrounding the meeting, the Presidents of Costa Rica, El Salvador and Honduras have all charged in the last two days that Nicaragua is the country that has most failed to carry out the regional treaty, which calls for increased democratization and an end to guerrilla wars in Central America. They criticized Nicaragua for appearing to have not cut off aid to Salvadoran leftist guerrillas and for failing to lift a state of siege, failing to offer fuller freedom of the press, not applying a more ample political amnesty and not holding more negotiations with rebel leaders. Honduras Is Criticized, Too Diplomats and other political analysts noted, however, that Honduras has also been especially delinquent in applying the peace treaty because it has refused to end its assistance to Nicaraguan rebels, as called for in the accord. President Daniel Ortega Saavedra of Nicaragua rejected criticisms of his country at a news conference here this morning in which he defended his compliance with the peace treaty. Mr. Ortega, who arrived in the country under heavy security measures, said that he had come to Costa Rica in a ''spirit of conciliation,'' and that he intended to see that the regional peace treaty was carried out ''100 percent.'' He accused the United States of trying to scuttle the peace accord to get new aid for the contras and said he was willing to take further steps to fulfill the treaty if aid to the rebels was cut off for good - as he contended is called for in the treaty. Nicaraguan Strategy Offering a glimpse of his negotiating strategy, Mr. Ortega then argued that the report of an international verification commission established by the treaty be given greater weight than the opinions of the Central American Presidents. Such a step is not contemplated in the peace treaty and it is unlikely to be granted, but it is a move that offers Nicaragua advantages because the verification commission includes members who have shown greater sympathy for Nicaragua than have the leaders of its neighboring Central American countries. A meeting of the verification commission ended last weekend with little agreement. The commission is made up of members of the United Nations, the Organization of American States, the so-called Contadora Group of Latin countries and the five Central American signers of the peace treaty. President Jose Azcona Hoyo of Honduras and President Jose Napoleon Duarte of El Salvador flew here Thursday to meet with President Oscar Arias Sanchez of Costa Rica to discuss their strategy in what may be a sign of a joint position against Nicaragua. Duarte Accuses Ortega In a strong statement late Thursday, Mr. Duarte said that only the Central American Presidents have the authority to judge the peace treaty. He then accused Nicaragua of failing to carry out the accord and warned that ''the zero hour has come'' for peace in the region. Mr. Duarte asserted that El Salvador had fully complied with the treaty and then angrily accused Mr. Ortega of continuing to support Salvadoran leftist guerrillas and of failing to offer full political liberty in Nicaragua. ''From this moment we will see if there will be democracy in Nicaragua and peace in Central America,'' Mr. Duarte said. When Mr. Duarte met Mr. Ortega at opening ceremonies this morning, the two men stared coldly at each other and did not shake hands. A senior defector from the Nicaraguan Ministry of Defense contended recently that Nicaragua has continued to aid and train Salvadoran leftist guerrillas as well as prepare to organize a 500,000-man Soviet-armed reserve army. Sandinista officials have confirmed much of what the defector said, while denying some of his specific charges. Mr. Ortega declined today to reply to Mr. Duarte's attack, but said that if he wanted to find grounds to criticize other Presidents, he could easily do so. The Nicarauan mentioned the killings of a leading human rights advocate in El Salvador in October and another human rights campaigner, Miguel Angel Pavon, who was killed in Honduras on Thursday, as examples of noncompliance with the treaty's spirit of reconciliation. Nicaragua Defends Refusal Mr. Ortega defended his continued refusal to meet directly with contra leaders to negotiate, saying that Nicaragua wanted to negotiate with the United States, which he called ''the creator of the contras.'' Costa Rican officials criticized this argument. They said that by that reasoning Nicaragua, Cuba and the Soviet Union could be considered the chief planners of the guerrilla war in El Salvador because of their training and support for Marxist rebels there. The peace treaty being discussed here calls for press freedom, freedom to organize politically, free elections, lifting of state of siege laws, a political amnesty, efforts to negotiate cease-fires in guerrilla wars and a cutoff of all aid to rebel forces in the region, among other measures. It is possible that the meeting here will end in discord. But several officials suggest it is more likely the Presidents may agree to extend the time allowed for complying with the treaty. Costa Rican, Honduran and Salvadoran officials say a possible extension should be limited to a month or less and should be tied to a precise dates in which each country will be asked to carry out those steps of the treaty that they have not fulfilled. ----Honduran Rights Advocate Killed TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras, Jan. 15 (Reuters) - A leading Honduran human rights advocate was shot dead by unknown assailants in the city of San Pedro Sula, the police said today. Miguel Angel Pavon, president of the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights, a human rights group, was killed Thursday night in the outskirts of San Pedro Sula, 120 miles north of the capital. The two attackers, who also killed a man accompanying Mr. Pavon, Moises Landaverde, fled on a motorcycle, witnesses told local radio stations. Mr. Pavon was a member of the National Assembly from the Innovation and Unity Party. Mr. Landevearde was a local leader of the Christian Democratic Party. Both are small opposition parties. The president of the Committee of Relatives of Disappeared Persons in Honduras, Zenaida Velasquez, said ''the authors of this murder were the death squads.'' Mr. Pavon testified in October before the Interamerican Human Rights Commission in a hearing into the disappearances of more than 100 persons between 1981 and 1985.

1122-> Skin Cream Seems to Reverse Some Harmful Effects of Sun
A small study has found that a prescription cream containing a chemical cousin of vitamin A appears capable of reversing some of the damaging effects that sunlight has on skin. The study marks the first time that a drug has been shown to actually turn back sun-caused skin damage. But experts expressed caution yesterday, saying the research had involved too few people over too short a period to be conclusive. The study, whose results are reported in the current issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, was conducted by Dr. Jonathan Weiss and colleagues at the University of Michigan. It involved 30 white patients ranging in age from 35 to 70, all of whom had sun-damaged skin. They applied a cream with a vitamin A derivative to their forearms or faces. An Anti-Acne Drug The cream, called Retin-A, which has long been sold as a prescription anti-acne drug, reversed some of the sun damage after four months of use, the length of the study. But, the researchers noted, the cream also caused some skin irritation, and they could not establish how long the changes would last. Dr. Barbara Gilchrest, head of dermatology at the Boston University School of Medicine, expressed caution in an editorial in the journal about the relatively small size and short length of the study. She also noted that the cream was no fountain of youth. It was most effective in reducing fine wrinkling, ''a relatively early and subtle marker of aging,'' she wrote. But ''little or no improvement was observed in more advanced changes,'' she added. Further, 90 percent of the patients developed a rash, which caused most of them to stop using the cream temporarily at least once; three had to stop using it altogether. Improvement 'Quite Subtle' The study did not show that the cream affected natural aging of the skin, the genetically programmed sort that occurs with or without the sun. Normal aging entails the skin's loss of elasticity, its thinning and the formation of crow's feet and frown lines, for example. Sun-damaged skin is leathery, wrinkled and yellowed. Dr. Gilchrest, while calling for more research on products to make skin appear youthful, cautioned that, with Retin-A, ''the average improvement was quite subtle'' and ''may not satisfy the expectations of a demanding public for long.'' The cream is made by the Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation, a division of Johnson & Johnson. Johnson & Johnson stock jumped $3 yesterday, closing at $74.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. A total of 1,739,900 of its shares were traded, making it the fifth most active stock on the exchange.

1123-> BROKEN WATER MAIN FLOODS BUILDINGS AND KNOCKS OUT UTILITIES ON UPPER WEST SIDE
A 90-year-old water main broke underneath Broadway between West 84th and 85th Streets in Manhattan early yesterday, sending a cascade of water flowing westward in the frigid darkness into basements of apartment houses and stores. The water knocked out furnaces, phone lines and some electricity, forcing businesses to close, causing the rerouting of traffic, and shutting subway service along the Broadway line during the morning and evening rush hours. It was the second major water main break within a week of single-digit temperatures. But the authorities said yesterday's break, which flooded a dozen or more buildings in a three- to four-block area between Broadway and West End Avenue, was less serious than Monday's incident when two aging mains burst and knocked out utilities in a nine-square block area on the East Side of Manhattan. Laboring in subfreezing temperatures, work crews spent most of yesterday trying to repair a 36-inch main trunk line, dating to 1898, which burst under the southbound lane of Broadway at about 2:40 A.M. causing the street to buckle as water rushed through the fissures and uprooted sidewalk slabs for about half a block on the west of Broadway. The water continued downhill toward West End Avenue, said Jeffrey Sommer, first deputy commissioner of the city's Department of Environmental Protection. No Injuries Reported No cars were on that section of street at the time and no one was was reported injured, according to the authorities, but apartment dwellers were jerked from sleep by the noise of water crashing into basements. Many residents of heatless apartment buildings sought shelter elsewhere last night. The Red Cross reported it had transported one elderly woman and her dog to a relative's house in Brooklyn. Electricity was shut off in one apartment building, the 75-unit Alameda at 255 West 84th Street, at the corner of Broadway, and was still off last night, according to a spokeswoman for Consolidated Edison, Laurie Hanson. ''The main itself can probably be repaired within 24 hours, but what will take longer is the reconstruction of the roadway itself and the sidewalk area and I believe that will take as much as a week,'' Commissioner Sommer said. He said it was possible a weak spot in the line was aggravated by the frozen soil around it. Phones Knocked Out A spokeswoman for his agency, Tina Casey, said water was restored by noon but many residents still lacked it because electrical water pumps were inoperable in some buildings. A total of 4,200 phone lines were knocked out, said a spokesman for the New York Telephone Company, Tony Pappas. About 2,900 were still out by late evening and of these, at least 1,200 might not be back in service until Sunday, he said. Service on the 1 train was restored around 9:30 P.M. and service on the 2 and 3 trains was restored about 15 minutes later, said a Transit Authority spokesman, Robert Slovak. Emergency crews from the city's Buildings Department will inspect a dozen flooded buildings on 82d, 83d, 84th, and 85th Streets and along West End Avenue beginning today for structural damage, said a spokesman, Vahe Tiryakian. 'All This Water' The superintendent at 252 West 85th Street, George Torres, said he became aware of a problem as he was returning to the 10-story cooperative apartment building, between Broadway and West End Avenue, about 2:30 A.M. ''I was out late, having a good time,'' Mr. Torres said.''And as I was going home to my apartment I saw all this water out on Broadway, kind of coming up out of the ground.'' ''So I called 911, and they didn't believe me. The guy says, 'Nah, you're crazy, there's nothing like that.' Then my brother called up and said, 'Hey this guy isn't crazy, it's really like that.' '' By the time fire equipment and Con Edison trucks began arriving shortly after 3:30, Mr. Torres said, water had already begun to run down the slope from Broadway and was starting to seep into the building from the sidewalk along 85th Street. Voytek Obernikowicz, the superintendent of a 13-story building at 500 West End Avenue, said he was awakened at about 2:30 by a crashing noise. When he reached the lobby, ''it was a river, about 14 inches high, from the backyard, through the lobby, and into the street,'' he said. It carried heavy potted plants along with it. About half the tenants left for shelter elsewhere, and Mr. Obernikowicz, who is 6-foot-4, carried some of the elderly residents. As Mr. Torres spoke at about 10:30 A.M., firefighters had pumped out water from most of the buildings. In the basement of his building, the high water mark of four feet - like a bathtub ring - circled the walls. Nine stores on Broadway in the affected block were closed for business. Simon Simunovic, owner of the Grand Prix, a record store, glumly probed the cellar darkness with a flashlight. He said about 2,000 videotapes and compact disks were destroyed by the water that rose to three feet. He estimated the loss at more than $40,000.

1125-> Sports People; Incentive for Olympics
To get the best track and field performances for the Seoul Olympics, The Athletics Congress, the national governing body of the sport in the United States, announced that it would provide $400,000 to 26 Olympic hopefuls. Carl Lewis, Edwin Moses, Valerie Brisco and Jackie Joyner-Kersee are among the athletes designated for Operation Seoul, the name of the pilot program. Each of the 26, chosen by a special T.A.C. selection committee, was considered a potential medalist. Each could receive as much as $14,000 over the 10-month period, beginning this month. Each will receive $1,500 monthly through July, payable to his or her T.A.C. trust fund account. Then, the athletes qualifying for the Olympics at the trials July 15-23 in Indianapolis will receive $1,500 each in August and September and $500 in October.

1126-> Mecham's New Worry: Lasers
As he faces criminal charges and possible recall or impeachment, Gov. Evan Mecham of Arizona says he has yet another worry: someone may be eavesdropping on him with laser beams. Mr. Mecham told a group of lawyers at a breakfast meeting Tuesday that he believed someone might be using laser beams to spy on conversations at his office in the state Capitol and at his home, two lawyers said today. One of the lawyers, Ernest Calderon, said the Governor told them he played the radio all the time to keep laser beams out. Laser beams are used in one form of electronic surveillance, experts say, and can ''read'' vibrations in window glass caused by voices. Other noise in a room, such as a radio, would make it harder to interpret conversations. Ken Smith, Mr. Mecham's press secretary, said that there was continuing concern that the Governor's office was the target of some sort of electronic surveillance but that no evidence had been uncovered. Mr. Mecham said in Tucson today that the alleged eavesdropping occurred ''many months ago'' and that no attempt was made to find out who was listening in. ''We just set up some precautions so it wouldn't happen again,'' he said. He acknowledged talking about eavesdropping at the breakfast meeting Tuesday. The Governor is scheduled to be arraigned Friday on six felony counts of fraud, perjury and filing of false documents in connection with his failure to report a $350,000 campaign loan.

1127-> Nobel Laureates Agree to Meet Again in 1990
At the end of four days of deliberations, 75 Nobel laureates decided today to hold another meeting in two years and to create an emergency committee to intervene with moral authority in crises around the world. Elie Wiesel, the 1986 Peace Prize winner who with President Francois Mitterrand organized the unusual gathering, said the laureates' discussions on the future of mankind had gone surprisingly well. ''I expected some problems with superstars,'' the American laureate said in an interview, ''but they became very friendly with each other.'' Mr. Wiesel, a survivor of German death camps who has written extensively about the crimes of Nazi Germany, said the biggest success of the gathering was the decision to meet again in two years at an undetermined location. The laureates, he said, also resolved to create an emergency group that could bear witness at human rights violations or catastrophes. ''Imagine 10 Nobel Prize winners in Argentina during the period of the disappearances,'' Mr. Wiesel said, referring to the Argentine military's repression of opposition in the 1970's. ''Or at Chernobyl. Or in Ethiopia.'' Although the gathering issued no final document, Mr. Wiesel today mentioned some general conclusions, including the need for the summoning of a global conference on world debt and the pooling of research on AIDS. At a reception at the Elysee Palace given by Mr. Mitterrand, several laureates said they had been pleasantly surprised by the exchange of ideas that was accomplished by bringing together scientists, writers, economists and politicians. ''There are signs of a baby here aborning,'' said Sheldon L. Glashow, a professor at Harvard University who shared the Nobel in Physics in 1979. Earlier in the week, Mr. Glashow had been openly skeptical about the usefulness of the gathering. The event was to have 76 laureates, but Sean MacBride of Ireland, the 1974 Peace Prize recipient, died three days before the conference opened. Mr. Mitterrand thanked the laureates today for ''doing an honor to France.'' The laureates also did an honor to Mr. Mitterrand, who is deciding whether he will run for a second term in this spring's presidential election. For four days, the Socialist President has received considerable press and television coverage, prompting one Gaullist politician to remark that he had won a Nobel for electioneering.

1128-> POP/JAZZ; For Melodies From Weill To Webb, Come To the Cabaret
Cabaret, an ever-fragile world perpetually on the verge of flickering out, seems to thrive at the coldest time of the year, its intimacy a buffer against the blast of winter. This weekend, clubs across Manhattan are offering entertainment that provides an unusually rich array of nostalgic flavors, from the late 60's pop of Jimmy Webb to Walt Levinsky playing 40's swing, from Judith Cohen relighting the torch of 70's cabaret to Depression-era jazz at the Vineyard Theater. And next week, Helen Schneider is scheduled to resume a monthlong stint at the Ballroom singing an all-Sondheim program. That engagement was temporarily interrupted by vocal problems. Does this activity augur a full-scale cabaret revival? The closing in recent months of two important midtown clubs - Panache and Freddy's - illustrates the precarious economics of a field in which probably no more than a dozen performers can be guaranteed to do good business. At the same time, the popularity of rising young cabaret stars like Michael Feinstein and Karen Akers and the eagerness of veteran performers to make contact with audiences in the hushed intimacy of a cabaret attests to the resilience of a genre in which the music is often made more for love than for money. Two of this weekend's cabaret high points are the return to club performance of Mr. Webb and Ms. Cohen. Tonight at Jan Wallman's, Mr. Webb, the composer of ''Up Up and Away,'' ''By the Time I Get to Phoenix,'' ''MacArthur Park'' and ''The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress,'' among other modern standards, will perform in New York for the first time in a decade. The shows, at which the singer and pianist will be accompanied by Larry Coryell on acoustic guitar, are the first in a string of four Friday evening dates by Mr. Webb at the club. His most famous songs, most of them written when he was in his teens and early 20's, evoke the heady atmosphere of Los Angeles when it was becoming a musical boom town in the late 60's. They also represent pop-rock at its most effulgently, unapologetically romantic. Today, Mr. Webb lives in Montclair, N.J., with his wife, Patsy, and five sons who range in age from 7 months to 14 years. Although Mr. Webb still writes pop songs, in the last several years he has devoted more of his energy to writing for the theater. ''What brings me back to performing is fear of petrifaction,'' Mr. Webb said the other day. ''I'm 41 and have a 14-year-old son who also writes and performs. And I'm convinced he's much better than I was when I was his age. I need the adrenaline that comes from contact with an audience.'' Mr. Webb spends five or six hours at the piano every day, writing both pop songs (Glen Campbell's version of his recent song ''Still Within the Sound of My Voice'' is currently a top 10 country single) and theater projects. One is a musical, ''The Children's Crusade,'' set in the 13th century, that he has been working on for the last three and a half years with the book writer John Heilpern. The show was suggested by Michael Bennett, with whom Mr. Webb collaborated on ''Scandal,'' which never evolved beyond the workshop stage. Robin Wagner, the designer, has become the patriarch of ''The Children's Crusade,'' Mr. Webb said in a recent interview. ''After Michael's death, he came to John and me and said we had to finish it,'' Mr. Webb said. ''He's determined to help us see it through, and thank God for him. My other current project is a collaboration with Ray Bradbury based on his novel 'Dandelion Wine.' It's three songs away from completion. In March, I'll begin working with Dale Wasserman on another show, commissioned by the Abbey Theater in Dublin and based on a one-act play by George Bernard Shaw.'' Mr. Webb doubts the music he wrote for the ill-fated ''Scandal'' will ever be heard, since most of it was ballet music that has no context outside the production. Questions on 'MacArthur Park' At Jan Wallman's, Mr. Webb expects to sing most of his best-known songs, including ''MacArthur Park,'' the surrealistic ballad he wrote at 19. ''The song has always had its adherents and its detractors,'' Mr. Webb said. ''I've been asked so many questions about it that I can't think of it anymore. What's amazing is the extraordinary life the song has had. It's been done in all different styles. Waylon Jennings recorded it twice, and it once won me a country song of the year award. 'Cake out in the rain' buffs, take note!'' This weekend marks a homecoming of sorts for Judith Cohen, the singer and actress who will appear at the Ballroom Thursdays through Saturdays at 11 P.M. through January, and is substituting for Helen Schneider tonight and tomorrow at 9. Ms. Cohen, who has stayed away from cabaret for the last seven years, was one of the most popular cult figures in the mid-70's cabaret revival. In those days, she was best known for her rendingly emotional interpretations of Janis Ian's ''At Seventeen,'' which she is singing in this engagement, and a medley of ''Be a Clown'' and ''Send In the Clowns,'' which she is not. The red-haired singer, who moved to New York from Baltimore in 1973, was near the peak of her popularity when she suddenly stopped performing in clubs at the end of the 70's. ''I stopped when my mama died,'' she explained in an interview the other day. ''My father had died earlier, and I felt as though the whole world kind of toppled over. I no longer wanted to sing. I had also gotten too caught up in the glitter and the glitz and waiting for a golden coach to arrive. I needed some time for cleansing and reassessment.'' Songs as Miniature Plays Ms. Cohen, who had always treated songs as miniature three-act plays, turned from cabaret to acting. Norman Lear, who had discovered her at Reno Sweeney, flew her to Hollywood, where she starred in an episode of his series ''Good Times.'' Then she waited while he developed a pilot for her, but it failed to go into production. Since returning to the East Coast, Ms. Cohen has worked quite steadily in the theater (''The Bald Soprano,'' directed by Joseph Chaikin, the Jewish Repertory Theater's ''Sophie,'' ''The Rise of David Levinsky,'' and the Goodspeed Opera House revival of ''The Boys From Syracuse,'' among other shows) and in movies like Woody Allen's ''Stardust Memories.'' With Gabriel Barre, she has also begun work on a two-character musical about a marriage, ''Color Outside the Lines.'' Some of the songs in Ms. Cohen's act are interpreted from the point of view of eccentric characters she has invented. Nancy, the character who sings ''At Seventeen,'' is a bag lady who fantasizes being a ballerina. Blanche, who was inspired by Tennessee Williams's Blanche DuBois, dramatizes the June Christy pop-jazz standard ''Something Cool.'' Another character, a German prostitute with a bubblegum fetish, sings ''The Teddy Bear's Picnic'' and the Brecht-Weill ''Barbara Song.'' ''I'm a little frightened about coming back to cabaret, because it's been so long since I stood up and sang, and because cabaret is so different now,'' Ms. Cohen said. ''It's not nearly as innocent as it used to be. But it seems to me that especially in these times with AIDS and everything else that is happening, we need a cabaret resurgence. We need places to go where we can talk and relate to one another and let out our feelings.'' In cabarets this weekend, one can also see musicians who scored significant personal triumphs in clubs during the last two years returning with new shows. At Michael's Pub, Walt Levinsky, an arranger, conductor and clarinetist whose tribute to Benny Goodman was one of the most successful club acts last fall, has expanded his scope. Leading his Great American Swing Band, a 14-piece all-star orchestra made up entirely of big band alumni, he is paying tribute to the bands of nine different leaders: Benny Goodman, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Tommy Dorsey, Artie Shaw, Woody Herman, Harry James, Gene Krupa and Les Brown. From a Revue to Sondheim Helen Schneider, whose one-woman revue of 1920's songs, ''A Flapper's Folly,'' was a hit at the Ballroom a year and a half ago, returned to the club in its prime-time 9 P.M. slot earlier this week with an all-Sondheim program. The engagement was temporarily interrupted because of illness yesterday, but she is expected to return on Tuesday. Since Ms. Schneider's last club appearance, she starred as Sally Bowles in a critically acclaimed production of ''Cabaret'' in West Berlin. ''I discovered Sondheim doing a production of the revue 'Side by Side by Sondheim' in Miami last winter,'' Ms. Schneider said the other day. ''I was overwhelmed by the wealth of material. His lyrics excite me because they are so clever and rich and deep. In picking my favorite songs, I stayed away from those that might require my singing to sound more 'legit' than I feel comfortable being. I also stayed away from songs like 'Ladies Who Lunch' and 'I'm Still Here' that are better suited to older singers.'' Joining Ms. Schneider for a section of songs about marriage is David Carroll, who recently appeared in the York Theater revival of ''Company.'' Ruth Brown, who is appearing at Sweetwaters tonight and tomorrow, also scored a personal triumph, in the recent Off Broadway musical ''Staggerlee.'' Now in her late 50's, the great rhythm-and-blues singer whose blunt, powerful delivery helped bridge blues shouting and rock-and-roll, is in excellent voice and possibly the most solid pop-soul singer of her generation. Margaret Whiting, who is in her second engagement at the Oak Room of the Algonquin Hotel singing a program that features some Irving Berlin rarities, is also one of the reliably powerful longtime cabaret artists. Her perfect diction, trumpetlike power and respect for songwriting are unassailable. At the Cafe Carlyle, George Shearing, the master of pianistic suavity, has just begun a winter sojourn that extends to the end of March. 'Flora' and 30's Jazz The Vineyard Theater is complementing its successful, small-scale production of the Kander and Ebb show ''Flora, the Red Menace,'' which is set in New York in the mid-30's, with three Sunday afternoons of Depression-era jazz. The first program, this Sunday, ''Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?,'' concentrates on music from 1930-31 and features the singers Barbara Lea and Nik Munson and a five-piece ensemble that includes Dick Sudhalter (trumpet), Bobby Pring (trombone), Keith Igham (piano), John Goldsby (bass) and Eddie Locke (drums). Two zany revues of very different stripe can also be seen this weekend in New York clubs. Jeff and Julie Olmsted's ''New Age Blues Revue'' at Don't Tell Mama, which plays Fridays through January, satirizes the new-age movement of gurus, psychics and life-transforming weekend retreats. John Epperson's drag farce ''Ballet of the Dolls,'' which plays tonight and tomorrow at the Club at La Mama, sends up Jacqueline Susann's novel ''Valley of the Dolls.'' Its dramatis personae includes characters named Susan Wayward and Tony LaBinaca, with Mr. Epperson impersonating Miss Susann.

1130-> Gephardt Received 2 Unsecured Loans
Representative Richard A. Gephardt's Presidential campaign and political action committee received unusual, unsecured loans totaling $200,000 in 1986 and 1987 from two banks whose top officers now hold key positions on Mr. Gephardt's campaign. Such unsecured political loans are rare. Even campaigns with collateral can have a hard time obtaining loans because they have no sure source of future income and campaigns have reputations for amassing large debts. Federal election laws state that loans to political committees must be made ''in the ordinary course of business.'' Interest Rates in Line The interest rates on the two loans to the Gephardt campaign were in line with the rates on commercial loans at the time. But officials from several other banks and lawyers who specialize in campaign finance said that the loans might have violated Federal election laws because it was unlikely they would have been made had it not been for the ties to the campaign of the two bank officers. Gephardt campaign officials said the loans were perfectly legitimate and that most of the money had been paid off. They said it was common and perfectly legal for campaigns to borrow money from banks operated by political supporters. A $125,000 loan to the Gephardt campaign was made in August by the Federal City National Bank here, whose current chairman, Terence R. McAuliffe, was on the bank's board at the time of the loan and is the campaign's national finance chairman. Mr. McAulifee, who continues to be the chief fund-raiser for the Gephardt campaign, said today that he abstained from voting on the loan. A loan of $75,000 was made in June 1986 to Gephardt's political action committee, the Effective Government Committee, by the Landmark Bank of St. Louis. The bank's parent is the Landmark Bancshares Corporation, whose chairman is S. Lee Kling, who is now the treasurer of the Gephardt campaign and has long been active in raising funds for Mr. Gephardt's campaigns. Mr. Kling said today that he did not vote on the loan because as chief executive officer he does not take part in decisions by the loan committee. As a result of the two loans, Mr. Gephardt could phave received a financial advantage over any rival who was unable to obtain unsecured loans early in the campaign. Most Campaign Loans Secured Most loans to Presidential campaigns are secured by the Federal Election Commission's guarantees of public matching subsidies, which are distributed beginning in January of the election year. Herbert E. Alexander of the University of Southern California, a leading authority on campaign finance, said: ''The law talks about prudent business decisions. It might not be a prudent business decision to make a loan in those circumstances and therefore it may be considered a contribution. The fact that the chairman and the treasurer are both bankers looks a little bit incestuous to say the least.'' Both the Presidential campaign and political action committee of Mr. Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, listed the loans as not secured in filings with the Federal Election Commission. Mr. McAuliffe said his bank never granted unsecured loans to campaigns ''unless they are backed 100 percent by matching funds.'' Asked why the bank made such a loan to the Gephardt campaign, he said that another Washington had told the Federal City Bank that it would advance the money for the loan. He said his bank had a letter from the other bank ''that they had approved the loan,'' 'As Good as Secured' ''From our bank's perspective, the loan was as good as secured,'' he said. Asked why his bank went to another bank for the money, he said: ''This goes on all the time in the banking business.'' Asked why another bank would grant an unsecured loan on behalf of his bank, he said, ''I thought they were crazy to do it in the first place.'' But Mr. McAuliffe said the other bank reneged on its pledge. He said the bank apparently had second thoughts on loaning money to a campaign that did not have adequate collateral. Neither Mr. McAuliffe nor John Duffy, Federal City's senior loan officer, would furnish the letter or disclose the name of the bank they said had initially pledged to make the loan. The campaign paid off $35,000 of the Federal City loan a month after it was granted, which was 19 days after it was officially due. The campaign then combined the remaining $90,000 debt with a $1.4 million loan from the bank that was secured with matching fund guarantees. Mr. McAuliffe said the full loan was retired last month. One person familiar with Federal City's transactions said the bank, which by law cannot make a loan of more than $400,000 without the help of another bank, made the $1.4 million loan to the Gephardt campaign before it found another bank to help with financing. Mr. McAuliffe denied this. Such an action could violate Federal banking regulations. Thirteen percent of all the outstanding loans at Federal City, a small bank that was established in 1986, are not secured, according to Mr. Duffy. Guarantors for $75,000 Loan Mr. Kling, whose St. Louis bank made the unsecured $75,000 loan to Gephardt's political action committee in 1986, said it was not unusual because 13 guarantors pledged to pay the loan if the committee could not. Even with guarantors, several bankers and lawyers said such a loan was not as solid as a secured loan. Loans to political action committees are more risky than to campaigns because the committees have less guarantee of future income, they said. ''PAC's almost have no ability to have future business of any size,'' said William C. Oldaker, an election lawyer who sits on two bank boards. Mr. Gephardt's political action committee was useful in helping the lawmaker build support before he formed his Presidential committee. Officials of the PAC had said they planned to close the committee last year. But the committee has stayed in existence because of debts totalling $32,108 as of the end of 1987, including $10,500 owed to Mr. Kling's bank.

1131-> Cuomo Broke Budget Surplus Agreement, G.O.P. Senators Charge
State Senate Republicans said today that the state's budget surplus was almost $300 million higher than Governor Cuomo has estimated. They accused the Governor of having spent most of the difference on routine state operating expenses instead of putting the money, as agreed, into a special capital fund for roads and housing. The first deputy director of the Governor's budget office, Peter D. Lynch, said the charges were ''simply not true.'' The exchange marked the first round in what has become an annual battle between the Governor and the Legislature over how much money the state has to spend. The Republican-controlled Senate has frequently accused the Governor of purposefully underestimating revenues so that he could use the extra money as he wished. This year, because of the specially created capital fund, the battle over revenue figures is likely to be a particularly protracted one. Surge in Tax Refunds The fund, officially known as the Infrastructure Trust Fund, was established last spring under an agreement between the Legislature and the Governor. It is supposed to contain surplus tax revenues that the state collected as a result of the change in the Federal tax code during the current fiscal year, which ends April 1. At the time the fund was created, Mr. Cuomo estimated that it would total $850 million. But when the Governor presented his budget proposal to the Legislature earlier this month, he revised this estimate to $670 million. He attributed the downward revision to a sudden surge in tax refunds paid by the state. Senate Republicans said today, however, that if the Governor had not used some of the money earmarked for the fund, it would have already reached almost $950 million. Mr. Cuomo, they charged, has used almost $250 million to pay for extra state spending in the current fiscal year on such items as Medicaid and mental health programs. 'Budget Manipulation' The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, John J. Marchi, a Staten Island Republican, said his staff's analysis of the Governor's budget showed ''an olympic performance in executive budget manipulation designed to disguise true spending.'' Mr. Lynch, the state budget official, said that while the Senate's analysis appeared credible, it was not. The figure his office submitted for the surplus, he said, is ''accurate.'' Mr. Lynch added that the Senate's chief fiscal analyst, Eugene K. Tyksinski, ''gets an A for math, but I guess he gets an F for facts.''

1133-> Trash Disposal Problem Besieging Philadelphia
Much like last year's unhappy garbage barge from Islip, L.I., two cargo ships are plying the high seas somewhere today, presumably in the Caribbean, laden with ash from this city's trash incinerators and looking for somewhere to dump it. Back in Philadelphia, meanwhile, angry, fearful residents have confronted Mayor W. Wilson Goode and the City Council over Mr. Goode's stated determination to eliminate the city's waste disposal problem by building a plant that would burn trash to create steam and make electricity. Cheering and jeering one recent morning, more than 50 opponents of the project carried signs into City Hall reading, ''Trash-to-Steam Kills,'' ''Cancer From Burning,'' and ''Please, Wilson, Don't Kill Me.'' Perhaps more than any other big city, Philadelphia is deeply and emotionally embroiled in what has emerged as one of the most serious and frustrating difficulties faced by local governments today, particularly in the Northeast: what to do with urban refuse at a time when landfills are rapidly nearing capacity and concern about the toxicity of incinerator ash and emissions is rising. Test of the Mayor's Strength Soon, possibly next week, Mr. Goode's proposal to build the trash-to-steam plant at the Philadelphia Navy Yard in South Philadelphia is to be introduced in the City Council. Political analysts see the coming legislative struggle not only as critical in its own right but also as a major test of the Mayor's strength and leadership as he begins a new four-year term. ''It would weaken him'' if he lost that struggle, said Sandra Featherman, a political scientist at Temple University here. Early in his first term, Mr. Goode gave up the fight for the project in the face of intense opposition from South Philadelphia and as a result was severely criticized in the business community for what was perceived as weakness. Mr. Goode's re-election and the election last November of four new members to the 17-member City Council are seen as strengthening his hand this time around, however, and both the Mayor and a number of analysts believe that the nine votes required to push the project through can be found. Not in My Backyard The problem of trash disposal here provides a classic not-in-my-backyard scenario. As the landfills on which Philadelphia once relied for disposal of both raw trash and incinerator ash have closed or been denied to the city for other reasons, it has had to look for other solutions. One solution has entailed the long-distance transporting of trash and ash by private haulers. Mostly as a result, trash-disposal costs have more than tripled since 1981, from $20 million to $70 million. And over the last three years, distant landfills in Virginia, Ohio, South Carolina, Georgia and West Virginia, needing their diminishing space for local use, have begun refusing access to the Philadelphia haulers at any price. In recent days, officials in Houston have denounced a plan to ship tons of Philadelphia trash to that city. Meanwhile, the contractors hired by Philadelphia to dispose of incinerator ash have taken to the high seas. A few days ago, Haitian Government officials said that the cargo ship Khian Sea had dumped 4,000 tons of its 14,000-ton load of Philadelphia incinerator ash on a Haitian beach. The ship was forced to leave after being barred from unloading any more ash. The Khian Sea has been trying to find a place to unload its cargo for 17 months, far longer than the two-month voyage last spring of a barge from Islip, L.I., that was carrying garbage from the New York area. City officials here say that the ash was turned over to a private hauler with the understanding that it would be disposed of legally and safely. The city is now withholding payment to the contractor. Another Ship Sets Sail Last week it was disclosed that a second ship, called the Bark, acting for a second private hauler, had left Philadelphia with another 14,000 tons of ash, also apparently bound for Haiti. Originally the ash was to be disposed of in Panama, but Panamanian officials backed out after Greenpeace, the environmental activist organization, had told them that the ash contained toxic substances. The city has canceled its contract with this private hauler on grounds of nonperformance. The contractors involved have declined comment, and the current location of both ships is not publicly known. Greenpeace has been closely scrutinizing the situation and considers Philadelphia a prime example not only of cities' steadily worsening trash problem but also of what the organization sees as a trend toward the exporting of American waste to the third world. ''Philadelphia is on the front line,'' said Neville Williams, a Greenpeace spokesman. Two Approaches in Philadelphia The Goode administration is advancing two main strategies. One is recycling. By 1990, under an ordinance passed by the Council last spring, the city is to recycle 50 percent of its trash. But city officials say that, in a pilot program, poor collections and a lack of up-to-date equipment have produced only a 20 percent recycling rate and that the citywide program will not start on schedule. The second strategy is trash-to-steam. Mayor Goode says that a panel of medical experts he appointed has determined that the health effect of emissions from the proposed plant would be equal to ''one person smoking two cigarettes or drinking two Diet Cokes in a lifetime.'' The opponents here are not convinced, and opponents of incinerators elsewhere have charged that incinerator smoke can carry cancer-causing dioxins. Beyond that, serious questions have been raised about the toxicity of ashes from both conventional incinerators and trash-to-steam plants. Last week the Federal Environmental Protection Agency disclosed that high dioxin levels had been found near one of the city's temporary dumps for incinerator ash. The measurement was not considered definitive, and a more detailed analysis is proceeding. Opponents also say that incinerator technology is still developing and that it is unclear just what safety rules are required for trash-to-steam, or ''mass burn,'' plants. The critics have also raised questions about such plants' costs, which for Philadelphia has been estimated at $350 million.

1134-> Federated, Campeau Near Deal
Federated Department Stores Inc. and the Campeau Corporation yesterday moved close to a $6.3 billion merger that would be the biggest ever in American retailing. In a joint statement, the two companies said they were holding talks on a sweetened, $68-a-share takeover offer that Campeau presented at a Federated board meeting Thursday afternoon. The new bid by the Canadian developer would result in a total price almost $1 billion higher than its earlier $66-a-share offer, twice spurned by Federated. Campeau's presentation to the Federated board capped a month of hostile relations between the companies. Robert Campeau, chairman of Campeau and of a subsidiary, the Allied Stores Corporation, was in West Germany but conferred by telephone with his agents at the meeting. Authorization to Proceed Afterward, Federated's board authorized the company's management to proceed with talks on a full merger accord and submit it to the board on Monday. Two Campeau advisers, the First Boston Corporation and the new firm of Wasserstein, Perella & Company, will prepare documents for the merger over the weekend. A First Boston executive said that one matter to be ironed out by the two sides was whether the takeover would be accomplished through a full merger, at $68 a share, or an equivalent price for Campeau's tender offer, which is currently $66 a share and which expires March 9. In their joint statement, both Federated and Campeau cautioned that there was ''no assurance'' that a definitive agreement would be reached. But the consensus of retailers, analysts and arbitragers was that Campeau's acquisition of Federated, the nation's largest chain of department stores, was virtually a reality. Some analysts said they believed that only details regarding the financing remained to be worked out. Stock Closes at $64.50 Yesterday's trading activity in Federated's common stock did not reflect the new, higher offer. The shares rose $1.375, to $64.50, in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. A merger of the companies would have a pronounced effect on the New York retail market. Two Federated divisions, Bloomingdale's and Abraham & Straus, represent the largest combination in sales in the market, although R. H. Macy & Company, which is now privately held, is the biggest single retailer. All three have their main or flagship stores in New York and operate branches in the other boroughs and suburbs, as well as in other regions of the country. The two Federated divisions have valuable real estate that might be affected by a merger - possibly by the conversion of one or more stores to multiple-use buildings. Campeau, a development company, was joined in its quest for Federated by two other developers, the Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation and Olympia & York Developments. The long-term lease on the Bloomingdale's store at Lexington Avenue and 59th Street was renewed several years ago. Abraham & Straus is due to open its first Manhattan store in the fall in the old Gimbels building at Herald Square, but this plan might be held up under Campeau's ownership. Federated, which also has several Filene's Basement stores in the New York area, operates 19 other store divisions, most of them dominant in their markets. Such recent transactions among retailers as the leveraged buyout of R. H. Macy and the merger of the May Department Store Company and the Associated Dry Goods Corporation have involved sums of $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion. Some retailing experts expressed surprise yesterday at the lack of a competing offer for Federated. But some, noting that there were some disappointed contenders, said another bidder might emerge over the weekend with a higher offer - perhaps $69 or $70 a share - timed for Monday's Federated board meeting. Among the names mentioned were Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, the investment banking firm that specializes in leveraged buyouts; the May Department Stores Company; the Limited Inc., and a group consisting of Dillard Department Stores, the Pritzker family of Chicago and two prominent shopping center developers, Melvin Simon & Associates and the Taubman Company. However, most experts largely discounted the likelihood of higher bids. ''It's a done deal,'' said Robert M. Raiff, managing director of research for C. J. Lawrence Inc. in New York. ''It was essentially a fight among the developers, with the Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation and Olympia & York Developments taking the lead by joining with Campeau in providing equity.'' William N. Smith, an analyst in New York with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, said: ''It's all over. The joint announcement has to mean an agreement in principle. The only thing left for the negotiators is to work out the financing.'' The apparent agreement in principle also means that Campeau's arrangement to sell Allied's Brooks Brothers division to Marks & Spencer P.L.C. would become effective, giving Campeau about $770 million. Divestitures Predicted But predictions were already being made that many Federated divisions would be divested if Campeau is ultimately successful. These might include Abraham & Straus, Ralphs Supermarkets, I. Magnin, the Gold Circle discount stores, the MainStreet apparel chain and the Children's Place stores. Since acquiring Allied in December 1986, Campeau has divested 16 of Allied's 24 store divisions, a record that seemed to worry several merchants who would comment only if they were not identified. Knowing Campeau's history, executives at both Bloomingdale's and Abraham & Straus apparently reacted sharply to the disclosure of the negotiations between Campeau and Federated, which is often referred to as ''the class act'' in retailing because of its prestigious divisions. ''What seemed the most unlikely possibility now seems a most likely probability,'' one merchant said. One of New York's leading executive recruiters said that for weeks he had been receiving distress calls from executives of Federated divisions seeking job opportunities. ''Yesterday there were more,'' he said.

1135-> 2 Arabs Killed in Clashes on West Bank
Israeli security forces shot and killed two Palestinians, one of them a 12-year-old boy, in another day of protests today. The shootings raised the death toll to at least 61 Palestinians in the 10 weeks of what Arabs are calling ''the uprising.'' The violence on the West Bank today occurred as 2,000 more policemen moved into Jerusalem in anticipation of the visit next week of Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who is to bring another American peace initiative. A leaflet from the Palestinian underground leadership called for demonstrations against what it termed Mr. Shultz's ''conspiratorial plans against our people.'' Bombs Thrown at U.S. Consulate Tonight, two firebombs were thrown at the American Consulate in Arab East Jerusalem, causing no injuries or serious damage. The two Palestinians killed were Abdullah Attah, 20 years old, who was shot in Ramallah, and Nassarallah Abdul Qadr, 12 years old, who died in a clash in the Tulkarm refugee center. In the village of Bani Naim, near Hebron, old women in traditional embroidered peasant dresses broke up rocks and passed them to young men, their faces covered by Arab headdresses, to throw at the army. Soldiers opened fire, wounding four. Soldiers also fired at protesters in the village of Tubas. The Ittahad Hospital in Nablus reported receiving 10 gunshot cases. No further information was immediately available on the death of the 12-year-old at Tulkarm. Another 10-year old boy was also wounded in the chest. The army's information center was not answering its telephone numbers tonight. Struggle Over Body The bitterness that the clashes have engendered developed into fight over the body of Mr. Attah, who was killed when the top of his head was blown off by a member of the paramilitary border police. The young man was shot after stones were thrown as a jeep of the border police rounded a corner near the mosque in the narrow streets of the old city in Ramallah, where there had been scattered protests. Several Palestinian witnesses, interviewed independently, said a policeman in the jeep shot Mr. Attah in the head with a rifle from about 10 feet away. The army said tonight that the shooting took place when the policeman was hit with a stone and fell as he was preparing to fire a warning shot in the air. An 80-year old woman, Lulu Mahmoud, who had been sitting in the alleyway, said she saw the killing. ''I saw him fall,'' she said. ''I saw the blood and brain coming out of his head.'' Clash Moves to Hospital The clash moved swiftly to the Ramallah hospital, to which residents rushed the dead man in a car. Palestinian youths put up roadblocks on the surrounding streets and threw stones to keep soldiers from the hospital. Two tear gas canisters were fired by soldiers into the hospital's maternity ward, doctors said, but five women and their babies had been removed minutes earlier because gas fired outside was seeping in the windows. A convoy of cars was organized to take the body from the hospital for burial at the man's village, Kafr Nimah, 15 miles west of Ramallah. When someone is killed during the protests, the army's usual practice is to perform an autopsy and return the body to the family late at night, allowing only a few relatives at an immediate funeral to prevent demonstrations. The Palestinians prefer an emotional celebration of ''martyrdom.'' Their tradition also holds that a martyr should be buried unwashed and in the clothing in which he died. By the time the soldiers stormed the hospital the body was gone. Another young man who was brought to the hospital with a bullet wound also escaped, Palestinians said. Mohammed Attah told journalists outside the hospital before his brother's body was removed, ''I am proud because my brother was shot on Palestinian soil as a good patriot.''

1137-> SPORTS PEOPLE; New Pact for Parcells
A lot has changed since Coach Bill Parcells led the Giants to victory in the 1987 Super Bowl and then made a handshake deal with the general manager, George Young, on a contract extension. There was a sharp drop in the team's fortunes to a 6-9 record last season. Despite that, one thing that has apparently not changed is the club's confidence in Parcells, whose former contract ran through the 1988 season. Yesterday, he signed the four-year extension. It will pay him an estimated $3.2 million and keep him with the Giants through the 1991 season. Parcells, who has a 47-38-1 record with three playoff berths in five seasons with the Giants, delayed the signing because of tax considerations.

1139-> Drug Smugglers Used Cuban Base For U.S. Shipment, Jury Charges
Two Federal indictments unsealed today charge 17 people with smuggling Colombian cocaine into Florida through a Cuban military base. A Federal drug official said the operation apparently had official cooperation in Cuba. ''This does not make a statement that the Cuban Government has an official policy of assisting drug traffickers,'' said the Federal official, Jack Hook, a spokesman for the Drug Enforcement Administration. ''What it does say is that when a drug-trafficking private light aircraft lands on a military base in Cuba and the cocaine is offloaded and placed onto boats destined for the U.S., it is quite clear that somebody on that base in an official capacity is involved.'' The indictments, returned by a grand jury here, make no mention of official Cuban involvement, said Ana Barnett, a spokeswoman for the United States Attorney's office here. #3,800 Pound of Cocaine One indictment charges five people with being part of the smuggling ring and the other charges 12. Mr. Hook said nine of those charged had been arrested. The indictments described four loads of cocaine totaling 3,800 pounds. Two came through Cuba in April and May, one through Haiti in October and one through the Bahamas. The date of the Bahamas shipment was not available. ''This does not indict or name or allegedly name any Cuban officials,'' Mr. Hook said. ''But it is significant in proving that Cuba is most definitely being used as a trans-shipment point for Colombian cocaine destined for the United States.'' Mr. Hook said he had no information on how far that involvement went in the Cuban Government. One of those arrested told an informant that he could arrange Cuban Coast Guard escorts for drug boats leaving Cuban waters for Florida, Mr. Hook said. The Cuban leader Fidel Castro, in an interview with NBC-TV that was broadcast Thursday, denied any knowledge of drug smuggling in Cuba. Mr. Hook said the indictment showed that Cuba, even with its strict security, was as susceptible to drug trafficking as other Caribbean nations. The indictments represented at least the third time in the last six months that Federal grand juries in Miami have cited Cuban involvement in cocaine trafficking. In October, the police broke up a ring that reportedly smuggled drugs into the United States through Cuba and other Caribbean islands. Federal officials said at that time that there was no evidence of Cuban Government involvement. Earlier this month, an indictment here of Panama's principal leader, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, said that Mr. Castro was aware of Mr. Noriega's drug activities.

1140-> City in Rhode Island Proposes New Rules On Guests at Hotels
A proposed city ordinance to require people checking into hotels, motels and inns to show an identification card bearing a photograph is being supported by local officials, but criticized by hotel industry organizations. City Councilman C. Kenneth Wild said he proposed the ordinance last month after the deaths of two women in a Warwick hotel and motel. ''Our problem is not the 95 percent of the people who check into the hotel using a VISA, MasterCard or American Express,'' Mr. Wild said. ''The problem we've got is with the 5 percent who walk in, slap $50 on the counter, give a name, an address and check into the hotel. ''The incidents brought to mind the importance of a hotel having accurate records,'' at least for medical or other emergencies. The ordinance would also help hotel management to catch vandals, Mr. Wild said. But he said his main concern was to prevent any more deaths in the 11 hotels, motels and inns in Warwick. Feb.16 Vote Set The proposal will get the first of two required Council votes Feb. 16. Mr. Wild said the proposal had the backing of hotels in Warwick, the Warwick Chamber of Commerce and the Chief of PoLice. A woman was found Jan. 2 stuffed in a luggage bench at the Holiday Inn at the Crossings. The state medical examiner said she had been strangled up to a week before her body was found. She was not identified until Jan. 13 because her mother thought she was with relatives, the authorities said. ''The girl who died was not the person who checked in,'' Mr. Wild said. On Jan. 17, a woman was found on a bathroom floor at the Howard Johnson Motor Lodge. An assistant medical examiner said she drowned. Mr. Wild said both places checked identification. In the Howard Johnson's case, the police ''were able to find out who was in the room'' through a driver's license, Mr. Wild said. David W. Balfour, the executive director of the 200-member Rhode Island Hospitality Association, said identification cards with photographs were a good idea, but the ordinance was unnecessary. ''I can't speak for the little mom-and-pop operations,'' he said, but most major hotels ''will always ask you for some type of ID.'' Sam Schorr, resident manager at the Omni Biltmore in Providence, thinks the proposal makes sense. Except for a few frequent patrons, ''We require identification from every guest who checks in,'' including photo ID.'s, he said. Other industry officials are skeptical. ''What purpose would it serve?'' asked Sheila Schofield, a vice president of Hospitality Group in Boston, a hotel management company that owns eight hotels in New England. ''It sounds like a lot of small town activity in the wrong direction.'' She suggested that Warwick hire more police officers. ''You almost have to take in anybody who has the ability to pay,'' said Bob Ramsey, vice president of the Virginia Hotel-Motel Association in Richmond. Vicki Passarelli, an executive with the American Hotel and Motel Association in New York, said, it was ''almost discriminatory'' to ask for identification. ''

1141-> COLLEGE BASKETBALL: BIG EAST; UCONN TOPPLES GEORGETOWN
Cliff Robinson scored 16 points and blocked 9 shots to lead Connecticut over Georgetown tonight, 66-59. Playing before the largest crowd ever to see a college game in New England, 16,016, the Huskies withstood a second-half Hoya surge that erased a 12-point lead. Georgetown took a 52-51 lead on a jump shot by Mark Tillmon with 4 minutes 47 seconds left, but Robinson scored and Phil Gamble followed with a 3-point basket to get Connecticut back in front. Connecticut made eight straight free throws in the final 1:23 to clinch the victory, their first over Georgetown since January 1982. The Huskies, 11-8 over all and 3-7 in the Big East, trailed by 18-9 in the early moments, but scored 12 straight points and took a 34-33 halftime lead. Connecticut outscored Georgetown by 13-2 in the opening minutes of the second half before the Hoyas rallied. Willie McCloud added 13 points and Gamble 11 for Connecticut. Tillmon had 19 points for Georgetown, 14-6 over all and 4-5 in the Big East. Villanova 66 Boston College 54 BOSTON (AP) - Tom Greis scored 16 points and Kenny Wilson added 15 for Villanova (16-6, 8-4). Dana Barros led the Eagles (12-9, 3-7) with 17 points. Greis scored 10 points in the first nine and a half minutes of the second half and led the Wildcats to a 52-40 lead with 7:24 remaining. But Barros hit a jumper and Steve Benton scored two fastbreak baskets to pull Boston College within 52-46 with 4:37 left. Gary Massey then ended the Eagles' run with two resounding dunks within 17 seconds to give Villanova a 56-46 lead with 4:12 left. Seton Hall 68, Providence 54 PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) - Mark Bryant scored 20 points for Seton Hall (15-9, 4-6). The Pirates broke the game open with 11 straight points early in the second half to take a 44-36 lead. After that, Providence (9-11, 3-6) never came closer than 5 points. Seton Hall also received 17 points from Nick Katsikas, who sank five of six 3-pointers, and 11 points from Ramon Ramos, in winning consecutive Big East road games for the first time. The Pirates won at Connecticut on Tuesday night.

1143-> '88 WINTER OLYMPICS; Tomba Moves Into Spotlight
The Swiss bickered among themselves. The skiers, in general, complained about the wind and lack of snow. The ticket-holders arrived at this winter resort about 65 miles west of Calgary, not knowing whether they would see a race, much less which one. Still, nothing that happened during the first week of the Alpine events here at Mount Allan has caused as big a stir as Alberto Tomba of Italy is likely to when he begins competing Sunday. Tomba La Bomba (the Bomb) is his nickname. The 21-year-old slalom specialist emerged as one of the top skiers in the world this season and perhaps the sport's most engaging personality. Tomba has won seven races in slalom and giant slalom thus far in World Cup racing and is second in overall points with 213, only 6 behind Pirmin Zurbriggen of Switzerland. He is 6 feet 1 inches and 185 pounds, a powerful skier who says he thinks he may intimidate the competition. As close as they are in the rankings, which are not affected by the Olympics, no two skiers could be more different than Tomba and Zurbriggen, who will duel in the super giant slalom on Sunday. The Swiss skier is always in training. Tomba must be encouraged to work. ''It's easier to coach Zurbriggen,'' said Josef Messner, one of the Italian coaches. ''Alberto, I can't always tell him what to do.'' Good Chance for 2 Golds The super giant slalom is a hybrid race that is essentially a downhill with more gates. Zurbriggen is expected to win the gold medal. Tomba has a good chance, though, to win the gold medals in the giant slalom and slalom later next week. Messner said he has had trouble keeping Tomba's mind on his business during the first week of the Olympics. ''Here, it has not been easy,'' Messner said. ''We are in one hotel in the mountains. And Tomba likes to go out at night. We told him that after every race, he can visit Calgary for one day and one night.'' Tomba has set modest goals here, hoping to win one medal. No matter how he fares, it is unlikely to affect his outlook on life. ''A champion,'' he said, ''must be able to win and he must be able to lose.''

1145-> Practical Traveler; Getting to the Airport
WHEN friends came home from Greece, they had made no plans for getting out of Kennedy International Airport and traveling home to the suburbs in Bergen County, N.J. They piled into a metered medallion cab and across New York City they went, over two bridges and home to the tune of $100, including the tip. ''We were just jet lagged out and, after all, we were still on vacation,'' one of the friends said. They knew the economy public transit route: the J.F.K. Express, which is a bus and then a subway to the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan ($6.50 a person), then a suburban bus to New Jersey ($2.85 each). No tips, total cost for two: $18.70. But they were in no frame of mind for this. If they had anticipated their fatigue on returning, the best choice for them as travelers with luggage would probably have been either a chauffeured car, ordered in advance from home, which would have cost $58.50 to their doorstep, or a local taxi ordered from home at $57, both prices including tolls. There would also be a tip of $12 or so for either, putting these choices in the $70 bracket. That would be $50 more than the cheapest choice, or $30 less than their mad taxi trip, depending on whether you take a half-empty or half-full view of quantities. Strangers at an airport faced with a similar problem may find the $100 cost a severe dent in their travel budget, or they may meet an unscrupulous driver and be even worse off. As airports have multiplied and moved farther from downtowns, the question of how to get out of the airport, or more specifically, how to get where you're going, has become harder to answer. Some cities still leave it to you to grapple with choices, public or piratical. But transit agencies are increasingly developing leaflets and wall charts to guide visitors, using colors to define routes and symbols for buses and jitneys. I grab such guides off the racks wherever I see them. Massport and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey have both been on the job. Massport's guide to the Boston airport, ''Logan Airport Ground Transportation,'' a leaflet revised last fall, gives information on the subway's Blue Line, the water shuttle to Rowes Wharf downtown, and buses and limousines into Boston and to much of New England. It also includes a colored diagram of the airport and a miniature map of the complete subway line, showing where it intersects rail lines. This leaflet, available at booths at the airport, gives a copious listing of phone numbers, including the Massport information number, 800-235-6426, which it renders as 800-23-LOGAN. A copy of this, and a schematic diagram of the five airline terminals, are available from Maynard Scarborough, Massport, 10 Park Plaza, Boston, Mass. 02116, or by calling the 800 number. In New York, the Port Authority, while not, alas, providing subway maps to arriving visitors, does offer getting-around-and-out guides to its three airports, La Guardia, Newark International and Kennedy. Prices are given for medallion cab service and for scheduled limousine runs, which provide a basis for negotiation with listed limousine companies. These guides are available at the airports and sometimes at such places as the 42d Street waiting room for the N.J. Transit bus to Newark from the Port Authority terminal. They may also be requested free from Public Services, Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Room 65N, 1 World Trade Center, New York, N.Y. 10048; 212-466-7503. Another local guide that is a favorite of mine is the two-sided map published by the Greater New Orleans Tourist and Convention Commission. When I went to New Orleans with a friend to scrub a family gravestone for All Saints' Day, we walked immediately to the information desk at the airport. We were given directions to the $7 Orleans Transportation limousine. ''How do you get to work?'' we asked the desk expert. ''Oh my, not for $7 you bet,'' she said, although with a nicer accent than I can render, and she marked the map for us. WE waited on the bench that she indicated and caught a $1.10 bus -she warned us that we needed exact change - to Elk Place, which flows off Basin Street, and then we walked three blocks and picked up the 60-cent Vieux Carre tourist bus, which left us at our hotel door. Because we were carrying a plastic bucket, we got some odd looks, but $7 would not have protected us from that. Failing a full collection of airport escape guides, I consider a $4.95 paperback book, ''How to Get From the Airport to the City All Around the World,'' to be one step behind comfortable shoes as a necessity for the air traveler. Sometimes referred to in the travel industry as ''Crampton's Guide,'' for its author, Norman Crampton, this book is finally, in its new, seventh, edition, going to go on sale where it should be: at airports. It gives the alternatives for getting out of 360 of them, prices and all. Mr. Crampton, who is not in the travel or writing business, began to collect airport information early in the 80's and published 5,000 copies of his guide in 1982. They sold out in six weeks. He pressed on with his basement publishing project, gathering information from readers and students. He sold the book by mail order from his home, and in a few bookstores. His biggest customers were travel agents who bought in bulk to give to their clients. ''Better than a calendar,'' Mr. Crampton said. This year, the New York publisher M. Evans & Company is putting the guide out in a clearer and more readable format. The first order is 50,000 copies, and the main sales points are to be airport bookstalls and kiosks as well as regular bookstores. The book is now 4 1/8 by 7 inches, larger than in its earlier versions, but handy. The airports are listed alphabetically, from Abidjan, Ivory Coast, to Zurich. International graphic symbols are used to set apart the entries on taxis, buses, vans, trains, helicopters, rental cars and parking. Prices are given to center city, which means that the section on Los Angeles, which has no center - or many - runs on a bit. Professionally, Mr. Crampton is secretary of the Institute for Solid Waste, a division of the American Public Works Association. He is, as I suspected, a fan of public transit. Transit agencies issue many of the free guides and, not surprisingly, favor public transit. For example, Massport says, ''Getting to or from Logan is easier when you leave your car at home and use another means of transportation.'' The New York port agency tells commuters, ''Don't drive yourself crazy commuting by car.'' Mr. Crampton gives the same message, couched in affirmative terms. His book doesn't always deal with the matter of handling luggage on public transit, but there are frequent pertinent notations. Of the Moscow subway, the book says: ''Moscow Metro is fast, comfortable, frequent, cheap and a celebration of Soviet architecture in marble and mosaic. Not if you are laden with luggage, however.'' Of the Orlybus in Paris, it says, ''Travelers with light luggage who know Paris will find this service a way to avoid possible traffic delays on the Air France bus to Invalides.'' I am not an authority on all 360 airports in the book, but the information is sound on those airports I have exited without benefit, as the old sailing books used to say, of local knowledge. The book has my favorite caper, the SamTrans 7B bus from San Francisco International. In the morning rush hour, this quickly - by New York standards - took me and all my luggage downtown to a corner a block from my destination for $1.25. You can't beat that, unless, as Mr. Crampton points out, you have no luggage to speak of and can ride the same route on the 7F express, which does not accept heavy luggage.

1146-> Dance: Peridance Offers Work Based on Folk Mass
Peridance is a company connected with a popular Manhattan dance school of the same name. And the program it presented on Wednesday at the Joyce Theater (175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street) suggested the virtues and problems of such an association. The dances were well-crafted and intelligent but timidly assertive. The dancers were well-trained and likeable but supremely modest. There is certainly nothing wrong with modesty, but artistic adventurousness was in short supply here. Miguel Valdez-Mor's new ''Misa Criolla,'' danced to a lilting folk mass composed by Ariel Ramirez, offered a stark solo and mysterious duet embedded in a lushly pretty group dance. In the solo, a man gradually rose from the earth, his long arms and upper torso stretching into the air in an image that suggested both the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ. Two women moved slowly across a darkened stage, alone together, almost groping their way. One, tall and sturdy, half-carried the other, a smaller and quavering woman. Mr. Valdez-Mor, who replaced the injured Silvio Facchin in the solo, has created a fluid, seamless ritual in ''Misa Criolla.'' It is a dance that is as vivid as the purple and red costumes worn by the dancers as they move in pulsating waves about the stage. And the dance received a strong performance from its cast, which also included Chantal Germain and Rulan Tangen in the duet, and June Balish, Inga Borg, Derrick Brown, Lynnette Chew, Nicky Fonte, Brigid Hoag, Nancy Hutchings, Tony Mei, Jane Elizabeth Pfaus, Keith-Derrick Randolph, Jose Seabra and Angela Vaillancourt. Mauke Cramm designed the costumes. ''Valses Poeticos,'' a recent work by Igal Perry, the company director, was a seamless little duet that never strayed far from the line and intent of its wistfully lyrical score by Enrique Granados. It was a charming dance, however, that had Ms. Hoag and Mr. Brown furling and unfurling at center stage, then moving farther afield for a little playful flirtation. ''Saudedes,'' by Graciela Kozak, was a dance that might have been made by a very neat and exacting carpenter. The planes all joined and intersected satisfyingly. But program notes suggested that the quartet, set to music by Nana Vasconcelos, had to do with loss and commemoration. There was a hint of this in the separation of Mr. Brown from a circle of women at the start of the dance, yet there was little emotional coloring in what Ms. Kozak gave her performers. And both ''Valses Poeticos'' and ''Saudedes'' suffered from too even dynamics. It seemed, in fact, that Ms. Kozak might have put the women in toe shoes simply to give them a chance to releve and interrupt the flow a little. The cast also included Ms. Balish, Ms. Hoag and Ms. Pfaus. Each of the choreographers is connected with the school. This may be the time for Peridance to begin to reach out for independent choreographers. It was sad, for example, to see so little stretching of a resilient dancer and engaging performer like Mr. Brown. The program was completed by Mr. Perry's ''Folk Songs.'' It replaced the scheduled ''Songs,'' also by Mr. Perry, because of Mr. Facchin's injury. Peridance performs in two programs through Sunday at the Joyce.

1147-> Review of Jersey City Police Is Joined by the State
The State Attorney General's office has joined a review of the Jersey City Police Department, which was rocked recently by the suicide of its chief and has been accused of racism and brutality by the city's Indian and Hispanic communities. The Attorney General, W. Cary Edwards, said that the resources of his office would be placed behind the review, which was requested by Mayor Anthony R. Cucci, and that all aspects of the department would be examined in an effort to improve its professionalism. ''This is an assistance program,'' Mr. Edwards said after a news conference this week. ''We're here to help. We're not here to investigate or to run the department or any of those kinds of things.'' On Monday Mr. Cucci, in an unusual move, named the Hudson County Prosecutor, Paul DePascale, acting director of the 893-member force. Recently Mr. Cucci asked Walter Adams, a 24-year veteran of the department, to relinquish his position as the appointed police director and named him chief, replacing John Fritz, who committed suicide on Feb. 7. The chief, the senior line officer in the department, reports to the director. Chief Fritz, who was under emotional strain because of family problems, left a note written on a police directive that had ordered him to work two nights a week; his note stated that the directive was ''harassment.'' 'There Is No Investigation' At the news conference, Mr. DePascale, who remains as County Prosecutor and serves as police director without compensation, emphasized that the department was not the subject of an investigation. ''There is no probe; there is no investigation,'' he said. ''There is no single overriding concern.'' He noted, however, that ''to assume that in an organization of this size it is problem-free is ludicrous.'' ''We are considering a total restructuring of the department,'' he said. Mr. Edwards said it was the state's responsibility to insure that the best police services are made available to the people. ''That is not to say that there is a claim that there is something wrong,'' Mr. Edwards said, ''or that I have found anything wrong with the Police Department in Jersey City nor that the Prosecutor specifically has. It is merely an attempt by the Mayor and the city government to make police services and delivery of those services as professional and as good as they can possibly be.'' The Attorney General said some changes can be expected in communications and dispatching of officers to crime scenes. Mr. DePascale, who has been asked to serve as police director for the next 90 days, said another area that would be looked into is the two-officer Internal Affairs Unit, which investigates charges of corruption, brutality and racism lodged against the police. ''Can two men adequately handle that department?'' he asked. Complaints of Insensitivity Members of the Hispanic community have repeatedly asserted that officers use undue force against members of their group. Many of the 15,000 members of the Indian community have called for increased police efforts to crack down on white youths attacking Indians. They said that officers were insensitive to their complaints and that calls for police assistance often went unheed. Several months ago, Mr. Cucci called in Patrick Murphy, a former New York City Police Commissioner, to make a management study of the department. He said that Mr. Murphy had now submitted a draft report but that this was not what had made him decide to ask for state help. Mr. Cucci said he had not yet studied the report. Dr. Lalitha Masson, who has been a vocal critic of police efforts at ending violence against the Indian community, applauded the state's role. ''I think it's a great idea,'' she said. ''I absolutely support it. Perhaps the state will find out where the irregularities lie.''

1148-> PRO HOCEKY; Devils Defeat Flyers Again
The Flyers are virtually assured one of the four playoff spots in the Patrick Division and the team they would probably like to avoid in the opening round is the Devils. The Flyers take pride in having certain records against teams in the league, especially within the Patrick Division, but there is one claim they can no longer make. The Devils defeated the Flyers, 6-5, at the Spectrum this afternoon to close the regular-season series with five victories and two ties against the Flyers. Frustrating Situation It is the first time since the inception of the Patrick Division in 1974 that the Flyers have gone through a season without defeating a team within the division at least once. ''It's really frustrating to play against them,'' Scott Mellanby of the Flyers said about the Devils. ''They have guys who are always on your face, and break up your concentration. They also have guys who don't mind getting hit.'' The Devils got hit time and again, but they seemed to match the hard checking of the Flyers, who suffered their fourth loss in the last five games, but still have 35-26-7 record for 77 points. Tom Kurvers had two goals for the Devils. Pat Verbeek, Jack O'Callahan, Mark Johnson and Claude Loiselle also scored goals for the Devils (31-35-5), who have 67 points, the most in their history. Goal on Penalty Shot The goal by Johnson came on a penalty shot and gave the Devils a 3-1 lead, which was extended to 6-3 early in the last period, with Loiselle getting what turned out to be the deciding goal against Ron Hextall, who made 20 saves. Sean Burke started in goal for the Devils and registered his third victory in three decisions since he joined the Devils from the Canadian Olympic team. He faced 27 shots and allowed two goals to Kerry Huffman and one each to Murray Craven, Willie Huber and Ilkka Sinisalo. Coach Jim Schoenfeld of the Devils started Burke in goal despite Burke's disastrous appearance in a 7-4 loss to the Rangers in the previous game, when he allowed three goals on four shots in only 6 minutes 25 seconds of action before he was replaced by Alain Chevrier. Burke started on shaky ground again this afternoon as the Flyers scored on their very first shot 16 seconds into the game. The young goaltender was not to blame for the goal, however, as Craven was left completely unchecked standing at the bottom of the right circle for his 25th of the season. O'Callahan equaled Craven's goal for the Devils at 7:51 of the opening period when connected in front of Hextall's right door step. Verbeek put the Devils ahead with his 39th goal of the season while the Devils had a two-man avdantage 12:11 into the game, and Johnson extended the lead to 3-1 with his penalty shot exactly two minutes later. Johnson was awarded the penalty shot when he was pulled down by Tim Kerr just as he had reached Hextall after a breakaway. Johnson skated toward Hextall with plenty of confidence and beat the goaltender under the stick for his 14th of the season. ''I went over and asked Aaron Broten and Kirk Muller what I should do,'' Johnson said about his second penalty shot of the season, ''and they told me to relax.'' Huffman scored the next two goals for the Flyers to tie the game at 3-all, but Kurvers imitated Huffman by scoring the next two goals in the game, giving the Devils a 5-3 lead with his third and fourth of the season late in the second.

1149-> POSTING: Choir School Site; Offices by Macklowe
On one of the most built-up streets in Manhattan, Sheldon Werdiger, the project manager for 125 West 55th Street, speaks of creating a park feeling. Though the 23-story office building being developed there by the Harry Macklowe Real Estate Company has two of New York's tallest new buildings as neighbors, it is near a mid-block public plaza and will yield to small plazas of its own on both 55th and 56th Streets. Moreover, the building's blue-green glass sheathing may give it a pastoral sheen. The design, by Edward Larrabee Barnes Associates, is somewhat similar to that of Metropolitan Tower, another Macklow building nearby with entrances on 56th and 57th Streets. Both have sharply angled sections, but each structure creates its own distinctive image. The stark black Metropolitan Tower at 78 floors vies with the 72-story Citispire, across 56th Street, for the title of tallest residential building in New York. Both of them dwarf the newest Macklowe building. The $60 million project will occupy the former site of the Choir School of St. Thomas Church, which moved into a new building at 202 West 58th Street last August. The school traded its land with Fisher Brothers for the new building. Fisher, which had assembled several smaller lots at the 55th Street location, then sold the complete 29,000-square-foot plot to Macklowe in September. The foundation of the new 550,000-square-foot structure, which is being built as-of-right, is being rushed to completion before May 13 to take advantage the West Midtown 20 percent space bonus. Occupancy is expected in May 1989. The building, which will have entries on 55th and 56th Streets, will have floors designed with few structural columns to accommodate tenants needing open space. The developer has also begun construction of the 52-story, 638-room Hotel Macklowe at 145 West 44th Street. On that site three years ago, Macklowe was accused of paying a contractor to illegally demolish a single-room-occupancy hotel and has since paid $2 million toward a city housing fund as a mitigation.

1151-> Uncovered Short Sales Inch Up on the Big Board
The New York Stock Exchange reported yesterday that the number of shares sold short and not yet covered in the month ended Feb. 12 rose by 3.3 million shares, or nine-tenths of 1 percent, to 383.4 million, from a revised 380.1 million in the previous month. By comparison, in the month ended Aug. 14, 1987, open positions on short sales were at a record 546.3 million shares. For the comparable period a year ago, ended Feb. 13, 1987, open positions totaled 448.2 million shares. The American Stock Exchange said that uncovered short sales for the month ended Feb. 12 fell 981,154 shares, or 2.8 percent, to 28.5 million. In a short sale, an investor, betting that a stock price will decline, sells borrowed stock in anticipation of buying it back later at a lower price. The number of shares in which a short position is still held by investors is totaled by each exchange at the end of a reporting period. That total represents the ''short interest'' for that period. On the surface, a short sale is a bearish sign, representing an investor's belief that the market will turn down. But a short-seller must eventually buy back the shares that have been sold short, and those purchases exert an upward pressure on the market. Thus, analysts generally believe that a rise in short interest presages a rise in the stock market.

1152-> Council Backs Housing Order In Yonkers
After nearly five hours of being denounced by residents as wimps, liars, snakes and ''masters of deceit,'' the City Council voted early this morning to obey a Federal court order to build low-income housing in predominantly white neighborhoods. The resolution, which the Council approved by a vote of 5 to 2, came after a settlement reached this week between local officials and the plaintiffs in a seven-year-old desegregation suit that has bitterly divided the city. The settlement included the Council's pledge to drop long-promised plans to appeal Federal Judge Leonard B. Sand's two-year-old desegregation order to the United States Supreme Court. In his order, Judge Sand said Yonkers must desegregate its schools and build public housing in white neighborhoods to remedy nearly four decades of racial discrimination. 'You Promised Us an Appeal' Judge Sand had threatened the Council members with having them removed from office, as well as with fines that would have left the city bankrupt. In addition, had they not cooperated, city officials would have lost control over the housing plan, with Judge Sand designating the sites himself. ''If you do this, we're no better than animals in a zoo,'' Jack O'Toole, one of the community leaders who has led the battle against low-income housing, told the Council. ''You promised us an appeal,'' he said. ''You promised us you'd never settle.'' Mr. O'Toole was among 50 speakers who took the lecturn from 8 P.M. on Wednesday until shortly before the vote at 1:30 A.M. today. A raucous crowd of more than 800 cheered them on in the auditorium of Saunders Technical School, holding up signs reading: ''No Guts!'' ''You Sold Us Out!'' and ''Appeal!'' ''Resign! Resign! Resign!'' the crowd chanted throughout the meeting. Only two months ago, the same voters helped elect the Councilmen who Wednesday night sat on stage under the protection of 60 police officers. They sat mutely during the marathon attack, several of them looking away from the audience. People entering the auditorium had to pass through a metal detector, and the police confiscated four registered handguns. Most of the Council members had waged highly emotional campaigns focused on promises to fight Judge Sand's order to the Supreme Court. Several councilmen had vowed to go to jail before they allowed low-income housing to be built in north and east Yonkers. ''You people campaigned on this issue!'' said Bernadette McLaughlin, president of the Dunwoodie Civic Association. She pointed at Nicholas Longo and Edward Fagan Jr., two Council members whose anti-low-income housing campaigns had become particularly heated. Many local officials have said that Mr. Longo, a longtime incumbent Republican, won his race with a commercial that contrasted a menacing-looking, high-rise housing project with a tranquil suburban backyard. Promises and Accusations ''I knocked on doors for you, Nick Longo,'' Mrs. McLaughlin said as the crowd applauded, ''and you, Ed Fagan, and you said, 'I will go to jail.' You're not even a man of your word.' '' Referring to the two weeks of negotiations that led up to the settlement, she said, ''We're going to find out what deal was done, and I think you're going to regret the day you ever went into politics.'' Only one speaker, Laurie Recht, a white resident of southwest Yonkers, spoke in favor of desegregation. The crowd jeered so loudly - ''Send her to Harlem!'' one man shouted -that Ms. Recht, a secretary, could barely be heard as she read her brief prepared statement. Demand for an Appeal ''I applaud their vote and deplore their reasons,'' she said. ''There are good and bad in all races,'' she said. ''It is important to realize that no one group should be blamed for all social or societal problems.'' One Council member, Peter Chema, voted unexpectedly against the resolution after agreeing earlier in the week to support it. But the vote of Vice Mayor Henry Spallone was not a surprise. Mr. Spallone, a retired New York City detective, has become known for his tirades against low-income housing, which he asserts will destroy the city's suburban neighborhoods. He was shut out of the recent negotiations and is the lone Council member who has continued to demand an appeal to the Supreme Court. ''Spallone for Mayor!'' the members of the audience shouted last night, giving Mr. Spallone a standing ovation as he entered the auditorium. 'I Don't Wear Pampers!' Throughout the night, the audience attacked the Mayor, 28-year-old Nicholas C. Wasicsko, calling him a wimp, and a baby who is overly dependent on his mother. Mr. Wasicsko, who is single, lives in the same house as his mother. ''I don't wear Pampers!'' Mr. Spallone shouted to his supporters at about 1 A.M., when it came time for the Council members to deliver their speeches. ''Judge Sand found that out!'' He called his fellow Council members wimps and addressed the crowd: ''I swore an allegiance to you and I will keep that allegiance to you. Nuts to you, Judge Sand. You wanna take me in? Come on and try it! This is a sellout, a sellout of the worst kind.'' In the agreement, city officials designated seven sites on which 200 units of public housing will be built and gave Yonkers the oppportunity to designate one or two more. The council approved an amendment designating an eighth site and thereby decreasing the housing's density.

1153-> Q&A
Phantom Tours Question:Having seen ''The Phantom of the Opera,'' and currently planning a trip to Paris, I wonder whether it is possible to take backstage tours of the Paris Opera House. - W. H. B., New York, N.Y. Answer:Backstage tours are available twice a month, but arranging one with an English-speaking guide requires making an appointment a month in advance. The regular tours are held on the first and third Tuesday each month. Participants assemble at the Opera's main entrance at 1 P.M. The visits, led by professional guides, are organized by Les Monuments Historiques de Paris (telephone, 48.87.24.14), an agency of the Ministry of Culture. They cost $8 a person, last about an hour and a half and generally take in the attic, the caves and the small underground lake across which, in the story, the Phantom lures the singer Christine to his secret lair. Visitors wanting a backstage tour with an English-speaking guide must call the monuments office to schedule a visit. These tours cost a total of $92 for any number of people up to 30. The building is renowned for its great staircase and foyer, gilded statuary and the sumptuous decoration of the auditorium. But these can be admired during regular public visiting hours from 11 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. daily. There are no guides for these visits, which are sometimes unavailable or limited in scope when rehearsals are taking place, and they do not include backstage. Admission: about $3. Telephone: 42.66.50.22. Dialysis Patients Question:Is there an organization that can supply travel information for kidney dialysis patients? - R. A. J., Poughkeepsie, N.Y. Answer:One source of information is Mary Ann Hamm, who works for a travel agency called Travel Horizons Unlimited and has specialized in arranging travel for dialysis patients since 1976. Mrs. Hamm, a registered nurse, says she organizes trips and schedules treatments - for individuals, not groups - in many countries as well as in the United States. Among her tasks are contacting dialysis units with kidney machines and sending them her clients' medical histories. Mrs. Hamm said major medical plans and Medicare cover all of the cost of treatment during trips in the United States (including Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands); overseas, travelers must pay on the spot for treatment but are usually reimbursed in part by their private insurance plans - not by Medicare. One suggestion Mrs. Hamm makes to patients is to avoid visiting vacation areas during their high seasons. (Travel Horizons Unlimited, 11 East 44th Street, New York, N.Y. 10017; 212-687-5121.) A travel agency that specializes in making arrangements for dialysis patients who want to take cruises is Unique Reservations (611 Barry Place, Indian Rocks Beach, Fla. 34635; 813-596-7604 and, outside Florida, 800-544-7604). Its president, Loretta McCollum-Powell, says that although her main field is cruises, she does set up land trips for individual dialysis patients, and is willing to advise inquirers on a personal - as well as a business - level about travel. The company books space on regular cruises, this year with the Holland America, Cunard and Ocean Cruise Lines. Medical arrangements include the services of a nephrologist and dialysis nurses during a voyage. In addition to the cruise fare, passengers requiring treatments on a dialysis machine pay $400 a treatment; peritoneal dialysis patients who care for themselves but need assistance pay $15 a day. Mrs. McCollum-Powell said many medical plans, but not Medicare, reimbursed part or all of the cost of treatment on a cruise. New England Question:Can you direct me to any museums in New England that are devoted to toys and dolls? - J. T., Alexandria, Va. Answer:Many old toys and dolls from around the country are on show at the Shelburne Museum (Shelburne, Vt. 05482; 802-985-3346). They are displayed in some of the 37 buildings on this 45-acre complex, which focuses on Americana. The museum is open every day from May 14 to Oct. 16, from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. Admission: $10, $4 for youngsters aged 6 to 17; under 6, free. The Wenham Museum (132 Main Street, Wenham, Mass. 01984; 617-468-2377) displays about 1,000 dolls as well as antique toys. Open daily; $1.50 and 50 cents for children 6 to 14. About 1,100 board and card games dating from 1812 to 1930 can be seen at the Game Preserve (110 Spring Road, Peterborough, N.H. 03458; 603-924-6710). This private home is open from noon to 5 on Monday, Wednesday and Friday the year round. Admission: $2.50; under 12, $1.50. Among other sites is Green Animals, the country house in Portsmouth, R.I., owned by the Preservation Society of Newport County (118 Mill Street, Newport, R.I. 02840; 401-847-1000). The toy and doll collections are Victorian. May 1 to Sept. 30, 10 to 5 daily; $4 and $2 for children 6 to 11. Austrian Resort Question:I am looking for the name of the Austrian town where ski competitions were held recently. What interests me most is that the town pharmacy has a model train exhibit in the basement, which I plan to visit in June. - A. R., Garden Grove, Calif. Answer:The annual Hahnenkamm ski race was held in January in Bad Kleinkirchheim, having been transferred from Kitzbuhel, where the snowfall was unusually light. In a basement beneath a small shopping center in Bad Kleinkirchheim, Hans Roettit, a former baker, operates a model railroad that is open to the public. The stores - a pharmacy among them - are on the main street next to the thermal-spring bathhouse where visitors like to bathe after skiing. Mr. Roettit's railroad covers about 155 square yards and includes 100 locomotives and hundreds of cars. It is open the year round in the afternoon, and in the morning as well in midsummer and the ski season. Admission is about $3 and $1.25 for children aged 12 and under. The exhibit does not have a telephone number. The village, which is at 3,500 feet, is in the south near Spittal; the nearest international airport is at Klagenfurt.

1154-> SPEAKING PERSONALLY; The Rough Boyhood of the Girl on the Block
LAST. Always last. Despite my skills on the baseball diamond, I was mere dross as sides were drawn, unless a dork was the only other live body left. Anyone who'd consider me before every last male was chosen risked ridicule, often in the form: ''(name) and Andrea sittin' in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g. First comes love, then comes marriage, then comes Junior in a baby carriage.'' ''Once, twice, three - Shoot!'' the two tallest chanted in unison, facing off over odds and evens. A motley, almost-all boy's chorus joined in for the next throw of fingers. Sal clinched it, holding two rounds of odds to Louey's one even. ''I got Anthony,'' Sal said, his voice infused with the authority of captainhood. ''I got Dom,'' countered Louey. ''Ralphy.'' ''Joey.'' ''Twin.'' The scene was re-enacted several times a week. Players took their roles seriously, and the boys gravitated to their appointed sides. But one thing never varied. ''I guess I got Andge,'' said the captain, resigned to the fate of his draw. There were 20 kids on Roosevelt Street. There was one girl - me. Our domain was ''The Block,'' its boundaries encompassing the backyards, the school at one end and ''The Hill'' at the other. From 1961, I spent my first 21 years on there. Almost everyone had a ''y'' tagged to his name, regardless of the name: Pauly, Anthony, Louey, Keithy, Ralphy, even Sally. I was Andge, short for Andrea, as in ''Can Andge come out to play?'' Another exception to the ''y'' rule were the twins, Sal and Joey. Too similar for us to discern, each was called Twin, which no doubt damaged their respective self-esteem. The sole sister in this fraternity, I not only witnessed, but mastered, the rituals of boyhood. Rumbling (customarily, it was: ''Pile on Andrea!'' - live burial beneath a score of human bodies), articulate belching, petty shoplifting, stealing through backyards at War, raking leaves and shoveling snow for money - and playing softball. Softball - where I was made to feel like a ''girl'' (emphasize with derisive tone and curled lip). One day, I stormed from the field. I cried to my big brother how unfair it was, especially since I was better than many of the boys. My brother resolved to elevate my status as a free agent by improving my batting. He wound a tennis ball up in a rope and hung it from a tree. I swung, and the yellow ball flew from its twine cradle. With each swing, I had to retrieve the ball from the bushes, the ivy bed or the next yard. Bored, we dropped the workshop -and my major-league dreams. Next time on the field, however, I connected for a double. Not bad, they granted . . . for a girl. One area where I was bestowed recognition was bicycle riding. For reasons mysterious to me then (clear to me now), I was reputed to be the best bike-rider - that is, the giver of the best bike rides. My bike was a snazzy gold metallic Schwinn with stingray handlebars and a sparkling white banana seat long enough for two child-sized rears. For maximum pedaling power, I stood, while the passenger held on to my bobbing hips or the metal loop at the back of the seat. Boys liined up for rides and, as tired as my thighs got from pumping a double load, I would not weaken and chance relinquishing my title. The street was our arena for bicycling and associated tricks, like wheelies, spins, curb-jumping and standing on the seat. And also for running bases, monkey-in-the-middle and TV tag (in which you kneel when ''It'' approaches and shout ''My Three Sons!'' or ''Gilligan's Island!'', for example, to ward off a tag. On hot days, we'd lie in the street popping tar bubbles with ice cream sticks sharpened to a point. On very rainy days, because there were no sewers, the street flooded deep enough for us to swim. A jingling bell was our call of the wild. Kids emerged from inside houses, under bushes, down from trees and around the corner at first ring. The Good Humor man was near, and we stood by. A nickel bought a Whammy stick, a thin ice pop; a quarter procured a Chocolate Eclair. I once bought a dollar's worth of Whammy Sticks and ate all 20 in a night. Our house was close enough to the railroad to make a train's hooting whistle a comforting, recurrent note in the local soundtrack. And it was near enough that our mothers worried (to no avail) about us playing on the tracks. A train-flattened coin was a treasure for show-and-tell and a trophy of courage among the boys. The train passed by Legion Hill. ''The Hill,'' we knew, wasn't quite a mountain - it was a grassy embankment of the parkway - but it was as much a natural wonder to us. It's where we dared each other to ride our bikes top to bottom, where we rode sleds and flying saucers and where we hid in the dwarfish pine tree up top to smoke cigarettes. It's also where Ralph and I (how tempting to revert to ''me'n Ralph''') saw a ghost one night. It was dusk, and we were placing a nickel on the track. Dangerous business, we knew, as all of us told and retold the story of Nancy Feeney, who was decapitated there. Standing on the rocky train bed, we heard a clanking noise that stopped our hearts. We looked up and watched in frozen horror as a swinging light came jerking down the track toward us. Ralph grabbed my hand and we tore back to our houses. It was the first and only time that he ever held my hand. Ralph was my next-door neighbor and best friend, although we had to be hush-hush about that. He was on a higher intellectual plane than the others and, like me, loved to read. It wasn't cool to be a ''brain'' in our gang, and so we kept our trysts a secret. ''The Hardy Boys'' were our favorite, and we went through the entire series. Sprawled on the floor of Ralph's room or mine, snacking on American cheese and soda, we shared Frank and Joe's adventures, looking up unfamiliar words in a dictionary. I could see Ralph's window from my bedroom and he could see mine; however, I couldn't see inside his, and I assume he couldn't see into mine. I performed in there for myself and my mirror, practicing cheers, jazz routines and a young version of erotic dancing. I acted out entire sides of Broadway musical records and pranced around wearing just scarves - girl stuff. If he could see me, I would have heard it from someone, although he was a private and taciturn boy. My older sister and I once found a day-and-date stamper and turned it into an educational enterprise. We invited boys up to our room to visit our library. Everyone made fun of Pauly for picking pop-up ''Cinderella'' with 3-D pictures. Everyone always made fun of Pauly. There was even a ''We-Hate-Pauly Club'' for a while, but I never understood why we were supposed to hate him. Nevertheless, he was late in returning the book and we charged him overdue. Rules is rules. On Halloween, school gave us orange cardboard boxes to collect money for UNICEF. At every door, we would sing, ''Trick or Treat for UNICEF - and Something More,'' like a barbershop quartet sans harmony. Our boxes filled with coins and our bags with candy. Ralph and I dutifully turned in our UNICEF collections, but the others kept the loot. They called us goodie-goods. Our block was haunted by two witches, Mrs. Slayman and Mrs. Volorn. God forbid that a ball landed in either of their yards, especially Mrs. Volorn's. Her yard was fenced in and surrounded by trees. Who knew the risk of entry? I never did it myself, but when any of the boys ventured in for an errant ball (how many balls, I wonder, were sent in just for the thrill of the chase?), the ever-aproned Mrs. Volorn would shriek at us hysterically, her thin black hair in a bun atop her head: ''Stay out of my yard! I'll call the police!'' At times, she stood quietly on her screened-in porch, watching us through little glasses, and perhaps lonely in that house with only Johnny, her retarded grandson, for company. Mrs. Slayman was a white-haired witch who always warned us about playing near her house. She was a stout, beak-nosed woman, and her appearance was threat enough. It was even scarier to catch a peek of the demented sister who lived with her - a tiny, wizened, snow-haired woman with dark, dark eyes and heavy black-rimmed glasses. We naturally avoided ringing their bells on Halloween. One year, Mrs. Volorn chased after us on the street, holding out candy after we passed by her house and shouting desperately, ''Children! Children!'' She handed us the best candy bars. Ashamed, I thanked her without looking up. Bad things happen to people, we learned young. Everyone knew that my father had died when I was 5, but no one talked about it. Ralph's father got cancer of the larynx and had his voice box removed, and so he couldn't talk anymore except for clicking sounds we grew to understand. Sal and Anthony's father, a painter, fell from a roof and broke both legs, putting him out of business for a while. And the twins' older brother, whom we knew only as a tough kid with a motorcycle, became a policeman and accidentally shot himself dead while cleaning his revolver. Growing up on Roosevelt Street gave me an edge on the bigger piece of world I entered. On the street, we fought, raced, laughed, ridiculed, competed and explored. Weaken, and you were tagged a ''cry baby.'' Better to stay tough. It was a man's world, and I did more than keep up. I flourished. In the charcoal house at the bend in the road, I was a safe baby sister; out on Roosevelt Street, I was Andge, one of the guys.

1155-> WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING; Potomac Hospitality
Some of the curtains have not yet been hung and a few pieces of furniture are missing, but President and Mrs. Reagan are about to get an advance look at Blair House, the President's newly restored official guest house. The historic mansion, which is actually four contiguous houses with 115 rooms and 30 bathrooms, has been closed for two and a half years while undergoing a federally financed $8.6 million restoration. On Monday evening the Reagans will be the hosts at a private reception attended by many of the people who had a hand in restoring Blair House as well as the major donors who underwrote a $4 million redecoration by two New York designers, Mario Buatta and Mark Hampton. Secretary of State George P. Shultz has elected to show off the new quarters to Washington diplomats on April 29, when he will hold his annual reception for the diplomatic corps there. Then Blair House, which in many ways serves as a first-class hotel for visiting heads of state, will shut down for a month for the finishing touches. It will be officially unveiled in early June, according to Selwa Roosevelt, the State Department's Chief of Protocol, who has been overseeing the restoration project. By early fall the capital's luxury hotels will lose some of their best customers, for Blair House, diagonally across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House, will once again be back in business.

1156-> A Protein Is Found to Help Fight Bone Cancer
The natural protein interferon shows promise in controlling multiple myeloma, a lethal form of bone cancer, when used in combination with standard chemotherapy drugs, researchers said today. ''We finally have a leg up on arresting the natural progression of the disease and producing patients who are alive at five years, which has been a rarity,'' said Dr. Martin M. Oken of the University of Minnesota. His research is part of a new effort by scientists to find a role for interferon by combining it with drugs that have long been used to fight cancer. Dr. Oken said interferon might provide a knockout punch after cancer has been weakened, but not destroyed, by other medicines. Early Optimism The work may also bring a revival of interest in the medicinal use of interferon, a natural, hormone-like substance that, among other things, helps regulate the body's immune system. When the human gene that makes this chemical was isolated, some experts predicted many uses for interferon in eliminating cancer and infections. But studies showed that when used alone interferon had little major impact on any cancer except a rare malignancy, hairy cell leukemia, for which it has become a standard therapy. In the latest research, presented at the annual meeting of the American Association of Clinical Oncology, doctors found that interferon plus chemotherapy produced complete remissions in 30 percent of the 54 patients studied. Such remissions, in which all signs of the disease are gone, are rare in cases of multiple myeloma. In another study presented at the meeting, doctors from the University of North Carolina reported promising early results in testing interferon against chronic myelogenous leukemia, a form of the disease that originates in bone. While this leukemia can be effectively treated with bone marrow transplants, suitable marrow donors are not available for many victims. About 11,000 new cases of multiple myeloma and 5,000 cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia are reported each year.

1157-> JACKSON WINS EASILY IN MICHIGAN IN SURPRISING SETBACK TO DUKAKIS
The Rev. Jesse Jackson dealt a blow to the Presidential candidacy of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis today, trouncing him in the popular vote in Michigan's Democratic caucuses and denying him the momentum he had sought in this big industrial state. Despite an all-out effort, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri finished third. He said he would meet with his family on Sunday to decide whether to withdraw from the race and run for re-election to Congress. After winning the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 8, he has been unable to produce a second major victory; he is out of money and his prospects are considered bleak. Message Is Not Enough Ironically, Mr. Gephardt's message of economic nationalism could not save him even here, but it proved so popular that it has been taken up by Mr. Dukakis and others. As expected, Mr. Jackson swept Detroit's black neighborhoods, where he generated intense support despite the endorsement of Mr. Dukakis by Mayor Coleman A. Young, who is black. Mr. Jackson won some wards on the West Side by margins of 15- and 20-to-1. But the surprise was the Chicago clergyman's powerful showing in predominantly white cities like Lansing, Flint, Kalamazoo and Battle Creek, several of which he carried. The Popular Vote Tally With 74 percent of the precincts reporting, but many Jackson strongholds in Detroit uncounted, the vote was: Jackson . . . 59,889 (42%) Dukakis . . . 49,965 (35%) Gephardt. . . 23,132 (16%) Simon . . . 4,895 (4%) Gore . . . 3,534 (3%) The outcome of the struggle for the 183 delegates to the Democratic National Convention that were at stake here remained in doubt as the count progressed slowly. But it was clear that Mr. Jackson would win many more delegates than the Dukakis forces and most neutral observers had predicted, and he appeared to have at least a chance of taking the largest number. Mr. Dukakis had hoped that a clear-cut victory in this state would prove his appeal to blue-collar workers, a group critical to Democratic chances in the fall, and re-establish him as the front-runner, a distinction he lost when he ran third last week behind a pair of favorite sons in Illinois, Mr. Jackson and Senator Paul Simon. Instead, the Michigan voters left the race in a bigger muddle than before, with Mr. Dukakis hurt by two straight disappointments in Northern industrial states, Mr. Jackson buoyed by an unexpected victory and the shape of the contest hard to discern. Senator Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee and Senator Simon lagged far behind in the Michigan ''beauty contest'' and won no delegates. Lines at Polling Places Mr. Jackson, who had drawn surprisingly large crowds of both blacks and whites in the last few days, stayed in the state beyond his scheduled departure today to try to insure a large turnout of his followers. He spent the day touring black churches and five housing projects in Detroit, and his efforts appeared to pay off; as many as 100 people waited in lines at inner-city polling places this afternoon. Some polls were unable to close on time because of the crowds still waiting to cast ballots. Mr. Jackson easily eclipsed his 1984 effort in Michigan, when he took 17 percent of the vote in a state that is 12 per cent black. In a typical Lansing precinct, for example, he took 1,400 votes this year, as against 240 four years ago. So dramatically did he seize the public imagination that he was able to counter successfully the notion that Mr. Dukakis was the Democrat with the best chance of nomination, and to do it in a week when two national polls showed the Massachusetts Governor running neck-and-neck with Vice President Bush and all of the other Democratic candidates trailing by big margins. 'Firehouse Primary' Mr. Dukakis conceded defeat in Milwaukee, where all the candidates attended a Jefferson-Jackson dinner tonight. He congratulated Mr. Jackson for ''a good campaign, an exciting campaign.'' His aides said he would persist in his strategy of campaigning in every state, including Connecticut, which votes Tuesday, Colorado, which holds caucuses on April 4, and Wisconsin, where there is a primary on April 5. The contest today was described locally as a series of caucuses, but in fact it was an example of what politicians call a ''firehouse primary'' - an election run by the party rather than the state, with shorter voting hours and fewer polling places than usual, but normal ballots dropped into normal ballot boxes and counted exactly as in a state-sanctioned primary. Mr. Gephardt apparently made up considerable ground in the final week of the campaigning here, only to fall short. Early polls showed him a distant third, but expenditures of more than $350,000 on television commercials, the work of trade union allies and the candidate's own unceasing stress on the need for tougher measures against unfair foreign competition made an impact, particularly among auto workers whose jobs have been imperiled. The Missouri Congressman predicted Friday that he would achieve a ''miracle in Michigan'' that would thrust him back into the thick of the Democratic Presidential contest. But even a last campaign day that began before dawn was not quite enough, and it is widely thought in the political community that Mr. Gephardt will withdraw from the race to concentrate on seeking re-election to his House seat on the south side of St. Louis. Looking Toward Wisconsin He has until Tuesday, which is the filing deadline in Missouri, to decide what course he will follow. Neither Mr. Simon nor Mr. Gore was able to make any real dent on the Michigan electorate, and Mr. Gore looks more and more each week like a southern regional candidate with nowhere to go now that Super Tuesday, when the Southern and Border states voted, has passed. As in Illinois, he predicted he would stage a surprise here; as in Illinois, he failed to make good. Even before the votes were counted here, he was looking toward the New York primary on April 19, which may turn out to be his last chance. Mr. Simon hopes to repeat his comeback victory in Illinois last week with a triumph in Wisconsin on April 5. He blamed his minuscule vote total here on fundraising difficulties, commenting in East Lansing: ''I have a great voting record for the public. However, it is not a great voting record for getting campaign contributions.'' Only a tiny fraction of Michigan's Democrats and independents voted in the caucuses today. With more than 9 million people, this is the nation's eighth largest state, but preliminary calculations by party officials tonight suggested that only 150,000 people voted - a small increase from the 130,000 who turned out four years ago. Michigan once had Presidential primaries, but in 1972, under rules permitting crossover voting, Republicans flooded the Democratic contest. The result was a landslide victory for former Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama, who had been shot in Laurel, Md., just a few days before the balloting. Almost 1.6 million voted in the Democratic contest that year, but the liberal leadership of the party, embarrassed at what they considered a fiasco, vowed that they would never sanction an ''open'' primary in the state again. Using a somewhat different caucus system that was marred by lengthy court fights and occasional physical scuffles, Michigan Republicans completed the selection of their convention delegates at a state convention on Jan. 29, at which Vice President Bush won a convincing victory over his closest rival, Pat Robertson.

1158-> George Sklar, 79, Dies; Playwright and Author
George Sklar, a playwright and novelist, died of cardiac arrest Sunday in Los Angeles. He was 79 years old. Mr. Sklar was a leading figure in the theater of social protest during the Depression, writing several political plays, helping to organize the Theater Union and serving on the board of the Federal Theater Project. He collaborated with Albert Maltz on the play ''Merry-Go-Round,'' about political corruption, and an antiwar drama, ''Peace on Earth.'' With Paul Peters, Mr. Sklar wrote a satirical revue called ''Parade,'' and ''Stevedore,'' which Brooks Atkinson described as ''comic, brutish, hysterical and defiant.'' Mr. Sklar spent the early 1940's in Hollywood writing screenplays, and collaborated with Vera Caspary on the 1947 Broadway adaptation of ''Laura.'' A victim of anti-Communist blacklisting, he began writing novels in the late 1940's. His first, ''The Two Worlds of Johnny Truro'' became a best seller that was made into a movie. His other novels were ''The Promising Young Men,'' ''The Housewarming'' and ''The Identity of Dr. Frazier.'' Mr. Sklar returned to playwriting in the mid-1960's with ''And People All Around,'' about the killing of three civil-rights workers, and a 1972 environmentalist work called ''Brown Pelican.'' He is survived by a daughter, Judith Rasminsky, of Montreal; two sons, Daniel and Zachary, of New York; a brother, Nathan, of Palm City, Fla., and two grandchildren.

1159-> Ruling Party Is Declared the Winner in Bangladesh
Bangladesh's ruling Jatiya party today was declared the overwhelming winner of elections that were marred by violence, but the opposition renewed its pledge to topple President H. M. Ershad. The Election Commission said the ruling party so far had won 177 contested seats in Thursday's election for 220 seats in the 300-member Parliament. Eighteen Jatiya members were elected unopposed, giving the party 195 of the seats decided so far. A senior commission official said it was suspending announcement of the remaining results because the violence on Election Day had affected the voting in 81 constituencies. Major opposition parties, which boycotted the election, have been campaigning for the last four months to force General Ershad to resign. One of them described the polls as a ''voterless election.'' ''The deceitful results strengthen our determination to oust this Government. Our moral backbone will be crippled if it continues to stay,'' said Khaleda Zia, leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. ''This is a voterless election where results were tailored beforehand,'' said Sheik Hasina Wazed, chief of the the other major opposition group, the Awami League. Bangladesh was without newspapers today. The country's 1,500 journalists staged a nine-hour strike to protest Government curbs on reporting on election violence. Reazuddin Ahmed, secretary-general of the Bangladesh Federal Union of Journalists, said his group decided to strike after the Press Information Department imposed a news blackout on the violence. He said newspapers were warned that they might be closed if they printed stories and photographs of the violence. ''This was contrary to the Government's earlier promise,'' he said. Rival political groups fought with guns, knives and bombs on Thursday, killing up to 13 people. They burned paper ballots, stole ballot boxes and drove election officials away in some centers. Home Minister Abdul Matin, who had likened the fairness of Thursday's elections to those of Britain, said he knew of only five deaths. However, he confirmed that polling had been suspended in 170 centers. Western diplomats toured several polling stations on election day. One described the polls as ''a mockery of an election.'' General Ershad, 58 years old, has ruled Bangladesh since overthrowing a civilian government in a bloodless coup in 1982.

1160-> Sleepy Hollow Is Still Just a Legend
A PROPOSAL to change North Tarrytown's name to Sleepy Hollow was firmly rejected by residents of that village last week by a vote of 1,322 to 794. But proponents of the switch said they were a growing minority and would probably try again. Chris Skelly, who sought to have the village capitalize on its heritage as the setting for Washington Irving's ''Sleepy Hollow,'' said the Sleepy Hollow Society would ''continue its historical research and its process of education.'' ''We raised it as a credible issue and got one-third of the vote,'' he said. ''But a name change is very profound and touches people very deeply.'' He said he thought most villagers had responded to that issue, rather than to how much they thought the change would cost. Mayor Janet Gandolfo agreed, saying the ''cost factor may have influenced some people, but it was not large enough for people to vote against it.'' She added, ''I think when it came right down to it, people just didn't want to change.''

1161-> ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS
In breaking her anonymity, Nan Robertson has done a disservice to herself, to Alcoholics Anonymous and to the alcoholic who still suffers. I find it significant that Ms. Robertson does not discuss A.A.'s 11th Tradition (''. . we need always maintain personal anonymity at the level of press, radio and films,'') and 12th Tradition (''Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our traditions. . . .''). These guidelines were designed to protect the recovering alcoholic from overconfidence and to protect the organization from exploitation. Most important, they are meant to preserve the hope offered by A.A. from the foibles of its members. What if Ms. Robertson drinks tonight? And what if that fact receives as much publicity as her recovery has? It is possible that thousands may assume that A.A. wouldn't work for them. ROSEMARY M. New York, N.Y.

1163-> IN AFGHANISTAN, THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR WAR ARE ENDLESS
CERTAINTIES are hard to come by here or in Peshawar, the unofficial capital of the 10 Afghan political groupings eager to seize control as soon as the Soviet Army leaves their country. The prospect of the withdrawal of Soviet forces by early next year was shaken last week, when Secretary of State George P. Shultz and the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze failed to resolve a dispute over halting arms aid to the Afghan rebels and Government. The continuing dispute is holding up conclusion of accords in Geneva that would insure the departure of Soviet forces by early next year. This leaves only one assumption that commands general acceptance. Most officials, diplomats and other analysts here believe that leaving Afghanistan to the Afghans nearly a decade after Soviet troops moved in will not produce instant peace under a government enjoying general support and may, in fact, lead to intensified internal strife. The most favorable chain of events projected here is that the withdrawal of the 115,000 Soviet soldiers and the end of Soviet air attacks on the insurgents will be followed by the quick collapse of the Afghan Communist forces. Then the guerrillas would stage a concerted drive on Kabul, the capital; the Government of President Najibullah would fall, and the proposed coalition government cobbled together in Peshawar last month would take over. This is the forecast put forward more or less officially by the Afghan rebel alliance in Peshawar, the Pakistani Government and the countries, including the United States, that have given diplomatic support and covert military assistance to the Afghan ''freedom fighters'' - a romantic title that diverts attention from the lack of common purpose and hatreds that divide the alliance. The worst-case scenario is that all of the negative passions of a nation whose political culture has not included a gift for accommodation and compromise will be allowed free play. Then Afghanistan will become a land of enduring chaos until a strong power re-emerges and imposes its will on a country whose geography and sociology encourage resistance to central rule. The Final Battles Such divisions have been strengthened by a level of armament unprecedented even in a society that has seen the highest virtue in manly readiness to kill for the sake of defending honor and wreaking vengeance. Even while peace is being sought in Geneva, arms are flowing into Afghanistan, and the guerrilla groups are preparing for the final battles - with the Najibullah Government and with each other. The Soviet Union is arming the Government in the hope of keeping him in power, and the United States and China are still sending weapons to the guerrillas. Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf sheikdoms are paying to restore Sunni Moslems to the political dominance that they held until King Zahir Shah was overthrown in Kabul in 1973. The Afghan anti-Communist groups are relatively weak; no group has a leader with any hope of achieving a consensus among all of them. The seven-party alliance is Sunni. It is divided into two wings - four Islamic fundamentalist or radical groups and three Islamic traditionalist parties. The members of each wing distrust each another only slightly less than their rivals in the opposing wing. The fundamentalists want to create an Afghanistan more Islamic than ever before; the three others favor restoration of traditional sources of authority - tribal or religious leaders. Three marginal Shiite Moslem parties are also based in Peshawar. From Peshawar, the alliance members distribute arms to the fighting groups inside Afghanistan and issue orders to the three million refugees in Pakistan. When the alliance had to put together a proposed transition government to enable Pakistan to demand in Geneva that such a leadership be installed, the wrangling was long. The man they chose to lead Afghanistan from war to peace and from Communism back to Islam is Ahmed Shah, a minor figure in a Saudi-backed party whose name is barely known outside his own group. No one considers him a real contender for power. He was chosen only because the Islamic fundamentalists and radicals, who cast four of the seven alliance votes, wanted one of their own to head a shadow government but could not put aside the rivalries among their real leaders. The Former King's Role The three traditionalist parties, which are known as moderates only because of their lesser zeal, put forward the 73-year-old former King, who has spent the years since his downfall in Rome. But the reaction of perhaps the strongest fundamentalist leader, Mohammed Yunis Khalis, was to say that Zahir Shah could return to Afghanistan only for burial. The head of the most militant radical party, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, rejected the deposed monarch as ''non-Islamic.'' Few people believe that the alliance leaders will be able to suppress their personal ambition when, for the first time since 1979, the possibility of seizing power arrives. Most analysts believe that if the Soviet troops depart, the power of the Peshawar politicians will greatly decline. Their place will be taken by local commanders inside Afghanistan, who have accepted the exiled leadership only because the alliance parties were the channels through which Pakistani military intelligence distributed arms from the United States, China or the Persian Gulf to the guerrillas. Some of these commanders have themselves established considerable fiefdoms and they, too, will not want to give up power to a new central government. While the sources of future conflict among the guerrillas are visible, little is known about the strength that the Soviet Union will continue to provide for the Communist Government it intends to leave behind. Hated as that Government clearly is, it has an army, a militia and a separate military force controlled by the equivalent of the Soviet K.G.B. security police. In the coming battles for control over a country in which an overriding desire for national unity has never been evident, the Communist force may be the equal in strength of any of the insurgent groups. Pessimists - optimism is professed only by those who hope to come out on top - see relevance in the example of Lebanon, and say that in Afghanistan, too, the tribal and religious divisions, fueled by an unlimited flow of arms and the intervention of foreign powers, may lead to a shattered country that no one can put back together.

1164-> Review/Dance; Paul Taylor Opens With A Premiere
If it's the Paul Taylor Dance Company, it must be spring. Or so one has assumed through the 1980's ever since Mr. Taylor and his merry band became an April fixture in New York. In the forefront of those who made modern dance popular and no longer dependent, as modern dance often is, upon a haphazard engagement, Mr. Taylor and his troupe can be seen at the same time and same place every year. We know where to go for our Paul Taylor fix. A dose of humor, musicality, depth and intellect-tickling is what we expect. The four-week company season that opened Tuesday night at the City Center with a Taylor premiere called ''Brandenburgs'' and two repertory pieces, ''Esplanade'' and ''Runes,'' testifies to Mr. Taylor's remarkable creativity for over 30 years, with a special accent on the last 15. It has been easy to take for granted the idea that every Taylor premiere is going to be a masterpiece, or close to it. What ''Brandenburgs'' comes close to being, unfortunately, is a clinker, and one says this in full cognizance of the fact that any critic can go wrong - and so can a choreographer. Perhaps it is just that Bach's ''Brandenburg'' Concertos, or portions thereof (the third appended to the first two movements of the sixth) do not serve as a very good floor for dancing. The notion of being bored at a Taylor concert seems inconceivable, and yet ''Brandenburgs'' is boring. Very possibly, J. S. Bach is boring. But somehow one doubts it. It is rather that a series of stag leaps, turns and runs repeatedly performed by dancers who exit and enter with cyclical regularity has its numbing limitations. Mr. Taylor has reduced his vocabulary unnecessarily here and uncharacteristically he seems, at least for the men, to have adhered to every note. Many notes, few steps do not a good combination make. ''Brandenburgs,'' of course, must be viewed within the context of Mr. Taylor's entire output. This is not the work by which a newcomer should judge him. At the same time, its saving grace consists of the occasional and typical Taylorism. In this case it is an unusual use of an all-male ensemble that dances independently in inventively designed patterns and also accompanies the four soloists (forming an alley, a circle and an asymmetrical frame). The small corps includes exuberant newcomers like Joseph Bowie and Hernando Cortez and slightly more senior dancers - Joao Mauricio, Jeff Wadlington and Barry Wizoreck. William Ivey Long has designed blue tights with gold belts for the ensemble that is bathed in a resplendent Olympic glow by Jennifer Tipton's lighting. The soloists, in white with gold, are all veterans: Christopher Gillis, Susan McGuire, Cathy McCann and Kate Johnson. Mr. Gillis is initially and finally attended by the women, whose basic motifs refer to high kicks performed from a tilted torso, light skips and a variety of turns, some skimmingly executed above the ground. Every soloist has a solo, with or without the ensemble, which tends to pick up or initiate a movement theme. Mr. Gillis's leitmotif is presented as specifically heroic, contrasting with the sanctimonious walk and curved-arm gracefulness of the handmaidens he partners. Carving his own body into shape after shape, Mr. Gillis is all flowing sculpture. Mr. Taylor's way with Bach is spectacularly more ingenious in one of his indisputable masterpieces, the 1975 ''Esplanade,'' the progam's opener. He has dared to use everyday movement against music with courtly Baroque associations and he has also read into these excerpts from two concertos (E and D minor) programmatic content they do not have. Playful at first in their rhythmic transformation of natural skips and runs, the dancers are daringly virtuosic as they throw themselves to the ground at the end. The central section is as ambiguous as it is dramatic. Karla Wolfangle, looking like a 1930's film star in her red bangs and short hair, was the marvelous fulcrum of the mysterious family that included Kenneth Tosti, Linda Kent, Miss Johnson and as a poignant outsider, Mary Cochran. Isolated as humans, each found a sense of community only when transformed into one of the bestial beings that herded together finally in a circle. Oddly, some of the roles were redistributed on this occasion with Miss Cochran reeling backward with derring-do in the solo that belonged to Miss Johnson. Donald York conducted during the evening and Jeanne Ingraham and Martha Caplin were the violin soloists. Gerald Busby played his own resonant and sinister-sounding piano score for ''Runes'' (1975), an evocative Taylor ritual in which one sacrificial victim replaces another. Elie Chaib and Cathy McCann were outstanding in the twisting convolutions of their brutal neo-primitive duet. Raymond Kurshal, another newcomer, was completely at home in his speedy incantations. This was Mr. Taylor in his modern-archaic mood, troubling and deep. The Cast BRANDENBURGS choreography, Paul Taylor; costumes, William Ivey Long; lighting, Jennifer Tipton; music, J. S. Bach. WITH: Christopher Gillis, Susan McGuire, Cathy McCann, Kate Johnson, Joao Mauricio, Jeff Wadlington, Barry Wizoreck, Joseph Bowie and Hernando Cortez.

1168-> FOREIGN AFFAIRS; Japan's Faulty Memory
If he had been a German official, or a stiff-backed President of Austria, everybody would have been up in arms. There would have been a clamor for wide-ranging debate, for TV documentaries and films, for programs in the schools, for a basic review of textbooks. As it was, Seisuke Okuno was obliged to resign from his Cabinet post as Director General of Japan's National Land Agency. But there has been no real apology, as far as I know, and nothing has been set in motion beyond some maneuvers to relieve a certain political embarrassment. Last month, Mr. Okuno visited the national shrine honoring Japan's war dead and declared: ''Japan fought the war in order to secure its safety. . . . The white race had turned Asia into a colony. Japan was by no means the aggressor nation.'' China and both South and North Korea protested. But scarcely any notice was taken in the West. Forty-one right-wing members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party had come out in support of Mr. Okuno and denounced criticism of Japan's role in the war as unfair. He repeated his views last week, asserting that Japan ''had no intention'' of invading China in the 1930's when its troops occupied large parts of the country and massacred millions. ''I don't want to call it an aggressive war because both many Japanese and Chinese were killed,'' he said. That provoked another flap and finally forced the resignation, although Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita appeared to dissociate himself by telling Parliament, ''We should be fully aware of the fact that the wartime action is under severe international criticism as an aggression.'' He seemed to be saying that the view of foreigners still had to be taken into account, not that it described the facts. There have been similar incidents in recent years as Japan has come to take account of its great new economic power and grope for a definition of its role in the world. None have led to a serious discussion of what happened when Japan set out to establish a ''Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere'' with its military forces in the years that led to World War II. But Mr. Okuno, who is 74, should know. He headed the wartime secret police in a town on Kyushu Island. The abrupt shift of self-perception from a poor, totally vanquished nation to a weighty member of the Western industrial club has been hard to digest. A wise Japanese professor of sociology, welcoming the new self-confidence as a basis for necessary assumption of responsibility in international affairs, warned in a recent Tokyo conversation of the danger of leaping ''from self-pity to arrogance.'' This is a serious concern of the countries Japan overran, and the reason they are so edgy about its new role, especially when they hear the U.S. calling on the Japanese to increase their military spending. It should also be a concern to the U.S. and Europe. The great majority of the Japanese have drawn the lesson that their militaristic system was a disaster. They found a better way to ''co-prosperity.'' But failing to face the history and explain it to new generations undermines the confidence others can have in welcoming Japan as a partner. This is an element in ''Japan-bashing,'' which provokes such indignation there. Japanese memories focus on the bad years of the atom bomb, defeat, hunger and humiliation, without noting how it all began. The global power pattern is shifting and melding. Japan's Asian neighbors can no longer be the only ones who pay attention to the underlying attitudes. Nationalism is rising throughout the region, without any of the postwar accommodations that transformed European nationalisms into a base for cooperation. The U.S. played an enormous role in advancing the recovery of Japan, reforming its social structure and introducing democracy, opening up the world trading system, including its own market, which Japan energetically used to achieve prosperity. The foundations were laid during the occupation and many Japanese acknowledge that. But it is up to the Japanese to complete their emergence as a peaceful and reliable member of the free world community, and that requires a better sense of their recent as well as their more ancient past. The Times of London quoted Prof. Takeshi Sasaki of Tokyo University as saying: ''We're very concerned about our identity. We can't find a direction in which to lead our people. In this situation, it's easy to understand that people want to go back to the old style.'' Perhaps, but not with illusions of righteous innocence. It is not only markets but minds that the rest of the world must now ask Japan to open.

1169-> PATIENTS FACING INCREASED COSTS AT NURSING HOMES
The Reagan Administration has issued a new rule that it says will probably increase the costs of nursing home care for hundreds of thousands of low-income people who are elderly or disabled. The Government said the rule, which takes effect April 8, would enable states to ''shift more of the financial responsibility for the cost of nursing home care to the recipient.'' The Department of Health and Human Services said the change could affect 20 percent to 50 percent of Medicaid recipients in nursing homes or other institutions. As a result, the department said, the Federal Government and the states will save a total of $160 million to $615 million over three years. $50 to $75 More a Month The rule will require additional payments averaging $50 to $75 a month by each Medicaid recipient in a nursing home who has income from a pension, Social Security or other sources, the department estimated. For at least 15 years, the Government has allowed Medicaid recipients to deduct certain medical expenses from their income before determining how much they must pay for nursing home care. The deductions reflect the cost of such items as eyeglasses, hearing aids, dentures, physical therapy and prescription drugs when those items are not covered by a state's Medicaid program. Nursing home residents may have deductions totaling $300 a month or more, Federal officials said. Under the new rule, states will be allowed for the first time to eliminate or curtail the deductions they must now permit for the costs of necessary medical care not covered by the state Medicaid plan. As a result, Medicaid recipients would have to pay more for nursing home care, while the Federal Government and the states pay less. The new rule assumes, in effect, that money spent on eyeglasses or hearing aids is available to pay for nursing home care. In a statement published in the Federal Register, the Administration said the purpose of the rule was to ''reduce administrative problems for states'' and to give them ''maximum flexibility'' in operating their Medicaid programs. The deductions tend to increase Medicaid program costs, it noted. But Toby S. Edelman, who represents nursing home residents as a lawyer with the National Senior Citizens Law Center, said: ''The new regulation reverses a longstanding policy of the Department of Health and Human Services. There was no Congressional action or judicial mandate calling for such a reversal.'' Congress could pass legislation to override the rule change, but has apparently not focused on the issue. Ms. Edelman also said: ''The department suggests that residents will have a choice of paying for nursing home care or for other medical services. But in reality there is no choice. They have to pay their share of nursing home costs, or else they can be evicted. Many nursing home residents will have to go without dentures or eyeglasses or prescription drugs or hearing aids.'' Broad Dependence on Medicaid The new rule is consistent with previous efforts by the Reagan Administration, which has tried, with some success, to slow the growth of social welfare programs while asking beneficiaries to bear more of the costs. About 70 percent of the 1.5 million nursing home residents depend on Medicaid to help pay for their care. A Medicaid recipient who lives in a nursing home must use virtually all of his or her income, after certain deductions, to pay the nursing home. Medicaid then pays the remainder of the cost, up to the reimbursement level set by the state. Medicaid is financed jointly by the Federal Government and the states. Nursing home officials gave this example of how the current rule works. Assume that a state has decided that a particular nursing home should receive $1,500 a month for the care of Medicaid patients. A nursing home resident might have income of $700 a month from Social Security and a private pension and might have to pay $175 for dentures and dental care in a given month. The individual is entitled to keep $25 a month for clothing and other personal needs. Under the current rule, the person gets deductions totaling $200 and must pay $500 for nursing home care. Medicaid pays the balance, $1,000. Reductions by States Likely Under the new rule, the person could still keep $25 for personal needs but the state could reduce or eliminate the deduction for medical expenses, so the nursing home resident would have to pay more. Describing the effects of the new rule, the Administration said that ''a state will be permitted to count more of recipients' income as available for paying for their institutional care.'' It predicted that there would be a ''reduction in state payments to nursing homes,'' matched by similar reductions in Federal payments. ''In most cases,'' it said, ''recipients voluntarily will assume the additional cost of paying for their institutional care'' and will forgo some of the medical services for which they lose deductions. In many cases, it said, these services are of ''marginal value.'' The Government said that most of the people affected by the new rule were women over 85 years old with income in the form of Social Security widows' benefits. Some are receiving welfare benefits under the Supplemental Security Income program, for the elderly, blind and disabled. Federal officials said the median income for nursing home residents receiving Medicaid benfits was $583 a month, or $6,996 a year. By definition, the number of people with income above the median is the same as the number below it. 'An Untenable Position' Thomas J. Jazwiecki, director of reimbursement policy at the American Health Care Association, which represents 9,000 nursing homes, said the new rule ''puts patients in an untenable position'' and could adversely affect nursing homes as well. ''Assuming that the institutional care is a necessity, the patient may not be able to pay for other needed services,'' he said. ''If a patient needs dentures or eyeglasses, the purchase of those items reduces the patient's financial resources, but may not be recognized under the Medicaid program. Thus, the nursing home will be paid less under the new rule than it would have received under the old rule, which made allowance for such expenses.'' The agency said that Medicaid recipients would probably use their available income to help pay for nursing home care rather than other medical services. For this reason, it said, the rule could have a ''major impact'' on providers of such services, including doctors, dentists and physical and occupational therapists.

1170-> Art Under The (Little) Big Top
Two dancers are flirting. He plays the oboe as she pirouettes toward him. Then he advances toward her, leaping and doing a somersault, only to be pushed away. It could be ballet or modern dance - but it's a tightrope act. Later, a young couple is doing a steamy tango. Suddenly, she is standing on her head in the palm of his hand. She remains there as he drops to the ground, rolls over and stands up again, all to the Latin rhythm. Such combinations of dance and acrobatics exemplify Le Cirque du Soleil, a circus from Quebec that has been drawing standing ovations in Canada and California for performances that are part circus, part theater. The four-year-old troupe, whose name means Circus of the Sun, will make its East Coast debut in Battery Park City in Manhattan on Wednesday. Adding Art to the Spectacle Le Cirque du Soleil is one of a handful of so-called new-wave circuses that try to present the circus as art, not merely spectacle. Participants perform in one ring to specially composed music, and try to establish an intimacy with the audience often lacking in the three-ring extravaganza that has become customary in the United States. Other such circuses include New York's Big Apple Circus, San Francisco's Pickle Family Circus and Australia's Circus Oz. But among them, Cirque du Soleil is the least traditional and the most theatrical, producing a brightly polished high-tech show that aims its appeal as much to adults as to children. Many of its acts are the same as those found in traditional circuses or Chinese acrobatic shows. Thirteen people ride one bicycle. Three men and two women balance on a tower of chairs. And a contortionist folds her body into shapes that are impossible to describe, let alone do. One big departure, however, is that there are no animal acts. From Tourists to Stars Technically, the acts are no more proficient than those found in other circuses. What really sets Cirque du Soleil apart is how the acts are packaged. There is no loud ringmaster here, warbling ''La-a-adies and ge-entlemen,'' no drum roll before each stunt. Instead of being composed of isolated acts, the circus flows from one act to another, and all the acts are loosely united by a common theme: A group of frumpy tourists wanders by mistake into a circus. The Queen of the Night appears in a cloud of smoke and transforms the motley visitors into circus performers wearing dazzling costumes, allowing each to act out his or her fantasies. Almost all the acts are choreographed to pulsating new-age music composed by the circus's musical director, Rene Dupere, and played live by a five-piece band. The music is so coordinated with the performance that each juggle seems to have its own special note. Like much of what is now called the new vaudeville movement, this circus had its origins in street performing. Guy Laliberte, the troupe's founder and president, abandoned his plans to study nuclear engineering in his late teens and began traveling around the world learning such skills as fire breathing and stilt walking. Support From Governments In 1984, the provincial Government of Quebec gave Mr. Laliberte, then 23 years old, a grant to organize a troupe of street performers as part of the celebration marking the 450th anniversary of the discovery of Quebec by Jacques Cartier. Le Cirque du Soleil has grown ever since, with backing from both the Canadian and Quebec Governments and several corporations. The 28 performers of the troupe are mainly in their 20's and not bound by old approaches. In a reversal of the usual roles, women occasionally lift up the men in the acrobatic numbers. And audience rapport is helped by the fact that the troupe's blue-and-gold tent seats only 1,750 people. This circus makes little use of conventional clown stunts and at times seems to mock that tradition. ''We hate circuses the way they're done right now,'' said Denis Lacombe, who is the troupe's leading clown. Mr. Lacombe, who prefers to call himself a ''visual comedian,'' presents one of the shows most crowd-pleasing acts: a portrayal of a symphony conductor who gets carried away by Tchaikovsky's ''1812 Overture,'' swaying so hard that his body is parallel to the floor. Mr. Lacombe performed the same act last year with the Big Apple Circus. Fred D. Pfening 3d, president of the Circus Historical Society, an organization of circus enthusiasts in Columbus, Ohio, said he believed that by appealing to adults, Le Cirque du Soleil attracts new audiences to the circus. ''It was almost like watching a Broadway production about a circus,'' he said. ''They've brought the yuppies back to the big top.''

1171-> Judge Orders Mistrial Over a Prankter's Note
The juror's friend thought it would be funny to leave a little note the other day. The joke prompted a mistrial. David Welch of Manchester, a friend of the juror, Alfred Palys, wrote a threatening note on one of his business cards and left it Monday on Mr. Palys' car. But Mr. Palys didn't see the note. Another juror did, and reported it. Mr. Welch had written: ''If you find me guilty, you're in big trouble, buddy.'' The juror who saw the card took it to the jury clerk, who gave it to the Superior Court clerk, who gave it to the judge, who declared a mistrial in the case of a man accused of disposing of stolen property. The County Attorney, Peter McDonough, said Mr. Welch did not deny writing the note, saying he knew his friend was a juror, but knew nothing about the trial. Mr. McDonough said Mr. Welch would not be charged. ''It just seems to be a bad practical joke rather than a criminal act,'' he said.

1172-> More Than a Club: It's Open House
HER outfit was simple, really, just a white jacket, black skirt and black-and-white striped stockings. But in the dim library, against oak specimen cases displaying stuffed flamingos and wolf skeletons, the young woman looked crisp and graphic as she took her billiard cue and leaned into her shot. Her friends, also casually well dressed, circled the table, chalking their cues. It was the top floor and the end of the evening at the new dinner club M.K., which could rival Ralph Lauren ads for taste and nonchalance. Only one young man looked troubled. ''I have to decide by tomorrow whether to move to Miami for a job promotion,'' he said. ''If I go, I'd be missing nights like this.'' M.K., which opened March 22, is the creation of Serge Becker, a designer, and Eric Goode, an artist and a founder of the downtown club Area, which closed last year. Starting with an old neo-classical bank building at 204 Fifth Avenue, between 25th and 26th Streets, they designed a kind of building-wide stage set for a larger-than-life town house, with a living room and bar downstairs, a dining room upstairs and a billiard room and bedroom on the top floor. Guests - about 600 to 700 most weekend evenings - leave their coats in an old vault in the basement. From 8 P.M. to 4 A.M., the four floors and individual rooms divide the guests into what seems to be a large house party. A cross between the ''21'' Club and Nell's - a downtown club furnished with antiques - M.K. might be compared to European clubs like Bains-Douches in Paris. M.K., which is not a membership club, takes dinner reservations. People without reservations may enter at the discretion of the door attendants. ''It's a reaction to huge clubs, which people over 25 are tired of; Area was completely the opposite of this,'' said Mr. Goode, who is 30 years old. ''I was getting older, and tired of staying up late. I could see going to a club for dinner, not dancing, and wanted to create a smaller club with an idea of exclusivity and intimacy.'' A three-course dinner in a dining area seating 100 is the centerpiece of a visit here; entrees range from $10 to $21. But the evening really progresses in long conversations that wind up and through the building. Guests meet downstairs by the bars, amid reproduction French antiques, and under the steady gaze of two stuffed Dobermans. After dinner, people adjourn for after-dinner drinks in the library, or meander on to a grand parlor bedroom and open bath, with its wraparound vanity and framed 19th-century sepia-toned pornographic photos. In the basement there is a small separate club for dancing that requires a membership card. It is not the transformation of a commercial space into a kind of house that makes M.K. unusual. The appeal is simply the charm of a slow, processional evening during which guests are led along to other parts of the building by such details as the bulldog hood ornaments set among the banister rails. It is a gathering place for New York's new fusion society, where professionals, models, society figures and artists mingle. The variety of haircuts perhaps tells the story: there are preppy cuts, 50's duck tails, ponytails, flying wedges, Junior League coifs, bald heads, hair tumbling in glorious free falls and hair gelled into unicorn horns. Originally the partners intended to make M.K. the fantasy home of an imaginary character. A possibility was a Peruvian billionaire with an interest in polo. ''It got too corny, too transparent,'' said Mr. Goode, though there are still vestiges of a ''character.'' ''An older gentleman, a weird guy, who collects art and a litte pornography,'' said Mr. Becker. The initials M.K. belong to the character. The interior is eclectic. To the well-proportioned main room, with classical details, the partners added low-tech elements like galvanized sheet-metal ducts. Fake art is on the walls. The effortless flow of an evening at M.K. is not simple serendipity. ''People like to travel in a space, move through; they're voyeuristic,'' said Mr. Goode.

1173-> Arthur M. Carter, 76, Afro-American Editor
Arthur M. Carter, a longtime editor and publisher of The Washington Afro-American newspaper, former managing editor of the Afro-American newspaper chain, and a former Pulitzer Prize juror, has died of cancer. He was 76 years old. Mr. Carter, who had headed the newspaper for 16 years until his retirement in 1986, died Sunday at the Washington Hospital Center. He received Editor of the Year honors from the National Newspaper Publishers Association and the Capital Press Club, of which he was a past president and founder. A Washington native, Mr. Carter attended Howard University and began his journalism career at the Afro-American chain in 1937 as a sports and police reporter. He was one of the country's few black correspondents in World War II, reporting from North Africa and Italy.

1175-> Education; 'Tom Sawyer' Still Tops Reading List
The winner and still the heavyweight champion of the books most read by American children in their free time is Mark Twain's ''Tom Sawyer.'' The National Endowment for the Humanities asked 60 public and private schools across the country about the books that pupils sought most for extracurricular reading. The results appear in a pamphlet, ''Summertime Favorites,'' aimed at encouraging more children to pick up the reading habit. Starting today, the endowment will mail copies of the pamphlet to each of the 14,456 school superintendents and 14,981 public libraries in the United States. The South Carolina Department of Education got wind of the project and asked for a copy for every schoolchild in the state, but the endowment decided that the 611,978 copies it would have to send to that state alone might do irreparable harm to its printing budget. Individuals can get a free copy of the pamphlet by writing to ''Summertime Favorites,'' National Endowment for the Humanities, Washington, D.C., 20506. Pamphlet Lists 400 Titles The booklet has 400 titles listed alphabetically and divided by age group, starting with Joy Adamson's ''Born Free'' for the youngest to Richard Wright's ''Black Boy'' and ''Native Son'' for the oldest. After ''Tom Sawyer,'' the most popular books, in order of the frequency of their appearance on schools' recommended reading lists, were ''The Hobbit'' by J. R. R. Tolkien, ''Jane Eyre'' by Charlotte Bronte, ''The Red Badge of Courage'' by Stephen Crane and, tied for fifth place, ''Animal Farm'' by George Orwell and ''Johnny Tremain'' by Esther Forbes. The endowment said many of the schools that submitted their supplementary reading lists had been recognized by the Department of Education as exemplary schools, while others had strong programs in the humanities. Those factors appear to have led to the inclusion of many challenging selections, some of them complex plays.

1176-> Budget Battle Is Heating Up In Albany
A major confrontation between the Legislature and Governor Cuomo seemed in the making today as they began to address ways to close what the administration says is a $900 million shortfall in the state budget. Mr. Cuomo, who has asked the Budget Director to submit recommendations for cuts by the end of the week, said he thought enough data for the fiscal year, which began April 1, were available to decide almost immediately how to close the gap. Budget Director Dall W. Forsythe argued that the lag in revenues would not be isolated to this year and would recur, requiring permanent spending cuts. Key lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, said it was too soon to tell whether the shortfall was more than a one-year problem resulting from the start of the revised Federal tax code. With an Eye on November They suggested that Mr. Cuomo should go ahead now with some actions he could take on his own, such as stretching out spending on some programs. But, they said, they wanted to wait until more data were in, after the November election, to decide whether any large-scale cutbacks were necessary. Cuts are certain to draw outcries from constituent groups, and legislators are up for re-election this year. Assembly Speaker Mel Miller said he thought the state should go ahead with most projects agreed to under the budget plan, but should commit to no new projects. 'Can't Keep the Red Ink Pouring' ''I think we should come back after the general election, take a look at our fiscal situation then, so you can make some decisions,'' Mr. Miller, Democrat of Brooklyn, said. ''But in the interim, I don't think the Governor shouldn't do some cutting back. He has to, you can't keep the red ink pouring.'' The Governor, who is not up for re-election until 1990, said: ''This is not something you can put off until after the November election on the ground, 'We will not make hard judgments before an election.' We must deal with this as soon as possible. We cannot run from this session. If the public believes we have faced this honestly, boldly, we will all be better off politically.'' On a day of finger pointing here -with the Governor, Comptroller and Speaker contending that they had long ago sounded the alarm of impending difficulties and blaming one another for the crisis - were these developments on the $28.4 billion budget, which was enacted five weeks ago: * Senate Republicans, who say it is too early in the fiscal year to have sufficient data, said they would call on outside accounting firms and consultants to examine the economy and budget to see whether the shortfall is real. They said they would oppose any cuts until the analyses are completed, at the earliest, next fall. * Income-tax cuts, which began last year and will not be fully phased in until 1991, appear safe for now. Republicans are adamantly against canceling or delaying them. Mr. Cuomo said, ''I said I would not suggest repealing the tax cut.'' Asked whether he would delay it, he did not rule that out, but said he would prefer to cut spending. Mr. Miller said he was opposed to delaying the cut. * The fate of a $650 million fund to build housing and repair roads and bridges was uncertain. Senate Republicans want to set much of the money aside as a reserve, in case they decide the shortfall is real. Mr. Miller wants to spend the money as intended. Mr. Cuomo said that his administration's stance was misunderstood Monday and that dipping into the fund was under consideration. * The administration sought to assure holders of state notes that they were secure. In a letter to Comptroller Edward V. Regan dated Monday, Mr. Forsythe wrote: ''Noteholders should be assured they will be repaid. The state has significant resources and stringent impoundment procedures to ensure this result.'' * Mr. Forsythe and the Governor continued to decline to specify what cuts were being considered. Mr. Forsythe said that commissioners had responded with suggestions for cuts. Administration officials said they were concentrating on aid to local governments and other local programs. Local aid accounts for 60 percent of the budget. Effect of Capital Gains Change The crucial debate is whether the shortfall is one-time or likely to recur. A recurring shortfall would be require permanent cuts in spending. The shortfall arises because 1986 was the last year taxpayers could take advantage of a lower rate on capital gains than on other income. As a result, many taxpayers sold stock and other investments in 1986 that they would otherwise not have sold until 1987 or later. That made for an increase in capital gains transactions in 1986, but for a decrease in 1987, leading to lower tax revenue. The administration argues that capital gains transactions will be down for years, in part because so many transactions that would have normally occurred in future years were completed in 1986. That view was tentatively shared today by Felix G. Rohatyn, the investment banker, who helped New York City work on its fiscal crisis in the 1970's. ''It sounds as if this might be a long-term thing,'' he said, ''because of the magnitude of the capital-gains realizations taken in '86.'' The administration is consulting with Mr. Rohatyn on the shortfall, as it has consulted with him on other issues. Mr. Forsythe is to meet with him Thursday. In part, aides to Mr. Cuomo seem to hope that the Rohatyn name will lend credibility in their fight with the Legislature. But, Mr. Miller said, ''I think things should probably stabilize over the next two calendar years.'' In any case, he said, no one could speak with any authority until after the figures through Aug. 15 were in. That is the date by which those who have received a filing extension must mail in their tax returns. PU ADD ALBANY Those Who Warned Throughout the day, officials tried to lessen any blame for the shortfall by saying they had warned about it. ''I told the Legislature, I said, 'Let's put it aside,' '' the Governor said. He was referring to making extra revenue from 1986 available in case of a shortfall. Said Mr. Cuomo: ''The Legislature overwhelmingly disagreed with me. It would have been better to have done it my way.'' Said Mr. Miller: ''I don't want to say I told you so but. . . . I said in February I thought the budget was too rich and the Governor's revenue projections were too high.'' Said Mr. Regan: ''Again and again I warned of the downside risk, $800 million. I said it as early as March 14.'' Despite their statements, none of the officials backed them up with actions - albeit politically difficult ones - to block the budget. Mr. Miller passed it. Mr. Cuomo approved it. Mr. Regan certified the projections. Asked about that, Mr. Regan said he thought the shortfall was manageable and did not warrant failing to certify the entire budget. Mr. Cuomo said he did everything he could to persuade the Legislature to act more prudently. He said if he had vetoed budget bills, he would have been overridden. Mr. Miller said that although some saw problems coming, ''we didn't think it was going to be as big as this.''

1177-> Batteries and Water
To the Editor: Your front-page article on New York's Suffolk County Legislature (May 19) says batteries are a major source of heavy metals in contaminated groundwater. You speak of the Suffolk County refundable deposit proposal for all types of batteries as a means to correct this problem. You do not, however, distinguish between household, lead-acid and other types of batteries. Speaking for the household-battery industry, I believe some misperceptions thus created should be addressed. Household batteries are not a major source of heavy metals found in groundwater. Studies conducted by international nonindustry bodies during the last 15 years have found that household dry-cell batteries disposed of in landfills present no special threat to ground-water quality. The Suffolk County Legislature bill is portrayed as the first of its kind to be introduced in the United States. Not true. Several states, such as Iowa and California, have introduced similar bills and, after having examined the evidence, decided that the removal of household batteries from the household waste stream is unnecessary.

1178-> Rising Aluminum Prices Spur Oversupply Fears
Economists and industry analysts have expressed concern that surging aluminum prices will encourage producing countries to increase their capacity further, which could lead to an oversupply in the future. ''The long-term outlook is not very rosy,'' said Euan A. Worthington, head of mining research for S. G. Warburg & Company in London. ''There has been a lot of capacity added this year already. And there is even more coming in the second half.'' Mr. Worthington predicted that worldwide aluminum capacity would increase by more than 20 percent over the next five years, while demand will grow at less than 4 percent a year. Spain Increases Capacity Venezuela, which is becoming a leading aluminum producer, increased capacity in March by 23,000 tons. In Spain, aluminum producers added 80,000 tons of capacity last month. Meanwhile, producers in the United States have increased capacity by 150,000 tons over the last year, according to S. G. Warburg. ''The market is very strong and the producers have seen the prices and they have jumped in,'' Mr. Worthington said. referring to the sharp increase in aluminum prices on the London Metal Exchange last week. ''Some countries, like Venezuela, are going all out to increase capacity.'' Higher Revenues Expected Until that occurs, the higher aluminum prices - now at record levels -will result in increased revenues and earnings for metals producers, who have suffered from low prices for a decade. But some industry executives would like to see a moderation of prices, saying that the higher prices will also accelerate substitution of other materials, such as plastics, steel and copper. On the London Metal Exchange, spot prices for aluminum reached $1.80 on Friday, compared with an average spot price of $1.33 in May and 71 cents a year ago. While domestic producers have been booking July orders at $1.06 a pound, the Midwest spot price is now $1.24 a pound. Analysts say the increases will fuel inflation, adding to the cost of a range of products including beverage cans, roofing materials and street lights. Customers Likely to Pay Industry executives, however, including William O. Burke, chairman and chief executive of the Reynolds Metals Company, said they did not expect the increases to add significantly to inflation, although the high prices are likely to be passed directly on to customers. Mr. Burke and other industry executives contended that the worldwide increases in production will not threaten the industry's long-term stability. They added that the supply of aluminum has tightened so much that additional capacity is needed. ''Demand has held up and people caught in short positions are scurrying to cover,'' Mr. Burke said. ''Some aluminum brokers have defaulted when they couldn't get the amount of metal they had committed to deliver.'' Mr. Burke added that worldwide inventories are at an all-time low, that production capacity is at 96 percent and that ''any strike or curtailed production from a power shortage will further aggravate this tight situation.''

1180-> Mexican Quits Race, Trying to Unite Left
With Mexico's presidential election just a month away, the candidate of the Mexican Socialist Party has withdrawn from the race in an effort to unite all of Mexico's major left-wing and nationalist parties behind a single candidate. In a move expected to strengthen the left's showing at the polls, Heberto Castillo, chosen by the Socialists as their candidate in a primary election last fall, announced his withdrawal from the campaign Friday. He said the party would invite Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, son of a former Mexican President and candidate of the populist National Democratic Front, to be its new standard-bearer. Mr. Cardenas said this weekend that he would be ''honored'' to accept the party's nomination, calling Mr. Castillo's offer ''a victory for the country's progressive forces and a transcendental development in Mexican national life.'' An agreement on the electoral alliance of the country's two most important left-wing groups is expected to be signed here Monday. Five Candidates Remain Mr. Castillo's withdrawal reduces to five the number of candidates running in the presidential election, which will be held July 6. Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the former Minister of Budget and Planning who is the candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, is expected to win handily. The ruling party has won every presidential and gubernatorial election since coming to power in 1929. Nevertheless, the decision of the major elements of Mexico's normally fractious left to unite behind Mr. Cardenas is regarded here as one of the most important developments in the campaign, the most seriously contested campaign in nearly 50 years. The alliance was formed after nearly a year of talks, which were broken off at least twice because of political and personal differences. Left Emerging as No. 2 Power Mexican political experts said this weekend that the alliance increases the chances that the left will emerge as Mexico's second largest political force after the voting. The most powerful opposition force in recent years has been the right-of-center National Action Party, which received 16 percent of the vote in the 1982 election but expects to improve its showing this year. In a news conference here this weekend, Mr. Castillo predicted the fusion of the left would create a ''multiplier effect'' in support for Mr. Cardenas during the month remaining in the campaign. Mr. Cardenas, a 54-year-old engineer, is a former member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party who led a dissident faction within the ruling party until breaking with his former colleagues less than a year ago. A former governor of the state of Michoacan, he is the son of Gen. Lazaro Cardenas, who as President of Mexico from 1934 to 1940 carried out a major land redistribution program and nationalized foreign oil companies. Candidate of More Than 15 Groups Mr. Cardenas has been running as the candidate of more than 15 parties and organizations, most of which have a nationalist or Social Democratic tinge. Mr. Castillo's party, formed last year, is itself a fusion of six left-wing parties, ranging from orthodox Communists to non-Leninist Socialists. The two groups that formed the alliance issued an invitation to Rosario Ibarra de Piedra, presidential candidate of the Revolutionary Workers' Party, a Trotskyist group, to join them in the coalition. But her supporters immediately rejected the offer, saying they did not regard Mr. Cardenas as a true socialist. Though Mr. Castillo said he thought Mr. Salinas ''is very worried, and rightfully so,'' there was no immediate official reaction from the ruling party. But a National Action Party leader condemned the leftist alliance, describing it as an electoral maneuver that ''seeks power for its own sake, not taking into account that Cardenas represents the vices and defects of the system.'' The ballots that will be cast by Mexico's 38 million registered voters are already being printed, so Mr. Castillo's name cannot be stricken from the list of candidates. But Mr. Castillo said at a news conference that Mexican electoral law permits votes cast in his name to be added to the total of Mr. Cardenas.

1182-> Irving Board Weighing Latest Takeover Offer
The board of the Irving Bank Corporation met yesterday but left unresolved a battle for control of Irving between the Bank of New York and Banca Commerciale Italiana. Bank of New York, which began its hostile takeover campaign in September, has been spurned four times by Irving's board, but the mood at yesterday's regular monthly meeting was less hostile than in recent months. ''There continue to be conflicting elements in this latest release, but the tone does sound better,'' said James J. McDermott, research director at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, an investment firm that specializes in the banking and savings industries. Robert A. Falise, an executive vice president of Irving who attended the five-and-a-half hour session at the bank company's midtown offices, said last night that the board considered the revised offer that a senior delegation of the Bank of New York had presented last Wednesday. Suitor's 'Attitude' Praised Mr. Falise said: ''The Irving board stated that although no decision has been made with respect to the offer, it is pleased that Bank of New York made the revised offer, and with the new attitude expressed by Bank of New York directors when the revised Bank of New York offer was presented.'' The Irving executive said that the board held off making a final decision until it clarifies certain legal and regulatory issues posed by the latest bid. Under that highly conditional offer, Bank of New York would give each Irving shareholder 1.675 of its own shares, plus $15 cash, a $2.50 dividend to be paid when the deal is final and up to $2.50 in dividends contingent on the profitable sale of Irving's headquarters at 1 Wall Street. At yesterday's prices, the package would be worth about $76. Bank of New York executives reached last night declined to comment. Irving's stock rose 12.5 cents yesterday, to $71.375, on speculation that Banca Commerciale would counter with a higher offer. The Milan-based bank, which has been a friendly suitor, had said it would not sweeten its offer before the board meeting. B.C.I. has most recently offered $80 a share for 51 percent of Irving's outstanding stock. The remaining shareholders would receive a $10 special dividend, for a total package that many analysts consider to be worth slightly less than Bank of New York's. A Promise to Meet Although Irving congratulated itself in its statement for taking recent action ''which has resulted in three increases in the B.C.I. offer and two increases in the Bank of New York offer,'' it promised to meet with both bidders soon to seek a final resolution. Irving said it wanted to explore whether the Federal Reserve Board would approve the latest Bank of New York offer in light of the bidder's own arguments to regulators against the Banca Commerciale bid. In a June 8 letter to the Federal Reserve, Bank of New York said the payment of special dividends by Irving in connection with the Banca Commerciale offer would violate Federal Reserve policies, an Irving spokesman said. The latest Bank of New York offer depends in part on the payment of special dividends. Litigation Might Be Dropped Irving, which has questioned whether Bank of New York had received sufficient shareholder support to issue the shares needed to complete the merger, suggested last night that Bank of New York hold a special shareholder meeting to approve its new offer. Irving also said it would not oppose a Federal Reserve decision to extend the deadline for Bank of New York to complete the offer. Irving also requested that Bank of New York stop its efforts to persuade the Federal Reserve to block Banca Commerciale's offer. And Irving dangled the possibility that it might drop its litigation against Bank of New York if that company reciprocated.

1184-> PALESTINIANS QUIT THE POLICE FORCE IN OCCUPIED AREAS
Palestinians working for the Israeli police in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip were resigning from their jobs tonight amid predictions that the entire 1,000-member Palestinian force would quit by Sunday. Police officials said almost 500 had already resigned in a dramatic protest that began Friday. A Western diplomat called the mass resignations the most significant blow against Israel's control of the occupied territories in three months of revolt that has killed at least 85 Palestinians. Elias Freij, a moderate Palestinian Mayor of Bethlehem, where a police station was attacked by demonstrators today, condemned the resignations of the Arab police officers. 'Big and Dangerous Vacuum' ''Their resignation will leave a big and dangerous vacuum,'' he said. ''There will be robberies and murders that will require police intervention.'' Israeli television said tonight that the occupation authorities would strongly resist any attempt by the Palestinians to form their own police force. The Palestinians in the Israeli police are not part of the security forces involved in quelling the uprising. Police officials said they work mostly in crime control and traffic departments. The resignations, the diplomat said, showed a profound erosion of loyalty toward the Israelis among some of the most prominent of the 17,000 to 18,000 Palestinians working for the occupation authorities. The resignations appeared to have expanded the revolt from the physical clashes between the Israeli Army and rock-throwing demonstrators to a fundamental challenge of authority. On the eve of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's departure for a visit to Washington, unrest continued today in Israel's occupied territories. Rally in Tel Aviv In Tel Aviv, an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 Israelis turned out for a rally sponsored by the Peace Now movement, which supports territorial concessions in return for a peaceful settlement of the Palestinian issue. ''I think that this shows an expression of sentiment in favor of the peace process among a growing number of Israelis,'' said Janet Aviad, one of the organizers. In clashes today between Israeli troops and Arabs, a 50-year-old Palestinian woman, identified in Palestinian reports as Safiyah Ibrahim, was shot and wounded in a West Bank refugee center after a car belonging to the Israeli prisons service was stoned. Last night, an army spokesman said, soldiers wounded a Palestinian who threw a grenade at an army patrol. The Palestinians have mainly used rocks and gasoline bombs against Israeli soldiers. In Bethlehem, demonstrators threw rocks and bottles at the Israeli police station, reflecting a deepening campaign to undermine official control in the occupied territories. A Clandestine Call The resignation from the police followed a call from a clandestine leadership of what Palestinians call the uprising in the occupied territories. In its latest communique, issued Thursday, the clandestine leaders urged Palestinians working as policemen or tax collectors for the Israelis to resign. By late yesterday, 300 policemen from the occupied West Bank south of Jerusalem were reported to have obeyed. Tonight, officials said 30 more had resigned in the northern part of the West Bank and 165 had resigned in Gaza. An Israeli police spokesman said the police were trying to persuade the officers, reportedly led by a self-appointed committee of 14 senior officers, to withdraw their resignations. Lieut. Mustafa Adawi, the ranking Palestinian officer in the police, desribed the mass resignation as ''national duty.'' He said a committee of 14 officers decided earlier in the week that if the clandestine leadership, known as the Unified National Leadership of the Uprising, repeated its call for officers to resign, then they would do so. He expected the entire force to resign by Sunday. Vulnerability Is Illustrated The leadership apparently is trying to break down Israeli control over the occupied territories by forcing the withdrawal of civilian Palestinian cooperation with the authorities. The vulnerability of Palestinians working for the Israelis has already been illustrated by the murder of two Palestinians - one an intelligence agent, the other a policeman - accused of collaborating with the authorities. Additionally, a radio station run by a faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization and based in Syria has broadcast the names of suspected collaborators. In many Palestinian villages, towns and refugee camps, demonstrators and political activists say they have lists of collaborators whom they are pressing to resign. Until the resignations of the last two days, the campaign against Palestinians working for the Israelis had scored no major or dramatic successes, and the resignations are certain to be taken as a sign of the influence wielded by the underground leadership of the revolt. The Israeli authorities have displayed deep concern about the resignations, seeking to suppress reports about their extent. In addition to the Peace Now rally in Tel Aviv, a small group of Israelis from a group called Stop the Occupation visited a Palestinian refugee camp near Ramallah in the West Bank today to display support for its occupants. As they were leaving, the Palestinians in the camp staged a demonstration against soldiers outside the camp, who fired tear gas. ISRAELIS RAID LEBANON TARGETS BEIRUT, Lebanon, March 12 (Special to The New York Times) - Israeli Air Force fighters attacked Palestinian guerrilla targets near the southern Lebanese port of Sidon today. A Palestine Liberation Organization spokesman said 10 people had been taken to hospitals. The Lebanese police and Palestinians said 10 buildings were destroyed in the raid, and the police said many people were feared buried by debris. Witnesses said six Israeli jets carried out the strike over 12 minutes. While three provided cover, the others fired 12 rockets at targets on three hills on the edges of two Palestinian refugee centers, Ain Hilwe and Mieh Mieh, according to the witnesses. The positions attacked belonged to four guerrilla groups: Al Fatah, the main guerrilla movement led by the P.L.O. chairman, Yasir Arafat; the breakaway Fatah Revolutionary Council led by Abu Nidal; the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a Marxist group, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, a pro-Libyan group. An Israeli military spokesman was quoted on the Israeli radio as saying that all planes returned safely and the pilots reported accurate strikes. The raid occurred five days after three Palestinian guerrillas hijacked a bus in southern Israel and were killed, along with three Israeli passengers, during a shootout with Israeli commandos. Al Fatah claimed responsibility for the operation.

1185-> John E. Nidecker, 75, Ex-Presidential Aide
John E. Nidecker, a White House aide in the administrations of Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford, and later a lay brother of the Episcopal Church, died of congestive heart failure Monday at Shady Grove Adventist Hospital in Rockville, Md., after a long bout with lung cancer. He was 75 years old and lived in Rockville. Mr. Nidecker triggered a major investigation of influence-peddling by South Korean officials in the 1970's. As the aide was returning from a Presidential mission to Seoul in 1974, a South Korean security officer handed him an envelope as a farewell gift. The incident occurred at a golf club. The envelope turned out to contain $10,000 in American currency. Mr. Nidecker turned it over to the American Embassy, which returned it to President Park Chung Hee. Two years later, a chain of other attempted bribes of American Government officials and members of Congress led to a Washington scandal. Mr. Nidecker, a native of Philadelphia, was with the Sun Oil Company for 13 years before he joined Cities Service Company in 1947. He was manager for business development when he joined the Nixon Administration in 1969 as a special assistant, continuing in that post under President Ford. In 1976 he became a lay member of the Episcopal Brotherhood of St. Gregory, serving in churches in the Washington area. He is survived by his wife, the former Jeanne Brodhead; two sons, Arnold, of Rosslyn, Pa., and Stephen, of Hyattsville, Md.; a brother, Arnold, of Devon, Pa., and three grandchildren.

1186-> How to Cure Abandoned Car Blight
New York, like a number of other big cities, faces an epidemic of abandoned cars. With Albany's approval, a new plan to get tougher with owners of derelicts could provide an answer. Eyesore hulks - windshields shattered and parts stripped by scavengers - deface the nation's streets in record numbers. In New York City last year, the Sanitation Department removed 128,733 abandoned cars, up from 105,000 in 1986 and 31,000 in 1981. The tide continues to rise. A year ago, New York City began using identification numbers on engine blocks to track plateless jalopies to their last registered owners, who can then be held liable for a $500 fine. Yet the program lacks bite. The state Department of Motor Vehicles interprets the law narrowly to require that violators be served summonses in person, not by mail. But the city doesn't have the manpower to do that for the 60,000 derelict owners identified so far. Fewer than 2,000 fines have been collected. The city's bill would give localities the authority to serve summonses by mail, make mandatory the maximum $500 fine and require suspension of scofflaws' licenses. Enforcement would be further simplified by requiring owners to notify the D.M.V. of all sales or other disposals of vehicles. While the agency gives lip service to the proposal, it jeopardizes passage by fixating on the personnel and computer programming costs of administering the new law. Yet a modest transfer fee could be imposed to cover most if not all the added expense - a drop in the bucket compared with the millions in fines that would be collected. In a legislative session marked by discord over a budget deficit, lawmakers ought to embrace this rare chance to make an improvement in the city's quality of life, and make money in the bargain.

1187-> Gerardus Wiarda, 81, European Court Jurist
Gerardus Wiarda, a Dutch jurist who was president of the European Court for Human Rights, died at his home here on Saturday, a relative said today. He was 81 years old. Mr. Wiarda had been in ill health for the last few years, the relative said. Born in Amsterdam in 1906, Mr. Wiarda finished his legal studies at Amsterdam's Municipal University in 1929. After practicing law in Rotterdam and serving as a judge at Amsterdam's district court, Mr. Wiarda was appointed a member of the Dutch Supreme Court in 1950. During his 26-year tenure there, the last four of which he served as the court's president, Mr. Wiarda earned a reputation as a progressive jurist on social and judicial issues. After his retirement in 1976, he was appointed as a judge at the European Court for Human Rights in Strasbourg, France. In 1981 he was named president of the 18-member human rights panel for the 21-nation Council of Europe.

1188-> Furloughs From Common Sense
Who would give a weekend pass to a convicted murderer? Massachusetts prison officials have done that during the administration of Gov. Michael Dukakis. The practice hardly warrants Vice President George Bush's mock shock. But it deserves more explanation. Many state prison systems allow inmates with good records to apply for short furloughs in the months before their release on parole. Prisoners are supposed to use such furloughs to find work or housing and otherwise ease the transition back to freedom. But there was no such transition in sight for a Massachusetts murderer named Willie Horton. He had been serving a life sentence without parole. His furlough couldn't be justified as preliminary to release. Yet he was furloughed, escaped, and later was caught in a police shootout after raping a woman and torturing her companion in Maryland. By way of justification, Massachusetts officials offer double-talk. Prisoners serving life without parole sometimes have their sentences commuted, they say, thus making a prerelease furlough appropriate. But that makes no sense: furloughs are useful only after a murderer's sentence has already been commuted. The furlough policy evidently took an ill-advised turn in Massachusetts simply because no one took the trouble to think it through. Mr. Dukakis, who inherited from his predecessor the furlough rules under which Willie Horton was released, promptly ended furloughs for those serving life without parole. He first resisted a new law, arguing that he could suspend furloughs administratively. As furor grew, he went along with a legislated ban. By using the Horton episode to portray the Massachusetts governor as soft on crime, Mr. Bush does a disservice not only to his opponent but also to the usually practical idea of prerelease prison furloughs. But Mr. Dukakis remains accountable: he oversaw, and overlooked, the poor administration of an otherwise sensible policy, until tragedy struck.

1190-> Festival's Impact Estimated at $400 Million
Martin E. Segal, chairman of the First New York International Festival of the Arts, said at a news conference yesterday that he expects the festival to generate $400 million for the economy of New York City. ''That's the low side of our original estimate,'' Mr. Segal said, ''but that's still considerably over what the city would have had if there hadn't been a festival.'' He said the income would result from ''visitors, employment, shopping, restaurants and the like.'' Mr. Segal later said that his prediction was ''a hunch, based on what I've learned from the hotels, restaurants and transportation people.'' He said attendance at festival events, which included many sellouts, ''might average 75 percent of capacity.'' Paul Libin, producing director of the Circle in the Square Theater, also appeared at the press conference and announced that the theater's sold-out presentation, ''Juno and the Paycock,'' was adding another performance on Saturday at 2 P.M. ''Juno'' will close after the Saturday evening performance. Others at the press conference also said the festival had helped ticket sales. Jacques d'Amboise credited the festival with having caused his annual National Dance Institute program to sell out for the first time in 12 years. Francis Thorne, chairman of the American Composers Orchestra, said the success of the ''All-Ellington'' evening at Carnegie Hall reduced the year's deficit of his organization to $10,000 from $30,000. Ken Marsolais, the producer of ''Stars of the Morning Sky,'' said, ''Business now looks very good.'' Mr. Segal also provided a breakdown of the $4.5 million he raised for festival programs. The largest amounts went to theater events ($1.7 million) and music presentations ($1.7 million). Smaller amounts went to dance ($703,713), multi-arts ($200,434), symposiums ($83,267) and film and television ($82,500).

1196-> ONE MYSTERY ENDS; ANOTHER ENDURES
Ending months of investigation and uncertainty, two college students who vanished here in April surfaced in San Diego and called their parents Tuesday, the police said today. Scott Swanson, 23 years old, and Carolyn MacLean, 22, both students at suburban Wheaton College, were at the center of a case that had tormented friends and family members and baffled the authorities who were searching for them in at least five states. The couple, who secretly married on March 26, disappeared April 2, failing to show up at the home of Mr. Swanson's parents in Elgin, Ill., for Easter. That night, Ms. MacLean's red BMW was found in a downtown alley here with the keys in the ignition and the engine running. Mr. Swanson's wallet, the couple's credit cards and clothing were found in the trunk. Since then, none of the couple's friends or family had heard from them until Tuesday when both sets of parents received letters from the couple and, later that night, a telephone call from them. The parents then got in touch with the police and went to San Diego today, the police said. A Flight to California The young couple apparently flew to California, the police said, but it was unclear what they had been doing since their disappearance. At a news conference today, the police said that the disappearance involved no criminal activity and that the couple faced no charges. ''We are not trying to impose discipline, which should have been given by the parents years ago,'' said Edward Wodnicki, chief of the Detective Division. At Wheaton College, a nondenominational Christian school where Mr. Swanson was a senior and Ms. MacLean a junior, the two were described as well-liked, deeply religious and loving toward their families. They disappeared just weeks before Mr. Swanson's scheduled graduation, when he was to have been commissioned a second lieutenant in the Army. The police suspected foul play at first and used an airplane equipped with infrared devices able to detect bodies to track the couple's path. The authorities called a meeting of law-enforcement officers from Illinois, Michigan and Indiana and sent evidence from the couple's abandoned car to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for analysis. The police said today that they might seek restitution for money spent on the investigation. But lawyers for the city said the police department would not likely be reimbursed because the couple had no legal responsibility to disclose their whereabouts. ''I'm glad that Scott and Carolyn are safe,'' said Ettore DiVito, commander of the Youth Division. ''I am somewhat disheartened that we expended so many man-hours on this case. They caused anguish and heartbreak to their friends and families.'' 'We Would Welcome Them' The couple are no longer considered students at Wheaton College. ''If they elect to come back, they will have reapply like any other students who withdraw,'' said Patricia Swindle, a spokeswoman for the college. ''We would welcome them back.'' Officials at the college planned to meet to determine what, if any, disciplinary action to take against the two. As a bell tolled from the tower of Wheaton's Blanchard Hall to celebrate the discovery of the couple, those who knew them were trying to figure out why they would subject their family and friends to three months of anguish. ''We're all happy that they're alive and well,'' said Violet Capizzi, a next-door neighbor of the Swanson family. ''But as things simmer down, people are going to get steamed that so many people put in so much effort to try to find them. They took a lot of time out of people's lives.'' Ms. MacLean's parents, James and Kathleen MacLean of Haddonfield, N.J., flew to Chicago and spent two weeks helping search for the couple before returning home. Later, the family received periodic telephone calls in which the caller never spoke. After arriving in San Diego tonight, Mr. MacLean told reporters, according to The San Diego Tribune: ''They weren't running from us; they ran to something else: interest in perfect love.''

1197-> Review/Dance; Pina Bausch's 'Carnations' in U.S. Premiere
''The Man I Love'' by George Gershwin, repeated several times during the evening, is the theme song of Pina Bausch's dance-theater piece ''Carnations,'' which was given its United States premiere Tuesday night at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Love can be viewed only in its ironic, if not cruelest, aspects in any Bausch work. Nonetheless, the impasse in male-female relations usually evoked by the West German choreographer yields here to a tapestry of less violent images than expected. The entire stage is covered with fake carnations, and if the men tend to wear dresses most of the time, they act like children and not adults. In ''Carnations,'' humans tend to hurt themselves rather than others. People have to be taught how to love, Miss Bausch seems to suggest. Toward the end, the cast actually asks the members of the audience to rise (it is a commentary on social conditioning that nearly everyone does) and teaches them how to hug. The joke is that the gestures that everyone is invited to imitate look merely like arms folded at some distance from the chest. It is only when the dancers approach individual spectators and slip into what is really an embrace that the point comes across. For all its humor (and there is a considerable dose), ''Carnations'' asks how love is possible in the world in which we live. The occasional sight of two German shepherds on patrol with their trainers at the rear of the stage shows Miss Bausch at her most metaphorically direct. The motif of the world as police state is never lost. Repeatedly, the performers are asked to show their passports by a ubiquitous master of ceremonies-secret police official. Add four professional stuntmen who don't have to strain to look thuggish and whose duties, among other things, include jumping down from two high scaffolds, and a deliberately disquieting element comes into play. The sinister and the mellow constantly mesh. The image that greets the public at the start is completely romantic. The entire stage is covered with silk and scented carnations. Each flower is individually planted in a small hole. One doesn't have to be a genius to understand the symbolism of a field of flowers that ends up trampled after two hours. But one can appreciate the fact that Miss Bausch does have an indisputable genius of her own for observing human behavior and processing that raw material through an artistic blender. ''Carnations'' (''Nelken'' in German) is typical of her method. A patchwork of disparate episodes, seemingly totally irrelevant to one another, accumulate into an emotional texture that is left open to individual interpretation. Nonetheless, there is always some subtext at hand that guides the tone of each piece. ''Carnations,'' created in 1983 for Miss Bausch's company, Tanztheater Wuppertal, and which continues through Sunday afternoon, does not have the consistency that the 1986 ''Viktor'' had last week when that piece opened the company's engagement as part of the First New York International Festival of the Arts. Every moment had a vividness in ''Viktor.'' ''Carnations'' has lapses that seem to emerge from the psychodrama that Miss Bausch uses as a compositional technique. The confessions the performers make to the audience are rooted in real experience, but not everyone's experiences, when screamed out, are of interest. Nonetheless, ''Carnations,'' like ''Viktor,'' has a stunning richness and psychological aptness. One of the most striking sections shows Silvia Kesselheim cowering in a corner as the stuntmen approach menacingly. Yet none lay a hand upon her. Instead, each stands on a table and throws himself upon its surface; each time she cries out as if she herself had been hurt. A student of pioneering German movement theorists, Miss Bausch knows well that people can empathize kinetically with emotions and pain suffered by others. Many of the seemingly odd gestures the Bausch dancers make are in fact drawn from exercises devised by the movement theorist Rudolf von Laban and are also seen in the recent ballets of William Forsythe, who has studied Laban's work. There is a serious underpinning to Miss Bausch's work, and she is certainly the most serious of artists. She also knows how to entertain, and she has a superbly trained group of performers who can transform every facial muscle: a coy, simpering look moves easily into a more typical tough, tight-lipped mode. To see Miss Kesselheim peeling a potato while Billie Holiday sings of finding romance in the dark is a study in minute irony. Much of ''Carnations'' uses the conceit of life as a game. All the players are noticeable but some are notable - especially Jan Minarik, who acts as the master of ceremonies; Lutz Forster, who interprets ''The Man I Love'' in sign language as Sophie Tucker sings; Dominique Mercy, who is a male ballet virtuoso giving the public what it wants in a section that suddenly concerns itself with why dancers dance, and Urs Kaufmann, who leapfrogs through the flora.

1198-> Reagan Vows Speed on Meese Successor
The White House said today that it would move quickly to nominate a successor to Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d even though there is little time left in the Reagan Administration for the Senate to complete the laborious confirmation process. Mr. Meese, who plans to leave the Justice Department late this month or in early August, met today with President Reagan at the White House and provided him with a list of possible successors. ''There were a few names on the list,'' said the Attorney General's chief spokesman, Patrick Korten. ''He plans to go back later with a longer list.'' Mr. Korten declined to identify any of Mr. Meese's candidates. Capital Abuzz With Names Others within the Administration were not so reticent, and the capital was abuzz with the names of possible nominees for Attorney General, including at least two men who have already held the job. Separately, the President briefly discussed the search for a successor with his chief of staff, Kenneth M. Duberstein, and the White House counsel, A. B. Culvahouse, a spokesman said. ''We'd like to have a candidate to replace the Attorney General before he leaves, but you can't predict what the timetable will be,'' said the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater. ''We are beginning the search immediately.'' Justice Department officials had speculated that, with only six months left in the Reagan Presidency, the White House might make use of a special constitutional provision that would permit appointment of a new Attorney General without Senate approval. Fast Procedure Ruled Out But the White House today seemed to rule out the procedure, which would require the President to make the appointment in a Senate recess. Although the Attorney General had long indicated he might resign, White House officials conceded today that they had no contingency plan to find a replacement for Mr. Meese, who announced Tuesday that he planned to resign. ''We had an Attorney General up until yesterday,'' Mr. Fitzwater said. ''We don't compile lists for positions where they're already filled.'' As the White House began its search, Mr. Meese continued a public relations offensive designed to blunt whatever bad news might be contained in an independent prosecutor's still-secret report on the Attorney General's conduct. Mr. Meese, who granted interviews today to the three major television networks and Cable News Network, said again that the decision by the prosecutor, James C. McKay, not to seek an indictment was a ''complete vindication.'' He acknowledged that he and his lawyers had not yet seen the report, which is expected to be made public this summer. Laxalt Among Those Named According to Justice Department and Congressional officials, several prominent Republicans have been mentioned as potential successors to Mr. Meese. They include Paul Laxalt, a close friend of Mr. Reagan who retired from the Senate last year; Pete du Pont, the former Governor of Delaware; Representative Henry J. Hyde, Republican of Illinois, and even William French Smith, Mr. Meese's predecessor as Attorney General. At a news conference today, Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, put forward the names of Elizabeth H. Dole, the former Transportation Secretary, and Griffin B. Bell, who was Attorney General under President Carter. Within the Administration and on Capitol Hill, officials said it was critical that a replacement for Mr. Meese be named quickly. ''We haven't had an Attorney General for two years,'' said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a New York Democrat who is a frequent critic of Mr. Meese. ''So if we could have one for the next six months, it would be an improvement.'' Two Await Confirmation The lawyers now serving as Deputy Attorney General and Associate Attorney General, the second and third-ranking positions at the Justice Department, are still awaiting confirmation by the Senate. Until the Senate approves their nominations, they would be barred from assuming Mr. Meese's duties, even for a short time. Most of his powers would instead be handed over to Solicitor General Charles Fried, the department's chief advocate before the Supreme Court and the highest-ranking official at the agency who has already been confirmed by the Senate. Administration officials said it was possible that the Acting Deputy Attorney General, Harold G. Christensen, might be nominated as Attorney General. But the officials cautioned that lawmakers might balk at confirming Mr. Christensen, a Utah lawyer who has no experience as a prosecutor. The Constitution permits the President to make appointments for positions subject to Senate confirmation while the Senate is in recess. The appointee then serves until the end of the next session of Congress, which in this case would leave the new Attorney General in place until President Reagan leaves office next January. The Senate goes into a short recess later this month. Meese as Bush Liability But Reagan Administration officials appeared today to rule out the procedure, saying instead that the President intended to present a nominee for Senate confirmation, a process that, in Mr. Meese's case, took more than a year. In televised interviews today, the Attorney General acknowledged that his continued presence at the Justice Department might have been a liability to Vice President Bush, whose Presidential campaign has been dogged by questions about the ethical standards of Reagan Administration officials. ''I'm sure that from a political standpoint, that any person who has been controversial for whatever reason, rightly or wrongly, is something that no candidate in any campaign wants to have if it can be avoided,'' Mr. Meese said. He said he had ''no concerns'' about reports that the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility might still conduct an inquiry of his conduct in office. Department officials had previously insisted that there would be no internal investigation if Mr. Meese stepped down. But they said today the earlier statements were inaccurate, and that the director of the Office of Professional Responsibility, Michael E. Shaheen, could still order an investigation. Mr. Shaheen had been expected to review the findings of the independent prosecutor, Mr. McKay, to determine whether the Attorney General had breached Government ethics rules. Mr. McKay's investigation was focused on possible violations of criminal law. It is unclear what penalty, if any, Mr. Shaheen might impose on the Attorney General after Mr. Meese left office. Department officials said that even with Mr. Meese's departure, Mr. Shaheen might consider the investigation as valuable, if only in the preparation of guidelines for the conduct of Justice Department employees.

1199-> Key Step Taken in Times Sq. Redevelopment
The long-delayed plan to redevelop Times Square took an important step off the drawing board yesterday as New York City and State officials announced that they had signed detailed development agreements for four office towers, to be built at two intersections of 42d Street. The agreements mean that work will begin on the towers, at Broadway and at Seventh Avenue, before next spring, the officials said. The agreement was signed with a development concern, Times Square Center Associates, a joint venture between Park Tower Realty and the Prudential Insurance Company of America. ''Today is day 1 of a revitalized 42d Street,'' Governor Cuomo said yesterday. Veronica Hackett, executive vice president of Park Towers, said ''we will move quickly'' on the project. Returning the City's Soul The towers, the shortest at 31 stories and the tallest at 58 stories, would anchor a development scheme that the New York State Urban Development Corporation said is ''the most massive urban renewal plan ever launched in the country.'' A merchandise market and hotel are planned for the east side of Eighth Avenue at 42d Street, but no developers have been found. Nine theaters along 42d Street are to be renovated, and the Times Square subway station is to be rebuilt, with most of the work paid for by Times Square Center Associates. If the entire project is completed, it would return 42d Street to ''its place as a thriving commercial and cultural district that is part of the very soul of New York City,'' Mayor Koch said. Seeing Is Believing The development agreements, which run more than 5,000 pages, include 99-year leases on the property where Times Square Center Associates plans its office towers. The accords were signed Monday night by the developers and several government agencies, including the Urban Development Corporation, the New York City Public Development Corporation and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. But the project, first proposed more than a decade ago, still faces several hurdles. Some officials said yesterday that they will not believe redevelopment will occur until they see the demolition of many of the buildings that now line much of 42d Street between Broadway and Eighth Avenue. Even with the signing of the leases, the four towers have a long way to go. The developers must buy the land from the current owners and find tenants. One thing that may delay or even prevent the redevelopment is an assortment of legal challenges. ''Our aim is to prevent condemnation,'' said Senator Franz S. Leichter, a Manhattan Democrat who has joined Councilwoman Carol Greitzer and several Times Square property owners in filing three lawsuits to block the project. More Than 25 Suits Filed The lawsuits assert that the redevelopment plan, approved by the Board of Estimate in 1984, has changed and should be voted on again. One objection is that the plan is proceeding for the office towers even though no developers have been found for the proposed hotel and merchandise market. Since it was conceived in the late 1970's, more than 25 lawsuits against the plan have been dismissed or dropped, and state officials said yesterday that the suits still pending raise no new issues. But Mr. Leichter said opponents of the plan might seek a temporary restraining order against condemnation. Meanwhile, state officials said they were in difficult negotiations with a developer for the proposed merchandise market. 'A Much Sweeter Deal' Vincent Tese, chairman of the Urban Development Corporation, said the state was ''very close'' to an agreement with Joseph P. Kennedy Enterprises Inc., the Kennedy family concern that owns Chicago's Merchandise Mart. In order to induce the Kennedy concern or other developers to build a similar market on 42d Street, Mr. Tese said ''we will have to offer a much sweeter deal'' in tax breaks and other economic incentives than has been granted to the developers of the four office towers. And even if the Kennedy concern or another developer agreed to build a market, the plan would face a legal challenge from developers and public officials in Queens who argue that the market would harm the new International Design Center, a furniture exposition center in Long Island City. Claire Shulman, the Queens Borough President, said in an interview yesterday that she plans to introduce a resolution to the Board of Estimate today that would prevent use of the proposed 42d Street market for furniture shows. Despite the remaining problems, however, several officials said yesterday that final agreement on the four towers had been the crucial step toward completion of the entire redevelopment plan. Will Spend $80 Million ''With these agreements we know that the days of blight and crime on 42d Street are numbered,'' said Carl Weisbrod, president of the 42d Street Development Project, a state agency set up to manage the development effort. Slightly more than 9 acres of land -out of 13 acres in the Times Square redevelopment area - is covered under the agreements released yesterday. The land includes the sites of the four office towers - on the northeast and southwest corners of 42d and Broadway and the northwest and southwest corners of 42d and Seventh Avenue - and the nine theaters on 42d Street between Seventh and Eighth. In all, the joint venture that is developing the four towers has agreed to spend $80 million on public improvements, with most of the money dedicated to extensive renovation of the Times Square subway station. The 99-year leases, which were made public yesterday, include 15-year tax breaks and other complex provisions that officials said are a major economic inducement for the developer. At the same time, the officials said the provisions make certain that the city will receive higher tax revenues from the land than it currently receives. Rising Vacancy Rate A major uncertainty, though, is how much money the developer will pay for the Times Square property once it has been condemned. Experts said the current landowners are likely to ask for a high price, arguing that the property is now part of an improving area with corporate cachet. Another uncertainty is how difficult will it be to find tenants for the towers, especially with several other new office buildings scheduled to open in midtown Manhattan before the towers are completed. The four towers are scheduled to be finished in 1991 and 1992, Ms. Hackett said. Indeed, with the city's office vacancy rate on the rise, analysts maintain that the number of empty offices is likely to peak, and then begin shrinking by the time the Times Square towers are completed. Provisions of the leases provide that if the developers suffer economic hardship they will be partly compensated through steeper tax breaks.

INTERNATIONAL A3-19 The strongest hurricane to hit the Western Hemisphere in the 20th century slammed into Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula with 23-foot waves and wind gusts of up to 218 miles per hour, forcing the evacuation of tens of thousands of people.

1202-> Reagan and Hungarian Chief Discuss Trade
President Reagan met today with Prime Minister Karoly Grosz of Hungary and discussed closer economic ties between the two countries. At the same time, the Administration received little encouragement from Mr. Grosz that the Soviet Union might be ready to withdraw some of its 65,000 soldiers now stationed in Hungary. American officials describe Hungary as being on the ''cutting edge'' of economic change in Eastern Europe, and they say that Mr. Grosz, who is also the head of his country's ruling Communist Party, was invited here to encourage that trend throughout the region. Aside from Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, he is the only Communist Party leader of an Eastern bloc nation to visit the Reagan White House, and the first senior Hungarian leader to come here in 42 years. Mr. Reagan used the occasion to lobby for American companies, and even urged the Hungarian leader to purchase American-built aircraft, according to a senior Government official. The President ''stressed what good planes we have,'' the official added. Earlier this month, Administration officials suggested that a Soviet troop withdrawal might be imminent. Mr. Grosz, however, said that a withdrawal would have to be linked to reciprocal removal of troops of the Western alliance in central Europe. Mr. Reagan seemed impressed with Mr. Grosz, who became party leader in May, and his praise for the Hungarian leader echoed the compliments he has paid Mr. Gorbachev. In a departure ceremony at the White House today, the President said the visit ''marks an historic stage in U.S.-Hungarian relations,'' and said of Mr. Grosz, ''We've been impressed with your openness to new ideas.'' But the President, who repeatedly extolled the virtues of free enterprise and political freedom during his visit to Moscow in May, also took the occasion to instruct Mr. Grosz on the importance of these values. ''I hope you'll remember what you've seen here,'' he said, ''about the strength to be found in a society that is free, in a society committed to upholding fundamental human rights and open to diverse opinion and talent.'' In his reply to the President, Mr. Grosz seemed to agree, saying: ''Hungary has to face enormous tasks today. It will reorganize its economy. This can only be done, we are aware, if the people, if the citizens, will enjoy more rights, more freedoms. Therefore, we are modernizing our political system and our political practice.'' A senior Administration official, briefing reporters about the visit, said Hungary had made considerable progress on human rights. But he pointed out that some Hungarians are still denied passports, and that American diplomats are ''not always happy'' with how the Hungarian police deal with demonstrations. Hopes for Soviet Pullout Dashed After a speech at the National Press Club on Tuesday, Mr. Grosz answered a question by saying he could ''envisage any sort of a system'' in Hungary, including a multi-party system. But he cautioned that a one-party system was a historical fact, and broadening the range of parties ''is not one of the first priorities'' of his Government. The senior official acknowledged that American hopes for a Soviet troop withdrawal went unfulfilled. ''We thought that there perhaps might be something coming out in a unilateral fashion, but that didn't jell,'' he said. ''So now it's very difficult to say under what circumstances they might move.'' At the press club, Mr. Grosz seemed to place conditions on any immediate move, saying that other armed forces in the West ''would have to be disbanded or withdrawn as well.'' The talks on economic issues today seemed more encouraging. Mr. Grosz said that one area of ''great promise'' in relations would be for American companies to purchase partial or even total control of Hungarian companies, the senior official said. Mr. Grosz also expressed his hope of building an ''international university'' in his country, staffed in part by American and other Western professors, the official added.

1203-> Since 1805, a Family Saved It All
HISTORIC preservationists never had it so good. Usually, when piecing together the contents of a once-grand mansion, they must dig through local records and scour the region for furnishings from a particular period. Not so at Montgomery Place, a classical revival house with 10 bedrooms set 180 feet above the Hudson River here in northern Dutchess County. The 434-acre estate, which has several gardens, outbuildings and a commercial orchard, was for nearly two centuries the summer retreat of the Livingston family, whose members made their mark in politics, in the military and in New York social circles. The estate was opened to the public last month after two years of preservation work, which is still in progress. But the job was made easier because the house came with everything, from every decade. ''The richness of what's on the property is remarkable,'' said Richard F. Halverson, the president of Historic Hudson Valley, a nonprofit museum in Tarrytown that is overseeing the renovation. ''The family had a great sense of its own history.'' The museum, formerly called Sleepy Hollow Restorations, bought the sagging house for $3 million in early 1986 from a descendant of the Livingston family, J. Dennis Delafield of New York City. He, in turn, donated the entire contents of the house, from the most mundane to the most extraordinary, collected by generations that abhorred throwing things out. ''We got tennis shoes, Brillo boxes and copies of New York magazine from 1983,'' Mr. Halverson said, ''along with letters from the first 13 Presidents, Gilbert Stuart paintings, children's toys from the 1840's and the compass from the Clermont,'' the first commercially successful American steamboat, designed by Robert Fulton. More than 125 people - including designers, restoration experts, horticulturists and subcontractors - have participated in the $7 million project over the last two years. While the interior of the main house has been restored, at least two years of work remain to be done on the facade - an assemblage of Corinthian columns, scalloped lintels, swags and fan windows. The wealth of material in the house has taken out much of the guesswork, but it has made the restoration a slow, meticulous affair. One walk-in closet held 60,000 documents, from 19th-century fruit-tree orders to family letters. A trunk filled with rolls of old wallpaper sat in the attic, while pieces of an original balustrade were stashed in the garage. According to Mr. Halverson, 8,000 objects and 8,000 books were left in the house; so far, Historic Hudson Valley has catalogued only 3,000 of the objects. ''There seems to have been a museum ethic at work here,'' he said, ''even though they weren't museum people.'' The main portion of the house was completed in 1805 under the direction of Janet Livingston Montgomery, whose husband, Richard Montgomery, was killed during the Quebec campaign in 1775, two years after they were married. When she died in 1828, the house went to her youngest brother, Edward Livingston, who was a member of the House of Representatives, mayor of New York City, United States Senator, Secretary of State and Minister to France. Edward Livingston died in 1836, and his family took control of the property. They hired the architect Alexander Jackson Davis, who designed several additions between 1843 and 1863, transforming the house's style from Federal to neo-classical. The property drifted through generations, finally falling to Maj. John White Delafield, who lived there until his death in 1985. While the other four properties owned by Historic Hudson Valley are frozen in time, reflecting one period, Montgomery Place is presented as a continuum. In the kitchen, for example, the march of technology is evident in the juxtapostion of an open hearth, warming ovens from the 19th century and a modern stove, as well as three refrigerators from different decades of the 20th century. Elsewhere, the furnishings, wallpapers and rugs are drawn from three distinct interior styles - rococo revival, Gothic revival and Empire. ''The continuum theory is becoming more of a trend in historic preservation,'' said Cynthia E. Grant, the site manager. ''Twenty years ago, we would have wanted to take off the layers to get back to an earlier moment in time. But if you keep lopping off the 20th century and the late 19th century, we're going to have a gap in our visual history.'' A few family tastes seemed to remain constant, however, notably a love of floral patterns, plants and pets. A pet cemetery lies just beyond the herb garden with tombstones commemorating Gyp (1822-1837), Cocoa (1852-60), Dermot (1924-39) and Cotton ''Companion Cat'' (1952-1969). The grounds of the estate command as much attention as the house. Over the decades, family members -some of whom were amateur botanists - shaped a nature lover's paradise. At various times, it consisted of a nursery, an arboretum, a conservatory, a formal garden, an informal ''rough'' garden, an herb garden, a vegetable garden and a 100-acre commercial orchard with 5,000 fruit trees. When the property was bought two years ago, the gardens were lost to weeds, but most have since been brought back to life. The orchard is still in operation, and Historic Hudson Valley is trying to make it profitable. Still to be rejuvenated is the vegetable garden, planted earlier in this century when the house was occupied by Gen. John Ross Delafield and his wife, Violetta White. Gardening records list 50 vegetables that once grew there, including some offbeat varieties like Henderson's Famous Prosperity Pea, White Velvet Okra and the Mammoth Sandwich Island Oyster Plant. ''I wonder where I'm going to find these,'' Julie Schaller, the resident horticulturist, said wistfully. Before coming to Montgomery Place, Ms. Schaller worked as an associate horticultural scientist at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. She was recently placed in charge of plants at all Historic Hudson Valley sites. Her plans for Montgomery Place call for the renewal of the one-acre arboretum and, if there is enough money, the re-creation of the conservatory - a wood and glass structure that housed citrus trees and exotic flowers. It was torn down at the turn of the century. In addition to guided tours of the house, there are tours focusing on the orchard, gardens, walking trails, the preservation project and the role of children's games in American culture. In keeping with the spirit of Montgomery Place as a summer retreat, visitors may picnic on the grounds and can even check out various games to play on the lawns or on their picnic blankets, from badminton and croquet to Parcheesi, jacks and marbles. ''This property was used heavily as a weekend getaway, and the family's energies went into leisure activities,'' said Renee Friedman, the director of interpretation and education for Historic Hudson Valley. ''We want this to be a place where people can not only come and tour, but can come and be.''

1204-> Fetters on the Executive; By Finding No Threat in Prosecutor Law, The Court Rejects a Constitutional Vision
On one level, the Supreme Court decision upholding the law on independent prosecutors is a footnote to history, ratifying one of the major legacies of the Watergate experience. The Court removed all lingering doubt about the constitutionality of the steps Congress took to spare the country the trauma of a repetition of the Saturday Night Massacre in which President Nixon ordered the dismissal of the Watergate special prosecutor. But from the moment last year when the Reagan Administration joined the constitutional battle on the side of those who would strike the law down, the case became very much a debate over the present and future as well as the past. At stake was not only the status of a key structural change in the Government but also the validity of the Administration's insistence that only a completely unfettered executive branch could function with sufficient vigor to satisfy the constitutional imperative of the separation of powers. The decision today was considered a stinging political and philosophical blow to the Administration's vision of executive branch supremacy. In its timing, the ruling was also considered spectacularly inconvenient, removing the constitutional shadow from the office of special prosecutor just as one special prosecutor was about to file a potentially damaging report on the activities of Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d and as another was preparing for the trial of leading figures in the Iran-contra affair. Two of President Reagan's closest advisers, Michael K. Deaver and Lyn Nofziger, have been convicted in the last half-year on criminal indictments obtained by independent prosecutors. Bland Defense, Anguished Dissent But if the message today was devastating, so was the messenger: Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, whose bland, straightforward opinion made the Administration's arguments against the law appear inconsequential and almost irrelevant. Solicitor General Charles Fried had argued that the special prosecutor statute threatened the existence of ''a unitary, vigorous and independent Executive responsible directly to the people'' that he said was essential to the functioning of the American system. But the Chief Justice saw no such threat. ''We do not think the act impermissibly undermines the powers of the executive branch,'' he said, observing that the law contained enough safeguards ''to insure that the President is able to perform his constitutionally assigned duties.'' Only Justice Antonin Scalia, in an anguished, lone dissent that contained a sarcastic reference to ''our former constitutional system,'' gave any evidence of sharing the Administration's constitutional vision. With even President Reagan's chosen Chief Justice deserting him, the decision seemed a coda to the Administration's eight-year effort to fundamentally redirect the Supreme Court, an effort that was ultimately frustrated by the longevity of the liberal Justices and the will of the Senate. The Goals Unreached By the same token, the decision is also a bitter reminder of how important the Court was to the accomplishment of Mr. Reagan's goals, goals that for the most part eluded the Administration in such areas as abortion, affirmative action, and relaxing the barriers between church and state. Debates on these topics became familiar to a broad segment of the public in the Reagan years. The debate over the separation of powers that was at the heart of today's decision has been conducted before a much smaller audience, but with no less intensity and with at least an equal sense of moment. The separation of powers is an elusive, abstract area of constitutional law. The Court, in a series of highly formalistic rulings that invoked the doctrine to strike down such Congressional ventures as the legislative veto and the budget-balancing law, has done little to make the subject accessible. The Struggle for Dominance But there has been passionate discussion in conservative circles over how to protect the executive branch from what many conservatives see as encroachments by a Congress dominated by liberals. There is a historical irony to this. In the not too distant past it was executive authority personified by Franklin D. Roosevelt that conservatives decried and Congressional power that they sought to bolster. Liberals have traveled the same route in reverse. In any event, the special prosecutor law became a surrogate for this debate, a symbol of the current round in the age-old struggle for dominance between Congress and the White House. That was clear from the fevered tone of Justice Scalia's dissent today as well as from the decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that the Supreme Court overturned in reaching today's result. The author of the appellate court's decision, Judge Laurence H. Silberman, one of the two Reagan Administration appointees who made up the 2-to-1 majority, depicted the special prosecutor statute as essentially a Congressional power grab. Sapping 'Political Vitality' In his Jan. 22 opinion, Judge Silberman said it was significant that the law ''was passed in the midst of a period when one political party tended to control the Presidency and the other enjoyed dominance in the legislative branch.'' He said appointment of a special prosecutor ''surely saps the political vitality of the Presidency and thereby renders the President a less effective political force juxtaposed against Congress.'' That analysis barely drew Chief Justice Rehnquist's passing notice. ''We observe first that this case does not involve an attempt by Congress to increase its own powers at the expense of the executive branch,'' he said. By entering the battle and asking the Court to strike the law down, the Reagan Administration had more than just a single case in mind and inevitably risked losing more than just a case. The Administration remained true to its constitutional vision, and it was that vision that the Court rejected today.

1205-> Japan Data On Economy
The Japanese Government issued an optimistic report today on the nation's economy, but officials said the gap between rich and poor was growing, with many Japanese feeling they have been left out of the nation's economic boom. In its annual white paper, the Economic Planning Agency said that Japan had made great achievements economically but that the general public had yet to feel a solid sense of prosperity. Relatively high domestic prices, long working hours and poor housing conditions were among the main problems, the report said. The Government has accepted the document as official policy. The 524-page white paper said Japan had achieved strong growth in the fiscal year ended in March. Robust housing investment, consumer spending, and a 6 trillion yen, about $45 billion, emergency economic package adopted in May last year, had pulled the economy out of a slump produced by the rapidly rising yen, it said. The agency said a high yen had forced Japan to restructure its economy and companies had made strenuous efforts to adapt themselves to changed business circumstances, turning to the domestic market and away from exports for their profits.

1207-> Q&A
Q. My bathroom ceiling has been dripping water from a leak in the apartment above. Our superintendent says the leak was repaired by replacing the grouting, but the ceiling is leaking again whenever the tenant above takes a shower. In addition I have three growths coming through the cracks in the ceiling. Each has a long, slender stem and a circular flat head pleated like the underside of a mushroom. Can you tell me how this growth developed and what can be done to repair this problem? A.The growth is a type of poisonous fungus that often develops - usually outdoors - where there is constant dampness. It grows in your ceiling because the leak keeps the inside of the ceiling damp. Simply grouting the tile in the floor above is usually not enough to stop such a leak. My guess is that in the bathroom above, the shower pan under the floor or the water pipe inside the wall is leaking. Until such defects are repaired, the leaking will continue. Q. Our very old house has a large porch with concrete-block pillars supporting its roof. The paint on these pillars is cracked and peeling. How can we remove it, and what kind of paint should we use to prevent a recurrence of this problem? A.The paint can be removed with a semipaste remover, the kind that can be flushed off with water, since scraping would be difficult on such a surface. Brush the remover on in thick layers, a few square feet at a time, and let it soak 15 or 20 minutes. Then use a hose and a scrub brush to wash off the softened residue. Repaint with two coats of latex masonry paint, but first make sure that all mortar joints are sound and that the bottom and top of each pillar are caulked to keep water out. Q.I have some sheets of rigid foam insulation left over from a paneling job, and plan to use them to box in the heating ducts in the crawl space. Is this against regulations, and if so, isn't it dangerous just storing these sheets in the house? A.Rigid foam insulation is a hazard in case of fire because when flames come in contact with it the foam sheets can give off fumes that may be toxic. Most fire regulations require that when installed these sheets should be covered with gypsum board or similar fire-resistant paneling. For this reason I imagine that storing them inside the home could be hazardous. For more specific information I suggest you check with your local fire department or building department.

1208-> Gala Raises $4 Million to Fight Cancer
A four-year, $1 billion campaign to fight cancer began Wednesday night at a gala black-tie concert-dinner-dance in the glittering new space of the Winter Garden. The campaign, Stop Cancer, is the creation of Dr. Armand Hammer, who is chairman of President Reagan's cancer panel. The space at the Winter Garden, the vaulted steel and glass 120-foot high structure at the World Financial Center in Battery Park, turned out to be a smashing place in which to raise money. The evening - or whatever one calls an event that began at 7 P.M., wound up well after 1 A.M. and raised $4 million - was underwritten by Albert Reichmann, president of Olympia & York Developments Ltd., which built the World Financial Center. About 800 guests paid up to $2,500 each (there were additional contributions as well) to attend the fund-raiser, which began with a program featuring the violinist Isaac Stern, the baritone Sherrill Milnes and the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, who also conducted the Philadelphia Orchestra. Somewhere between Aaron Copland's ''Fanfare for the Common Man'' and Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture, minus the frequent fireworks, Governor Cuomo put in a non-musical cameo appearance. 'Just a Festive Building' Next stop was cocktails - background music by the Marian McPartland Trio - in the courtyard of the World Financial Center. ''You get a bargain for your money listening to music in the Winter Garden,'' Beverly Sills said. ''You hear every note three times.'' Sporting an electric-blue bow tie, Cesar Pelli, the Winter Garden's architect, explained that the building was never thought of as a place for performances. ''It's just a festive building,'' he said. The chairmen of the evening were Armand and Frances Hammer, John and Patricia Kluge and Albert and Asoga Reichmann. Among the other guests were Randolph and Veronica Hearst, Ted and Rhonda Fleming Mann and Mrs. Morton Phillips, otherwise known as Abigail van Buren. ''Armand is a cherished friend,'' she said, ''one person I've never had to give advice to. Honey, he has no problem he can't handle himself.'' Dr. Hammer, who is 90 years old, was indeed in fine fettle. ''It's Columbus Day,'' he said. ''What better time to start off a campaign to discover a cure for cancer?'' His wife, 87, held his hand. Then it was back to the Winter Garden, now set up for a kosher dinner. Speeches first, of course. The speakers were introduced by Merv Griffin. (''The Dodgers are ahead 6 to 0,'' he whispered between introductions.) Among the speakers: Dr. Hammer, Mr. Reichmann, Mr. Stern, Mayor Koch and, via tape, President Reagan. Still later, there was dancing to Vince Giordando and the Nighthawks. But by 11:15, when dinner was served - main course of medallions of veal sauteed in wine and mushrooms - guests had deserted a number of tables. Mayor Koch was among those who left before the food was served but not before he confided to Vera Stern, ''I expect to win as Mayor, but if I don't I'll let your husband teach me to play the fiddle.''

1210-> PARENT & CHILD
NEITHER his parents nor his high-school track coach understood what was going on. The boy would do extremely well during practice, often performing at championship levels. The local papers were full of articles about his athletic potential and predictions of his success. Yet he would do very poorly in competition. ''One day he came to his psychotherapy session with a stack of newspaper clippings about him,'' said Dr. Steven Berglas, a clinical psychologist at the Harvard Medical School and the author of ''The Success Syndrome: Hitting Bottom When You've Reached the Top'' (Plenum, 1986). ''He spread out the clippings and said, 'They're telling me to perform, and I won't!' '' Children who appear to be self-defeating are often fighting a very personal battle for control over their lives, a battle fraught with ambivalence and symbolic communications. The issue of personal control is most clearly seen in young children. A child who has been punished for spilling something will sometimes deliberately do the same thing again and will then gruffly tell himself, ''Now clean this up!'' ''It's a way of telling his parents that he's going to take away their power over him by saying these things to himself,'' Dr. Berglas said. Among adolescents, the theme is the same, but the behavior is more complex. A teen-ager who suddenly stops studying or handing in homework assignments has actually gained more power over his grades than when he was working hard. Yet if you ask that child why he isn't performing better, his answers will be vague or tangential: ''I hate the teacher. The class is stupid.'' ''We see this a lot in children of upwardly mobile, ambitious, very intelligent parents,'' said Dr. Robert L. Hendren, the director of the division of child and adolescent psychiatry at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. He described a 13-year-old boy whose parents kept saying how bright their son was: ''The boy told me: 'If I got B's in school, my parents would want A's. I have more control getting D's and F's.' '' Children who sabotage themselves that way will occasionally hand in an A+ paper or exam and then, once the teachers' and parents' hopes are raised, go back to failing. That is another way children show that they, and not the adults, are in control. Self-defeating behavior can sometimes be rooted in fear rather than rebelliousness. A college freshman who had done well throughout high school may be scared by the stiffer competition at a new school. The student responds by not studying at all. ''That way he can convince himself that he's not really failing because he's not really working at it,'' said Dr. Jerry M. Wiener, the chairman of the department of psychiatry at George Washington University. ''It's more acceptable to fail that way than to fail after you've made a strong effort.'' Abusing alcohol or other drugs is another way children sabotage themselves when they are scared they may fail. Showing up drunk or high for a test is a way to preserve self-esteem. Then they can blame that for their poor performance; their real skills have never been tested.

1211-> Manila View: Bases Go Home, Slowly
As the Philippines struggles to find a national consensus over the presence of American bases here, a growing number of legislators are advocating a compromise involving a gradual closing of the installations. Most now agree with President Corazon C. Aquino that the bases should be allowed to remain until their 25-year lease expires in 1991, but some are now saying that that will be the time to set their time of departure. Among those advocating a phased closing, the talk ranges from five years to a decade. Current negotiations over compensation for the last two years of the lease have created an atmosphere of confrontation between the Philippines and the United States. Washington Is Called 'Cheap' The talks broke down just over a week ago, with the Philippine side calling the Americans ''cheap'' in offering only a limited increase over the $180 million they now pay each year for the use of Clark Air Base, Subic Bay Naval Station and several smaller installations. The talks resumed three days ago, but although negotiators for both sides have been noncommittal in public, Philippine officials say privately that the atmosphere has not greatly improved. Part of their disappointment appears to stem from the failure of the American side to increase its offer significantly after an encouraging visit to Manila last month by Secretary of State George P. Shultz. At the time, Mrs. Aquino said she was confident that an agreement could be reached by the end of July, but the talks broke down several days before the deadline. Emerging Sense of Independence The Philippines' mood and the demand for a major increase in compensation to $1.2 billion a year reflect an emerging sense of independence from its former colonial ruler, which remains its primary economic, political and cultural partner. ''We cannot tolerate the usual treatment we have been getting from the Americans,'' Senator Aquilino Pimentel Jr. said. ''We have always been taken for granted.'' Speaking of the longer term, he said: ''I think the consensus is withdrawal. It's just a question of when. I don't think any Filipino is working under the proposition that the bases would stay forever.'' The Senate president, Jovito R. Salonga, who has long opposed the bases, acknowledged that closing them immediately after the lease expires would not be practical. ''Whether we like it or not, there has to be a phase-out, because you cannot just take the bases bodily out on Sept. 16, 1991,'' he said. A Few Years Past 1991 Senator John Osmena, one of the few senators to argue for retaining the bases, said he favored keeping them for only a few years beyond that date. ''I agree that the bases have to go,'' he said. ''But I don't think this is the proper time.'' Voicing the position of the military, Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos has also indicated support for the idea of a gradual closing of the bases. Even the President, who has insisted on keeping her options open for the future, said in an interview early last year that she believed the bases would eventually have to go. As compensation talks have continued over the last four months, discussion here has moved from headlong ''nationalist'' oratory against the bases to a more substantive exploration of options, including the discussion of a phased closing. The Economic Challenge One of the main challenges the Philippines faces is economic. The bases are the nation's second-largest employer, contributing about $500 million to the economy each year. A study commissioned by the Senate proposed the transfer of three large Philippine bases from Manila to Clark Air Base and the sale of their prime real estate in the capital. It proposed conversion of the Clark airfield into an international airport, two hour's drive from the city. The vast Subic Bay base, the largest American military installation outside the United States, would be converted to a shipyard complex and international transshipment port. These are ideas, however, that have been suggested for years and face major difficulties in being carried out. Even thorough studies of these options could take almost as long as the remaining time on the bases' lease, critics say. Referendum Is Possible In recent weeks, consideration has also been given to the Government's political options, given many legislators' public commitments to oppose keeping the bases. Mrs. Aquino was reported Thursday to have endorsed the possibility of a national referendum on the question. This option appeals to some legislators because it spares them from casting a difficult vote, and because most people here believe a referendum would favor keeping the bases. But the nation's leading poll-taker, Mahar Mangahas, cast some doubt on this belief when he reported that although most people do favor allowing the bases to stay for some period, their percentage is shrinking in the face of current publicity against the installations. And to the astonishment of many in the urban elite, he also found that a third of Filipinos - a swing vote in any referendum - were not even aware of the bases' existence. ''All in all,'' he wrote, ''the survey data points to a great erosion of implicit trust among Filipinos for the United States Government and to a rapidly growing dissatisfaction with the bases agreement in its present form.''

1212-> Election-Law Compliance Is Difficult Enough
To the Editor: ''In Texas, Law vs. Law'' (editorial, July 29), dealing with alleged excess campaign funds available to Gov. Michael S. Dukakis and Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas (arising from Mr. Bentsen's right to run simultaneously as a Vice-Presidential and senatorial candidate under Texas law), represents political naivete. Senator Bentsen did not write the Texas law authorizing dual candidacy. The Senator is not only acting morally and with due propriety in soliciting funds to support his senatorial candidacy, but also in strict conformity with Texas law. Indeed, Governor Dukakis and Senator Bentsen have agreed, as you acknowledge, to segregate national election funds from Texas senatorial funds, notwithstanding the frivolous Republican argument that, in this computer age such segregation is impossible - an argument overruled by the Federal Election Commission. What more do you expect from Presidential candidates? This case does not represent ''a question of moral leadership'' involving campaign funds. There are far greater moral issues in this campaign than the sour-grapes Republican attempt to freeze the $46 million national campaign allotment to the Democrats, which equals a similar allotment to the Republicans. If the shoe were on the other foot, do you suppose that Vice President Bush and his running mate would ''seize the moral issue'' you advocate and give up campaign funds to which they are legitimately entitled? Politicians have enough problems complying with election laws as written, but to expect a higher morality is asking too much. IRVING LEVINE Great Neck, L.I., Aug. 3, 1988

1214-> For Dancegoers, A Trip Around The World In Three Days Of Performances
SOONER or later, the world comes to New York City. Or so it seems this weekend, when a far-flung group of dance and dance-theater companies descends upon the city. Not that there will not be enough home-grown dance to satisfy stalwart hometown boosters. But the accent is on visiting companies, from the itinerant Korean performing troupes at the Asia Society and the National Dance Company of Senegal at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, to the Tulsa Ballet Theater at the Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts at Brooklyn College, as well as an act or two that could pass for extraterrestrial at the Danspace Project Benefit '88 at St. Mark's Church. Asian dance and theater can sometimes seem dauntingly stylized or refined. Blink, and you miss a universe in a minute tilt of the head or flexing of the foot. But Korean folk theater has an immediacy to it that comes, no doubt, from its often raucous humor and directness. And that should be in plentiful supply in a program presented by the Namsadang company now on a tour through America, when the troupe comes to New York for performances tonight through Sunday at the Asia Society's Lila Acheson Wallace Auditorium. The namsadang - or intinerant performers - who have roamed the Korean countryside from 1300 to the present were originally celebrants of rituals designed to propitiate the spirits during the planting season, encouraging the workers with their stirring percussion music and, in the process, providing still popular entertainment to all who came to watch. The program will include comparatively familiar - and decorous - ribbon dances created by musicians who send long paper ribbons, attached to their hats, whirling through the air as they dart and spin to intricate rhythms produced on drums, gongs and pipes. A more earthy highlight promises to be the troupe's puppet plays, which enabled the namsadang to serve as sharp critics of the ruling class and the religious establishment in traditional tales noteworthy for their satire and explicit erotic humor. There will also be four drummers from the hypnotic Samul-Nori group, which helped to select the performers and arrange the event. The program will be completed by excerpts of Pansori, or Korean folk opera, performed by Park Dong Jin, who has been designated a national living treasure in South Korea. Mr. Park will be accompanied by Chu Bong Shin, who will play the buk, or barrel drum, and make suitable calls of encouragement from time to time, in the Pansori fashion. (Namsadang performs at the Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, tonight at 8, tomorrow at 3 and 8 P.M. and Sunday at 2:30 and 8 P.M. Tickets are $20. Charge: 517-2742. Information: 288-6400.) The National Dance Company of Senegal has acquired a loyal New York audience in nearly annual tours over the past 20 years. Audiences tend, in fact, to participate in the excitement by dancing in the aisles or even joining the performers on the stage. And the company, founded in 1960 by Leopold S. Senghor, the President of Senegal, does offer spectacular dancing and drumming, acrobatics and stilt walking. But there are a good many gentler pleasures to the Senegalese programs, among them the performers' sly humor, a sense of the culture, traditions and stories of that African country, and a distinctive elegance and simplicity of gesture. (The National Dance Company of Senegal performs at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, Amsterdam Avenue and 112th Street, today and tomorrow at 8 P.M. Tickets are $17.50 and 22.50. Charge: 307-7171. Reservations and information: 662-2133.) Tulsa Ballet Theater Tulsa, Okla., may seem light years away from the bustle of ballet in New York. But it was the Tulsa Ballet Theater that brought a first taste of a ''lost'' ballet by George Balanchine -his 1932 ''Cotillon,'' to be revived in full this season by the Joffrey Ballet - to Brooklyn in 1983 in the ''Hand of Fate'' pas de deux. This time around, the vibrant young company, under the direction of Roman Jasinski and Moscelyne Larkin - two former Ballet Russe dancers - will present a revival of Balanchine's ''Mozart Violin Concerto,'' another ''lost'' ballet. The work was known as ''Concierto de Mozart'' when it was first performed by the Ballet of the Teatro Colon in Buenos Aires in 1942. Mr. Jasinski performed as a guest artist in the ballet, a mysterious evocation of romance, and Miss Larkin saw it several times. They commissioned the staging from Esmeralda Agoglia, a former ballerina with the Teatro Colon. The program will be completed by Ruth Page's ''Merry Widow,'' not seen here since 1955. (The Tulsa Ballet Theater will perform at the Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts at Brooklyn College, Flatbush and Nostrand Avenues, tomorrow night at 8 and Sunday afternoon at 2. Tickets are $12 and $16. Reservations and information: (718) 434-1900.) Of North Carolina The state of North Carolina will be represented by the North Carolina Dance Theater, which performs this weekend at the Joyce Theater. Founded in 1970 by Robert Lindgren, who was then the dean of dance at the North Carolina School of the Arts and is currently the head of New York's own School of American Ballet, the company is made up in part of graduates of the North Carolina school. One of those graduates is Mel A. Tomlinson, a former member of the Dance Theater of Harlem, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and New York City Ballet, who left New York last year to retire from dance but was soon drawn back. Mr. Tomlinson personifies the blend of ballet and modern dance typical of the North Carolina dancers and their repertory. He will be seen in ''Echoes of Presence'' and ''Afternoon of a Faun,'' both based on Diaghilev-era ballets, and three works by the company's director, Salvatore Aiello, that will be performed this weekend. This weekend's programs also include ballets by Vicente Nebrada, Mauricio Wainrot and Susan McKee-McCullough, a former member of the Netherlands Dance Theater who now heads the dance department at the North Carolina school. (The North Carolina Dance Theater will perform at the Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, tonight and tomorrow at 8 and Sunday at 2 and 7:30 P.M. Tickets are $17. Reservations: 242-0800.) Ruth Zaporah's Debut Ruth Zaporah will make her New York debut this weekend at the Warren Street Performance Loft. Miss Zaporah, who will present her new ''Grace and a Handful of Sticks,'' is based in Berkeley, Calif., and is a leading solo performer in the Bay Area. She specializes in improvisation, with scripts growing out of each performance. ''I am fascinated with the truth and simplicity of the moment of discovery,'' she wrote of improvisation, in the fall 1988 issue of Contact Quarterly. (Ruth Zaporah will perform at the Warren Street Performance Loft, 46 Warren Street, tonight and tomorrow at 8. Tickets are $8; Theater Development Fund vouchers accepted. Reservations and information: 732-3149.) Otherworldly Offerings The Danspace Project's annual benefits tend to be wild and wacky outpourings of the newest in dance and performance art. Although the 13 soloists and companies appearing in this year's two-performance gala are certifiably of this world, at least some of the star turns are so uninhibitedly original they might have fallen from another planet. Gayle Tufts of the School of Hard Knocks will serve as the master of ceremonies for the programs, which include leading members of the downtown arts community. (Danspace Project Benefit '88 will be held at the Danspace of St. Mark's Church, Second Avenue at 10th Street, tonight and tomorrow at 8:30. Tickets are $7; Theater Development Fund vouchers accepted. Information on tickets and the performers: 674-8112.) Another candidate for out-of-this-world-in-New-York category is Alice Farley, whose New York-based company will take over the Winter Garden at the World Financial Center in Battery Park City today at 12:15 P.M. The creatures of ''Anggrek: The Human Life of Plants,'' a free dance-theater spectacle inspired by the forests and rituals of Borneo, will perform free. And if Miss Farley's other experiments with lights, magic techniques and sculptural costumes are any guide, it will be an odd and antic afternoon. (The Winter Garden, a glass-enclosed atrium, is at the foot of the North Bridge, which crosses over West Street from 1 World Trade Center. Information: 945-2600.) Carlota Santana The Carlota Santana Spanish Dance Arts Company is based in New York, but what they perform is rooted in the dance traditions of Spain. The company will present flamenco when it appears at Symphony Space this weekend. But it will also offer a novel departure from the repertory with ''For Whom the Bell Tolls,'' a Spanish dance-drama based on the Ernest Hemingway novel. (The Carlota Santana Spanish Dance Arts Company performs at Symphony Space, Broadway and 95th Street, tonight and tomorrow at 8. Tickets are $15 and $17.50. Information: 864-5400.) From Martha Graham And for unabashedly home-grown art, there is the Martha Graham Dance Company at the City Center. Raised and nurtured as an artist in New York, Miss Graham deals with plain and exotic themes and places this weekend in such dances as ''Appalachian Spring,'' a giddy and visionary look at the pioneers who settled in the American West, which will be performed tomorrow night, and ''El Penitente,'' a trio drawn from the rituals of the Penitentes of the American Southwest, which will be presented on Sunday afternoon. The weekend's roster also includes dances inspired by Greek myth and literature, as well as some plotless pieces that remind us of the sheer exhilaration of dancing. And Miss Graham will be honored, with Representative Ted Weiss, Democrat of New York, in ''Our Town: Living Within a Caring Community,'' a benefit for the Village Nursing Home AIDS Program on Sunday night at the O'Neill Theater. Stars of Broadway and Off Broadway theater are to perform in the gala. (The Martha Graham Dance Company performs at City Center, 131 West 55th Street, tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 P.M. and Sunday at 2 and 7:30 P.M. Tickets are $15, $25 and $35. Information: 581-7907.) (''Our Town: Living Within a Caring Community'' will take place on Sunday at 8:30 P.M. at the O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street. Tickets for the performance are $100; for dinner and the performance, $300 and $500. Information: 431-7262.)

1215-> Review/Recital; Soviet Pianist, Busoni Winner, Makes Debut
A superior pianistic talent was disclosed by Lilia Zilberstein, the young Moscow-born winner of the 1987 Busoni competition, at her local debut in Weill Recital Hall Tuesday evening. The program - a part of the First New York International Festival of the Arts - was all Russian, and the style corresponded, but Miss Zilberstein moderates the harsh excesses that have been associated with Soviet piano playing in recent decades, and brings a fluid lyricism, a free swing of tempo and a sense of color to much of her playing. She wore a severe look on her face (broken by a quizzical half-smile in response to vigorous applause), but her music making was generous. Some of the biggest finger-benders in her Nikolai Medtner Sonata and her Rachmaninoff Opus 32 Preludes tested her technical security, but she was able to bring clarity and sensitive shaping to many passages that lumber, sweat and gasp in some pianists' readings. This was a particular asset in Shostakovich's Sonata No. 1. Somewhat less persuasive (and perhaps more typically Russian in its emphatic stride) was the interpretation of Sergei Taneyev's Prelude and Fugue in G sharp minor. It would be interesting to hear Miss Zilberstein in a broader repertory; in any case, we will surely be hearing her again. A footnote: I don't think I'm the only one who was curious how a work called ''Canzone Mattinata'' (the Medtner) came to have the subtitle ''Tragic Sonata.'' If this is a festival, where are the program notes?

1216-> Gandhi Goes To Punjabis With a Plea
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi came to the heart of India's most violent region today to tell the people of Punjab State that his Government had not forgotten them. It was Mr. Gandhi's first visit to Punjab in almost four years. In this little town on the Beas River founded by a Sikh religious leader in the 15th century, the Prime Minister asked his Punjabi audience not to mix religion and politics. He was talking about militant Sikh separatists whose armed gangs began the spiral of terror and economic depression that debilitated villages in Amritsar district and other areas of the state. Almost 2,000 people have died in Punjab since January. On Monday, the head of a Hindu-based opposition party in the state, which is under emergency rule and has no elected legislature, was assassinated in the state capital, Chandigarh. But Sikh separatism is no longer Punjab's only problem, residents of Amritsar and the villages around it say. Unchecked violence has permeated all sects and communities, and guns are everywhere. Armed Men on the Roofs Punjabi violence has also changed the way an Indian Prime Minister lives and works. In a country where politicians traditionally mix with crowds and are daily besieged by favor-seekers, Mr. Gandhi was today the focus of a security operation involving tens of thousands of troops, police officers and explosives experts. In Goindwal, where armed men stood on every roof, the Prime Minister never came close to the people he had come to reassure. Speaking to a largely impassive and unenthusiastic audience that had been carefully selected and screened, he wore a bullet-proof vest, stood in a bullet-proof enclosure more than 12 feet above the ground and was separated from the crowd by 20 to 30 yards of no man's land guarded by police officers. Mr. Gandhi told the crowd, which clapped on cue from a pair of hands that would appear from time to time over the Prime Minister's head, that there might soon be local elections in Punjab that would give people more control over their own affairs. Armed Gangs in Control Punjabis, especially in Amritsar district, know how far they are from this goal, elections or not. They tell of orders from armed gangs who dictate what kind of school uniforms children should wear, what kind of pets people can keep - no dogs, because they bark and warn of intruders - and whether people may own television sets. ''The credibility of the Government in Delhi is on a steady downward slope,'' the state's leading newspaper, The Tribune, wrote in an editorial today, ''and there is not much that the Prime Minister can offer at today's gatherings in Punjab which could dramatically reverse the tide of cynicism, disbelief and desperation.'' Mr. Gandhi had come to Goindwal, where both Sikhs and Hindus have had their lives disrupted by terrorism, to lay the foundation stone of a newsprint factory designed to utilize the residue of crops raised on the Punjab's rich farmlands: sugar cane bagasse and rice straw and husks. The factory, in a new industrial park, will create 20,000 jobs, officials say. After leaving Goindwal, Mr. Gandhi went to Jalandhar, where he addressed a Congress Party rally. Later in the day he visited Jaito, near Bhatinda, where 65 years ago his grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, was paraded through the streets in handcuffs after his arrest for defying a British colonial order. Meeting the People At the end of the day, Mr. Gandhi finally broke away from his security cordon to meet local people. The Bhatinda area has been relatively quiet and free of violence. The Prime Minister's visit to Punjab is the highlight of a week of announcements intended to bolster the Government's image in the state. On Monday, New Delhi approved a project that will bring Pepsico to India to build bottling and food-processing plants in Punjab in a partnership with Indian companies. On Tuesday night, the Government ordered the release of 138 detainees held since 1984 when Indian troops stormed the Golden Temple in Amritsar to dislodge Sikh extremists. The storming of the Golden Temple, the holiest shrine of the Sikh religion, enraged many Sikhs and ultimately led to the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by Sikh bodyguards. Sikh Areas Attacked After her death, Sikh neighborhoods in New Delhi and elsewhere in India where the Sikhs are strong in commerce and industry were attacked by mobs. Many Sikhs died and millions of dollars in Sikh-owned property was destroyed. Even moderate Sikh leaders say they believe those attacks were politically motivated, and a commission named three officials in the Gandhi Government as instigators of the anti-Sikh crowds. None have been punished. One of the three, Jagdish Tytler, was subsequently made Minister of Food Processing and as such made the announcement Monday of the Pepsico agreement. This was not lost on Punjabis, Sikh, Hindu or Moslem.

1218-> Jersey Self-Service Gasoline Ban Is Unconstitutional, Judge Rules
A Superior Court judge ruled today that New Jersey's 39-year-old law banning motorists from pumping their own gasoline is unconstitutional. In his seven-page opinion, Judge Martin L. Haines in Willingboro said the law violated the State Constitution because it exceeds the police power of the Legislature. But Judge Haines immediately suspended his ruling for six months to give the Legislature a chance to draft regulations in accordance with his opinion. New Jersey and Oregon are the only states prohibiting self-service stations. Judge Haines's ruling came in a lawsuit filed by Kirschner Brothers Oil Company. of Haverford, Pa. The company, which owns about 20 service stations in New Jersey, claimed the law is antiquated and that customers ought to have a choice between full service and self-service. Proponents of self-service said it could help reduce costs by decreasing labor expenses. Pending Legislation But opponents said the change would increase profits of gasoline companies. The State Department of Labor has lobbied against a change in the law. At a legislative hearing in April, about 125 station operators and gasoline industry officials went to Trenton to voice their views on legislation that would legalize self-service pumps. Among the backers of self-service was the New Jersey Petroleum Council, which represents the major oil companies in New Jersey. ''We're obviously pleased,'' said the council's associate director, John F. Holtz. ''We see it as a victory for consumer freedom of choice.'' But Jerry Ferrara, executive director of the New Jersey Gasoline Retailer's Association and Allied Trades, which represents about 3,000 service stations in New Jersey, was unhappy with the opinion. ''The people will be the main ones to lose,'' he said. Mr. Ferrara said there would not be any cost benefits to motorists, that gasoline stations would lay off workers and that many service stations would become gas-only stations and close their repair shops. ''I'm rather amazed and surprised,'' he added.

1220-> Save Deconstruction From Its Explicators; Joyce's Words Matter
To the Editor: Marianne DeKoven's criticism of the press, public and academic community for their interest in the debate over the definitive edition of Joyce's ''Ulysses'' (letter, July 4) represents the reductio ad absurdum of the literary and philosophical theory of deconstruction. Ms. DeKoven argues that the effort to determine the authentic version of ''Ulysses'' is ''violently inimical to the workings of the text.'' This is the rhetoric of deconstruction, which claims that the meaning of any text is indeterminate. According to deconstruction, an author's intent is irrelevant to the meanings of a text, for the following reasons: (1) There is no such thing as a single intent. We have multiple and often contradictory intentions regarding any act, including the act of producing meaning. (2) There is no such thing as an author. The concept of author presupposes a unified human subject who controls language, whereas human subjectivity is a mere fiction of language. Texts are not the products of an individual will, but instead represent the intersection of competing cultural codes. (This rejection of the concept of author is the subtext of Ms. DeKoven's mocking reference to the ''one true 'Ulysses,' owned by and wholly attributable to a cultural godhead named James Joyce''). (3) Even if authors had unified intentions regarding their works, a reader cannot use intent as an interpretive guide without falling into a vicious circle: We look to the text to find evidence of the author's intent and then invoke that intent to justify our reading of the text. Ms. DeKoven has carried deconstruction's debunking of authorship to its inevitable conclusion. If the author's intent is irrelevant to the meanings of a text, so are the author's exact words. If a text is merely the site for the playing out of different codes, why should we privilege the author's choice of words over those added or deleted by subsequent accident and editorial choice? Why, in fact, don't we study texts generated by a culture-crammed computer? A logically consistent post-structuralist could not answer these questions, for any answer will invoke the primacy and value of authorial intention in determining both the structure and the meaning of a text. Ms. DeKoven ignores the most obvious reason for the public's interest in the ''Ulysses'' debate: People care about the text. And to care about the text is to care whether we have all and only the words Joyce intended to constitute ''Ulysses''! One of the reasons we read literature is to enter into the thoughts of another human being -the author. The author's words are privileged over subsequent emendations because they, not the emendations, represent the author's intent. Ms. DeKoven's characterization of ''Ulysses'' as ''a book intended to free and enlarge the spirit, to enrich life, to change culture for the better'' contradicts the rest of her letter, for it too assumes the role of authorial intention in determining the meaning of a text.

1224-> Smith Leads All-Star Selection
Ozzie Smith, the Wizard of Oz shortstop for the St. Louis Cardinals, stood No. 1 in the big leagues in votes last night when the final tally was made in the annual election by fans for baseball's All-Star Game. Smith, who also was the only player to receive more than 2 million votes, was followed in total ballots by two American League outfielders: Jose Canseco of the Oakland Athletics and Dave Winfield of the Yankees. After that, standing fourth in the big leagues and second in the National League came Darryl Strawberry of the Mets. The Yankees and the Mets each had two players elected by the fans. In addition to Winfield, Rickey Henderson was selected for the American League outfield. Strawberry is joined by Gary Carter, selected as the starting National League catcher. Trammell Won't Play These players, and the others who got the most votes at each position, will form the starting lineups for the game Tuesday night in Riverfront Stadium in Cincinnati. The only exception, apparently, was Alan Trammell of the Detroit Tigers, who won the most votes among shortstops in the American League but will not play because he is on the disabled list. The rest of the squads and the pitchers have been selected by the respective managers, Whitey Herzog of St. Louis for the National League and Tom Kelly of the Minnesota Twins for the American League, in consultation with the league offices. Their choices will be announced today. In the fans' balloting for the eight regular positions, the Oakland Athletics won at three positions, the most in either league: Canseco in the outfield, Mark McGwire at first base and Terry Steinbach at catcher. Two Yankee Winners The only other team in the American League with two winners was the Yankees. In the National League, three teams had two winners each: the Cardinals, with Smith at shortstop and Vince Coleman in the outfield; the Mets, and the Chicago Cubs, with Ryne Sandberg at second base and Andre Dawson in the outfield. The other players selected in the American League were Paul Molitor of the Milwaukee Brewers at second base and Wade Boggs of the Boston Red Sox at third base. In the National League, the others named were Will Clark of the San Francisco Giants at first base and Bobby Bonilla of the Pittsburgh Pirates at third. Andres Galarraga, the Montreal Expos' first baseman, was not elected as a starter although he was leading the National League in batting average, runs, hits and total bases.

1226-> OBSERVER; One of Our States Is Missing
Senator Moynihan, whose public duties include trying to save the country from coming to a complete standstill, says that by the year 2020 Interstate 95 will have to be 44 lanes wide to carry the traffic between Fort Lauderdale and Miami. ''Pretty soon there won't be anything left of Florida,'' he says. It's hard to weep about that because there's almost nothing left of Florida already. Whatever that thing is that's spreading down there may be interesting, or fun, or beloved by those sitting in its air-conditioned condos and traffic jams, but Florida it isn't. Florida was still mostly there in the 1940's, and there was even a good bit of it remaining in the 1960's, but now there's hardly enough Florida left to fill a glass display case in the Smithsonian. Robert Frost once said it doesn't take man long to use up a continent. The consumption of Florida shows he can do it practically overnight if the territory is humid and sandy and its winters are milder than Cleveland's. Senator Moynihan's ruminations about the dubious future down there are evoked by his interest in developing new forms of transportation. A member of the Senate Public Works Committee, he is trying to stir up interest in experimental magnetic-levitation vehicles. This is hard going because the Government is committed to sticking with cars and airplanes to the bitter end. Forty-four lanes of traffic on I-95. Meantime, why spend money experimenting in Buck Rogers stuff like magnetic-levitation vehicles? Star Wars, yes; traffic solutions, no. The American traffic solution is to widen the road. This is happening all over the once beautiful farmland of the Middle Atlantic states. Dirt roads barely wide enough for two cars to pass nervously are being paved with two broad lanes. Two-lane roads are swelling to four lanes with median strips, and four-lane divided highways are being widened to eight lanes. The result is always the same. Bet-ter roads lure more people to settle alongside them, bringing more cars, which jam the better roads. This angers the people in the traffic jams, who elect new politicians promising to solve the traffic problem by building better roads. This cycle of destruction has been continual since World War II. You'd think somebody would have realized by now that building better roads doesn't work. Just uses up the continent that much faster. But everybody, of course, does realize that it doesn't work. We keep on doing it anyhow. For one thing, building highways is something we do well; everybody likes doing what he's good at, even though it leads to a terrible mess. So we tacitly consent to being duped. We know the better roads being promised will relieve the traffic jam only briefly before doubling its intensity, but we elect the better-roads ticket anyhow. For a couple of years the traffic gets even worse because of the construction work. Finally comes the year when traffic flows contentedly. But what is this! You have just discovered yourself surrounded by vast, raw clots of housing developments named Greenery Glen, Forested Fantasy and Wistful Woods. Day after that the new jam-free, eight-lane highway is jammed halfway to Metropolis Bypass. Furious, aren't you? Time to vote for the new better-roads ticket. So we head inexorably toward the 44-lane highway, cheered on by the incantation of real-estate developers and asphalt tycoons: no use crying, folks, because growth and development cannot be stopped, and anyhow it's good for you. Why can't growth and development be stopped? In my experience, growth and development raise your taxes, make a shameful mess on the countryside and disperse people from the civilizing influence of city living to barren new communities which bind their victims to lifetimes of driving and offer so few rewards that the breakdown of the TV set becomes a catastrophe. Anything this dreadful can surely be stopped if somebody puts a mind to it. And somebody certainly should before the rest of the country is as disappeared as Florida. It would be good if Candidates Bush and Dukakis tried to create some pressure to save a little of the country from burial under the 44-lane highway. A proposal or two for saving a little bit of America for another day would certainly be more invigorating than the tired old campaign gas they have been emitting so far. Senator Moynihan, with magnetic levitation, is at least trying. Dukakis and Bush should study his lead. They both need levitating.

1228-> Two Bills on Drought Relief Advance in Congress
Relief for drought-stricken farmers moved a big step closer to reality today as both the House and Senate Agriculture Committees approved separate legislation aimed at putting payments in farmers' hands by September. Both panels plan to take another look at their bills when Congress returns on July 26 from its recess for the Democratic National Convention. This means that neither bill is likely to be voted on by the full House and Senate before early August, and the two houses will then have to reconcile their differences in a conference committee. ''This is a very significant safety net on which our farmers can count at this time,'' Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, the senior Republican on the Senate Agriculture Committee, said of his panel's bill. ''On average, farmers will receive about 50 percent of the value that would have been expected from their crops.'' House Bill to Cost Less The disaster relief program would be paid for out of money allocated for the payments farmers receive from the Government in times of surplus. Senator Lugar estimated that the Senate measure would cost $6.5 billion to $7 billion, but Senate Agriculture Committee aides said the cost could run as high as $8 billion. The House Agriculture Committee said its plan would cost about $2 billion less than the Senate version. Cost figures in both cases are only estimates because lawmakers do not have all the crop information that must be taken into account in working out the payment formulas. Lawmakers on the two agriculture panels worked from the same basic draft that was put together last week by a special House-Senate drought committee. But, over several days of deliberations, neither panel was able to resist adding at least a few special interest provisions. The Senate panel, for example, adopted amendments that would help tree growers, the ethanol industry, growers of cotton seed and sunflower seed. It also adopted an admendment to assist livestock farmers in counties contiguous to those that have been declared disaster areas by the President or the Secretary of Agriculture. The House panel included assistance for tree growers but did not approve aid for the ethanol industry. Dairy Cut to Be Rescinded Both panels agreed to rescind a 50-cent cut in dairly price supports that was scheduled to take effect next January, and to allow farmers to shift some of their acerage now growing price-supported corn, wheat, cotton or rice to soybeans, sunflowers and oats. The House provisions, however, are slightly less generous than the Senate's in the amount of soybean expansion that would be permitted. The House bill would also be more restrictive than the Senate on disaster payments for livestock feed programs. Payments would be permittted only to cattle raisers who lost livestock because of the drought and who need assistance to maintain breeding stock. President Reagan has warned lawmakers that he will reject any bill that exceeds Federal budget limits or that seeks to rewrite farm law. But Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who heads the Senate Agriculture Committee, expressed confidence that Mr. Reagan would be able to support the bill. ''We've assured the President we will stay within the budget and we will,'' Senator Leahy said. The basic plan adopted by both committees would give farmers a disaster payment based on a formula pegged to the payments they receive from the Government under existing crop price support programs. Payments would be made to any farmer whose crop loss is more than 35 percent of his historical yield under the price support program. Farmers who produce crops that are not covered by price support programs would also be eligible for disaster relief payments under a formula pegged to the average market price of those crops in three of the last five years. The Senate Agriculture Committee says this would result in payments ranging from 45 percent to 65 percent of the income farmers could have expected from their crops if the drought had not occurred. No producer would be allowed to receive more than $100,000 in disaster relief. A number of lawmakers have expressed concern, however, that under this formula a farmer who lost his entire crop would receive less money in disaster relief than a farmer who only lost half of his crop. These lawmakers would like to adjust the formula to provide greater relief for farmers who have been hardest hit by the drought. This is one of the issues that both panels will discuss when they review the legislation later this month.

1229-> SPORTS PEOPLE; Rangers Sign Center
In an effort to strengthen themselves on face-offs, the Rangers yesterday signed Doug Wickenheiser, a free-agent center who has played with three teams since being the first player selected by the Montreal Canadiens in the 1980 entry draft. Wickenheiser, who had 7 goals and 19 assists for the Vancouver Canucks last season, played three and a half seasons with Montreal before being traded to the St. Louis Blues. He missed 43 games of the 1985-86 season after suffering a severe knee injury in a motor-vehicle accident. Vancouver acquired the 6-foot-1-inch, 195-pounder in the 1987 waiver draft. ''I think face-offs are the strongest part of my game,'' said the 27-year-old Wickenheiser. ''If I get the ice time, it's up to me to put up the numbers.''

1230-> U.S. Agents Aid Drug Fight in Seattle
Local law-enforcement officials here have enlisted Federal agents and prosecutors to fight violent drug-dealing gangs that are moving into the Northwest. The approach, unusual in its reliance on Federal resources to fight drugs at the street level, is viewed as one of the most promising approaches in a war the authorities had long characterized as futile. The program is intended to serve as a deterrent by charging suspected gang members with Federal crimes that carry far greater penalties than state statutes. It also puts pressure on gang members to become informers, helping agents to seize suspects at airports and bus stations as they arrive with weapons and drugs from their bases in Los Angeles. Federal and local law-enforcement officials say this combination has slowed the influx of drug dealers from Los Angeles into new territory. Inquiries From Other Cities The new approach, which was begun by the United States Attorney here after a request was made by the local police, is being closely watched by the police in more than two-dozen American cities where cocaine-dealing gangs from Los Angeles have gained a foothold. ''It's working so well for us,'' said Lieut. Jerry Adams of the Seattle police, ''that we've had requests from cities around the country asking us for help.'' Law-enforcement officials from Seattle and a dozen other cities gathered with the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Kansas City today to develop a national strategy for fighting the Los Angeles gangs. Since last year, police officers in Denver, Minneapolis, Oklahoma City, St. Louis and Kansas City as well as on the West Coast have identified Los Angeles gang members dealing drugs on their streets. ''What we're seeing is the beginning and the potential for a nationwide network of drug dealers,'' Ira Reiner, the Los Angeles County District Attorney, said today at the Kansas City conference. ''This cannot be handled on a local level. It is a national problem and must be dealt with that way.'' Some civil rights advocates caution that Seattle's tactic of stopping suspected gang members at airports could lead to improper arrests of youths who simply look like gang members. But there have been no civil rights challenges to any of the arrests so far, and many politicians from crack-infested neighborhoods welcome the additional muscle of the Federal Government, saying it has put the first real scare into the drug gangs. 'It Gets Their Attention' ''These guys used to get off the plane wearing their colors and flaunting this stuff,'' said Bill Modesitt, who heads a Federal Drug Enforcement Agency unit at the Seattle-Tacoma Airport. ''But now when we stop them and they find out they're facing a mandatory five years for five grams of crack, they can't believe it. It gets their attention.'' One defendant, Derrick Hargress, whom Los Angeles authorities call a prominent leader of the Crips gang in that city, is facing a 40-year term after pleading guilty to a variety of charges in Seattle. As part of a possible reduction in sentence, he has written a letter to fellow Crips members in Los Angeles, warning them against coming to the Northwest. The Seattle approach is two-pronged. One part is the program at airport, train and bus stations, in which Federal agents rely on informers' tips and profiles of gang members to stop suspects as they enter the city. Those carrying drugs or who are wanted on warrants from other cities are arrested. The other part relies on turning over to the Federal authorities youths who have been arrested by the local police. Gene Anderson, the United States Attorney here, first used racketeering statutes against the gangs. But he said those laws generally were too cumbersome and complicated for the swift form of justice needed as a deterrent. Instead, he has been using Federal drug possession and weapons laws, and a relatively new statute that makes it a felony to sell narcotics within 1,000 feet of a school. Thus, for example, if a youth who is thought to be a gang member were arrested on a local drug charge near a school, Federal authorities would be notified so they could charge the suspect under the Federal statute. In three months, 25 out-of-state gang members have been indicted by Federal grand juries in Seattle on weapons, drug and other charges. While the number is comparatively small, the deterrent effect could be far-reaching, officials say. As a result of their indictments - in some cases for violating new laws that have been seldom enforced at the street level - the defendants are facing sentences of up to 50 years in jail. Local Officials Are Frustrated The authorities in Portland, Ore., say they plan to start some form of the Seattle program this month. They say their city does not have the jail space, the manpower or the range of local laws to combat gangs effectively. ''The frustration level is so great that people feel local government has completely failed them,'' said Charles Turner, the United States Attorney for Oregon. ''It's not the function of the Federal Government to prosecute street crime, but we can act as a general deterrent.'' He said a gang member arrested for selling drugs faces no more than 42 days in jail under Oregon law. And 50 percent of those who are arrested flee after posting bail, he said. Under Federal law, a gang member selling cocaine faces a mandatory five-year term and a minimum of another five years if found carrying a gun. Also, Federal laws make it much easier to detain gang members without bail or to ask for a high detention bond. #60,000 Crips and Bloods ''All of a sudden, a person who had no fear of the law may be looking at 10 years jail time,'' Mr. Anderson said. Faced with a choice of such a penalty or turning Government informer, many gang members here are deciding to give information to Government prosecutors. While hailing the three-month-old Seattle program, the United States Attorney in Los Angeles, Richard Bonner, warned that Federal resources are inadequate to begin a full Government attack in Los Angeles County, the home of most gangs in the West. The authorities estimate that two predominantly black youth gangs in the Los Angeles area, the Bloods and the Crips, have upwards of 60,000 members. On average, these machine gun-toting gangs commit about one murder a day. The authorities say some of the gang members who carried their trade to other cities have been quite obvious about wearing the color of their criminal unit, and could be easily spotted. Typical signs include a certain type of tennis shoe, a blue or red scarf or handkerchief, gold jewelry and hand signals. Since the crackdown at the Seattle airport, some gang members have tried to to foil the airport agents by arriving in sports coats and ties.

1231-> FINANCE/NEW ISSUES;
The Commonwealth Edison Company, a Chicago-based electric utility company, is offering $350 million of first-mortgage bonds in three parts through underwriters led by Salomon Brothers Inc. A $100 million issue of 9 1/4 percent noncallable bonds due in 1993 is priced at 99.60 to yield 9.35 percent, or about one percentage point more than Treasury securities with a similar maturity. The second part of the financing, which was increased to $125 million from $100 million, is made up of 10 1/8 percent 10-year bonds priced at 99.40 to yield 10.22 percent, or about 1.32 percentage points more than comparable Treasury securities. The final $125 million portion is an 11 1/8 percent issue due 2018 being offered at a price of 99.125 to yield 11.226 percent, or 2.14 percentage points more than the 30-year Treasury bond. Both the 10-year and 30-year issues are nonrefundable for five years. All the bonds are rated Baa-1 by Moody's and BBB+ by S.&P.

1232-> Legal Fees Set in One Texaco Case
Lawyers who had sought $9.5 million in fees for representing some Texaco Inc. shareholders during the company's bankruptcy proceedings were awarded $350,000 by a Federal judge yesterday. The lawyers, from 19 firms, had represented shareholders trying to block the company's emergence from bankruptcy earlier this year. The shareholders had complained that the reorganization plan protected officers and directors from suits in their role in the 1984 merger with the Getty Oil Company. That merger led to a suit by the Pennzoil Company, which also wanted to merge with Getty. Pennzoil was awarded $10.3 billion by a Houston jury, and Texaco entered bankruptcy when it was unable to post a bond required for the appeal. It eventually emerged from bankruptcy by agreeing to pay Pennzoil $3 billion. The lawyers had filed 15 ''derivative'' lawsuits, or suits brought by shareholders on behalf of the company against its management. In the days immediately before Judge Howard Schwartzberg of the Federal Bankruptcy Court in White Plains approved the plan to emerge from bankruptcy, a key dispute was whether Texaco's executives had drafted the plan to let themselves off the hook for the ill-fated Getty merger. After extensive evidence was provided that the indemnification was Pennzoil's idea, the lawyers agreed to withdraw their objections. In exchange, one party that benefited from the merger, the Getty Museum, as well as a company that insured Texaco's officers and directors, agreed to provide up to $10 million in fees, subject to the approval of the bankruptcy court. They applied to the court for 11,800 hours of work. But the judge awarded only $350,000, plus $166,000 in expenses.

1233-> THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Macmillan Restructuring Is Blocked by an Injunction
The Robert M. Bass Group won a crucial court ruling yesterday against Macmillan Inc. that will prevent the publishing and information company's planned restructuring into two separate companies. The Bass Group will now be allowed to proceed with its proposed tender offer of $73 a share, or about $2 billion, for the giant publishing and information company. People close to the Texas group said it was likely to proceed with the tender offer. The preliminary injunction, by Judge Jack B. Jacobs of Delaware Chancery Court, is significant in that it appears to limit Macmillan management's ability to gain control over the company if a higher bid is on the table. Move to Appeal Decision Macmillan said yesterday that it would appeal the decision in Delaware Supreme Court. Macmillan's appeal will rest on management's argument that the restructuring does not represent a sale of the campany. By this reasoning, the company was not for sale, so management had not rejected a higher bid. It is expected that a decision on the appeal could be made well before the end of the period of 20 business days during which a tender offer is open. The battle between the parties started when the Bass Group offered $64 a share in cash for the company. Macmillan countered with a restructuring package that offered each shareholder $52.35 in cash, a $4.50 principal amount of Macmillan subordinated debentures, a share in the Macmillan Publishing Company and a half share in the Macmillan Information Company. The Macmillan plan was valued at a base price of $64.15 a share. That package's ultimate value would, of course, have depended on the value of the stock. Macmillan's top management would have owned 39 percent of the information company. The Bass Group countered with a bid of $73 a share in cash, or, alternatively, a restructuring comparable to that proposed by Macmillan but with a cash componenet of $58 a share. Restructuring Is Criticized In his decision the judge criticized both the price of the restructuring and its treatment of top management. Management, which owned less than 5 percent of the company before the restructuring, would have owned 39 percent of one of the two new companies created in its aftermath. The restructuring plan had been widely perceived as unusually generous to Macmillan's top management. The judge's decision said, ''The proposed 39 percent level of management's equity ownership is derived from valuation methods that are either incorrect or, at the very least, highly questionable.'' ''Each of the Bass offers is clearly superior to the restructuring,'' the decision stated. In explaining the decision, Michael Klein, a partner at Wilmer Cutler & Pickering, the law firm that represented the Bass Group, said that the court had found Macmillan's management has misled its board about whether Bass presented a threat. As Mr. Klein explained it: ''The threat relevant in Delaware is not a threat to management itself, but corporate policy and effectiveness. The court found the Bass Group was not a threat to that, as management had told the directors. The result was that the board was misled into adopting the restructuring.'' The Bass Group still faces other obstacles to the takeover of Macmillan. In particular, Macmillan already has a ''poison pill'' plan in place that would go into effect with the acquisition of more than 15 percent of its stock by an investor. It is possible that Macmillan could waive the poison pill should a tender offer succeed. Or the Bass Group could sue to have it waived, contending that the poison pill is being used to block an offer, rather than to bring about an orderly auction of the company.

1234-> Market Place; Analysts Favor Big 3 Auto Stocks
Despite surprisingly robust car and truck sales so far this year and some stronger-than-expected earnings, investors have largely been undervaluing the shares of the Big Three domestic automobile companies, according to a growing number of analysts who follow the industry. They say that investor perceptions of the Detroit companies have not yet shaken off a history of dizzying cyclical plunges in sales, made worse by changes in gasoline prices and interest rates, uncompetitive products and bloated costs. Investors also seem troubled by the prospect that low-cost imports from newly developing nations, like Korea, as well as competition from Japanese-owned assembly plants in this country, will strictly limit the ability of the auto companies to raise prices. This all means that the auto issues sell at very modest multiples of their current earnings. The shares of the Chrysler Corporation, which closed yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange at $23.25, up 12.5 cents, are selling at a multiple of about four. The Ford Motor Company is at a multiple of about five, despite having $20 a share in cash on its balance sheet. Ford shares closed yesterday at $47.375, up 50 cents. The General Motors Corporation has the group's highest multiple, about seven times earnings. Its shares fell 37.5 cents yesterday, to $73.375. Analysts who feel the multiples are too low point out that the weakening of the dollar has erased much of the advantage of the importers. In addition, the Big Three have improved their products and financial position and the sales cycle seems to be losing some of its roller coaster characteristics. ''Sales fell 40 percent in the last downturn and 26 percent in the one before that,'' said Ronald Glantz, who is with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. ''The attitude of investors is that every time they were told auto stocks were cheap in the past, sales fell out of bed.'' But Mr. Glantz adds that the last two auto recessions were produced by sharp increases in fuel prices and interest rates. Neither of these conditions is a factor now, and few analysts are forecasting a steep decline in sales in the current cycle. From a trough in 1982 when 10.6 million cars and light trucks were sold, overall sales in this country increased gradually to an apparent cyclical peak of 16.3 million in 1986, before dropping to 15.2 million last year. Analysts are looking for something between 14.7 million and 15 million this year and for 14.2 million in 1989. Analysts think that the current multiples are understating the earnings power of the companies as they come out of an expected recession at the end of this decade. A multiple of 10 should be a minimum, in their opinion, once stock prices start to increase anticipating a recovery. Charles J. Brady of Oppenheimer & Company recently forecast that G.M. would earn $16 a share in 1989, up from an estimated $11.80 this year. With a multiple of 10, that would give G.M. a stock price of $160 a share. Mr. Glantz is estimating that Ford will earn $8.75 a share in 1989, which at a relatively modest multiple of 10 would yield a $87.50 share price. Earnings of $4 a share for Chrysler in 1989 would raise the stock to $40 a share at a multiple of 10. Public Ownership of Dealers? As automobile dealerships have evolved in recent years from one-location, one-brand stores to large businesses with multiple locations and franchises, dealers have talked of tapping public markets to finance growth. Until recently, these discussions were largely theoretical since domestic auto companies refused to award or transfer franchises to anyone but an individual dealer-operator. But earlier this year, G.M. said it might approve public ownership in certain cases. And Ford is studying a proposal by a British dealership company, Lex Service, to acquire 50 percent of the Campbell Automotive Group of dealerships in the Los Angeles region for $13.5 million. Wall Street is not bracing for an influx of so-called mega-dealers, at least not yet. ''There has been a little talk, but nothing substantial yet,'' said David Healy, an automotive specialist with Drexel Burnham Lambert. Still, Ron B. Tonkin, a dealer in Oregon who has more than a dozen franchises, said he could foresee circumstances in which selling stock would be preferable to borrowing. One example, he said, might be a successful smaller dealer who wanted to acquire some large metropolitan dealerships. ''Those kinds of stores cost from $5 million to $8 million each,'' Mr. Tonkin said. ''It's tough to borrow that amount from a bank and service the debt. But if you are returning the investment as profits and dividends down the line, that makes sense.''

1237-> Park Service Plans to Revise Fire Recovery Policy
The National Park Service will reverse some of its established practices of letting nature take its course as it seeks to deal with the consequences of the devastating fires in Yellowstone National Park, Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel said today. This will include reforestation and revegetation of some burned-out areas, including stream banks and road beds threatened by erosion. The Park Service is also planning to feed some of the park's wildlife, like elk and bison, to prevent them from migrating out of the park and looking for food on cattle ranches. Normally, the Park Service allows time and nature to heal the wounds caused by fire as part of its policy of keeping the human impact on ecological systems as unobtrusive as possible. 'Adjustments' Are Planned ''But this is not a normal year by a long shot,'' Secretary Hodel said today, adding that the damage and suffering caused by the fire showed that ''adjustments will have to be made.'' He said the Park Service would concentrate its efforts on getting the fires out before working on specifics of the new policies. The Administration is also convening a panel of Government experts and outside scientists to examine the consequences of letting some naturally occurring fires continue to burn. That is the practice of the Park Service, an arm of the Interior Department, and of the Forest Service, which is part of the Agriculture Department. Mr. Hodel said he expected the policy to be modified but not overturned entirely. Officials of the Park Service agreed that while they would depart from some of their normal practices this year they did not expect major long-term changes. Gray F. Reynolds, director of the watershed and air management division at the Forest Service, said the recovery plan for the forests burned around Yellowstone include reforestation and revegetation in order to prevent soil erosion and sedimentation of streams. But Mr. Reynolds that such actions were part of the service's standard operating procedures. Unlike the hands-off policy of the Park Service, the Forest Service normally follows a policy of active management of National Forest lands, which are intended for a number of different uses, including timber production, watershed management, recreation and wildlife protection. Denis P. Galvin, the Deputy Director of the National Park Service, said that that most of the revegetation and other remedial activites planned in the wake of the fire would be in those areas damaged by the firefighting efforts, such as fire breaks. If stream bank erosion threatened trout in the rivers with sedimentation, the service would consider revegetion in those areas, Mr. Galvin said. Looking Out for Animals If elk and bison are given supplementary forage, Mr. Galvin said, it would be to deal with effects outside, not inside, the park - specifically to prevent them from eating forage for cattle on privately owned land. In fact, he said, the Park Service may decide to feed the cattle instead of the wildlife. As for the policy of letting some fires caused by lightning continue to burn, some modifications are likely to take account the kind of extreme weather conditions that prevailed in the Yellowstone area this year, Mr. Galvin said. In addition, he said, the Park Service would be more active in protecting developed areas in the parks such as the area around Old Faithful geyser by putting nearby fires out immediately and removing accumulated flammable dead wood. ''But we don't see a complete backing away from the policy,'' he added, and said that, in general the change in practices this year ''is not so much a departure in substance as in degree.'' George T. Frampton Jr., president of the Wilderness Society, a conservation group concerned with public lands, said that before making any decisions on what actions to take after the fires a thorough study should be conducted by a National Academy of Sciences panel. Only then should decisions be made on fire management policy and remedial action like revegetation, he said. ''Traditionally, those forests have restored themselves,'' Mr. Frampton said. ''Fires like these have made the forest what it is. It has opened meadows for wildlife and allowed lodgepole pine forest to recreate itself over the years. Large scale reforestation would not only very likely change the nature of the forest, it would also not be very cost effective.'' Derek Craighead is director of the Wildlife-Wildlands Institute, a research organization that has studied ecological issues in Yellowstone. He said: ''I agree with the philosophy and ideas of basically trying to maintain the park as a wilderness area but I don't think you can ignore the fact that it is not a self-regulating ecosystem. Sometimes they are going to have to take specific management actions and this is probably one of those times when it is not only justifiable but necessary.''

Both ends of this double bill at the Village Gate are moving in unexpected directions. When McCoy Tyner is not playing piano at the head of a trio or quartet, he is usually heard leading a big band. But for the engagement in the big downstairs room of the Village Gate, he is playing as an unaccompanied piano soloist for the first time in many years. And Arthur Blythe, alto saxophonist, is performing in a totally new setting: without a rhythm section but accompanied by a string quintet (two violinists, a violist, a cellist and a bassist). Arrangements for this group have been written by Mr. Blythe and by Sir Roland Hanna, who plays cello although he is best known as a pianist. Performances tonight and tomorrow are at 9:30 and 11:30. Admission is $12.50, and there is a two-drink minimum. 'Heat' on East 55th ''Harlem Heat,'' Vince Giordano and the Nighthawks, the Hot Club of France, Michael's Pub, 211 East 55th Street (758-2272). Although heat may be the last thing anyone will go looking for this weekend, the kind of musical heat put out by Vince Giordano's 10-piece orchestra and the string quartet led by the guitarist Frank Vignola - based on the 1930's Quintet of the Hot Club of France with Django Reinhardt and Stephane Grappelli -is a refreshing change of pace on New York's jazz scene. Avoiding the Dixieland cliches of the 1920's and the too frequently heard swing-band standbys of the 30's and 40's, the two groups, which play separately and as a combined 14-piece ensemble, evoke both periods with some of the less familiar gems from the repertories of Jimmie Lunceford, Fletcher Henderson, Chick Webb, Benny Carter, Duke Ellington and the Hot Club Quintet played with a flair that catches the spirit of the originals. Shows are at 9:30 and 11:30 tonight and tomorrow. There is a cover charge of $20 and a two-drink minimum both nights.

1239-> SPORTS PEOPLE; McGirt-Davis Bout
In what its promoters call the last scheduled 15-round championship fight in the United States, James (Buddy) McGirt will make the first defense of the International Boxing Federation junior welterweight crown that took him six years to attain July 31 at the Felt Forum. His opponent will be Howard Davis Jr., the 1976 Olympic lightweight champion who has been unable to lay claim to a professional title in a dozen years. Davis, 32 years old, who lost close decisions in two lightweight championship fights, to James Watt in 1980 and Edwin Rosario in 1984, admitted that this third chance might be his final opportunity. The Sunday afternoon bout will be televised nationally by ABC. After Sept. 1, the I.B.F. will join the World Boxing Council and the World Boxing Association in limiting all championship fights to 12 rounds. Five 15-round title fights under I.B.F. sanction are scheduled in August, but none will be in the United States.

1240-> SPLIT IS REPORTED OVER ABM ACCORD
Disagreeing with the civilian leadership of the Pentagon, the Joint Chiefs of Staff are resisting a move that would allow the United States to suspend some of its obligations under the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty, Administration officials say. The position of the Joints Chiefs is consistent with their strong concern that the Soviet Union would be in a better position to move ahead over the short run with the development of anti-missile defensive systems if treaty restraints are loosened, according to Administration officials. The Reagan Administration has been deeply divided over whether to step up its charges of Soviet cheating by declaring that Moscow has committed a ''material breach'' of the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty by building an early warning radar system in central Siberia. Such a move would allow the United States to suspend some of its ABM treaty obligations. It is not clear what steps, if any, the United States would actually take if the Administration asserted the right to suspend some treaty obligations. Senior officials say the Administration is not considering abrogation of the entire treaty. Some senior officials see a declaration of ''material breach'' as a way to demonstrate American resolve over the violation. But opponents fear that the move is also being urged by some hard-liners as part of a long-term strategy of dropping adherence to the ABM treaty. 'Vigorous Discussion on This' ''The President has heard vigorous discussion on this,'' the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said Monday, alluding to an unannounced meeting that President Reagan held with his top advisers on July 6. Mr. Fitzwater said Mr. Reagan had not made a decision. Opposing the move are the State Department and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. On the other side are civilian Defense Department officials, hard-line arms control advisers and some Cabinet officers, such as Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d and Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d. The issue has come to the fore because the Administration has told the Soviets that it would like to hold the periodic five-year review of the ABM treaty sometime between today and July 22. The Soviet Union has not officially said whether these dates are acceptable. Under the treaty terms, the review is to be held before early October. The United States has already charged that the Soviet early radar system at Krasnoyarsk violates the ABM treaty because it is not situated on the periphery of the Soviet Union and oriented outward as the treaty requires. It has demanded that the radar be dismantled. Linked to Strategic Accord Moscow has denied the charge of violation but has also announced a temporary moratorium on further construction. State Department officials say the United States has already put the Soviets on notice that it will not conclude a new strategic arms treaty until the dispute over the Krasnoyark radar is resolved. And the Soviets are reported to have hinted that they may take some corrective action if an agreement can be worked out on anti-missile systems at the Geneva arms talks. One question that has been raised is whether a charge of material breach would prompt the Soviets to take new corrective action or deprive them of a face-saving way out. Another issue that pits the State Department officials against Administration hard-liners is whether the violation is so severe that it warrants a charge of ''material breach.'' Meeting of Top Officials When President Reagan met with top officials on July 6, Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci is said to have supported the charge of a ''material breach,'' officials say. So did Edward L. Rowny, a conservative arms control adviser to President Reagan; Attorney General Meese, and William Graham, the science adviser to President Reagan. Some officials say Treasury Secretary Baker also endorsed this view. John C. Whitehead, the Deputy Secretary of State, who represented the State Department at the meeting, argued against a charge of ''material breach,'' espousing the views of Paul H. Nitze, the arms control adviser to Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Max M. Kampelman, the chief United States arms negotiator, who also attended the meeting. Gen. Robert T. Herres, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is also said to have opposed the idea of charging a material breach. ''The Chiefs understand where the S.D.I. program is really at right now and they do not believe it is in our interest to undercut the ABM treaty at this time,'' a senior Administration official said, referring to the Strategic Defense Initiative, or ''Star Wars.'' William F. Burns, the director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, positioned himself somewhere in the middle, though he reportedly leaned toward the hard-line view. He is said to have advocated that Soviet officials be warned at the review meeting that the radar would be declared a ''material breach'' unless Moscow took some type of corrective action soon. Mr. Burns is said to take the view that the Administration should not lodge a charge of ''material breach'' unless it has a clear idea of what action it would take in response.

1241-> The Law; At the Bar
One lawyer, describing the plan, conjured up Orwellian images of Big Brother. Another lawyer said it smacked of the Soviet Union. Many said it violated numerous clauses of the Constitution, including the ban on slavery. The speakers were not professional civil libertarians but rank-and-file lawyers from places like Bismarck, Fargo, and Mandan, N.D. Their target was not some draconian measure to curb crime, but a far more modest proposal requiring them to devote 20 hours a year to the noncriminal legal problems of the needy. Traditionally, the mere mention of making public service work a condition for licensing has generated hostility of Pavlovian predictability. Eight years ago the American Bar Association's House of Delegates crushed such a proposal, as have many other organizations. The North Dakota plan was proposed by a panel created by the state's Supreme Court. It is now stalled and may just be the latest victim. Still, there are numerous signs that such compulsory programs are inevitable if not exactly imminent. Courts and bar associations in Texas, Florida, and Arkansas have already put mandatory public service requirements into effect. The issue has been debated in Oregon and Washington. It is on the table in Maryland, and it will soon be addressed in New York by a panel created by Chief Judge Sol Wachtler and led by Victor Marrero of Brown & Wood and including the most impressive convert to the cause, former Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance. Throughout the country, the talk is no longer so much whether and if lawyers will be required to contribute their services as it is how much, when, and where. ''Mandatory pro bono is coming, for two reasons,'' said Representative Benjamin L. Cardin of Baltimore, condensing the Latin for for the public good. He has spearheaded the effort in Maryland. ''There's a rising social consciousness among attorneys, as well as a more pragmatic concern that if they don't do something themselves, something more severe will be imposed on them.'' The different climate reflects a desire to compensate for the Reagan Administration's cutback in the Federal Legal Services program, the largest provider of assistance to poor people in civil cases. And it stems from the obvious inadequacy of current voluntary efforts by bar groups to meet the huge call for help. ''Exhortation alone seems not to have closed the gap,'' said a longtime advocate of compulsory programs, Alexander Forger of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy. Bismarck, N. D., is a place better known as the home of the Raccoon National Cemetery on ''The Honeymooners'' than a hotbed of legal innovation. Indeed, there are only 1,000 practicing lawyers in the entire state. But North Dakota's proposed pro bono program is clearly the most far-reaching and imaginative anywhere. Until recently, its backers thought, it was also the most palatable. All licensed lawyers - private practitioners, corporate attorneys, government lawyers including Attorney General Nicholas Spaeth and even, arguably, judges - would be required to devote 20 hours each year to the legal needs of the poor. A lawyer could buy his way out (for $50 an hour, with the money going to other work for the needy), pass along his obligation to colleagues, or ''educate his way out'' by taking or teaching courses in poverty law. The program, backed by Chief Justice Ralph J. Erickstad of the North Dakota Supreme Court, rests not on the idea, unpopular among lawyers, that lawyers have a perpetual ethical obligation to serve the poor but that the bar should take the lead in serving society's unmet needs. It would be dropped after six years. By that time state-financed legal aid programs would presumably be in place. Sponsors of the proposal insist that it is not only public-spirited but also self-interested, helping to clean up the bar's image of avariciousness and perhaps even to find new business. The proposal generated the predictable prairie storm of criticism. In their antipathy to mandatory pro bono, lawyers have one clear advantage over other, equally resistant cartels: they know all the ground rules. In North Dakota as elsewhere, they say it violates the Fifth Amendment, which bars taking property without just compensation. They say further that it abridges equal protection guarantees: only when doctors must perform free appendectomies, when restaurateurs must donate meals, when landlords furnish free apartments and when gas stations pump gratis gas, they say, can lawyers be so coerced. And they say it violates the 13th Amendment's ban on ''involuntary servitude.'' The North Dakota state bar recently voted not to act on the measure before June 1989. But the association rejected a move to kill the plan outright. In the meantime, the proposal has attracted national attention. Robert D. Raven of San Francisco called it ''impressive and provocative,'' and so, in a way, was his comment. He is the incoming president of a group that is not known for its fondness for change, the American Bar Association.

1242-> SPORTS PEOPLE; Cubs-Expos Trade
In a trade of outfielders, Dave Martinez was sent by the Chicago Cubs to the Montreal Expos yesterday for Mitch Webster. ''It was the fact Martinez never learned how to read pitchers and could not steal bases that led us to this decision,'' the Cubs' manager, Don Zimmer, said. ''We want to take advantage of Webster's switch-hitting ability and we think he can steal more bases than Martinez.'' Webster was batting .255 with 2 homers, 13 runs batted in and 12 stolen bases. Martinez was batting .254 with 4 homers and 34 runs batted in and 7 stolen bases. (AP)

1251-> SPORTS OF THE TIMES; Taking a Look at Lasix
Saratoga in August is far more than 24 days of racing. It has long been an unofficial international convention for thoroughbred racing. The races occupy only the afternoon hours, preceded by formal meetings by various groups in the mornings and followed by auctions in the evening, and increasingly spirited discussions of the game into the night. In the official and the unofficial sessions, the theme this year is change. Thoroughbred racing in America seems to be on the verge of extraordinary growth. The future does not involve getting more horseplayers through the turnstiles, but embracing the emerging technologies that could double or triple the fan base and the betting handle. New Yorkers can already place bets by telephone and watch replays of the races on cable television each evening, or dine in restaurants that have betting windows and live broadcasts of the races. The day that anyone can pick up the phone to bet on the Kentucky Derby is not far off. Also, the sport is slowly expanding to new parks and more favorable slots. The game is coming to Oklahoma this fall, to Texas within a year or two, and probably into the Bible Belt by the end of the century. Nearly every state has repealed the blue laws against racing on Sunday, potentially the biggest day of the week, and night racing is making inroads in urban markets. The potential is clearly enormous, but it is not as clear whether racing is ready for it. The industry has plenty of housecleaning to do, most of it involving the one issue that will not go away: the widespread use of both legal and illegal medication, and the resulting public perception that this is an unsavory game run by chemists and crooked gamblers. The sport's only annual, national meeting on industry-wide problems is the Jockey Club Round Table at Saratoga, which will be held tomorrow. After years of ignoring the medication issue, the Jockey Club last year apppointed one of those ''blue-ribbon panels'' to study and research it. The panel's major project so far has been to initiate a study of Lasix, the controversial medication that has brought the sport miles of bad publicity and eroded public confidence. The results of the Jockey Club's study are not yet in, but the very nature of its project is not promising. Lasix is a diuretic that every major racing state except New York permits to be administered to horses who have bled from the lungs under the stress of exercise or racing. Folk wisdom holds that Lasix, by draining fluid from a horse, keeps him from bleeding again. The problem is that no study has ever proved that Lasix has any effect whatsoever on bleeding, and the Food and Drug Administration has never approved it for that use. Plenty of racing results, however, suggest that horses treated with Lasix often improve dramatically. The Jockey Club decided to study this problem with a program involving horses racing at Philadelphia Park. Horses who do not have bleeding problems are being treated with Lasix to see if it improves their performance. If it does, the Jockey Club will conclude, then Lasix has volatile properties unrelated to bleeding control. If it does not, the Jockey Club is likely to say, Lasix apparently does not affect form and should be approved everywhere, including New York. That would be a fatuous conclusion. The study does not address the real question of whether Lasix has any beneficial effect on bleeders. It also fails to consider the greatest danger for misuse of the drug: Lasix drains a horse's system, removing traces of other medications that might have been improperly administered. If you wanted to give a horse a powerful illegal drug, the best thing you could do would be to get him certified as a bleeder so he could be legally treated with Lasix. Rather than creating an incomplete and artificial study to generate statistics about Lasix, racing leaders should consider the facts staring them in the face: the daily race results from nearly every American racetrack, including those of the most important races. Cutlass Reality was a second-rater for four seasons in New York, then turned into a stakes horse overnight when given Lasix in California this year. Alysheba has won 1 one of 11 starts without Lasix but earned almost $4 million with it. He will race without it in his next start, the Haskell Handicap at Monmouth on Aug. 27, and may run perfectly well, which would only prove he should never have been allowed to race with it in the first place, since he has never had a bleeding problem. In the Haskell, he may meet Bet Twice, who has just started using the drug. No one is saying that the trainers of these horses are doing anything improper. They are taking every legal edge afforded them in a competitive game where necks and noses mean millions. But no one knows the effect these drugs are having. Rather than permitting the use of such drugs while researchers try to determine their effects, racing leaders should ban them until more is known. At the very least, the drugs should be barred from the very top flight of competition, Grade I races that determine the sport's championships and the future of the breed. Racing has worked hard to spread opportunities for public involvement, and stands at the threshold of explosive growth. But it must stand on firmer ground when it comes to public confidence. Prospective customers are not going to play a game that permits the use of drugs whose effects are an utter mystery.

1253-> New York Officials Disagree Over Beach Debris
Amid an almost tangible sense of frustration at their inability to explain the source of medical waste on beaches in the region this month, New York City and State officials yesterday began disagreeing with each other over theories about the origin of the trash. Two New York City Commissioners, in particular, took issue with the state's top environmental official, who has said that much of the waste on the beach might have been flushed through the city's storm sewers or released from its trash disposal sites. Two swimming areas, along the Hudson River in the Westchester County village of Ossining, meanwhile, were closed yesterday after officials there found several hundred crack vials and six hypodermic needles. High Bacteria Counts And on Staten Island, Midland and South Beaches remained closed for the 11th day after nearly two dozen items of medical waste, including five syringes, washed ashore yesterday. The discoveries brought the number of syringes found on Staten Island beaches this month to nearly 700. Jacob Riis Park in Queens, closed since Sunday, was reopened to swimming. High bacteria counts kept beaches closed at two national recreation areas in the city, and New Jersey health officials identified an Asbury Park sewage treatment plant as the likely source of pollution that has troubled four New Jersey Shore towns in the past week. In New York City, several officials said they were skeptical of a theory offered by the State Commissioner of Environmental Conservation, Thomas C. Jorling, that much of the medical waste on city beaches came from city sewers and trash-transfer points. ''I just don't think you'd find massive quantities of explicit medical waste through any other source except a willful act, a large illegal dumping,'' said Brendan Sexton, the Commissioner of Sanitation. 'We're All Sort of Mystified' And Harvey W. Schultz, the Commissioner of Environmental Protection, whose department manages the sewers, said, ''It's our opinion that there's not a very strong possibility that the concentrations of medical waste we're talking about could come from that source.'' Mr. Schultz added, however: ''We do concur with Commissioner Jorling that we're all sort of mystified. Nobody has been able to figure out where this stuff is coming from.'' Mr. Jorling scheduled a news conference in Albany for this morning, saying that he would release a summary of his investigators' findings so far in the medical-waste mystery. He reiterated previous statements that no ''smoking gun''or ''midnight dumper'' had been found and said that his debris theory, all but ridiculed by city officials, remained ''a plausible explanation for the evidence we've looked at.'' No Increase Observed Mr. Jorling said he understood that there had been a noticeable increase in the number of syringes passing through city sewers, perhaps because AIDS education programs had made drug addicts more aware of the dangers of sharing them. But one of the city's assistant commissioners of Environmental Protection, Edward O. Wagner, said that plant operators do not see a large number of needles. ''Our plant people say there have always been a background number of these syringes that they have observed,'' said Mr. Wagner, who is the director of the Department's Bureau of Waste Water Treatment. ''They have not observed an increase.'' Several political leaders urged tougher sanctions against dumping. The Brooklyn District Attorney, Elizabeth Holtzman, said the dumping of medical wastes should be a felony. In general, such dumping is a misdemeanor. F.B.I. Inquiry Is Urged ''The public is fed up, '' she said at a sidewalk news conference. ''People want to be able to use the beaches in the summertime.'' Representative Guy V. Molinari, Republican of Staten Island, called on the F.B.I. to take over the medical waste investigation and deal with violators. In New Jersey, the primary problems continued to be related to sewage. Beaches in Asbury Park, Ocean Grove, Bradley Beach and Avon-by-the-Sea were closed again after tests indicated high levels of fecal coliform bacteria. Nevertheless, a truck-company owner offered a $10,000 reward to anyone offering information leading to the conviction of a dumper. The executive, Brad Honigsberg of Air Contact Transport Inc. of Roxbury, N.J., said he was a lifelong beach visitor dismayed by the medical waste.

1255-> COMPANY NEWS; PPG Drops Offer To Acquire Grow
PPG Industries terminated its plans to acquire Grow Group Inc., a manufacturer of paint and chemical coatings based in New York, for $300 million, sending the stock tumbling on Wall Street. PPG gave no reason for the surprise decision. Under the merger agreement, today was the last day PPG had the right to cancel the agreement. PPG had agreed on Aug. 19 to purchase Grow Group, which has annual sales of around $380 million, for $16.625 a share, or about $300 million. The price included the value of Grow Group's debt that would have been taken over by PPG. After a trading halt, Grow Group's stock fell $4 today, to $11.75 a share. Its 25.3 percent decline was the largest on the Big Board. A Grow Group plant was involved in a chemical leak Saturday that forced the evacuation of 20,000 people in eastern Los Angeles. Health officials said they saw no long-term impact or health risks from the leak.

Dukakis, a sharp critic of the Strategic Defense Initiative, said today that he was pleased to hear Vice President Bush saying that deployment of the proposed missile defense system should be contingent on the outcome of further research. Mr. Dukakis, who has been hammered by conservatives for opposing the missile defense plan and other new weapons systems, was clearly pleased over the Vice President's new cautiousness, disclosed in an interview published today in The New York Times, toward the system often referred to as 'Star Wars.' After swearing in a new member of the Massachusetts Port Authority at the statehouse, Mr. Dukakis was asked about the Vice President's position, and he replied: ''I'm glad the Vice President now agrees with me and a great many other American citizens, that while doing research into 'Star Wars' does make sense, spending billions and billions we don't have, at a time when we've got a massive Federal deficit and other important defense needs, on this system - on building it and deploying it - just doesn't make sense. I think he's made the right decision, and I'm glad he has.''

1258-> Over-the-Counter Short Sales Rose 8.4% in Month
The National Association of Securities Dealers yesterday reported an 8.4 percent monthly increase in the short interest for the most active over-the-counter securities in its national market system. For the month ended Oct. 15, 160.6 million shares were sold short and not yet covered, compared with 148.1 million shares sold short in the period ended Sept. 15. The October figures represent short selling in 2,458 stocks; in September, the selling was spread among 2,465 issues. In a short sale, an investor, betting that a stock's price will decline, sells borrowed stock, expecting to buy back an equal number of shares later at a lower price and thereby make a profit.Two Views Some traders and analysts consider a large short position to be bearish, because it presumably represents a strong, cumulative belief that the market will turn down. Under this reasoning, a large jump in the short position would also be bearish. But many analysts believe that a large short position is a positive, or bullish, sign for the stock market, because short-sellers must eventually buy back the stock they have sold. By this reasoning, a large ''overhang'' of short stock can fuel a market rally. The N.A.S.D. said that short interest in 1,279 less-active O-T-C securities that are traded in its automated quotation system, but not in the national market system, totaled 59.7 million shares as of Oct. 15, up 6.6 percent from 56 million shares in the September period, when 1,243 securities were involved. In general, the value of short interest as a predictive indicator of market bullishness or bearishness has been called into question in recent years. That is primarily because stock is sold short by arbitragers involved in many special situations. Some interpretations of recent Internal Revenue Service rulings have also led to speculation that pension funds may soon use short selling for hedging purposes.Brokerage Strategies There are other anomalies in the short-interest situation. For example, the larger percentage rise in the less-active Nasdaq issues may be explained by various strategies employed by certain brokerage houses that make markets in such stocks. Some firms say that they short such stock, particularly new issues, as a way of supporting prices. Still, many analysts who track market sentiment still study short interest, and have devised ways to screen out the arbitrage and other ''noise'' that distorts the figures. The number of shares in which a short position is still held by investors is totaled by each exchange and by the N.A.S.D. each month. The following N.A.S.D. stocks show changes in open short positions of 10,000 shares or more: $ Security Name 10/14/88 9/15/88 1st Amer Bancorp Inc T 35,053 2,537 20th Century Inds T 57,966 38,363 3 D Systems Inc 8,263 25,244 A B Electrlx Adr Spd T 14,192 34,685 A C S Enterprises 8,996 20,387 A D C Telecommun Inc T 83,240 54,877 A D T Limited Adr T N 1,601,911 0 A J Ross Logistic * 93,496 130,115 A L Williams Cp The T* 210,347 200,050 A M E Inc T 2,000 24,297 A R I X Cp N 236,699 0 A S A Intl Ltd 111,550 83,740 A S T Research Inc T 1,815,245 1,516,322 A W Brands Inc T 136,468 108,864 Academy Ins Group T 26,215 155,025 Ackerley Comm Inc 24,572 0 Action Auto Rental T S 7,193 31,338 Adobe Systems Inc T 493,444 517,739 Advance Genetic Sci T 44,900 4,800 Advanced Circuits T 4,900 20,005 Advanced Med Produts 79,589 3,000 Advanced Nmr Sys * 152,383 140,975 Advanced Prod * 37,690 68,256 Aegon N.V.

The Procter & Gamble Company said today that its profit in the third fiscal quarter jumped 40 percent over the corresponding period last year, largely because of a lower Federal income tax rate. The consumer products company said that its earnings were $263 million, or $1.53 a share, for the three months ended March 31, compared with earnings of $188 million, or $1.10 a share, last year. Its sales also rose, to $4.8 billion from $4.2 billion. Procter & Gamble, based in Cincinnati, produces a variety of consumer goods, including laundry and cleaning products, pharmaceuticals and food and beverage products.

1264-> New Hunt Set For Fed Choice
The White House is casting about for a new candidate to fill a vacant seat on the Federal Reserve Board because of a powerful Senator's opposition to the front-runner, Leif H. Olsen, according to officials. The President's long-expected nomination of Mr. Olsen, the former chief economist at Citibank and now a consultant, has brought objections from Senator Jake Garn, Republican of Utah. Mr. Garn is the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, which passes on nominations to the Fed's seven-member board of governors. One prospective candidate is William B. Eagleson, former chairman of the Mellon Bank Corporation in Pittsburgh. The White House appears to want to nominate someone with views similar to those of Mr. Olsen, who is a prominent monetarist - one who maintains that steady growth of money supply assures steady economic growth and low inflation.

1265-> Minister Is Indicted in Assault
The director of a fundamentalist children's home and two assistants were indicted by a state grand jury today on charges of assaulting officers who raided the home June 13 and took custody of children said to have been abused and neglected. The Rev. Herman Fountain, 38 years old, operator of the Bethel Home for Children, and Michael Baldino, 25, were indicted on three counts each of felonious assault on a law-enforcement officer. Two counts were lodged against 18-year-old Phil Reining. The three were scheduled to be arraigned Friday in George County Circuit Court. The unlicensed school is operated by the independent Bethel Baptist Church. The indictments were returned by a George County grand jury that went into session Monday. Mr. Fountain and the two assistants drove to the courthouse after the Circuit Clerk, Wilbur Ward, notified them of the indictments. They were allowed to remain free on bonds that were posted after the confrontation. ''I don't feel like they're after me,'' Mr. Fountain said when he arrived at the courthouse. ''I feel like they're after the church.'' Mark Maples, the county prosecutor, was in court today and was unavailable for comment. Mr. Fountain, who has claimed to be a former heroin addict and practitioner of witchcraft, has said he had as many as 120 children living at his 28-acre compound outside Lucedale. He contends that his right to freedom of religion exempts him from any state oversight. But last June, a George County Youth Court judge, looking into allegations of beatings and other abuse, ordered the state Department of Public Welfare to take custody of the Bethel residents. Some state law officers have accused Mr. Fountain of ordering the children to flee the compound, an accusation he denies. It took officials several days to round up the children. The minister is accused of punching law-enforcement officers after they stormed the locked church in search of the children. Several witnesses, including reporters, saw Mr. Fountain swing at offices. The minister has appealed a separate conviction of disorderly conduct. He has been fined $200 for the charge, which also stems from the June 13 incident. His initial Circuit Court appearance in the appeal is scheduled for Oct. 31.

1267-> THE MEDIA BUSINESS; New Fight on TV Ad-Sales Rule
Nearly 30 years after severely restricting the ability of the major television networks to sell advertising time on behalf of their local affiliates, the Federal Communications Commission has touched off an industrywide controversy by considering a rule change that would again allow ABC, CBS and NBC to compete in that business. The chance to represent affiliates in the sale of air time to national advertisers could be appealing to the networks at a time when they are under pressure from their corporate parents to increase their profitability. Under the current rules, the network companies can sell advertising time only for affiliates they own and operate. But the idea is anathema to the dozen companies that now represent the 600 network affiliates and hundreds of independent stations. The ''rep'' firms, led by subsidiaries of Katz Communications Inc., John Blair Communications Inc. and Tele-Rep Inc., sold more than $7 billion worth of air time last year. That business is already hotly competitive, and the companies have vowed to resist the entrance of potentially powerful new rivals. Pursuing the Status Quo ''We fought it 30 years ago, and we will use every resource at our disposal to maintain the status quo,'' said Jerome Feniger, the managing director of the Station Representatives Association, a trade group. Some affiliates appear wary as well. They say the interests of the network companies will not always coincide with their own when it comes to advertising sales. They wonder, for example, whether a network sales representative would be as aggressive as an independent company in selling time when an affiliate pre-empts the network for local programming. The F.C.C. review came up almost as a technicality, in relation to a longstanding case. The case involved a temporary waiver of the rule, granted to a Spanish-language network called Univision, now owned by Hallmark Cards Inc. The three major networks had not been lobbying for a review; indeed, they said they were surprised when the F.C.C. announced last month that it would begin the process. The F.C.C. had barred the networks from representing stations other than those they owned and operated in 1959, because the commission thought that the networks might exert too much control over the operations of affiliates. Networks Undecided The three major networks have not yet taken official positions on the matter. All appear to be grappling with the benefits and drawbacks. Network executives said they did not want to offend their affiliates, most of which seem relatively happy with the current system. The networks also must be careful not to alienate the rep firms, which exert a powerful influence over the advertising marketplace and provide programming and strategic advice to many affiliates. Tony C. Malara, vice president for affiliate relations at CBS, said the network was inclined to press for deregulation wherever possible. ''If there is an unwarranted rule on the books, we feel it should come off,'' he said. On the other hand, he said, CBS cannot ignore the concerns of the affiliates and the rep companies. An Attractive Possibility Still, some network executives clearly see the rep business as an attractive one in which they could compete successfully. NBC, a unit of the General Electric Company, represents five of the seven stations it owns, and will add the other two by early next year. ''We are in the rep business, and we think we do a very good job at it,'' said Al Jerome, the president of NBC's station group. ''If the legal way were cleared, we would give serious consideration to continuing our expansion.'' Analysts said there could be nonfinancial benefits for the networks as well. Relations between networks and affiliates have become strained in recent years as network audiences have eroded and more stations have started pre-empting network shows. Selling the stations' air time ''could be a powerful bond between the network and its affiliates at a time when many of the old bonds are fraying,'' said Alan J. Gottesman, an analyst at L.F. Rothschild. The F.C.C. has said it will consider four options. One would eliminate all restrictions on network participation in the rep business. A second would be to keep the rule and to eliminate waivers that were granted to three Spanish-language broadcasters to allow them to represent their affiliates in that small, fast-growing field. A third would continue to bar ABC, CBS and NBC from the business but to make permanent exceptions for smaller networks, including the Hispanic broadcasters and possibly the Fox Broadcasting network. The fourth option would be to maintain the current situation, which bars the major networks but allows temporary exceptions for the Hispanic networks. The formal review process will not begin until later this year. When it does, industry executives will watch closely not only for clues on this issue, but also for signs of the commission's stance on regulatory issues in general. That is important because another matter, far more important to the networks, is expected to heat up later this year. That issue is whether the networks should be allowed to own and syndicate their own programming, and both the networks and program producers say the outcome will determine the economic viability of their industries for decades.

1271-> New & Noteworthy
FAST LANES, by Jayne Anne Phillips. (Washington Square/Pocket Books, $5.95.) Unlike the selections in her first collection of short fiction, ''Black Tickets,'' many of these stories of dispossessed drifters are unfocused and even a bit cliched, Jay McInerney said here last year. But in the best of them, such as ''Bluegill,'' in which a young woman engages in a monologue with her unborn child, ''events have a dreamlike inevitability.'' THE SECRET HOUSE: 24 Hours in the Strange and Unexpected World in Which We Spend Our Nights and Days, by David Bodanis. (Touchstone/Simon & Schus-ter, $9.95.) Viewed microscopically, the author shows, even the most suburban home teems with disgusting creatures, such as the 2 million mites that inhabit a typical double bed, living on tiny flakes of skin. Yet a penicillin mold on a slice of Cheddar cheese (pictured) can appear as beautiful as some imagined extraterrestrial garden. In 1986, K. C. Cole said in The Times that this picture-filled book is ''nothing short of astounding.'' It ''zooms in relentlessly on the mundane matters of modern life, proving once again that the difference between the ordinary and the exotic is only your point of view.'' FAMILY RESEMBLANCES, by Lowry Pei. (Vintage, $6.95.) Exiled for a summer with her eccentric young aunt, a 15-year-old girl learns that love stories don't often have happy endings. Lowry Pei's ''clean, limpid, almost translucent prose renders the perfect plot . . . all but invisible,'' Lee Smith said here in 1986, ''as small events build to genuine suspense.'' KAISHA: The Japanese Corporation, by James C. Abegglen and George Stalk Jr. (Basic, $12.95.) After working in Tokyo, the authors conclude that it is not Zenlike management styles that have led to Japanese corporate success but sheer aggressiveness. In 1985, our reviewer, Nicholas D. Kristof, praised the authors for going beyond ''dark conspiracy theories or giddy paeans.'' ''Like most things created in Japan, this book is sturdy, well designed and a good buy.'' SUMMERTIME, by Maureen McCoy. (Washington Square/Pocket Books, $6.95.) The mother, wife and daughter of a man dying of leukemia spend a summer awaiting the inevitable. Last year, Emily Listfield said here that the novel ''has a cumulative power, and in the end an overriding optimism - reasoned, sanded down by the necessary compromises, but optimism nonetheless - that is moving.'' MORTAL SPLENDOR: The American Empire in Transition, by Walter Russell Mead. (Houghton Mifflin, $9.95.) By extending the liberal vision and insisting on decent working conditions for third world laborers, the author argues, the United States would not only be morally right but would also serve its own economic interest. This book ''should be required study for Democratic Presidential candidates and their staffs,'' Randall Rothenberg said here last year. A WORLD OF LOVE, by Elizabeth Bowen. (Penguin, $5.95.) With the careful prose that is her trademark, Elizabeth Bowen tells what happens when an Irish girl discovers a batch of old love letters in a run-down country house. ''Miss Bowen's powers are at their summit,'' A. S. Morris said here in 1955. ''She is interested in the outward and unexceptional as it must, if carefully observed, illuminate the hidden and particular.'' HEALTH AND HEALING, by Andrew Weil. (Houghton Mifflin, $8.95.) After studying a range of alternative therapies, a Harvard-trained physician concluded that most important to success is that patient and practitioner have faith in the cure. In 1984, our reviewer, Gerald Weissmann, said the ''amiable, open-minded guide [ is ] sympathetic, but not uncritical.'' HEARTBREAK HOTEL, by Gabrielle Burton. (Penguin, 6.95.) The residents of the Heartbreak Hotel in Buffalo work at the Museum of the Revolution, which displays miniskirts, Barbie dolls and other examples of sexist oppression. ''Reading this novel is like watching a boisterous, surrealistic three-ring circus on the theme of being a woman in America,'' Brett Harvey said here in 1986. ''Women readers in particular will roar and cringe with recognition, and many will be swept up in Gabrielle Burton's triumphant vision.'' TONE DEAF AND ALL THUMBS? An Invitation to Music-Making, by Frank R. Wilson. (Vintage, $6.95.) Using his expertise as a neurologist and late-blooming amateur pianist, Frank R. Wilson analyzes the brain and the muscular system and explores the biology of timing, rhythm and tempo, concluding that it is never too late to learn. In 1986, our reviewer, Robert J. Lurtsema, said the book was obscure in places but, on balance, ''thought-provoking and valuable to both the novice and the accomplished musician.'' REINDEER MOON, by Elizabeth Marshall Thomas. (Pocket Books, $4.50.) Written by an anthropologist, this first novel tells of an adolescent girl's life in a Siberian clan 20,000 years ago. Last year, our reviewer, Gay Andrews Dillin, called the book ''entrancing.'' It ''illuminates our path back into the distant past, allowing us to see it with new understanding.'' WOMEN OF THE LEFT BANK: Paris, 1900-1940, by Shari Benstock. (University of Texas, $12.95.) Reversing what has been conventionally accepted as foreground and background, Shari Benstock argues that Gertrude Stein, Alice B. Toklas, Jean Rhys, Djuna Barnes and other members of their Parisian literary community were as important to the development of modern literature as T. S. Eliot, James Joyce and Ezra Pound. ''Modernism as we will understand it for a long time to come will be defined by [ this ] book,'' one reviewer said in 1987.

1273-> CONSUMER'S WORLD; Test for Consumers: Finding the Real Bargain in Electronics
It's high season for electronics bargains. Presidents' Birthdays sales, running at full tilt, allow dealers to clear inventories before new products are introduced in April and May. Big-screen television sets, video cameras, VCR's and disk players are among the goods being heavily promoted. Yet finding a real bargain can be a challenge. Every year, electronic products improve and prices fall, but cutthroat competition and high-pressure sales tactics can make the marketplace confusing and intimidating. ''Watch out!'' said Barry Bryant, who tracks the electronics industry for Drexel Burnham Lambert. ''It's a cruel world out there.'' Not everyone is so grim. ''Relax,'' said Len Safhay, executive vice president of Harvey Electronics. ''People approach us as though they were going through open-heart surgery. It's not. Electronics is an industry that doesn't have many bad products.'' Higher Prices Later Indeed, quality is generally good and consumers have benefited from the competitiveness of the industry, which is so fierce it has insulated buyers from the effects of the rising yen. Japanese manufacturers, however, say they are determined to make higher prices stick later. Yet comparison shopping has become trickier, for two key reasons: many manufacturers produce nearly identical products with different model numbers for sale only by certain stores in certain markets; and there may be little difference between similar products offered under different brand names. Philips Consumer Electronics for example, produces four brands -Philips, Sylvania, Magnavox and Philco - and the differences between them are limited to optional features, appearance and price, said Patrick Wilson, a Philips spokesman. Matsushita and the Japan Victor Corporation are the two major manufacturers of VHS recorders. They allow their equipment to be relabeled and resold by American and European companies; thus, the difference between two comparable VCR's may only be the name and the packaging. This trend toward uniformity explains why prices are so competitive, but there are many exceptions. For example, Hammacher Schlemmer & Company's catalogue offers a Sony World Band radio for $319.50. The L. L. Bean catalogue offers an identical radio for $225. Discount retailers in New York sell what appears to be the same product for $195. This is simply a matter of what the market will bear. Hammacher Schlemmer, which serves affluent customers, has raised the radio's price since 1985, when it sold it for $299. L. L. Bean, which has a broader customer base, offers the radio at a nationally competitive price. In New York, shoppers seem to expect rock-bottom prices. A walk on West 45th Street in Manhattan tells the story. Within one block, between Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas, there is the Wiz (''Nobody beats the Wiz''), S. S. Sound City, Crazy Eddie (''We cannot be undersold''), Newmark & Lewis (''We'll always beat the competitor's price''), SaveMart, Bridge Midtown Camera and Harvey Electronics. The stores are crammed with products and the air vibrates with audio-visual signals. Only Harvey Electronics, with separate rooms for listening and viewing, offers space to think. Hard Bargaining Comparing prices is almost impossible because each store displays different brands or different models of the same brand. Bargaining is blatant. At Newmark & Lewis, a salesman offered a young couple a large-screen Mitsubishi television for $2,150, even though the price tag said $2,400. The man offered $2,000 and the salesman countered with $2,050. A large-screen NEC television in Sound City, which does not carry the Mitsubishi model, had a price tag of $3,000. The same couple offered $2,000. The salesman offered $2,700, then $2,500 and then $2,475, asserting that the wholesale price was $2,066. The couple kept shopping. The electronics manufacturers, which sold $30 billion worth of goods at wholesale last year, have been consolidating. Retailers have, too, in a way that tends to eliminate middle-of-the-road retailers - the ones that do not offer the lowest prices or high quality service, said Mr. Bryant. In the Boston area, retail activity shows how the market churns and the consumer benefits. Fretter Inc. and Highland Superstores Inc., two discount chains in Detroit, are rapidly expanding in Boston following the 1985 bankruptcy of Tech HiFi, a 70-store audio chain. Fretter and Highland, which sell electronics and home appliances, each opened four warehouse-like stores in the Boston area last year, and each plans to open six more stores. Like other large chains, the companies are members of competing buying groups, which buy billions of dollars' worth of goods from manufacturers at favorable prices and terms. The buying power of these groups makes it hard for unaffiliated competitors to undersell them. Still, some specialty stores thrive, said Debra Smith, a vice president of Tweeter Etc., a Cambridge, Mass., chain. Tweeter prides itself on offering innovative systems, a salon atmosphere and competitive prices on lines from Bang & Olafsen (expensive) to Sony (moderately priced.) Laws May Be Violated Regulators warn that if a deal seems too good to be true, it can mean trouble. ''We have a number of electronics stores that repeatedly violate consumer protection laws,'' said Miriam Garron, a spokeswoman for the New York City Consumer Affairs Department, which licenses retailers. The usual violations, she said, are ''bait and switch, failure to maintain stock on advertised items, failure to disclose that the goods had been used as demonstration models, charging consumers more than the advertised price, failure to disclose that the goods are not covered by a manufacturer's warranty, and splitting packaged goods and selling the products and accessories separately without telling the consumer.'' Gordon M. Snyder of Bennington, N.H., ordered a Cannon Fax Phone 10 that the Executive Photo and Supply Corporation in Manhattan advertised for $1,199, or $100 to $300 less than the price elsewhere. In a complaint to the Better Business Bureau, Mr. Snyder said that Executive Photo immediately billed his credit card last June, but did not deliver the product for seven months. He placed ''40 or more'' telephone calls, he said, and visited the store in November. Each time, Mr. Snyder said, the company made excuses and tried to sell him a higher-priced machine. In January, the Better Business Bureau intervened and Executive Photo sent the machine, as well as $100 in interest charges that had accrued on Mr. Snyder's credit bill. As the experts say, relax but watch out. N.V. Philipsd(Philips Consumer Electronics)Mitsubishi Electric Americad(Mitsubishi) SHOPPING FOR THE BEST DEAL * Prices usually increase with options.

1274-> OBSERVER; Gardens Of Sweet Ignorance
The good news is that giant snowdrops and brilliant yellow winter aconite are blooming in our garden. I found them Thursday morning, which was mild and cloudy, in that patch between the out-of-control climbing rose bush and the coffee bean tree. They came up in the same place last year, but not until March 3, according to my garden diary. Last year there was a single bee buzzing around them. This gave me such a start that the diary entry said, ''Where he come from?'' I know even less about bees than about gardening but had the impression that they went away somewhere in the winter, rather like those rich people who go away to tropical islands or luxurious Alpine resorts as soon as the November drizzles begin. Thursday morning when I discovered the blooming snowdrops and aconite, lo! there was a single bee again. This was an exciting find, and yet a worrisome one, too, for several reasons. First, there was the possibility that maybe I shouldn't have been excited by it. Maybe these cold-weather blooms always came with a single bee. Maybe botanists had discovered the phenomenon and named it (''the bee-snowdrop concatenation,'' perhaps) long before Aristotle's time. Maybe veteran garden-and-bee men were so familiar with it that they would laugh at me for finding it exciting. I also thought that recording my observation was not enough, that a person of scientific mind would do something about it. A day earlier I had marveled at the obituary of Richard P. Feynman, a theoretical physicist and apparently a scientific genius. Feynman, I realized, would not have been content with a diary entry (''Single bee back again this year in aconite and snowdrops''). He would have devised ways to answer the questions I was asking. For example: Could this be the same bee I saw in these same plants a year ago? Or is it a different bee, a bee that went away with all the other bees last November to wherever bees go, but was sent back when alerted that the aconite and snowdrops were about to bloom in my garden? Trying to think like Feynman, I saw that the scientific thing to do was to affix a small identifying tag to one of the bee's legs. Then, if a bee appeared again next year with the leg tag, I would know that this particular bee went with this particular patch of blooms. One problem here was that I didn't have a tag small enough to fit on a bee's leg or the equipment necessary to put it on if I was lucky enough to find one at the drugstore. Another was that I had never tried to catch a bee, much less tag one for scientific observation, and suspected that most bees would refuse to be caught, much less tagged, without a fight. Anyhow, suppose I got the bee tagged and set it free, then came back next year to find a bee in the aconite and snowdrops, but a bee with no tag on its leg. Given a year, any creature as busy a bee might find a way to get an annoying tag off its leg, so how could I know next year's untagged bee wasn't the same bee I tagged this year? These reflections, passing through my head much faster than it takes to explain them here, reminded me rather pleasantly that I was not only completely ignorant about where bees go in the winter, but also lacked the scientific imagination. Yes, pleasantly, because it is indeed pleasant after you have passed a certain age - 18, at least - to discover that there still remain a few things you don't know and a few others you will never be bright enough to understand. The pleasure is particularly acute for a newspaper columnist, whose trade after long practice leaves him with the depressing conviction that there is nothing he does not know and no problem afflicting humanity that could not be solved if the world would only heed the promptings of his fertile brain. What sweet relief it is for such a sad and sappy fellow to be brought low by bee mystery in muddy premature spring. He wanders to the garden, seeking fresh air to help his brain marshal his wisdom. Filled with the air, he will go indoors, address the impenetrable questions creating so much confusion among ordinary minds about the Presidential campaign, and make everything perfectly clear. His mind fixed on Dole and Bush, he glances down, sees snowdrops and yellow aconite and - can it be? - a bee. Which bee? He is hauled abruptly from knowing to notknowing, and the pleasure of rediscovering his human notknowingness is delightful. It is another reason the world needs more gardens, fewer developments.

1276-> ART; 'SELF AS SUBJECT' EXAMINED IN SEVERAL MEDIUMS IN KATONAH
IT has been more than a decade since the age of narcissism was identified as such by Christopher Lasch. Tom Wolfe's proto-Yuppies, the ''me generation,'' appeared at about the same time. What was formerly deplored is now accepted, even applauded. Still, this doesn't make ''Self as Subject,'' at the Katonah Gallery, any less provocative. Introducing the show, its organizer, Yvonne Pollack, states that the question, ''Who am I?'' has been ''pondered by artists ever since Narcissus saw his reflection in the water.'' Well, it turns out that Narcissus asked no such question: he was too infatuated with the reflection to notice that it was his own and, getting no response, he pined away. Some goddess had punished him for his cruel indifference to Echo and other nymphs who had loved him. As for self-portraiture, it may seem to imply the question today, but hasn't always done so. The 100 or so examples that Rembrandt produced may amount to an autobiography but, obviously, the painter was more interested in perfecting his understanding of light and texture than in probing his ego. Even for the introspective Van Gogh, the self-portrait was primarily a vehicle for ideas about painting. No doubt both men were aware of what might be called ''Narcissus' Law.'' Patient, understanding and always there, the self may be the ideal model, but its owner can never consciously grasp its essence. This does not deter Jonathan Borofsky, whose main subject is himself and whose stated aim is to make art that helps him understand his ''pains and happinesses.'' However, viewers who would understand along with the artist have a lot of work to do. It helps to have had prior experience of Mr. Borofsky's work - his spectacular installations featuring giant metal cutouts of figures, his repertory of alter egos, such as the ''Running Man,'' the ''Man With a Briefcase,'' the humanoid with rabbit ears, and so on. Even so, his contribution to this show is meager, consisting mainly of small cartoon-like self-portraits on the order of ''I Dreamed That I Had a Mustache That Was Cut Too High.'' The one sculpture is a urethane head with a book balanced on it, the whole riven by a jagged slab and garnished by a lightbulb. No wonder the artist is unhappy - read all about it in the canvas titled ''What Is Dragging Me?'' Cindy Sherman's photographs of herself acting out filmic fantasies are tours de force of narcissism. The best is the large color Polaroid in which she wears a low-cut dark suit and a tousled blond wig that obscures her face except for one baleful eye. She stands with fists clenched and, it would seem, Joan Crawford-style murder in her heart. In this picture and its companions, Ms. Sherman is trying, she said, ''to make other people recognize themselves rather than me.'' Eleanor Antin says she ''tends to think of herself as a collection of possible characteristic roles that wait in the wings for their chance to play.'' On stage in this selection of black-and-white photographs are Florence Nightingale, a Stuart-type ''king'' meditating in and around Solana Beach, Calif., and, under the heading ''Recollections of My Life With Diaghilev,'' Pocahontas and a symbolic ''Hebrew'' - all of them, of course, the artist in disguise. The 100 pairs of nomadic boots -played by themselves - that made Miss Antin's name in the 1960's were a tough act to follow. Nevertheless, these conceits dating from the late 70's and early 80's are full of the wit and charm that makes her unique among Conceptualists. Lucas Samaras is himself - or rather his selves - in four small color Polaroids that have been ''warped'' to make his face look like a gargoyle's and a pastel head of positively Byzantine intensity. They are accompanied by two of the artist's cryptic bronzes - both female figurines with wings. Jim Dine depicts himself straight in a chalk drawing and, with eyes sinisterly highlighted, in a handsome gray-black etching; symbolically in a color etching of a skull with three hearts and twin paintings of identical pink robes. Having noted the difference between the mirrored image and its original, Chuck Close pursues his own reflection in one gigantic color Polaroid and in two smaller black-and-white images composed of paper pulp and fingerprints respectively. Luis Cruz Azaceta's subject is essentially Armageddon painted in uproarious colors. The sculptor Robert Arneson is forever subverting art and the laws governing its appreciation. Here, the two artists use the self-portrait as a vehicle for their philosophies. In one painting, Mr. Azaceta is a truncated dummy with tools for arms that is parked on an office chair; in another, he's a mannequin riding his own giant profile, which contains, among other things, the New York skyline and a dismembered body with a knife in its belly. Mr. Arneson depicts himself in pink ceramic with his nose flattened as if by a window. But his magnum opus, cast in bronze with a gray patina, is of his flayed skin and scalp hung out to dry. A brilliant piece of modeling, it seems to say the hell with everything, including and especially the self-portrait. On view through March 6, the show can be visited from 1 to 5 P.M., Tuesdays through Fridays, from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. on Saturdays and from 1 to 5 P.M. on Sundays. On Feb. 17 at noon, Dr. George Dominiak will give a lecture entitled ''Why Me? Art, Self-Image and Psychiatry,'' for which paid reservations are required. Call 232-9555. The gallery is at 28 Bedford Road in Katonah.

1277-> Operators Got Millions in Bonuses Despite Hazards at Atom Plants
The Department of Energy has routinely awarded millions of dollars in performance bonuses over the last decade to contractors that run nuclear weapon factories racked by safety, health and environmental deficiencies, Government documents show. The bonuses have resulted from superior performance ratings given the contractors by field managers for the department. In a number of cases, the managers themselves have received annual bonuses of as much as $13,950 even though some of them took actions opposing important aspects of environmental, safety and health policies that Energy Secretary John S. Herrington instituted in September 1985. In an interview with The New York Times last week, Mr. Herrington, while acknowledging that the bonuses had tended to undercut his safety effort, said some such system was desirable as a way of creating incentives for superior management of the aging network of plants that turn out the nation's nuclear bombs. Production Comes First But as a practical matter, critics assert, the current system has provided real incentive only to meet production goals, frequently at the expense of safety. That system stems largely from the Energy Department's being more dependent on private contractors to run its operations than any other Federal agency. Under the contracts between the Government and corporations that manage many weapon production plants, the Energy Department pays the cost of operations plus an annual fee. The fee is made up of a guaranteed base payment and a bonus tied to the contractor's performance as determined by the Government field managers' evaluations. The contractors are evaluated twice annually, and among the factors on which they are graded are general management, cost management and quality assurance. Then there is the plant's performance on environment, safety and health, which until it was enhanced somewhat this year was a factor that accounted for 10 percent or less. Finally there is the plant's ability to meet production goals, which accounts for fully 40 to 50 percent of the evaluation. Thus, a contractor that scored low marks on environmental programs could nonetheless gain excellent evaluations and high bonuses if it did well in meeting production goals. A Case Study:The Fernald Plant Contractor evaluations written by field managers, and evaluations of field managers written at Energy Department headquarters in Washington, show numerous cases in which contractors received bonuses despite significant safety problems at the weapon production centers they operated: the Feed Materials Production Center near Fernald, Ohio; the Rocky Flats Plant near Boulder, Colo.; the Hanford Reservation in eastern Washington State; the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory near Idaho Falls, and the Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee. One striking case occurred at the Feed Materials Production Center, a uranium processing plant. In 1984, NLO Inc., which had managed the plant since its opening in 1953, was paid $2,616,085 in management fees. Of that amount, a bonus accounted for $1,306,955, more than three-quarters of the maximum bonus NLO could have received that year. Joe La Grone, the manager of the Energy Department's field office at Oak Ridge, whose area of jurisdiction included the Fernald plant, judged its efforts in delivering uranium ingots on time, in improving productivity generally and in keeping costs down as the most ''significant accomplishments'' there. Mr. La Grone also noted that the number of workers being exposed to radiation was increasing and that a more aggressive program was needed to ''satisfactorily meet the demands of expanding environmental laws and regulations.'' The health and safety concerns, however, did not dissuade Mr. La Grone from giving NLO an outstanding evaluation. ''I commend you for the overall excellent performance of NLO Inc.,'' he wrote in November 1984. An Earlier Inquiry Found Dangers Mr. La Grone's evaluation masked the Fernald plant's hazards and differed substantially from the conclusions of a report prepared five months earlier by investigators whom he had appointed to study problems there. That report painted a detailed picture of a plant that had lost its way, so poorly managed that workers were routinely exposed to hazardous levels of radiation and thousands of pounds of radioactive uranium were being released into the air and the water around the complex. ''The first priority at the Feed Materials Production Center has been production,'' the investigators said. ''Less consideration has been given to other areas of importance, such as the safety and health of employees, environmental protection, public relations, etc. This attitude of production first permeates the organization, and a need exists to promote a more balanced view of the importance of all the requirements facing the facility.'' Among other things, the report's authors suggested tightening the evaluation system. ''The task force,'' they wrote, ''believes that the NLO award fee contract is not being used as effectively as it could be in forcing the contractor's efforts toward new objectives and required improvements. ''The ratings given under the award fee contract have conveyed to NLO the impression that performance has been almost superior and that the operation is being conducted almost exactly as D.O.E. desires (i.e., there is even very little room for improvement). This is not the case, and the full incentive potential of award fee contracting is not being realized with respect to the NLO contract.'' A Year Later, Changed Assessment In 1985, several months after a large leak of uranium at Fernald had been discovered and made public, Mr. La Grone changed his evaluation of the plant. He declined to award a bonus to NLO that year, and the company later decided not to manage the plant any longer. In a recent interview, Mr. La Grone said he had read the report by his investigators but had failed in his own evaluation to respond to their findings. ''Quite frankly,'' he said, ''I did not evaluate the award fee as hard as I should have. I should have dug deeper into things. And since then, I have. It was a matter of being overloaded. I had a hell of a lot to do around here. I wish I had been smart enough to zero in on the award fee business in 1984. That's a bad one. I admit it.'' The Fernald plant, which has been closed almost three weeks by a strike over wages and working conditions, is now managed by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation. From last October to March, Westinghouse received $1 million in bonuses for operating the plant, a sum that a company spokesman, Jack M. Martin, said was less than expected. ''We received a satisfactory rating,'' said Mr. Martin. ''We thought we merited a grade of excellence.'' 'Excellent' Management At Rocky Flats A more recent example involved the Rocky Flats Plant, near Boulder, where weapon components are made from plutonium. On May 15, 1987, Raymond G. Romatowski, who was then the manager of the Energy Department's regional office in Albuquerque, N.M., completed an evaluation that commended the Rockwell International Corporation for its ''excellent'' management of the plant. Mr. Romatowski praised ''the high degree of dedication, commitment and competency demonstrated by all levels of all organizations'' at Rocky Flats. Mr. Romatowski did find several ''notable deficiencies,'' including significant problems in controlling radioactive contamination throughout the plant. He also found that some company reports on environmental safety and health were ''erroneous and incomplete.'' Yet he rated Rockwell's industrial safety and health programs as ''very good'' and said programs to manage radioactive and toxic wastes were ''excellent.'' Mr. Romatowski awarded Rockwell $8.6 million in performance bonuses. That sum, part of more than $40 million in bonuses that Rockwell has received since 1980 for managing the plant, was based on a grade of 85 that he gave the Rocky Flats operation, of a maximum of 100. Shutdown Was Ordered 17 Months Later Earlier this month, a year and a half after that evaluation, the Energy Department shut down the principal plutonium processing building at Rocky Flats: three people had been contaminated in a room where radioactive equipment was being cleaned, and officials in Washington said the incident was emblematic of a series of accidents at the plant. The contamination incident followed three separate inspections of the plant since 1986 by investigators from Energy Department headquarters, who had severely criticized Rocky Flats's managers and safety programs. Mr. Romatowski, who left the Energy Department last March, declined comment when reached at his home in Albuquerque. ''I'd appreciate if you didn't intrude on our privacy,'' he said. He is now a vice president in the Albuquerque office of BDM International, a Virginia-based subsidiary of the Ford Motor Company that sells technical services to the Government and other clients. Six months after his 1987 evaluation of Rockwell, Mr. Romatowski launched a campaign that appears to have contradicted Secretary Herrington's new emphasis on environmental efforts. In a memorandum written in November 1987, Mr. Romatowski urged Energy Department officials to defy enforcement agents of the Environmental Protection Agency who sought to clean up toxic pollution at the Rocky Flats Plant and other nuclear weapon sites across the country. In the memorandum, Mr. Romatowski said the Energy Department must ''go to the mat'' with the E.P.A. to restrict enforcement of environmental laws, if necessary appealing to the Federal courts. Mr. Romatowski argued in the memorandum that such a tactic ''sends a message which may result in a more reasonable attitude by E.P.A. in future dealings with the Department of Energy.'' Praise for a Manager: 'We Have No Better' Mr. Romatowski was one of a number of field managers given bonuses and roundly praised last year in evaluations prepared by Joseph F. Salgado, the Deputy Secretary of Energy. Mr. Romatowski received a rating of ''exceptional'' and, this January, was also given the Secretary's Award, the department's highest honor. Mr. Romatowski, wrote Mr. Salgado, was ''first among equals'' as a manager. ''We have no better,'' the Deputy Secretary added in the evaluation, which led to a bonus of $13,950, along with Mr. Romatowski's $77,500 salary. In subsequent interviews, both Mr. Salgado and Mr. Herrington defended Mr. Romatowski's bonuses and evaluations. ''Ray Romatowski's job was one of the toughest in the system,'' said Mr. Herrington. ''He did it with style. He was under enormous pressure from us, and he did his job well. I justify everything Ray Romatowski did. He spent a lot of time in the Federal Government, and he didn't get rich.'' When it was pointed out that Mr. Romatowski had apparently actively opposed some of the Secretary's policies, Mr. Salgado replied: ''I don't think he's perfect, but I'll tell you this - he's an outstanding manager. He met every production peg mark he had to make.'' 'They've Been Rewarded For Not Telling Truth' The favorable evaluations of contractors and field managers, and the resulting bonuses, have angered members of Congress who have studied the system. ''Our investigations have shown that D.O.E. rewarded field managers for not telling the truth and keeping the lid on bad news,'' said Representative Mike Synar, the Oklahoma Democrat who heads the House Government Operations Subcommittee on Environment, Energy and Natural Resources. ''They were rewarded for making up great reports when obviously conditions at these plants were miserable. They've been rewarded for not telling the truth. And it's a dangerous practice, because what we now see at the Energy Department can be summarized in one sentence: the top guys at the Department of Energy have no idea what is going on within their agency.'' In his interview with The Times last week, Mr. Herrington said that he was troubled by the bonus system but that the concept itself was justified. Without bonuses, he said, it would be difficult to recruit companies to manage the aging plants. And of the bonuses that go to field managers, he said: ''We need good people. I have to use a carrot-and-stick approach to run a department this big. I don't object to big bonuses to key executives. Some I am upset about, because I don't think they were deserved. Some were deserved. But if a guy is doing a good job, I think he's underpaid anyway. Government salaries are too low.'' But Mr. Herrington acknowledged that the bonuses helped explain why he had encountered difficulty persuading department employees and contractors to accept his three-year-old program to upgrade weapon plants, making them safer and less polluting. Contractors that received glowing evaluations and ample bonuses often came to believe that they were performing up to expectations, Energy Department officials now say, and the same was true for regional managers who were being praised and rewarded by the agency's headquarters. Asked in the interview whether the message from Washington about improving safety had been undercut by the bonus system, Mr. Herrington replied: ''I think you make a good point. The message needs to be corrected.''

1279-> A 'Puppet' Turns Patriot in Panama
President Eric Delvalle acted in Panama's best interests Thursday when he tried to dismiss Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega as head of the military. But Noriega loyalists won't go along, and Panama moves closer to a showdown. Washington's best stance for now is to continue backing the democrats while staying out of the field of fire. The pro-Noriega majority in Panama's Assembly retaliated by dismissing Mr. Delvalle in a hasty dawn session yesterday. Not surprisingly, the Defense Forces also stood with their beleaguered but still powerful chief. Mr. Delvalle owes his political career to the general. Two and a half years ago, he was placed in office after the previous President showed unexpected independence. With that background, his present bravery and patriotism do him honor. Events in Panama seem headed toward further cris s and perhaps sosolution. Key plplomats have suppteted Pridident Delvlele's action. A popular opposinon movenent unites studes,s, business leaders and church officials. National insolvency looms. General Noriega remains under U.S. indictment for drug trafficking. In a region where almost every other regime has moved to expand democratic rights, General Noriega has taken Panama deeper into dictatorship. What, then, can friends of democracy do to help Panama rid itself of this unloved dictator before he further damages its economic and political institutions? Some Latin governments now express solidarity with Mr. Delvalle. They could also heed his pleas for a trade embargo and withhold recognition from the new puppet President. Washington has a treaty commitment to yield administration of the Panama Canal to Panama by 1999. It also has a Southern Command there with 10,000 troops. The U.S. has legitimate interests, but best serves them by respecting Panamanians' right to resolve their own political problems. President Delvalle now has sought to initiate such a resolution. He, and others who may follow his lead, deserve full support from Washington and every other democratic nation in the hemisphere.

1285-> WASHINGTON TALK: ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY; E.P.A. Critic Enters the Lion's Den And Is Showered by Wild Applause
It was as if the Christians led into the Colosseum for slaughter had suddenly turned on the Roman mob, or like Daniel's attacking the lions in the den. Barry Commoner, the environmental scientist, spoke by invitation to an S.R.O. crowd of Environmental Protection Agency employees earlier this week and treated them to a fairly savage critique of their efforts to protect the nation's health from pollution. Dr. Commoner, who rarely has a good word to say for the E.P.A., or for Government regulators in general, had none at all in his speech. He told his stony-faced audience that the agency practiced bad science and bad policy and was failing to protect the environment. Waiting for the Thunderbolt He even dared use, in proposing a solution for the nation's pollution problems, what he called ''the S-word: socialism.'' Then he paused to look heavenward, waiting, he said, ''for the thunderbolt to strike me.'' Instead, at the end of his speech, he received thunderous applause from the audience he had so unsparingly criticized. Dr. Commoner is the director for the Center for the Biology of Natural Systems at Queens College of the City University of New York. He is also a widely read author on ecological issues, and a self-described radical who, in 1980 ran for President as the candidate of the Citizens Party. Stance on Dioxin Assailed He is a relentless critic of the environmental agency's policies and procedures, most recently assailing a decision to lower its estimate of the risks of dioxin, the highly toxic chemical byproduct. His speech was part of a continuing series of seminars held by the agency's office of toxic substances and its air and radiation program. But staff members who attended this one said they had not previously been subjected to the kind of verbal assault administered by Dr. Commoner on Tuesday. Dr. Commoner said the basic problem with the E.P.A.'s approach to pollution was that it was trying to clean up the environment piecemeal after it had already been severely degraded. Such a task, he said was, virtually impossible. This, he added, was as much the fault of the environmental laws as of the way they are administered by the environmental agency. An 'Acceptable Level of Harm' The answer, he said, was to stop pollution before it is produced by ending ''the taboo against social intervention in the production system.'' The environment will not be protected, he insisted, by the current practice of finding an ''acceptable level of harm'' from an environmental pollutant and then issuing rules allowing industry to pollute to that level. Instead, he said, the rational way to protect the environment and public health is to prevent pollution from entering the environment in the first place. He asserted that it was technologically and economically feasible to build cars and power plants, to produce food and to use chemicals in ways that would not harm the environment. Remedying the nation's ''environmental failure,'' he said, would ''require the courage to challenge the taboo against even questioning the present dominance of private interest over the public interest.'' Reaction of Audience Several members of the audience expressed some skepticism about Mr. Commoner's views. One suggested his approach to the environment would place limits on economic growth. Dr. Commoner vigorously denied holding such a view. Hugh Kaufman, a civil servant in the agency's toxic waste program who is a frequent critic of the agency's policies, said the reason Dr. Commoner was applauded by the E.P.A. staff after he attacked them was that ''they agreed with 80 to 90 percent of what he said.'' Dr. Commoner began his talk by noting that after World War 11, new industrial technology and acclerated economic activity began creating new, widespread forms of pollution such as smog, acid rain, excessive nitrate and phosphates in water supplies from agricultural fertilizers, pesticides and toxic chemicals in the food chain and accumulations of radioactive waste. Undoing the Damage ''Then, in 1970, pressed by a newly aroused public, Congress began a massive effort to undo the damage. Now, nearly 20 years later, the time has come to ask an important and perhaps embarrassing question: How far have we progressed toward the goal of restoring the quality of the environment. ''The answer is, in fact, embarrassing. Apart from a few notable exceptions, environmental quality has improved only slightly and in some cases has become worse.'' While the quantity of some pollutants in the environment, such as lead, DDT and polychlorinated biphenyls or PCB's, has gone down sharply, he noted, air and water quality has in most cases improved only slightly and other toxic substances continue to be poured into the environment. In the end, Dr. Commoner said, ''it will require good science and wise policies'' to clean up the environment. ''But, I suggest that we know how to begin,'' he said, ''by an open public discussion of what has gone wrong and why.''

1286-> Army to Reduce Officer Corps
The Army, in a budget move, has announced plans for cutting the number of officers including appointment of a board to select more than 350 lieutenant colonels and colonels for early retirement. The Army said Thursday that it was also beginning a voluntary release program for all officers who wanted to leave the military, regardless of rank, and would strictly enforce guidelines specifying the discharge of any first lieutenant who twice failed to win promotion to captain. The Army disclosed last week in its budget for the fiscal year 1989 that it was cutting active-duty strength by 8,600 people, including 1,540 officers. The cuts, which would bring the Army's total strength down to about 772,000, were prompted by a deficit-reducing agreement reached with Congress last November. Earlier this month the Army said it would trim its enlisted ranks through a combination of early discharges for soldiers already preparing to leave the service and reductions in recruiting goals. The Army said Thursday that it had now begun to focus on its officers and hoped the combination of the three programs would allow it to reduce those ranks without causing undue personal hardship.

1287-> Concert: Tokyo Quartet Presents More Beethoven
Not least among the 92d Street Y's recent complete traversals of this and that is its current Beethoven quartet cycle with the Tokyo String Quartet, the second concert of which took place Wednesday night. The Beethoven quartets themselves remain as all-encompassing a sweep of music as anyone has yet composed. The Tokyo Quartet, founded in 1969, is presenting the cycle for the first time in New York, and it's worth the wait. Although this ensemble has been among the world's premiere quartets from the outset, it seems to have blossomed in this decade. That may be partly a question of maturation. But it also has to do with the arrival in 1981 of the Canadian Peter Oundjian as first violinist. The Tokyo Quartet was always astonishing, technically. But Mr. Oundjian brought to them a veiled, poetic tone that infused their ''perfection'' with personality. He matches the other three in polish, but he makes the crucial first-violin line sing with feeling, and he seems to elicit a similar artistry from his fellows. With Beethoven, the most admired performances have generally relied not so much on a polished surface -that might almost seem inimical to the ideal effect - but on impassioned rhetoric and profound emotionality. What was so impressive about Wednesday's concert was the way the Tokyo Quartet handled every aspect of Beethoven's artistic evolution so surely, yet remained true to its own artistic profile as well. Programs in Beethoven string-quartet cycles generally move from early to late. Wednesday's followed that pattern, opening with the Quartet in F (Op. 18, No. 1). Here the Tokyo players were most obviously in their element, crisp and buoyant. Yet Mr. Oundjian's statement of his opening line in the Adagio was as ''affetuoso ed appassionato'' as Beethoven could have wished. Wednesday's middle-period offering was the Quartet in F minor (Op. 95, ''Serioso''). Here Classical poise was retained, yet there were some brilliant, slashing attacks, too, almost more effective for the precision of their articulation. But the real test came in the concluding Quartet in B flat (Op. 130), with the original finale, the ''Grosse Fuge'' (Op. 133); the revised finale will be given later as an encore. This is as deep and monumental as Beethoven gets. The whole quartet was beautifully done, within its contained frame of reference. But the ''Grosse Fuge'' took on a terrifying power, with jabbing accents and stinging trills. It was played more accurately than this writer has ever heard it, yet coherence underscored Beethoven's inspiration rather than clinically exposing it. Aside from Mr. Oundjian, the quartet members are Kikuei Ikeda, second violinist; Kazuhide Isomura, violist, and Sadao Harada, cellist. The remaining concerts in this series will be March 30, April 27 and May 11.

1288-> Aids in Justice System: Searching for Fairness
It was more than a question that Marvin Schecter posed. It was a scenario that he painted. In doing so, Mr. Schecter, a member of the board of the New York State Defenders Association, evoked the harsh realities and legal quandaries that bear on a defendant who is even suspected of carrying the AIDS virus. Mr. Schecter, whose organization represents public defenders, asked the question in the closing moments of a recent New York State Bar Association panel on AIDS and criminal justice. ''As jury selection begins,'' Mr. Schecter said, ''extra court officers appear, some wearing gloves and some with surgical masks. Defense counsel objects. The court requests that the gear be removed. The officers refuse. ''The judge orders a hearing. Defense counsel objects on the ground that the defendant's medical condition, if any, cannot interfere with courtroom conditions affecting the right to a fair trial. ''Defense counsel also informs the court that defendant's medical condition is covered by the medical confidentiality privilege and the attorney-client privilege, and any public testimony on his condition will result in objection. ''Defense counsel then files contempt motions against the court officers and the Commissioner of Corrections. The question is, 'Judge, what do you do?' '' 'We Will Be Overwhelmed' No full answer to the question was offered by the panel, just as no full answer has emerged on how the justice system will deal with the seemingly inexorable problems, and the paradox, posed by an increasing number of patients with the AIDS virus in prison. As a panel member, Nancy Dubler, director of the law and ethics division at Montefiore Hospital, said: ''Whether we are overwhelmed now, we will be overwhelmed in the future. And dealing with AIDS in prison is like combining alien systems. An aura of caring cannot exist in prison.'' Addressing Mr. Schecter's question, the sole judge on the panel, Acting Justice Richard C. Failla of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, said: ''I can't answer for every judge. But the hypothetical, to its full extent, raises most of the issues surrounding AIDS and the administration of justice - fairness, due process, confidentiality, stigmatization of a defendant, prejudicing a jury.'' '4 Modes of Transmission' At the same time, Justice Failla said, the question ''raises issues that arise only in people's ignorance of the true scientific facts, people who are giving in to irrational fears.'' The scientific fact, according to Charles Fallis, a spokesman for the National Centers for Disease Control who specializes in AIDS-related issues, is that there are ''four modes of transmission of the AIDS virus: sexual contact, where there is an exchange of blood or body fluids; sharing needles during intravenous drug abuse; less commonly through receiving blood transfusions - but with screening, that is very rare now - and by perinatal transmission, from infected mother to child at birth.'' ''There has never been a documented case of transmission by casual contact,'' Mr. Fallis said. Rooted in Irrational Fears Irrational fears, according to the director of the prisoners' rights program of the Legal Aid Society, Theodore Katz, are at the root of injustices suffered by defendants suspected of carrying the AIDS virus. In a presentation, Mr. Katz said: ''Some corrections officers falsely report that prisoners are too ill to come to court or that they refused to come. ''AIDS prisoners are brought to court on special vans and are sometimes left on the buses all day, without food or sanitary facilities, without ever being escorted into court. ''Most prisoners with AIDS are required to wear special disposable plastic handcuffs that publicly identify them as people with AIDS. Court officers escorting these defendants wear plastic gloves and have been known to wear masks and coveralls.'' 'Abuse by Hostile Prisoners' ''These scientifically unfounded, highly stigmatizing measures,'' Mr. Katz added, ''violate defendants' privacy, result in abuse by hostile prisoners and personnel, and may actually result in prejudice in court proceedings.'' Even though all those problems can occur even before a defendant has been convicted, the stigmatization compounds the already difficult problem a prisoner with the AIDS virus faces in receiving adequate care. Last September, the State Commission of Correction, which monitors the prison system, issued a report stating, among other findings, that inmates diagnosed with the AIDS virus survived about one-third as long as AIDS patients in the general population. The report said that in the general population the mean survival period was 367 days and that in prison it was 128 days. Stigmatization, according to the Commissioner of Correctional Services, Thomas A. Coughlin 3d, contributes significantly to the disparity. 'Nothing to Do With the Facts' ''The inmates know about AIDS symptoms,'' Mr. Coughlin said. ''So, if you're an inmate and all of a sudden you start to get these splotches on your skin and you have fevers and a cold, you lay in your cell. You don't go to sick call because you don't want anybody to think you've got AIDS. ''The population will shun you. No one wants to talk to you. You become a pariah. All of this has absolutely nothing to do with the facts of AIDS, nothing.'' Ms. Dubler pointed out that in prison ''the usual ethical analyses about a patient's right to choose appropriate care don't apply.'' Once an inmate's condition is written down, she said, ''it becomes informational currency in the prison marketplace.'' More Than Half of All Deaths Mr. Coughlin pointed out that the state ''has the unfortunate distinction of housing more than half of all AIDS-related cases in incarcerated settings in this country.'' There have been 597 confirmed AIDS patients in the system, he added. Of those, 346 have died, 152 have been released and 99 are in custody. More than half of all the deaths in the system between 1984 and 1986, according to the Correction Commission study, were because of AIDS. Of those inmates who died, 45 percent were Hispanic, 43 percent black and 95 percent had been intravenous drug users. The statistics spurred Manhattan Borough President David N. Dinkins to stress that ''the connections between AIDS and poverty, drug abuse, limited access to health care and discrimination cannot be ignored.'' Mr. Dinkins said, ''If only we could find a way to expand drug treatment with the same resources and urgency we devote to finding upstate locations and empty piers at which to moor new jails, we might make real progress preventing drug-related crime and AIDS.'' Mr. Coughlin concurred with Ms. Dubler's contention that prison was not the place to treat AIDS patients. ''We're just not programmatically and psychologically prepared to run a hospital,'' he said.

1289-> Governors in Northeast Share Ideas on Waste
Recycling programs could make the Northeast a major producer of natural resources, but finding markets for the trash could be a major headache, according to officials at a governors' conference here. ''We figure that if 15 percent of the solid waste in the Northeast was recycled, it would amount to 10 million tons a year,'' Robert L. Bendick Jr., director of the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management, told the Coalition of Northeastern Governors Thursday. ''The whole system of recycling would collapse unless there's a market for the material,'' he said. Regional Cooperation Urged The six governors who heard Mr. Bendick's report agreed that regional cooperation was the only way to address that problem. ''If we had a way of sharing our information and having a broker, so to speak, who could direct recyclables to markets on any given day, that would be a tremendous help,'' said Gov. Madeleine M. Kunin of Vermont. The governors who attended the forum also traded anecdotes about their troubles in finding sites for landfills and incinerators and agreed to share ideas and information on that subject. But they said a regional approach to trash disposal was unlikely to deal with the issue of allowing one state's trash to be disposed of in another state. ''We're having so many problems simply solving our own problems in our own states,'' said Governor Kean of New Jersey. ''For a state to actually say, 'we're building our facility to handle garbage from other states,' would be politically very, very difficult.'' Where to Put It? New Jersey once tried to ban anyone from bringing in trash from other states, but a Federal court overturned the ban. Rhode Island has banned out-of-state trash from the state-run Central Landfill in Johnston, which handles most of the state's trash and is New England's largest dump. Mr. Kean and Gov. Edward D. DiPrete of Rhode Island said finding sites for trash disposal was the most difficult aspect of dealing with the region's trash crisis. ''We have been talking about resource recovery facilities for 10 years,'' Mr. DiPrete said. ''We have yet to break ground on one.'' Mr. Kean agreed: ''It has not been an easy process. We had one of our county leaders attacked and pushed to the ground at one of these meetings.'' New Jersey has found a solution to the problem by paying communities that agree to accept trash facilities $5 per ton of garbage disposed there, Mr. Kean said. Gov. Robert P. Casey said the state of Pennsylvannia had adopted a similar plan. ''Some of these towns can have up to half the town budget'' covered by the fees, Mr. Kean said. ''We've actually had a couple of communities competing for these facilities.'' But Mr. DiPrete said he did not think that such an approach would work, for example, in North Kingstown, where residents have been fighting a proposed incinerator for years. ''They're saying, 'we don't want it here under any conditions,' '' Mr. DiPrete said. The coalition includes the governors of the six New England states, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts and Governor Cuomo of New York did not attend Thursday's meeting and Gov. John H. Sununu of New Hampshire left early.

1292-> Washington Talk: Briefing; That Presidential Bug
Representative Thomas S. Foley, the House majority leader, insists he is not likely to come down with a case of Presidential fever, even if Democrats try to recruit him for the Presidency. Meeting with reporters over breakfast yesterday, he dismissed the idea that Democrats, should they prove unable to mobilize support for one candidate this summer, would turn to him in a brokered convention. ''I am not consumed with ambition to be President of the U.S., and unless you are you should not be in the race,'' the Washington Democrat said. ''I think I have a fairly strong immunity to that Potomac virus. I'm just not ambitious enough to be President.'' Mr. Foley is widely thought to be a comer in party politics and one who will play a key role in Democratic policy making.

1293-> Museums Add Touch of Fun To Learning
ON a recent Saturday, dozens of children crowded inside a barn at the Stamford Museum and Nature Center to watch five day-old lambs nestle by their mother's side. About 40 miles away, children at the Connecticut Children's Museum in New Haven pretended to take a long sea voyage on a cabin cruiser. Others donned costumes to be television stars, and still others practiced with a real dentist's drill. The two museums are among a dozen in Connecticut that offer children playful learning experiences through hands-on exhibits and visual displays. Many of the museums are now expanding and opening new wings. ''There are lots of things I could touch around here, not just look at,'' Julia Clarke, a 3 1/2-year-old visitor from Philadelphia said as she toured the Connecticut Children's Museum. Stacy Shalvoy, 7 years old, of Cheshire, busily worked on an old-fashioned switchboard at the museum. ''This isn't fun,'' she said with a serious face as she disconnected half a dozen plugs. ''It's my job.'' Play, said June Levy, the director of the museum, ''is kid's work.'' ''That's how they learn about societal rules and expectations,'' she said. ''And children's museums provide an excellent place for them to learn and play.'' The oldest of these museums, the Barnum Museum in Bridgeport, will become one of the state's newest attractions when it reopens next year. Now undergoing a $7 million renovation, the museum was begun in 1893. Through hundreds of artifacts, it traces the life of P. T. Barnum of the Barnum & Bailey Circus, who was once the Mayor of Bridgeport and is often praised as its most famous resident. The collection includes Tom Thumb's carriage, stove and other belongings. The museum also chronicles the history of Bridgeport. The Museum of Art, Science and Industry, also in Bridgeport, is redesigning its second floor and adding new physical science exhibits. Galleries at the museum include sound, light and perception experiments that are conducted with simple machines and mechanical tools. Favorite exhibits among the young set include a frozen shadow trick, which uses a light-sensitive wall to freeze a shadow for a few seconds, and an authentic helicopter with an open cockpit that children can climb into. The Stamford Museum and Nature Center is planning a human body center to add to its rotating exhibits on art, geology, dinosaurs, Indian artifacts and toy trains, and its 18th-century barns with old sheep, goats and cows. In the new center, children will be able to compare their vision with an owl's, as well note as other differences between people and animals. Like many other museums, Stamford holds weekend and summer classes for children in art, nature and dance. It has 200 acres of nature trails. On April 1, the Science Museum of Connecticut in West Hartford will open a science wing, Kidsplace, which will offer a hodgepodge of things to touch, stack and manipulate. It will include stethoscopes, dinosaur fossils and puzzles, huge foam-cushioned blocks and varied science experiments. The museum has 18 learning games for children that deal with scientific principles, a planetarium, a live animal center, an aquarium and a fish tank from which children zealously try to catch swimming skate fish, starfish and crabs, but are cautioned to touch gently and not squeeze. The Connecticut Fire Museum in Manchester is housed in an old fire station. Its growing collection includes fire alarm equipment that children can operate, a 1922 restored fire engine, a steam-operated hose pump, helmets, leather fire hoses, buckets, paintings, lithographs and such antique fire-fighting equipment as hand-pulled hose reels. This summer, the museum will open a new exhibit area with a hand-drawn ladder truck and 19th-century fire extinguishers. Three museums have attractions for children only: the Connecticut Children's Museum, the Lutz Children's Museum in Manchester and the New Britain Youth Museum. What began in a school bus in 1974 developed into the Connecticut Children's Museum with a village of a dozen learning centers with real objects. Children play doctor and patient in a hospital room replete with hospital bed, incubator, scale and wheelchair. Others sail on a boat, take a trip on a ferry, play post office, dress up in costumes and watch themselves on a closed-circuit television, and play house with plastic food ''cooked'' in an old gas stove in metal pots and pans. Next year the museum, in a converted bicycle factory, will move a block away to a former state juvenile detention center. Ms. Levy, the director, said that she plans to start a resident children's theater with college and child actors and that she will add an art gallery of paintings and sculptures created by children. Like the Connecticut Children's Museum, the Lutz museum holds weekend arts and crafts workshops and brings in school classes for tours and special programs. In addition to changing exhibits on art, history, nature and ethnology, the Lutz Museum has a live animal room, which is part of its rehabilitation program for small animals. The Lutz Museum Oak Grove Nature Center has trails through 53 wooded acres with ponds and streams. Beginning this summer, the third museum devoted exclusively to children, the New Britain Youth Museum, will offer young visitors a look at the history of printing through an exhibit of printing presses, new and old. Visitors will be able to work the presses and observe staff demonstrations. ''Classrooms are most times fairly contained,'' said Alan Krauss, the director of the museum. ''Basically what children's museums offer is a chance for children to explore at their own pace and level in innovative and real-life ways.'' The youth museum focuses on children's toys, trains and clothing. One room is filled with construction toys; another holds dolls up to 100 years old, dollhouses and a puppet theater. Outside the children can climb on a circus wagon and playground equipment. Several Connecticut museums are devoted to travel by air, sea or land. The New England Air Museum in Windsor Locks contains 75 aircraft, among them fighters, bombers and helicopters. They are displayed in hangars or outdoors. On selected weekends, the cockpits are opened and, under staff supervision, children are allowed to climb in and pretend to soar the skies. In addition, the museum shows aviation films and flight demonstrations. This year the Shoreline Trolley Museum in East Haven is celebrating the 100th birthday of the trolley car with special exhibits on the evolution of the trolley through photographs, paintings and old trolley parts in its indoor exhibit area. The museum, which has 103 trolley cars mostly stored in barns, also owns the world's oldest rapid transit car, an 1884 model from New York City. Every half-hour, a three-mile trolley ride with a guided tour of the barns is conducted. During the celebration, the first freight locomotive built in the United States will be on display on the museum's trolley tracks; the locomotive ran betweeen Derby and Ansonia, said the executive director of the museum, Gareth Thorne. Construction should begin soon on the Connecticut Trolley Museum's first indoor museum. The East Windsor Museum now runs trolley rides and tours of trolleys in its barns. Its new addition, which is scheduled to open next spring, will include an auditorium for slide shows and lectures and trolley artifacts like conductors' emblems, uniforms and badges, and model cars. At the Mystic Seaport Museum, among the star attractions for children are four authentic sailing vessels, including a 150-year-old whaling ship. Children are encouraged to climb aboard to examine the ropes and oars that sailors once used and the eating and sleeping quarters down below. The Seaport Museum is actually a recreated maritime village on 15 acres along the Mystic River. Its 60 historic buildings include a church, meeting house, general store, blacksmith shop, weaving shop and a children's museum where youngsters can play with period costumes, toys and games. Connecticut's only hall of dinosaurs belongs to the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale. A full-scale fossil of brontosaurus is the star attraction of this exhibit. This fall, three life-size replicas of a very small dinosaur named deinonychus, which means terrible claws, will join the others in the Great Hall of Dinosaurs. Under construction now is a permanent exhibit, ''Hall of Human Origin,'' that will trace the evolution of man. The first section on primates opened last year. Last year the Peabody opened a discovery room to attract children too young to appreciate its many exhibits of artifacts from Indian, Egyptian and Mexican cultures dating back to 1500 B.C. The hands-on discovery room includes fossils, mounted birds, animal skeletons and microscopes. Besides museums, several other sites offer learning activities for children. They include Dinosaur State Park in Rocky Hill, where children can make plaster casts, and the Thames Science Center in New London, which this month is offering an exhibit on simple machines in which children learn how to work screws, pulleys and levers as well as sessions on building boats and riverbank models.

1294-> POP VIEW; Riches Abound in 'The Woods'
While immersed last week in the magnificent original cast recording of Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine's fairy-tale musical, ''Into the Woods'' (RCA Victor 6796-2RC; all three formats), I was reminded of how crucial a cast album can be to the future reputation of a show. If the score is first rate and the performances finely tuned, no matter what a show's short-term commercial fate, its cast album will keep the music circulating and win for it future champions who may never have seen it produced. Decades before the era of the $5 million Broadway spectacle, a show's cast album was viewed as little more than the musical equivalent of its souvenir program. One bought the record, which was often a tinny-sounding affair, to learn the tunes, savor favorite performances, and possess a nostalgic touchstone by which to remember a pleasant evening in the theater. Nowadays, a splashy show doesn't necessarily yield an original cast album. Last season, neither the short-lived ''Rags,'' which boasted a majestic score by Charles Strouse and Stephen Schwartz, nor ''Smile,'' Marvin Hamlisch and Howard Ashman's unsuccessful musical satire of beauty pageants, yielded an album that would keep these scores current. Instead of making an American cast record of ''Starlight Express,'' MCA Records put out an album of songs from the show re-recorded by pop-rock singers and aimed at top-40 radio. On the other hand, ''The Gospel at Colonus,'' which opens on Broadway this week, will have had two original cast recordings. The first, released by Warner Brothers and now out of print, was a 1984 studio recording made after the show's run at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Its replacement, scheduled for imminent release by Nonesuch, is a ''hotter''-sounding live recording made in Philadelphia in 1985. It used to be that almost every show worth even half its salt would quickly be committed to vinyl. Over the years, the greatest cast albums -of ''South Pacific,'' ''My Fair Lady'' and ''West Side Story,'' to name three - have loomed as much more than fond mementos. While retaining a remarkable dramatic cohesiveness and emotional immediacy, they also distilled the mood of their eras with an unmatchable intensity and exactness. The recent spate of re-recordings of classic Broadway scores may have helped reaffirm the lasting value of American theater music, but with the stunning exception of RCA's ''Follies in Concert,'' these records have also tended to be dramatically flaccid, vocally stiff exercises in ''crossover'' musical casting. In the years since Sondheim began almost singlehandedly to expand the concerns of the American musical into new intellectual and esthetic territory, the cast albums of his shows have assumed a special significance. While the 1981 Sondheim-George Furth show, ''Merrily We Roll Along,'' failed spectacularly on Broadway, the score has yielded three cabaret standards - ''Not a Day Goes By,'' ''Good Thing Going'' and ''Old Friends'' - and the cast album is considered to be a classic. I am one of many who believe strongly that the show warrants a full-scale Broadway revival. Sondheim's scores are so fertile with ideas and his musical structures so intricate that the more you listen to their cast albums the more there is to discover. This is especially true of ''Into the Woods,'' a show whose fast-moving multiple plots, all hinging on the bartering of some magic beans stolen from a witch's garden, can leave one confused. Because the show has so many characters spewing aphorisms, riddles, puns and pieces of the puzzle, a good concentrated listen to the album before seeing the show should help to clarify it without spoiling the fun. On the surface, the score's cleverness can be almost daunting. When the witch, played by Bernadette Peters, remembers the theft of her beans, the language becomes Gilbertesque, as she describes a villain ''rooting through my rutabaga/ Raiding my arugula and/ Ripping up the rampion.'' Below the surface, however, one discovers that in essence Sondheim is not a comic phrasemaker but a teacher. While the score didn't strike me as deep at first listen, having studied it at length I find it as treasure-laden as his more operatically ''important''-sounding scores for ''A Little Night Music'' and ''Sweeney Todd.'' Written in a deliberately childlike extension of the romantic minimalism of ''Sunday in the Park With George,'' the music initially sounds a bit tinny and lightheaded. The title song skips forward on a tune that suggests ''The Teddy Bear's Picnic,'' by way of Walt Disney. But on closer inspection, Sondheim's insidiously catchy singsong ditties - inverted, upended, attenuated, accelerated and traded among the cast of characters - unite as interlocking motifs in an almost continuous suite. The music only seems, as children do, to have a short attention span. There are also many moments when the friskiness is suspended, abruptly giving way to heart-stopping apprehension, tenderness and reflection. One particularly exquisite fragment that seems almost thrown away comes when an enigmatic subsidiary character known as the Mysterious Man advises an agitated young baker whose wife has been trampled under the boots of a giant not to flee the calamity: ''Running away - we'll do it./ Why sit around, resigned?/ Trouble is, son,/ The farther you run,/ the more you feel undefined/ For what you left undone/ And, more, what you've left behind.'' Sondheim has never sounded more wistful and wise. As Sondheim's songwriting has mellowed, he has felt freer to lay aside the compulsive verbal cleverness for which he is so celebrated and offer simple unadorned statements about life, death, human values and personal choice. Writing from inside a children's fantasy world has encouraged him to put disarmingly direct sentiments in the mouths of allegorical characters who transcend age and epoch. The musical diction of children's tunes may be the closest he has come to finding a ''universal'' musical language, though it is the not the first time he has thought in such terms. The array of Broadway styles in ''Follies'' was comparably sweeping as the score proudly summed up modern theater music. ''Pacific Overtures'' dared to explore a transcontinental hybrid of Asian and Western modes. Where Sondheim's mature shows have explored moral issues, from revenge (''Sweeney Todd'') to the perils of success (''Merrily We Roll Along'') and the value of art (''Sunday in the Park With George''), ''Into the Woods'' deals with with the ultimate legacy of humanity - the values we pass down to our children. In an artfully constructed running argument, the lyrics unfold an interior dialogue between Sondheim the cynical relativist and Sondheim the romantic perfectionist, with the latter barely winning. The witch, the central symbolic figure of ''Into the Woods,'' embodies both sides of the debate. Paradoxically the story's catalytic troublemaker and its purest truthteller, she ascends at the end of the show as a benign spirit to lead the cast in voicing the show's final moral:

RARE SILENT FILM A rare silent film, ''Mazel Tov,'' starring Molly Picon, the Yiddish theater star, will be shown at 3 P.M. today at the Irvine Auditorium of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. Frank Mader of the American Guild of Organists will accompany the film on organ. This event, part of the Curtis Organ Restoration Society's silent film series, is one of the first public showings of this film with live accompaniment since it was released in 1924. The film's titles are in Yiddish and in English. Special guests for the occasion include Arthur Cantor, Broadway producer, director and playwright; Frank Ford, president of radio station WDVT and talk-show host, who will speak about Miss Picon; Morris Helzner, cnductor of the Workmen's Circle Chorus; and Irvin R. Glazer, president emeritus of the Theater Historical Society. Tickets are $5 for adults, $3 for students and senior citizens, and may be purchased at the auditorium box office, 34th and Spruce Streets, an hour before the performance. Information: (215) 898-2848. QUILT EXHIBIT ''Drunken Paths and Ladders to the Stars: Quilts 1700 to Now'' opened yesterday at the Wadsworth Atheneum, 600 Main Street, Hartford, Conn. Although the bulk of the 35 items come from the Atheneum's permanent collection and are from 19th-century America, there are also quilts from India, Laos and Hawaii, some dating from as early as the late 17th century. The exhibit focuses on quilt patterns and the origins of the designs with their often whimsical names. Drunkard's Path - also known as Fool's Puzzle, Wonder of the World, and Country Husband - reflects a 19th-century concern with drunkenness. One of the few Royal Hawaiian flag quilts to be found outside the islands is included in the exhibit. The Atheneum is open from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. Tuesday through Sunday. Admission is $3 for adults; $1.50 for students and senior citizens. It is free for children under 13. Information on tape: (203) 247-9111; other information: (203) 278-2670. BOOK AND COOK ''The Book and the Cook: Cookbooks Then and Now,'' the first such exhibit of cookbooks from the 1700's to the present from The Free Library of Philadelphia's collection, is on view through April 24 at its central branch, 19th and Vine Streets. The exhibit was planned to show how cookbooks reflect the history, the people and the culture of the times. In each of the 12 cases, cookbooks are displayed against a backdrop of colorful wallpaper, tablecloths, utensils, prints and other items to be found in the kitchen. A film, ''Who is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe?,'' a mystery starring Robert Morley, will be shown in the Montgomery Auditorium at 2 P.M. Sunday, April 10. Admission to the exhibit and the film is free. The library is open from 9 A.M to 9 P.M. Monday through Wednesday, 9 A.M. to 6 P.M. Thursday and Friday, 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. Saturday, 1 to 5 P.M. Sunday.

1296-> N.F.L. PLAYOFF MATCHUPS; Surprise Teams Hope to Take Another Super Step
Three largely unheralded teams remain alive in the National Football League playoffs this weekend. But if the Minnesota Vikings, the Indianapolis Colts and the Houston Oilers are the underdogs, the Chicago Bears, the San Francisco 49ers, the Washington Redskins, the Denver Broncos and the Cleveland Browns are recognizable big names. A surprising aspect of these playoffs is that every team that made them - from the wild cards to the division titlists - would have been in the exact same position even if the replacement games didn't count. Colts vs. Browns At Cleveland, tomorrow, 12:30 P.M., Channel 4 - They met on Dec. 6, and the Colts produced a 9-7 victory at Cleveland. So much for dome teams and road troubles. The Colts, though, cannot afford to have Eric Dickerson fumble. The quarterback, Jack Trudeau, has never started a playoff game. But the Browns' Bernie Kosar - who had one of his worst days as a pro in last month's loss -has emerged as one of the great ones at age 24. The Colts are the Eastern Division champions - a season after they finished last - while the Browns repeated atop the Central Division. The winner of this game will play the winner of the Oilers-Broncos game for the American Conference championship. Offense - The Colts' line is sending three players to the Pro Bowl: Chris Hinton, tackle; Ron Solt, guard, and Ray Donaldson, center. Small wonder that Dickerson pounds through those holes. As long as Dickerson runs well, Trudeau will not pass. Dickerson started eight times after the trade and the Colts won six. In his nine games with Indianapolis he gained 1,011 yards. The Browns, however, will pass and run, if they can. Bernie Kosar has a spectacular average of 7.8 yards a pass, but that is based not so much on the deep stuff as on medium-range success. Opposing linebackers have to respect the running game spearheaded by the two backs, Earnest Byner and Kevin Mack. Defense - The teams yielded the fewest points in the American Conference, with the Colts' defenders edging the Browns' by a single point. The Browns are getting back their leading tackler, the linebacker Mike Johnson, from a knee injury just in time. But Bob Golic, the veteran nose tackle and Pro Bowl player, is missing. Without a big pass rush, they have still managed to hold the opposition, thanks in part to a pair of Pro Bowl cornerbacks, Frank Minnifield and Hanford Dixon. The Colts' big-play man is Duane Bickett, who had eight sacks from his outside-linebacker post. Mike Prior, a replacement player who remained at cornerback, tied for the conference lead with six interceptions. Coaches - The Browns' Marty Schottenheimer was an English major in college, and is a gifted organizer. He gets his assistants thinking and they produce. Ron Meyer of the Colts was just the kind of motivator that a young team needed at the end of last season to turn them in a winning direction. They were 0-13 when he came in, but won their final three games. Vikings vs. 49ers At San Francisco, tomorrow, 4 P.M., Channel 2 - The Vikings will probably name Tommy Kramer to start at quarterback, but Wade Wilson will dash out as soon as Kramer either reinjures his neck or plays ineffectively under a pass rush. The 49ers have just completed their finest three-game streak since the 1950's, winning by a combined score of 124-7. They had the N.F.L.'s best mark, 13-2, in the regular season. The Vikings, an 8-7 team, come in after their wild-card upset of the Saints. The winner here will face the Redskins-Bears winner in the National Conference title game. Offense - The 49ers led the league in rushing and Joe Montana, who will start despite a recurring hamstring problem, led the league in passing. Jerry Rice led every receiver who has ever played in touchdowns with 22, and ran for 1 more. Everyone is healthy except for one of the three tight ends, Ron Heller. None of the 49ers' last 88 passes (26 by Montana, 62 by Steve Young) have been intercepted. Rice is strongest over the middle and brings in a 13-game scoring streak, including one from last season, another record. The Vikings believe you can never have enough quarterbacks. Whoever throws, Anthony Carter will be the target. He led the with league with a 24.3-yard average. Darrin Nelson had a 4.9-yard average running, tops in the league for anyone with more than 100 carries. Defense - The 49ers do not generate many sacks but they were able to force 38 fumbles and interceptions. They also yielded the fewest yards in the league. Ronnie Lott, the Pro Bowl safety, picked off five passes. Pressure from Michael Carter, the nose tackle, was a big reason not one passer was able to have a 300-yard day against the 49ers. The Vikings, meanwhile, boast that not one runner has been able to have a 100-yard game against them. Their pass rush will need to get to Montana as readily as it bothered the Saints' Bobby Hebert. That is not quite the same thing. Montana can spot his receivers just like that, or run to bide time. Coaches - Bill Walsh got the 49ers' replacement players to produce a 3-0 record and also avoided angering his veterans with some clever promises and heart-to-heart talks in his role as club president. Jerry Burns of the Vikings is only the club's fourth coach. He has the only team in the playoffs that was 0-3 in the replacement games. Redskins vs. Bears At Chicago, Sunday, 12:30 P.M., Channel 2 - Mike Ditka has benched or shifted so many players, fans may be wondering if the Bears are in danger of collapsing. Certainly, they are not the Bears of the previous two seasons, when they created turnovers and forced people to play their style. Despite their 11-4 mark this season, only the 3-12 Falcons had more turnovers. The Redskins believe turnovers are the key to this affair, as well as being able to get productive rushing out of George Rogers and Kelvin Bryant. Offense - A limited Jim McMahon (shoulder) starts for the Bears, hoping he won't have to throw. Walter Payton gets another chance to run down memory lane with Neal Anderson sidelined. Payton has run in cold weather before and he had his best game of the year in the season finale against the Raiders with 82 yards on 20 carries. Doug Williams is the Redskins' quarterback instead of Jay Schroeder. Williams is still saddled with an image as a freewheeling passer, but he completed 56.4 percent of his passes, and had only five passes intercepted while throwing for 11 touchdowns. He is protected by a top line. Defense - Some teams have discovered ways to combat the once-feared Bears defenders by getting deep against their suspect cornerbacks or throwing quickly. Richard Dent's pass rush could be negated by Williams's scrambling. The Redskins' Barry Wilburn led the N.F.L. with 9 interceptions and Washington recorded 56 sacks, led by Charles Mann. Coaches - Ditka has been telling his players they have been making their own bad luck lately with their turnovers. Who can doubt him? Over the last three seasons, the team is 40-7. The Redskins' Joe Gibbs doesn't take chances. Concerned about special teams despite a division title, he held a place-kicking contest this week between Ali Haji-Sheikh and Jess Atkinson, who had been the incumbent until injured. Oilers vs. Broncos At Denver, Sunday, 4 P.M., Channel 4 - Don't misunderstand Jerry Glanville. It's not that he's looking past Denver, it's just that he wants his unknown Oilers to think Super Bowl in the wake of their wild-card victory over Seattle. The Broncos, though, think that Glanville is being pretty cheeky. Offense - Suddenly, Alonzo Highsmith, the Oilers' No. 1 draft pick, is coming along to complement Mike Rozier. Highsmith averaged more than 6 yards a carry with 74 on 12 attempts against the Seahawks. Warren Moon was only a 50 percent passer in the regular season, but connected on almost two-thirds of his attempts in the wild-card game. His receivers, Ernest Givins and Drew Hill, are clever and dangerous. The Broncos' John Elway allows everyone else in the Bronco offense to be more productive, and from the new shotgun formation he seems to be even more dangerous. Denver used the formation about half the time as it has won six of its last seven. Elway amassed more than 3,000 passing yards for the third straight year and led quarterbacks in rushing as well. Sammy Winder ran for 741 yards as the Broncos set a team record for yards gained. Defense - Only three players are in the same positions they held on the Bronco team that went to last year's Super Bowl. But Mark Haynes is having a solid season at cornerback and Karl Mecklenburg leads the defenders from his linebacker post. Denver had 28 interceptions. Houston's defense ranked no better than 17th in yardage allowed, but has an active secondary. It is paced by Keith Bostic, a safety, who had six interceptions. The Oilers are vulnerable to the run, although they stopped the Seahawks, who performed without Curt Warner. Coaches - Glanville is playing his team's modest fame to the hilt, calling eight of the Oilers' nine victories in the regular season upsets. The players must be believing him, because they got one last week, too. Dan Reeves of the Broncos has a .641 winning percentage, along with an ability to let Glanville do the talking.

1297-> New York Cites Gains In Toxic Waste Cleanup
New York is working to clean up 293 hazardous waste disposal sites as part of a $4 billion program to rid the state of dangerous dumping grounds by the year 2000, the Department of Environmental Conservation reported this week. In a series of year-end reports, the department said that it had made substantial progress in cleaning up the sites. In 1987, it said, the state completed work at seven sites, started to clean up 42 more, identified 65 new ones and added 73 people to the cleanup staff. Under the program, the state plans to eliminate more than 500 sites that it describes as ''a significant threat to the public health or environment'' and that require priority remedial action. The department defined such action as intensive study, design or actual work to contain or clean up hazardous waste. When actual work is begun on a site, it is said to be under construction. No Bond Act Money Spent Yet The program, begun last year, is expected to be completed in 13 years. It will be financed by $1.2 billion from the 1986 Environmental Quality Bond Act, $2 billion from parties responsible for the pollution and $800,000 from the Federal Government. None of the money that has been spent on the cleanup thus far has come from the bond act, according to Edward O. Sullivan, a deputy commissioner in charge of the cleanup efforts. Most has come from the responsible parties, Mr. Sullivan said. ''Our policy is to spend money received from industry fees prior to spending bond money,'' he said. ''The taxpayers should be the last to pay for the mistakes of the responsible parties.'' Between 1983 and 1987, private polluters paid $250 million for cleanup work and reached agreements with the state to do $250 million more such work, according to Mr. Sullivan. In the same period, he said, the state used $13.1 million of its own funds, most collected in fees from industry, for capital construction of hazardous waste remediation facilities and contracted to spend $11.7 million more. Earlier this year, some environmental groups criticized the department for not moving more quickly to use bond act funds to clean up toxic wastes. Michael J. O'Toole, director of the department's Division of Hazardous Waste Remediation, replied to the criticism. ''You don't measure success by how much we spend,'' he said, ''but by the number of starts to clean up, and on that basis we are a success.'' This week, Anne Rabe, the director of the Superfund Monitoring Project of the New York Environmental Institute, a coalition of environmental groups, criticized Governor Cuomo for approving only 93 of the 155 additional personnel requested for the cleanup projects. ''You can't do it with the staff levels the Governor has proposed,'' she said. The Department of Environmental Conservation has 225 people working on toxic waste projects. In addition, the Department of Health and the Attorney General's office have fewer people assigned to the projects. The environmental department has undertaken 373 separate cleanup projects at the 293 sites, according to the reports. Of those, 33 projects are under construction, 133 are at the end of the construction phase, and the rest are in the feasibility study or design phase. Thomas C. Jorling, Commissioner of Environmental Conservation, attributed the number of sites being cleaned up to ''aggresive D.E.C. action against responsible parties, with the powerful clout'' of the bond act. The department listed 1,045 hazardous waste sites throughout the state, up from 1,013 in 1986. It classified 330 sites as ''significant threats'' but said that the number would increase to more than 500 when investigations were completed at 605 additional sites. Among the ''significant threat'' sites were 8 in New York City, 27 in Suffolk County, 20 in Nassau County and 8 in Westchester. No 'Imminent' Threats' The department also listed 61 sites that contained hazardous wastes that were not a threat; 40 sites that had been cleaned up but required monitoring, and 9 sites that had been cleaned and did not require monitoring. No site was characterized as an ''imminent'' threat to the environment or the public health. In addition, the state removed 266 sites from its list, either because hazardous wastes were removed or because it found that no action was necessary. Of the 293 sites that the state is working to clean, the report said that 205 are being paid for by responsible parties, 44 by the Federal Government, 35 by the state Superfund and 9 by local governments. ''We have consistently exceeded our projections of the number of sites being addressed,'' Mr. Sullivan said.''

1298-> Program Is Helping Elderly to Cope With Crime in a Massachusetts City
A network of services for elderly crime victims here in this western Massachusetts city and the rest of Hampden County has encouraged the elderly to report crimes against them to the police, officials say. Elderly victims' reluctance to come forward is being combated by the network of police officials, mental health counselors and advocates in the district attorney's office who provide help with the justice system as well as emotional support. It is the first such network in the state. ''The whole service response seems to be knit together under one umbrella,'' said Lee Pearson, manager of criminal services for the American Association of Retired Persons in Washington. ''This makes the problem more visible and efficiently uses scarse resources. Mixing home security, prosecution and witness assistance is a good model for other programs.'' $10,000 in Donations The network began to take shape after a spree of break-ins into homes of elderly residents here in the spring of 1986. It has received about $350,000 in Federal, state and city funds, in addition to $10,000 from private donors. In August 1986 the Community Care Mental Health Center set up a team of six mental health counselors and support staff to deal with elderly crime victims. The police in Hampden County began to compile statistics on such victims and to give their names to the team of counselors. A 24-hour hot line - (413) 739-1111 - was also set up. The counselors call crime victims to offer counseling, emergency home repairs and transportation to the police station, courts and hospitals. They also provide information on how to prevent crime. Last February, the district attorney set up a three-member staff to find emergency housing for victims, to help them obtain restraining orders against abusive family members and to see them through court cases. The network, which handled about 2,000 cases in 1987, has contributed to increased reporting and prosecution of crimes against older people, said Eleanor C. Cress, director of the Hampden County District Attorney's Victim Assistance Program. 'Problem of Underreporting' Her office now receives about 20 reports a month of abuse of elderly people, as opposed to one a month before the program began. It also receives about 100 reports of crimes a month, up from the five a month it received in its first six months of operation. ''There is a problem of underreporting,'' she said. ''We're just beginning to see these victims.'' Experts agree older people may hesitate to report crimes because they fear retaliation or high visibility they think might make them more vulnerable to future crime. Some simply do not want to trouble the police or they may be intimidated by an unfamiliar judicial system. ''They may also fear being seen as incompetent by a relative who has advised they go into a nursing home,'' said Sue Langman, director of the counseling program. Lowell Case Cited But advocates also agree that failure to report crimes encourages repeat offenses. They point to a case in the eastern Massachusetts city of Lowell. For three weeks recently, a woman in her 70's was robbed several times in her home. The police estimate that $70,000 in cash was stolen. She never reported the robberies. Instead, the police were alerted by her bank after one of the youths tried to cash one of her checks. The police then investigated, with the help of her family, said Sgt. Jonathan C. Webb, and arrested 18 youths. Ms. Langman said crimes against older people often involved harassment by neighborhood youth who select the elderly as targets because they frequently keep large amounts of cash on hand. Care Lifts Spirits ''They're also vulnerable because they often can't run away or fight back,'' she added. Thomas W. Bertrand's front door was damaged in an attempted break-in. The 73-year-old called Ms. Langman, who arranged for repairs. ''They didn't take too long and did a good job at no cost at all,'' Mr. Bertrand said. Furthermore, he said, the care and attention he received from Ms. Langman ''lifted my sprits.'' Henrietta and Earl Corey of Worcester were visiting their daughter here in Springfield when her estranged boyfriend came in and held them at knifepoint for five hours, before they escaped when a friend of the assailant arrived. Mr. Corey, 69, suffered a heart attack and nervous breakdown. Mrs. Corey, 74, who was beaten in the attack, was hospitalized for bruises. ''I was in a war but I never had nightmares like with this,'' Mr. Corey recalled. ''I was hurt I couldn't do more and afraid people were after me.'' Two days after the incident, the Coreys called the police. Aleana M. Laster, an advocate in the network, called offering support. She called three times a day, took the couple to police interviews and to court hearings, and explained the legal process. The assailant pleaded guilty to assault and battery and is now in the county jail. The Coreys agreed they would not have gone through the 10-month process without Ms. Laster. ''It isn't like you hire a lawyer,'' Mr. Corey said. ''It's more personal. She was the best medicine.''

1300-> McFarlane Lawyers Dispute Iran Allegations
Lawyers for Robert C. McFarlane, the former national security adviser, have sharply disputed allegations of wrongdoing leveled against their client in the Congressional Iran-contra report. In a 32-page document sent to the 26 members of the Iran-contra committee today, Leonard Garment and Peter Morgan, the attorneys, assert that the report's comments on Mr. McFarlane are so inaccurate or unfair that they ''fail to meet even the most modest standards of objective investigation.'' The document appears to be part of an effort to defuse some of the most damaging allegations about Mr. McFarlane at a time when Lawrence E. Walsh, the special prosecutor, is about to bring indictments against key participants in the Iran-contra affair. Mr. McFarlane is believed to be a focus of the special prosecutor's inquiry. Mr. McFarlane's attorneys charge that the sections of the report on their client ''mistate crucial facts about Mr. McFarlane's activities, suppress exculpatory facts, and manipulate still other facts to create false and misleading impressions to a degree that cannot be explained simply as random, inadvertent mistakes.'' The Iran-contra report contended that Mr. McFarlane repeatedly misled Congress about the extent and nature of the support for the Nicaraguan rebels being provided by Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North, the former National Security Council aide. The statements at issue were made in 1985 and 1986. The report also says Mr. McFarlane took part in the preparation of false chronologies of the Iran initiative after it was exposed in November 1986 and cites a visit to the White House on Nov. 19, 1986. The lawyers assert that the Iran-contra report considerably overstated the extent to which Mr. McFarlane deceived Congress. They also say that Mr. McFarlane worked on the chronologies only on Nov. 18, 1986; that he was out of the city on Nov. 19, 1986, and that most of the incorrect information was inserted by others who continued working on the document. Questions about the relationship between the contras and Colonel North were formally raised by members of Congress in 1985. Mr. McFarlane, in answers he later testified were ''too categorical,'' wrote a letter in response that said the Administration was complying with both the letter and the spirit of Congressional restrictions on aid to the contras. Mr. McFarlane's lawyers, however, assert that the answers to Congress were ''accurate as far as Mr. McFarlane knew at the time.'' ''The staff authors thus leave the clear implication that Mr. McFarlane lied,'' his lawyers said. ''He did not. As the report itself notes elsewhere, the large contributions he knew about -the ones from Country Two - were all received by the end of March, 1985, more than five months before this question was asked - i.e. not 'in the last two months.' This is not simply a matter of weaseling. The question gives the impression that the contras received some large and quite recent infusion of funds. It was a development that Mr. McFarlane did not know about.'' The report characterizes Mr. McFarlane's Nov. 7, 1986, memo to Rear Adm. John M. Poindexter, the national security adviser, as part of an effort to hide damaging information, in part because it omits any description of the November 1985 shipment of weapons. Some White House officials feared that delivery was illegal. According to the lawyers, nothing should be read into Mr. McFarlane's failure to mention the November shipment since the his memo was ''brief, spontaneous, angry and plainly not intended to be a comprehensive and detailed factual history.'' ''The majority staff goes beyond the limits of intellectually respectable argument when it claims this November 7 note shows that Mr. McFarlane acted in an intentionally deceptive way,'' the lawyers wrote.

1301-> POSTINGS: By the Sea; Hotel and Town Houses
In a one-time resort now being transformed into a bedroom community, Henry V. Vaccaro is hedging his bets. Along with the first hotel to be built in Ocean Grove, N.J, in 50 years, Mr. Vaccaro plans 14 town-house condominiums. The combination resort-and-conference hotel will have 168 rooms and Victorian architecture. The six-story hotel will face the ocean, but the two-and-a-half-story town houses behind it will overlook Wesley Lake. The hotel and town houses will share a pool and a solarium. The four-acre lot off Ocean Avenue on the border of Asbury Park was formerly the site of the North End Hotel, which was closed and demolished a decade ago. Mr. Vaccaro won a competition among 12 developers to lease the land from the Ocean Grove Camp Meeting Association, an arm of the Methodist Church. The church group owns all the land in Ocean Grove, an unincorporated section of the Town of Neptune. The 99-year land lease is for $4 million. The $20 million project still awaits town and state approvals, but construction is expected to begin this summer, with completion in 1989. Mr. Vaccaro has been a major force in the redevelopment of neighboring Asbury Park. In 1985 he helped renovate the 254-room Berkeley-Carteret Hotel, built in 1925. Currently, he is a partner in a $500 million effort to create 2,400 housing units in Asbury Park over the next 12 years. One building in the first stage, a 240-unit, 16-story apartment house, will face the Ocean Grove project from the opposite side of Wesley Lake.

1302-> Murray C. Weiss, 64, Journalist
Murray C. Weiss, who was editor of The International Herald Tribune for 13 years, died yesterday from complications after a stroke at Arlington Hospital in Arlington, Va. He was 64 years old and lived in Falls Church, Va. Overseeing the Paris-based International Herald Tribune from 1966 to 1979, Mr. Weiss - known as Buddy -helped move the paper from a provincial publication geared toward traveling Americans and the expatriate community to a true world newspaper. From 1964 to 1966, he was managing editor of The New York Herald Tribune, where he had begun as a copyboy in 1946. His positions there included metropolitan editor, from 1961 to 1963, and before that, night editor on the city desk, rewrite reporter and New York correspondent for the paper's European edition. ''He could pull the very best out of anyone,'' said Robert A. Poteete, a former city editor at The New York Herald Tribune who worked under Mr. Weiss. ''He was masterful at weighing news, at helping a young reporter who was confused see the story. He had a superb editorial mind.'' Mr. Weiss, who was born in Far Rockaway, Queens, and who graduated from New York University, left The International Herald Tribune in 1979 to become editor of The Stamford (Conn.) Advocate, where he stayed until 1981. In early 1982, he became managing editor of Parade magazine, which is distributed nationally in Sunday newspapers. From 1983 until his death, he was a features editor at the United States Information Agency. He is survived by his wife, the former Margaret Sunde; a daughter and a son by his first marriage, Brenna, of Manhattan, and Deiter, of Marietta, Ga.; two sisters, Phyllis Weiss Golden of East Orange, N.J., and Natalie Weiss Davis of Remsenburg, N.Y., and two grandchildren.

1303-> OUTDOORS; SPORTSMAN'S SPRING-CLEANING
AN outdoorsman who suffers from the pack-rat syndrome will eventually be choked by clutter whether his digs are modest or grand. At that point, he must begin to discard certain items, not only to gain breathing room, but also to save time lost in bouts of nostalgia while poking through his hoard. This isn't as easy as it sounds, even when an object is of little practical value. Recently, while throwing away some trout flies that were frazzled beyond repair, I came upon an ugly wet fly weighted with several turns of copper wire that I tied nearly 40 years ago, when I was still in college. It worked the first time I used it, but never again. When it surfaced the last time, I was again reminded of that one trout, a 16-inch brown caught in a deep pool on New Hampshire's Mascoma River. In that era, sinking fly lines didn't exist, and even if they had existed, I couldn't have afforded anything more than the floating level line that I was casting with a fiberglass rod I had made from a kit purchased from Herter's for about $12. (It was only last year that I gave that rod - and this hurt a little - to one of my grandsons.) I had created the fly because I was sure that there were big browns in the depths of that pool that I couldn't reach with an ordinary offering. The fish took on the third or fourth cast. I played it with care in the bat-filled dusk, and was so delighted when I finally had it in hand that I fished no more that evening. Last week, I threw that fly into the waste basket, an act that emboldened me to remove three grain sacks of books from my library on the outdoors. Most were tedious works dealing with technical and overworked aspects of hunting or fishing, but none involved waterfowling, a subject that has yet to be drowned in words. The attack on the books - thousands more remain - cleared a substantial space for a poetry shelf. The winnowing slackened, but it will resume, starting with taxidermy texts. The only thing I will stuff into a fish, bird or mammal that I catch or shoot is spiced bread crumbs or oysters. There are more than two dozen works devoted to survival or building emergency wilderness shelters that need to be culled. I need instruction on surviving in the workaday world, not the forest primeval. If I get caught in a blizzard up north in winter, I'll crawl under an old hemlock and fall asleep. On the other hand, I'm going to keep my five books on building log cabins. I've helped others erect cabins, but one of my never-ending fantasies has been to have one of my own, to purchase a few hundred acres of mature spruces and build a cabin from some of them, a cabin that would have a year-round spring or brook nearby. Why else would I have a broadax, a slick, a three-pound hatchet, a double-bitted ax, a froe, an adze, two big drawknives, a log scriber, a heavy-duty breast drill, a long boat builder's hand auger, a block and tackle and a snatch block stashed away? My collection of pots and pans for camping or outdoor cooking has gotten out of hand. There are mess kits and cups from the armies of at least four countries, amassed when today's marvelous backpacking cookware wasn't available. They will have to go, but I don't know if I can relinquish the huge sheet-metal frying pan - it is 20 inches in diameter - that hangs in a toolshed. Some 25 years ago, I saw a picture of a Wyoming guide squatting by a campfire preparing breakfast for his sports in such a pan, and instantly knew that I needed one. That same year, I purchased an old-fashioned Dutch oven - it has a flat cover with a raised lip on which one may pile embers when cooking out of doors -that sits in a corner of the cellar where I put it 20 years ago, slathered with cooking oil to prevent rust. I used the oven a dozen times before I put it away. The pan has never been touched by fire, but one doesn't lightly discard something in which 48 pullet eggs can be fried at one time. I have been giving some of my rifles and shotguns to my sons, but there is one fowling piece I've used only four times to which I still cling. It is an antique muzzle-loading, double-barrelled shotgun that is somewhere between 28 and .410 gauge. It is effective out to no more than 20 yards, having no choke at all in either barrel -something I didn't know when I bought it on Cape Cod about 15 years ago at the start of a trip that was to include Wilson's snipe shooting in South Carolina. When I arrived at the half-flooded meadows where the snipe lurked, I decided to use the muzzle-loader. My companions laughed at me, saying that the birds would be out of range of my little gun. They would have laughed harder had they known how it was choked, that pellets fired from it would cover the side of a chicken house two car lengths away. We marched across the huge meadow, each man at least 150 yards from the next, and after firing three shots at fast-flying snipe that sprang from the grass about 30 yards distant, without touching a feather, I knew I was in trouble. I also knew that while the others could not see whether I was succeeding, they could certainly count my shots. Fate intervened. A drove of about a dozen of the birds that I did not see until the last second flew directly in front of me about 15 yards distant. I fired one off-balance shot, and birds showered down from the sky - five or six of them, I believe. Those snipe, plus two others that I got with one shot each at a similar range, made me high man for the morning, and my ratio of shots fired to birds bagged was better than anyone else's. I let my friends marvel at my apparent skill for several weeks before spilling the beans. A gun with such a history isn't easily given away.

1304-> A NEW TAX CODE IN THE SPOTLIGHT; Profiles: How Some Are Getting Their Financial Houses in Order
Four years ago William J. Boyko left his native West Germany to take a job at his company's United States subsidiary. A marketing manager for Rohm Tech Inc. of Malden, Mass., Mr. Boyko is in charge of selling chemicals to the leather and fur industries and earns, he says, a ''decent'' salary. To limit his tax liability in the past, Mr. Boyko focused his portfolio on an array of investments, including an I.R.A., mutual funds, stocks and real estate. But with the arrival of tax reform, Mr. Boyko is now looking to obtain long-term growth and maximum return from his investments through a broader diversification strategy. Perhaps the biggest change Mr. Boyko has made in his portfolio has been to strengthen his cash position from 10 percent to roughly 33 percent. The advantage of such a move, he said, is greater flexibility in that he will have a smaller portion of his assets tied up in long-term investments. ''The 1986 tax law, as well as the uncertainty in many of the markets, has definitely changed my outlook about stocks and mutual funds,'' he said. ''Neither seems very feasible anymore.'' In fact, last September Mr. Boyko became uncomfortable with most of his stock holdings; he can't really explain why, but something told him to cut his stake. He did. On Oct. 19, the stock market plunged 508 points, but to Mr. Boyko it meant little. He does not intend to make an I.R.A. contribution this year, citing the fact that the tax law has eliminated the deduction for taxpayers who have pension plans and earn more than $35,000. He is also concerned that some future legislation could change the I.R.A. ground rules again. Mr. Boyko, who is 30 years old and single, also owns and manages real estate. While he describes himself as a ''small'' investor, in the last few years he has participated in three limited partnerships, which the new tax law has hit particularly hard. Because he made the investments before October 1986, the bulk of his losses from the partnerships can still be deducted, but the percentage will decrease in the coming years. By 1991, none of the losses will be deductible. But with the guidance of Barry M. Freedman, a financial planner for IDS Financial Services Inc., Mr. Boyko did find an appealing partnership this year - one that invests in the historical rehabilitation of low-income housing. Once, 25 percent of the certified cost of a historic rehabilitation could be used to reduce his taxes, but now that credit has been cut to 20 percent. But the investment still pleases Mr. Boyko. ''I invested $10,000 in two units, and I'm getting $1,600 a year for the next 10 years as a tax credit,'' he said. Two years ago Mr. Boyko bought his home, a condominium in Peabody, Mass. It's an investment that has held its value not only because the property has appreciated but also because interest rate deductions for primary residences have been maintained under the new law. Still, he is making some changes in his real estate investment strategy. He began by selling some property he owned in Florida. Then last year he bought two condominiums in Maine and two in New Hampshire. The units have been rented, and he has now assumed an ''active'' role as landlord, in that he approves renters and plays a more direct role in managing the property. He learned that under the new law, landlords who actively manage their buildings are permitted to use up to $25,000 in losses to offset other income, as long as the owner's adjusted gross income is less than $100,000. Mr. Boyko said that while he is looking for ways to further broaden his holdings, he plans to stay away from currency and commodity investments for now because ''I understand even less about that.'' And while Mr. Boyko values professional investment advice, he has also attended several financial seminars to increase his knowledge and contacts. ''I run my finances like a business, and I try to avoid things that I don't understand,'' he said.

1305-> New Western Series Stresses Family Drama
David Jacobs, the writer and producer who changed the face of television in 1978 when he created ''Dallas,'' the first successful nighttime soap opera, is once again challenging established wisdom at the networks. Thursday night at 9 o'clock, CBS is to present the first episode of ''Paradise,'' a western on which Mr. Jacobs acted as executive producer, co-writer and director. It is the first new western series on any network in several years; the last successful series with a Western setting was NBC's ''Little House on the Prairie,'' which went off the air in 1984. CBS has not attempted a western series since ''The Chisholms'' in 1979. In ''Paradise,'' Lee Horsley, the star of ''Matt Houston,'' plays a reformed gunfighter living in a rugged mining town in California, who must take charge of his sister's four young children after she dies. ''We had been working with an embargo on Westerns,'' said Patric Faulstich, the CBS vice president who approved Mr. Jacobs's series. ''So had the other networks. I read that Brandon Tartikoff said recently that one requirement for NBC programs was that there be no horses. We don't go quite that far. We also have 'Lonesome Dove,' a western mini-series, this season. We've done well with our Kenney Rogers movies, which were westerns. We did well with a 'Gunsmoke' revival movie. We think the genre might be viable again. The success of the movie 'Young Guns' is encouraging.'' Nevertheless, Mr. Faulstich admitted that there were some major obstacles to the success of any western series. ''The younger contemporary audience is separated from the entertainment tradition of the western,'' he said. ''The older audience that caught Saturday matinees in the 1950's or the Sam Peckinpah and Sergio Leone westerns of the 1960's and early 70's may have some affection for the genre. But we know we'll have a hard time attracting younger viewers.'' Difficult Competition The time slot that CBS has assigned to ''Paradise'' may increase the odds against its success. It will be shown Thursday nights at 9 o'clock, opposite ''Cheers'' on NBC and ''Dynasty'' on ABC. One way that CBS intends to counter the prejudice against westerns is by promoting ''Paradise'' as a family drama rather than a straight Western. ''I'm almost ashamed to say this,'' Mr. Jacobs said, ''but 'Paradise' is not that different from 'Thirtysomething.' It's about the change in a man's life brought on by children.'' Mr. Jacobs and his co-writer, Robert Porter, suggested a western mini-series to CBS a few years ago, but the network did not approve that project. Then last year Mr. Jacobs read a magazine story about couples who were choosing not to have children because it would interfere with their careers. ''The article came at the height of the yuppie craze,'' Mr. Jacobs said, ''and it upset me. My wife said those people shouldn't have children if they felt that way, but I believed many of them probably would make good parents if they had to take on the responsibility. So I decided to do a series about a childless person who has several kids thrust upon him. '' I discussed it with Kim LeMasters, the president of CBS Entertainment, and he said, 'Could this be incorporated into the western you wanted to do?' I said, 'Yes, as long as we never have to admit it was the idea of a network executive.' '' A Fan of the Genre Although the series aims to reflect contemporary concerns about child rearing, Mr. Jacobs said, he hopes it will also offer many of the pleasures of traditional Westerns. Mr. Jacobs is a fan of the genre. He cited John Ford's westerns and Howard Hawks's ''Red River'' as his favorites, and he said he had also enjoyed the western television series of the 1950's, like ''Gunsmoke,'' ''The Rifleman'' and ''Wyatt Earp.'' One difficulty in doing westerns today is the cost. ''There used to be a lot of suppliers of horses and stagecoaches and other western props and costumes,'' Mr. Jacobs said. ''Now there are very few because there are so few Westerns, and everything is much more expensive. But we're economizing by shooting everything on two locations - outdoors at the Disney ranch and indoors on the sound stage. The biggest expense we have comes from working with kids; we're limited in the number of hours we can work each day.'' ''I hope we succeed on some level,'' Mr. Jacobs said, ''so that 'Paradise' won't be further proof to all three networks that Westerns are dead.''

1306-> Regulator Seeks TMIC Liquidation
In a widely expected move that will sharply increase the likelihood of losses from the collapse of the TMIC Insurance Company, the California Commissioner of Insurance moved yesterday to liquidate the company. In a related development, some of TMIC's biggest creditors, including the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, filed a lawsuit in Federal court in Los Angeles charging TMIC's parent, Ticor, with improperly shielding its other subsidiaries from losses at the home mortgage insurer. A recent TMIC payment moratorium has caused lenders to repossess 6,600 homes whose $485 million in home mortgages were already in default. TMIC had been making insurance payments on these mortgages. Specifically, the lawsuit says that in September 1985, shortly after TMIC's troubles came to light, Ticor transferred the TMIC stock that it held from another Ticor subsidiary, Ticor Title, to Ticor. The transfer was undertaken, the suit said, to shield Ticor Title - a healthy company -from the obligations of TMIC. The suit also charged that assets were siphoned out of TMIC so that the insurer would have little left to pay its claims. The Ticor companies were acquired in early 1984 by a group that included Harold Geneen, the former chairman and chief executive of the ITT Corporation. ''Ticor severely undercut the ability of TMIC to meet its obligations,'' the suit said. At Ticor's headquarters in Los Angeles, Erich Everbach, Ticor's general counsel, called the suit ''entirely without foundation.'' He added, ''The Ticor companies will vigorously defend themselves.'' The biggest effect of a TMIC liquidation would be felt by Fannie Mae and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, known as Freddie Mac. The two agencies bought TMIC-insured mortgages and then sold them as elements of securities on which the agencies guaranteed interest and principal payments. Earlier this week, Fannie Mae said that 1.5 percent, or about $3 billion, of the conventional mortgage loans in its portfolio and its outstanding mortgage-backed securities were insured by TMIC. Meanwhile, in state court in Los Angeles, California's Insurance Commissioner, Roxani M. Gillespie, filed a request to liquidate TMIC, which in its heyday, operating as Ticor Mortgage Insurance, was one of the nation's largest and best-known mortgage insurers. A hearing on Ms. Gillespie's request will take place on April 6. Unless an alternative plan can be developed by then, the insurer will be closed. ''She's hoping that this time will give creditors time to design a new plan of rehabilitation,'' said a spokeswoman for Ms. Gillespie, who apparently acted after receiving a new study by a group of actuaries that indicated TMIC's prospects for a recovery are bleak. But if a rehabilitation plan cannot be assembled, the banks, savings institutions and other home lenders that hold TMIC policies are almost certain to suffer losses. In her filing, Ms. Gillespie estimated that TMIC will have a $254 million shortfall -the excess of its claims over its available cash - if it is closed later this spring. And that shortfall would widen if the company is allowed to continue operating, experts familiar with the situation said. TMIC's liquidation would be fairly straightforward. Caryl Bernstein, an executive vice president and general counsel at Fannie Mae, said it would be terminated as a continuing business, policies would be canceled as of a certain date, and available assets would be used to pay existing claims. No claims would be considered after a certain date. TMIC would then be out of business, but according to Mrs. Bernstein, an attempt is being made to fashion some form of continued insurance on TMIC's mortgages so that homeowners would not have to obtain new mortgage insurance policies, whose premiums have escalated in recent years. In a typical mortgage policy, a lender pays a premium for protection against loss on a mortgage of up to 25 percent of the original principal amount. Mrs. Bernstein said that, led by the Mortgage Insurance Companies of America, a trade group, a behind-the-scenes effort was being made under which a consortium of existing, healthy mortgage insurers would provide continued coverage.

1307-> THE MEDIA BUSINESS; 4 Publishers List Results For Quarter
Three leading publishing companies - McGraw-Hill Inc., the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation and Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. - yesterday reported moderately higher earnings for the third quarter. A fourth company, Multimedia Inc., reported that its earnings fell slightly in the period. McGraw-Hill McGraw-Hill, based in New York, said its net income increased by 12.2 percent, to $58.8 million, or $1.21 a share, from $52.4 million, or $1.03 a share. Its revenues edged up by 3.5 percent, to $471.1 million, from $455.1 million. ''Increased operating profits were recorded by the information services and financial services companies,'' said Joseph L. Dionne, the chairman and chief executive. ''The publlishing company finished down for the quarter because of softness in some aspects of its education group's operations and in the broadcasting unit.'' He noted that the results benefited from the disposition of certain operations, including the company's Chemical Week magazine and its Aardvark software operations. Dun & Bradstreet Dun & Bradstreet, which is best known for its credit ratings and reports, said its net income rose by 16.5 percent, to 134.8 million, or 72 cents a share. In the 1987 quarter, the company's net income totaled $115.7 million, or 62 cents a share. Its operating revenues rose by 16.1 percent, to $1.06 billion from $920.7 million. Dun & Bradstreet also said that its board had unanimously approved a shareholder-rights plan that the company said was intended to preserve their long-term investment values should a takeover attempt occur. Charles W. Moritz, the chairman and chief executive of the New York-based company, said that the results had met expectations. Harcourt Brace Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, which is based in Orlando, Fla., reported that its earnings rose by 6.5 percent, to $80.4 million, or $1 a share, from $75.5 million, or $1.21 a share, on fewer shares outstanding. Its sales jumped by 15.1 percent, to $625.5 million from $543 million. Multimedia Multimedia said its net income slipped by 8.2 percent, to $4.5 million, or 36 cents a share, from $4.9 million, or 40 cents a share. But its revenues rose by 5.3 percent, to $107.9 million from $102.4 million. The company, which is based in Greenville, S.C., said its net earnings for the 1987 quarter included a gain of about $3 million from the sale of a radio station, WWNC-AM in Asheville, N.C.

1308-> OH, BABY, I LOVE YOUR LOFT
REAL ESTATE By Jane DeLynn. 316 pp. New York: Poseidon Press. $17.95. In New York City in the late 1980's real estate is destiny. Everyone knows a couple who stay together, or at least married, because neither partner will relinquish the co-op; adult offspring who return to childhood living accommodations because they can't find an affordable studio east of the Hudson; singles in search of a home who swear love when all they feel is lust for a trendy loft or 12-room prewar with wbf. Whether this is black comedy or high tragedy depends on the status of your lease, but Jane DeLynn has set out to mine both veins in ''Real Estate,'' an on-target, wickedly funny tale of musical apartments, malfunctioning appliances and misplaced passions. After more than 15 years of marriage spent in the same 2,500 square feet of rent-controlled space on Riverside Drive, Lorraine and David are bored. A move, however, is out of the question, since their building is about to go co-op. Instead they turn their maze of dark hallways and queer-shaped rooms into a gleaming loft, all space and no color. The problem is that neither the renovated apartment nor the marriage works. David moves out and into his girlfriend's sublet. Jack, a blocked artist, moves in with Lorraine and her stereo- and television-addicted daughter. He's sure that, free from his bleak Lower East Side tenement, inspired by a sweeping view of river and sky, he'll be able to paint again. But in contemporary New York, expectations are no more reliable than real estate ads. David, a wheeler-dealer attorney, discovers that homelessness is more than a condition to be watched in living color on the evening news. Jack has his 15 minutes in the sun as a performance artist who stages a series of convincing and darkly hilarious muggings, then decides what he really wants is not ''to be famous, but to lie in bed next to someone, complaining . . . about not being famous.'' Ms. DeLynn is at her best when she is lampooning the current New York scene - artists who ''appropriate'' other artists' styles as part of a ''dialogue,'' then manage to sell the rip-offs to banks and corporations for small but tax-deductible ransoms; bejeweled uptown matrons who cruise the downtown clubs in hopes of getting the performance art mugger to strike; television news that in its saccharine banality offends the spirit more than the actual reported calamities do. Moreover, she has a brassy style that suits her subject, though the constant repetition of parentheses, abbreviations and hip slang occasionally grates. But Ms. DeLynn is angry as well as witty, and the novel eventually sinks under the weight of its own indictments. The long treatises on art and parables about God and Israel, nihilism and Marxism, grow tedious. The characters' alienation and ineffectuality stultify -they constantly fight either narcolepsy or insomnia, dream of spinning off in spaceships, long to return to a childhood that never existed. The endless dissections of the most ordinary emotions - ''What could it mean to 'lose' one's 'character'? What did it mean to be a person?'' - and the obsession with bodily functions shed no new light on the human condition, though the household pet's interior monologues will permanently alter your view of every passing dog. The chief problem of ''Real Estate,'' one that marred the author's earlier novel ''In Thrall'' as well, is the sheer negative force of the characters. Though they often swear love, they care for nothing and no one. Selfish, petulantly self-involved, without passions or interests, compassion or even the ability to recognize that their actions will have consequences, they are an unsavory lot. Ms. DeLynn is undoubtedly trying to tell us something about contemporary urban society, with its skewed values and lost souls. If only she had resisted heavy-handed diatribes and trusted her keen eye for the social scene and sharp-tongued ability to describe it, ''Real Estate'' might have had humanity as well as a drolly delivered message. LIGHT AT THE END OF THE HALL? He knew what apartments were like in luxury buildings on the Upper West Side of New York City - bumpy walls, layers of paint gently detaching themselves from the ceilings, chipped baseboards, moldings whose relief patterns were slowly being obscured by accumulations of enamel, long dark halls that wandered between rooms, parquet floors whose wax you could scrape up with your fingernails, windows whose warped sashes stuck in their frames, which could be forced open or closed only by jamming the bottom of one's palm against the swollen sash. But here were white pickled floors, smooth uncracked white walls, huge picture windows or smaller (but still large) ones that swiveled. . . . He couldn't tell whether he liked or hated it. From ''Real Estate.''

1309-> COMPANY NEWS; American Cellular Deal Is Protested
Frederick A. Moran, president of Moran Asset Management, said that he plans to solicit other bidders to top a $25-a-share, or $230 million, merger agreement between the American Cellular Network Corporation and the Comcast Corporation. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Moran said he believed that ''the company should remain independent or the price should not be less than $45 a share'' and he planned to encourage other cable television and cellular telephone concerns ''to offer a higher price.'' Moran Asset Management is an investment advisory firm which manages more than $100 million in client funds, concentrating on cable television and cellular telephone issues from its headquarters in Greenwich, Conn. It holds 8.4 percent of American Cellular's shares outstanding on behalf of its clients.

1310-> NOTED WITH PLEASURE
In the Jungle With Cinderella While telling stories around the campfire one night, Eric Hansen entertained his hosts in Borneo with a Malay version of Cinderella. This is from ''Stranger in the Forest: On Foot Across Borneo'' (Yolla Bolly/Houghton Mifflin). One of the most popular stories I told was my special abridged version of Cinderella, with Cinderella working hard for her big, ugly, unmarried sisters - washing clothes in the river, cutting up tapioca for the pigs, and chopping firewood in the jungle. Along came the headman's son, who met her at an all-night rice-wine party and dance. Unfortunately Cinderella had to return to her village before midnight; otherwise her exquisitely carved and painted longboat would turn back into a banana (I didn't know the Malay word for pumpkin). The headman's son married Cinderella and took her away to the mouth of the river, where there were lots of fish and fat pigs. They lived happily ever after, of course. Silence Is Golden Sir James Frazer, author of ''The Golden Bough,'' was one of the hardest-working writers who ever lived - but he required very strict conditions. This is from a letter by his wife, Lilly, to Edmund Gosse, in ''J. G. Frazer: His Life and Work'' by Robert Ackerman (Cambridge University). He has some needs and his books could not be produced without those being satisfied. The first is absolute quiet - both in and out of the house; the slightest noise disturbs him and my experience has been that it is the most difficult condition to procure. Long before our marriage J. G. had Fellow's rooms in Nevile's Court and had to give them [ up ] and to take rather undergraduate's rooms as his neighbours in Nevile's Court poked the fire inconveniently. I give you this one example, but the need of total silence is growing on him with growing work and growing age. In a small house such as I personally dearly like, silence either domestic or other is an impossibility. We have tried it twice and failed. The second of J. G.'s needs is space for his library - another very serious condition - so serious that while in Trinity (Great Court) writing the first edition of the G. Bough - also before our marriage - he was asked not to put any more weight of books on the floors - I myself saw the ceiling below him looking like an inflated sail. Tallest Woman Writer of 1927 Here are two comments on writing - a deadpan one by Alan Bennett about Virginia Woolf and a wistful one by F. Scott Fitzgerald. They are from ''The Penguin Dictionary of Modern Humorous Quotations,'' compiled by Fred Metcalf (Penguin). Of all the honours that fell upon Virginia's [ Woolf ] head, none, I think, pleased her more than the Evening Standard Award for the Tallest Woman Writer of 1927, an award she took by a neck from Elizabeth Bowen. And rightly, I think, for she was in a very real sense the tallest writer I have ever known. Which is not to say that her stories were tall. They were not. They were short. But she did stand head and shoulders above her contemporaries, and sometimes of course, much more so. Mostly, we authors must repeat ourselves -that's the truth. We have two or three great moving experiences in our lives - experiences so great and moving that it doesn't seem at the time that anyone else has been caught up and pounded and dazzled and astonished and beaten and broken and rescued and illuminated and rewarded and humbled in just that way ever before. Disturbing the Peace While critics are always trying to police the novel, it remains a lawless and insurrectionary force, according to D. A. Miller in ''The Novel and the Police'' (University of California). The frequent appearance of policemen in novels is too evident to need detecting. Yet oddly enough, the ostensive thematic of regulation . . . has never impugned our belief that ''of all literary genres, the novel remains the most free, the most lawless.'' Though the phrase comes from Gide, the notion it expresses has dominated nearly every conception of the form. If a certain puritanical tradition, for instance, is profoundly suspicious of the novel, this is because the novel is felt to celebrate and encourage misconduct, rather than censure and repress it. A libertarian criticism may revalue this misconduct as human freedom, but it otherwise produces a remarkably similar version of the novel which, in league with rebel forces, would bespeak and inspire various projects of insurrection. This evasive or escapist novel persists even in formalist accounts of the genre as constantly needing to subvert and make strange its inherited prescriptions. Just a Bit of Cosmic Fun When a man has a solid philosophy not even an earthquake can shake him. This is from ''On Some Mental Effects of the Earthquake,'' published in 1906 when William James was treated to the great California quake. It is in ''William James: Writings 1902-1910'' (Library of America). I was thrown down on my face as it went fortior, shaking the room exactly as a terrier shakes a rat. Then everything that was on anything else slid off to the floor, over went bureau and chiffonier with a crash, as the fortissimo was reached, plaster cracked, an awful roaring noise seemed to fill the outer air. . . . The thing was over, as I understand the Lick Observatory to have declared, in forty-eight seconds. . . . In my case, sensation and emotion were so strong that little thought, and no reflection or volition, were possible in the short time consumed by the phenomenon. The emotion consisted wholly of glee and admiration; glee at the vividness which such an abstract idea or verbal term as ''earthquake'' could put on when translated into sensible reality and verified concretely; and admiration at the way in which the frail little wooden house could hold itself together in spite of such a shaking. I felt no trace whatever of fear; it was pure delight and welcome.

1311-> Orders Fell For Durables Last Month
The Government reported today that orders for durable goods fell 4.1 percent in September, but economists are reluctant to conclude that the boom in manufacturing is ending. The Commerce Department said total orders last month fell by $5 billion, to a seasonally adjusted $117.7 billion, pulled down by steep declines in the volatile military and transportation sectors. Other categories also recorded declines, including machinery, computers and capital goods purchased by businesses. The latest report is consistent with other signs of a slowdown last month, including the second consecutive decline in retail sales and a drop in manufacturing employment. Export Boom Has Helped But analysts said it was too soon to say that manufacturing, which has driven economic growth this year, is slowing significantly. A boom in export sales, aided by the lower value of the dollar, has kept factories humming. Manufacturers in turn have invested heavily to expand the capacity of their plants, stimulating the fastest growth in capital spending since 1984. ''There are some cautionary notes in this report, but the economy is still very strong,'' said Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch & Company in New York. ''The manufacturing sector isn't faltering just because orders went down one month.'' He noted that unusually wide swings in orders for both transportation equipment and military goods have pushed the overall orders up and down over the last four months. Durable goods, which are products expected to last three years or more, include a wide array of manufactured items, from refrigerators and other household appliances to large computers and battleships. Military Goods Off 12.3% Orders had soared 8.7 percent in June, plummeted 7.4 percent in July, and jumped 5.7 percent in August. Orders for transportation equipment in September were down 10.2 percent, after an 18.6 percent jump in August, while orders for military goods fell 12.3 percent last month, after a 14.7 percent rise. Excluding the military, orders fell 3.5 percent. Excluding transportation, they were down 1.7 percent. The important category of nonmilitary capital goods, considered a good barometer for business expansion plans, fell 11.9 percent. It was the first decline since May and the steepest drop since January 1986. James Annable, an economist with First National Bank of Chicago, said the decline in capital-goods orders was ''disquieting because it suggests a weakening in the primary engine of economic growth.'' He said, however, that manufacturing profits were high and factories were using a high percentage of their capacity, suggesting that capital-goods orders would rebound soon. Strength in Metals Electrical machinery also fell in September, by 4.1 percent, the second consecutive monthly decline, while non-electrical machinery dropped by 7.5 percent. The only area of strength in September was in primary metals, which includes steel. It rose 6.5 percent, after declines of 2 percent in August and 1.4 percent in July. Shipments of durable goods fell eight-tenths of 1 percent, to $116.9 billion, after a 4.2 percent increase in August. The backlog of unfilled orders expanded last month by a modest two-tenths of 1 percent, to $431.9 billion, after strong gains from June through August.

1314-> Iran Reports Iraqi Attacks Kil 37 Civilians
Iraq fired four missiles into Teheran today and said that it bombed eight other Iranian cities. Iran said that at least 37 civilians were killed and that it fired two missiles into Baghdad in retaliation. Iraq also said its planes hig a ''very large maritime target,'' a term that usually means a supertanker. It said the attack took place near the Iranian oil terminal on Lavan Island in the central Persian Gulf. Western reporters in Teheran said no air raid warnings were sounded before the Iraqi missile attacks there. The Iranian Prime Minister, Mir Hussein Moussave, charged that the Iraq was stepping up its missile and air strikes to disrupt elections for the 270-seat Iranian Parliament on Friday. Iran said that the Iraqi missiles hit residential districts in Teheran, killing 16 civilians and wounding scores more, and that 21 civilians werekilled and dozens wounded in Iraqi air raids on the other cities and towns. The Iraqi press agency, monitored in Nicosia, said an Iranian missile exploded in a residential neighborhood in Baghdad, killing several civilians. Iran said that five short-range missiles were fired into the southern Iraqi port of Basra, and that its planes carried out six attacks on Iraqi troop concentrations.

1315-> Remember the World
To The Home Section: Your article ''A Vanishing Way of Life: The Large American Family'' [ March 17 ] was interesting and well written, and it dealt rather thoroughly with the emotional and financial ''average'' number of children. What bothers me is what it completely neglected: the ecological angle. Did any of these parents consider the impact of the large family, its implications for the physical world? We face a worsening set of problems as to garbage and sewage disposal, in using more ground water than we replace in our aquifers, in damage to the ozone layer, and even in the simpler needs for food, clothing, housing and education. It seems to me that only the most self- or family-centered could remain proponents of 6-, 8- or 10-child families. It may be that such an attitude of ''be fruitful and multiply'' might have been justified for 18th-century European pioneers on the shores of half-empty continents. But in a world where zero population growth is not just a buzz phrase, the otherwise caring parents quoted in Carin Rubenstein's article seem self-indulgent anachronisms. IRWIN A. LEVY, New York, N.Y.

1316-> Jackson Is Arming His Campaign With Substance
Jesse Jackson wanted to talk numbers: budget statistics, excess costs, business entertainment deductions. But, he was asked, what about passion? What about oratory? What about rhyming? Numbers don't rhyme. ''Two and two make four and no more,'' he said, with a mischievous grin. ''Numbers live. Numbers take on vitality.'' As his rival, Michael S. Dukakis searches for passion to brighten his campaign, Mr. Jackson is reaching for substance to deepen his. ''I'm trying,'' he said, with a funny grimace, ''to be Presidential.'' Then, more primly: ''It's appropriate now to add some numbers to our dreams.'' For Mr. Jackson, the numbers in Wisconsin and Colorado may have been a disappointment and may have dashed the dazzling momentum of his quest for the Democratic nomination. But today he did not stop to mourn. ''We're in the fourth quarter of the game and I'm ahead on points, so what is the basis of sadness?'' he said on a plane from Arizona, which will hold caucuses next week, to Indianapolis to appear in a fund-raiser beamed across the country by satellite. 'We Find That We're All One' He knows, he said, that the process of bringing the country around to the idea of a black President is incremental: ''The large crowds that came in Wisconsin with many whites, the more they come and the more I have access to them, the more their fears are relieved and the more we find that we're all one and we have a lot in common.'' ''I have watched the exaggeration and hype toward those who would dare to change things,'' he said. ''Fears without foundation give way to normalcy. People said, 'If Jackie Robinson plays baseball, what's going to happen to our favorite pasttime?' Well it's still the favorite pastime. ''People said, 'I'm not calling him Muhammad Ali. His name is Cassius Clay.' Finally, they said, ''What's wrong with calling someone by the name they want to be called by?' '' To prepare for the New York primary, Mr. Jackson is trying to change what he considers stereotypes, hysteria, and misconceptions about him. He has been faulted for grandiose plans with no details, so now he has started introducing into speeches specifics of a budget that would freeze military spending for five years, double the education budget and increase spending on public housing and day care. He has been faulted for military and foreign policies that seem simplistic and radical, so he is now trying to argue that his positions are centrist. He compares his stances with those of Henry A. Kissinger and George P. Shultz, and he refers to the gray eminences of the establishment he recently had breakfast with in Washington, Clark M. Clifford and Clifford Alexander, as his policy advisers. He shrugged off the idea that some of his left-wing constituencies might have a hard time envisioning him in this new, more conservative mien, ''The center has shifted to include more people,'' he said. He said his idea to freeze the military budget is ''not a unilateral cut in the next-January sense.'' but would take place over five years. ''I will not scrap the weapons systems we already have,'' he said. ''That would be irresponsible.'' Reaching Out to Jewish Voters He has been criticized for his failure to apologize often and loudly enough for his ''Hymietown'' comment in 1984 and for hugging Yasir Arafat, so he is trying to show that his Rainbow coalition reaches out to Jewish voters and asserting that his Middle Eastern stance is in line with those of Abba Eban, Mr. Shultz and Shimon Peres. On his reference to New York City as ''Hymietown,'' he remarked grimly: ''People forgive and move on. It's the only way you can really function.'' Recalling his moving mea culpa at the 1984 Democratic convention, he added: ''I did what no one else has ever done. I expressed my feelings in July 1984 to 400 million people.'' He compared himself with Mr. Shultz: ''They say I met with Ortega, met with Duarte. Sure, I met them. But, just as in the Middle East, my position of direct negotiation, to seek to meet with all sides, is precisely what Shultz is trying to do.'' He said he wanted ''to address Palestinians in a very direct way to recognize Israel's right to exist with security.'' ''If America can play the role of the big arbiter and can do for both of them what neither can do for the other -recognition of mutual security - then that's moving in the right direction.'' Mr. Jackson said. ''That's Abba Eban's position. That's why Peres will meet with Shultz and Shamir will not.'' The Importance of Inspiring He stressed the importance of inspirational leadership. ''Sometimes a President can simply do what they call jawboning, and say 'Look, here's what's good for you and for America.' '' On the sensitive Jewish issue, Mr. Jackson pointed out that he went to Geneva and talked to Mikhail S. Gorbachev about Soviet Jewry, that he tried to help Elizabeth Holtzman win extradition from Syria for a Nazi war criminal and that he helped rabbis in Chicago last month to protest a swastika that had been painted on a synogogue. ''But that's no different than 10 years ago, marching with the Jews in Skokie when the neo-Nazis were ready to march and terrorize people,'' he said, adding in a clear cut at his rivals, Albert Gore and Mr. Dukakis: ''What we must do is try to be principled and honorable public leaders in that way and not through pandering. It underestimates people's intelligence.''

1317-> PILLSBURY RESTAURANT CUTBACKS SET
The Pillsbury Company said yesterday that it planned to sell or close about 103 of its fast-food and full-service restaurants to improve sagging corporate profits. The Minneapolis-based food company, known for flour, baking products, Green Giant foods and Haagen-Daz ice cream, said that it would take $91 million, or $1.06 a share, in charges and write-offs after taxes in its fourth quarter ending Feb. 29. Pillsbury's restaurants, which include Burger King, Godfather's Pizza, Benningan's and Steak and Ale's, hurt the company's earnings in the past year, as they lost market share to such industry giants as McDonald's. Under the restructuring, Pillsbury will close or sell its Quik Wok, Bay Street and Key West Grill restaurant chains, which total about 30 units. In addition, Pillsbury said it would shut down 43 company-operated Godfather's Pizza and Burger King outlets. Thirty other full-service restuarants, most likely Steak and Ales, will be closed or sold, the company said. Food analysts said that they were disappointed by the restructuring plan because it was not more inclusive. Analysts expected Pillsbury to divest of several major food chains that had low returns. ''All the company did was prune -there's no real substance here,'' said John McMillin, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities. ''Why spend so much time trying to fix things when in reality you should get rid of them?'' Pillsbury stock closed at $37.25 yesterday, down 62.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. In the last three days, the company's stock rose from $35.75, to $37.875, because of an improving market and in anticipation of the restructuring announcement, analysts said. In particular, analysts said that they expected Pillsbury to sell the Steak and Ale chain, whose sales have declined at double-digit rates over the last year. Pillsbury, which last year announced the sale of 40 Steak and Ale restaurants, added non-beef items such as chicken and fish to the chain's menus but the move has proved unsuccessful. Sales at the company's more than 5,000 Burger King restuarants were roughly flat over the past year, as the fast-food chain struggles to find a successful new advertising campaign and product line. It's last big ad campaign, which featured a nerdish character named Herb was widely considered an advertising disaster. Although they were dissatisfied with the plan, some investors said that they expect the company to reap its benefits in the next fiscal year. According to Ronald B. Morrow, an analyst with Smith Barney, the restaurants that Pillsbury plans to divest itself of have been a $150 million drain on operating revenues and about $20 million drain on profits. ''These changes are more than just cosmetic - they will improve cash flow by eliminating those assets that were not up to our return expectations,'' John M. Stafford, Pillsbury's chairman and chief executive, said in a telephone interview. Mr. Stafford, whom analysts have criticized for his handling of the restaurant group, said that he was giving top priority to enhancing the performance of the restuarant group. ''We have a new upcoming advertising campaign at Burger King and have refocused our menu at Steak and Ale - we are excited about this,'' he said. As part of the restructuring, Pillsbury said that Burger King would upgrade 145 units primarily in Chicago and New Orleans and modernize or close about 50 company-owned restaurants owned by franchisees. In addition, the company said that it would close or sell two manufacturing plants and two small canned vegetable businesses as well as two international food businesses. GENERAL MILLS MOVE DETROIT, Jan. 7 (Special to The New York Times) - General Mills Inc. said today that it was considering the sale of two specialty retail chains, Talbots and Eddie Bauer, a move that would eliminate the last traces of the non-food businesses it acquired during the 1960's and 1970's. The board of the Minneapolis-based food giant also authorized the application of the proceeds from any sale to repurchase up to 9.2 million shares; the company already holds 15.8 million of the 88.5 million shares outstanding. Craig Shulstad, a spokesman for General Mills, said the company might still decide to keep the clothing retailers if bids were disappointing. But he said the board would prefer to sell and thereby put the finishing touch on the restructuring it began more than two years ago, when it sold or spun off over two dozen businesses, in fields as diverse as toys and furniture, with combined annual revenues of about $1.7 billion. Mr. Shulstad said there were no financial problems with either Talbots or Eddie Bauer.

1318-> Don't Blame Private Carters for New York's Garbage Problems
To the Editor: As a third-generation private carter, whose grandfather and father both worked many long hours over many long years, my reaction to ''Dethrone the Emperors of Trash'' editorial (March 13) should have been anger or resentment; it was instead amusement at your mistakes and your implications. I fail to see how the bottle scavengers, garbage combers and rats of downtown sidewalks will be less likely to make their mess if the trash is picked up by New York City Sanitation trucks, by one monolithic company or by the private contractors who are doing their job in the free-market system. Perhaps the lack of respect traditionally accorded the private sanitation industry by you and the city has had a spillover effect on these occupants of night. An editorial against the real estate industry for not having trash ready for pickup in sequential order, one building putting out its daily waste just after the preceding one has been picked up, might be in order. Or an editorial against the Police Department or Department of Transportation or whoever is responsible for keeping the narrow downtown streets clear so that trucks could run their downtown routes before midnight, thus reducing the time some trash is left on the sidewalks. Several of your other points must be addressed. The rate charged by private carters is determined not by a ''cartel'' but by the Department of Consumer Affairs; a customer may cancel a contract at any time, for any reason. New York's private sanitation industry has always been a leader in new technology because its income is based on efficiency and productivity; there is a list of equipment and technology now commonplace in the Department of Sanitation that was introduced in this city by private carters. Yes, there are trade associations, as there are for most businesses in New York. Yes, they collect dues. Our company, as a small operator, finds the cost of being a member, in light of the individual costs of dealing with the many regulatory agencies and unions, is minimal. Finally, dealing with the waste flow from a metropolis such as New York is a major, expensive and complicated issue. For you to point an accusatory finger at the private carters, implying that they and not the lack of landfill space and the high costs of equipment, labor and insurance are the cause of the problem does a disservice not only to the majority of honest hard-working carters, but to the whole city as well.

1319-> Reagan on Democratic Campaign Special to The New York Times
President Reagan, in an assessment of the 1988 Presidential campaign, said today that it was unfortunate that the Rev. Jesse Jackson's campaign seemed to have drawn attention more because he is black than because of his policy proposals. ''I'm sorry that in the campaign that's going on with one candidate of the balck race, that it seems that more attention is being paid to the difference in color than is being paid to what he is actually saying,'' Mr. Reagan said at a question-and-answer session here with the American Society of Newspapaer Editors. Mr. Reagan's remarks, unusual because he has declined until recently to comment at all on the 1988 campaign, included one in which he said it appeared that criticism of Mr. Jackson had been withheld to avoid a perception that the criticism was racist. ''I have to believe that a great many of us would find ourselves in great disagreement with the policies that he is proposing and would perhaps be more vocal about them if it wasn't for concern that it would be misinterpreted into some kind of racial attack,'' the President said. ''I will be very frank with you,'' Mr. Reagan said. ''I find great disagreement with some of the things that are being proposed by Jesse Jackson. ''I also find a great deal of disagreement with his fellow candidates in that party, which is why I'd suggest that everybody should vote Republican.''

1320-> Reagan Defends Effort Against the Drug Trade
President Reagan today defended the Administration's efforts to rid the nation of illegal narcotics. Speaking at a meeting of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, he took issue with ''front-page articles on the war on drugs,'' including a series published this week by The New York Times. ''One frequent refrain has been, as The New York Times this Sunday wrote, no Administration has signed or spent more money to stem the flow of drugs into this country, but we're losing ground.'' Mr. Reagan said. ''Well, let me offer a slightly different view,'' he added. ''We've done more than ever before, and right now we're holding our own. We've stopped America's free fall into the drug pit.''

1322-> Inching Toward a 'Middle Way' on Tibet
Abruptly, China has shifted back toward conciliation in its approach to the continuing national grievances of Tibet. This week it invited the Dalai Lama, whom it has blamed for recent bloody unrest, to return to live in Tibet if he ceases to call for independence. The Tibetans' spiritual leader rejected the offer, but he too sounded conciliatory. Independence is not his word, he said, and he would be happy to talk with authorities in Beijing. Resumed negotiations would serve both sides best. The lowered voices make them sound almost possible. China's turn to conciliation, remarkably, comes after a chorus of calls for repression. After putting down a bout of anti-Chinese violence last fall, Beijing focused mainly on ''re-education'' - attempting to persuade Tibetans that their calls for independence were hopeless as well as illegal. Meanwhile, the Chinese gradually withdrew their heavily armed security forces and released most of the monks imprisoned during the riots. Despite this relatively restrained response, fresh turmoil erupted last month. China's press printed reports of official grumbling about the folly of restraint. If patience and understanding brought only more unrest, some argued, it was now time to crack heads. Cracking heads cannot root out deep-seated Tibetan unhappiness. Nor can China continue pretending that it is simply the agitation of exiles like the Dalai Lama that brings thousands to Tibetan streets to risk their lives. Nor can the decadence and feudalism of past Tibetan rule justify China's failure to acknowledge the aspirations of today's Tibetans for self-government. To find lasting solutions, China will have to hear the Tibetans out. This week's gesture toward the Dalai Lama took a small step in that direction. He called the offer nothing new - though previous ones had stipulated a return to Beijing, never Tibet. Still, more significantly, he too has been sounding conciliatory, offering peace plans and pressing for talks. There can indeed, as the Dalai Lama says, be ''a middle way.'' That would be something between harsh, near-colonial Chinese rule and a bloody, hopeless struggle for independence. Only by sitting down to talk together can the Chinese and the Tibetans hope to find that better way.

1323-> Police Chief in Dallas Resigns After Months of Controversy
Police Chief Billy Prince, under fire from top city officials for criticizing City Council members and opposing changes in the Police Department, has resigned. The Chief, in an announcement Tuesday, said he was stepping down immediately. The City Manager, Richard Knight, appointed the first assistant police chief, Louie C. Caudell, as interim chief, according to a police spokeswoman, Sgt. Carol Eberhardt. ''I don't want to be a lame-duck leader or a lame-duck chief,'' Mr. Prince said. He added that he would serve in an advisory role through the summer. His resignation comes at a time of tension between the police and blacks and other minority groups. Critics of the police, particularly the two black members of the City Council, have assailed the department for a number of shootings of blacks by police officers in recent years. Calls for Dismissal Made The Chief had been caught between the demands of a majority of the City Council, including Mayor Annette Strauss, who want more police accountability, and the police union, which opposes greater control. Also, the City Council put an affirmative action hiring plan into effect earlier this year in response to charges that the department did not reflect the city's racial makeup. Non-Hispanic whites are estimated to make up less than half the population. Some black officials, including City Councilwoman Diane Ragsdale and County Commissioner John Wiley Price, have called for Chief Prince's dismissal. City Councilman Jerry Rucker, who is white, called Chief Prince a ''scapegoat for the Mayor and the City Manager'' and said he had been ''hounded out of his office by demagogues.'' Chief Prince, who led the department for six years, said he was tired of the battling between the community and his beleaguered force. Decision Made on Easter ''I made this decision, after an 11-day vacation, on Easter Sunday,'' he said at a news conference. ''I woke up Easter Sunday and just didn't feel good about returning. I told my wife then, 'I think it's time for me to go.' '' It was not one event that led to his decision, he said, but added: ''I would not be totally truthful if I said I liked the atmosphere we've been working under. It's very trying and it wears you down.'' He said that he was not forced out of the $87,000-a-year job, and that he would now concentrate on business interests. ''I'm 45 years old, and I feel I'm at a part of my life when, if I'm going to change, now's the time to do it,'' he said. The Chief, a 24-year Dallas police veteran, had discussed resigning with Mr. Knight and others several times in the last few weeks, officials said. Comments About Slaying He had been at odds with the City Council since late last year, when Mr. Knight rebuked him for lobbying against changes in the department that were recommended by Mrs. Strauss' Advisory Committee on Crime. The aftermath of the slaying of a police officer by a vagrant in which some witnesses said a handful of onlookers encouraged the vagrant to shoot put the Chief on a collision course with the city's elected leadership. Chief Prince said some City Council members shared the responsibility for the officer's death because they had created an atmosphere of hostility toward the police. Mrs. Strauss asked him to retract his statements, which she said had heightened racial tensions, but he refused to back down.

1324-> Music: Noted in Brief; Mozart and Schubert Heard at the Frick
The Coull String Quartet, a British ensemble, made its New York debut Sunday afternoon at the Frick Collection. Formed in 1974 and named for its first violinist, Roger Coull (the other players are Philip Gallaway, violinist; David Curtis, violist, and John Todd, cellist), the group produces a bright, robust sound and plays with a stylistic command that matches its exuberance. Its program included a brisk rendering of the Mozart ''Hunt'' Quartet, in which the players tapped the sense of raw power that lies beneath Mozart's elegant surfaces, and Schubert's Quartet in A minor (D. 804), which was played with a steamy intensity that added an edge to the music's essentially lyrical impulses. The highlight of the afternoon, though, was Robert Simpson's String Quartet No. 11, a spellbinding work in four connected movements, composed for the Coull quartet in 1984. Clearly written with the group's strengths in mind, the work has an acerbic edge, a propulsive rhythmic sense and, in the quick first and third movements, a brash and almost barbaric energy. The slow movements, alternately introspective and eerie, are no less gripping, and the ensemble brought to the work what seemed an ideal blend of adrenaline and concentration.

1325-> Ethiopia, Pressing War on Rebels, Bars Aid Workers in Drought Area
The Ethiopian Government today ordered all foreign relief workers to immediately leave the drought-stricken provinces of Eritrea and Tigre because of its escalating war against rebels. Humanitarian agencies in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital, said the decision would further disrupt relief efforts, already severely crippled by the mounting conflict in the north, to provide emergency supplies to the more than three million Eritreans and Tigreans who face famine. They said they hoped that local employees could continue some work and that the latest development was being discussed with the Soviet-backed Government of Ethiopia. Measure Is Called Temporary The governmental Relief and Rehabilitation Commission, which coordinates relief activities, said in a statement that the move was being taken to avoid ''security risks'' to foreigners working in the provinces. It asked foreign relief agencies to turn over their operations to the commission. ''Under the circumstances, the R.R.C. has recalled expatriate relief workers from the troubled zone temporarily until the area is cleared of bandits and tranquillity is restored to the life of the civilian population in that area,'' the statement said. The decision to withdraw relief personnel was made less than a week after President Mengistu Haile Mariam, in a rare acknowledgment of mounting rebel activity, said the protracted insurgencies in the north were threatening the sovereignty of his impoverished country. Although the Government has not provided details of the military conflict, it has announced a nationwide mobilization of the army to carry out a counteroffensive against the rebels. Troops Head North Relief officials said today that some of their workers in the province of Wallo saw at least a dozen buses crowded with Ethiopian troops heading north toward Tigre. One official said the region was being ''shut up as tight as a drum.'' The move also followed an announcement this week by Somalia and Ethiopia, longtime adversaries, to restore diplomatic relations and withdraw troops from their border. Western diplomats said Ethiopia appeared to have agreed to ease tensions with its neighbor so as to redeploy thousands of security forces to the northern region. Rebels in both Eritrea and Tigre have claimed major successes against Marxist Ethiopia in recent week, including the capture of strategically important towns, the killing of thousands of Ethiopian troops and the capture of Soviet military advisers. The Eritrean People's Liberation Front has been fighting the Government for 27 years, while the Tigre People's Liberation Front has been engaged in an insurgency for 13 years. ''In recent weeks emergency relief aid distribution by the R.R.C. as well as the international donor organizations had been disrupted by terrorists engaged in destructive activities against the unity, integrity and freedom of Ethiopia,'' the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission said in its statement. Relief workers say that as many as seven million Ethiopians face the prospect of a famine that could rival the calamity of 1984 and 1985. Eritrea and Tigre are the worst affected areas in the country. But humanitarian agencies say that food distribution to outlying towns and villages in the north has been all but halted by the military conflict and the Government's increasing restrictions on the movement of trucks carrying food and supplies. David Morton, director of operations in Addis Ababa for the World Food Program, said in a telephone interview that the distribution of relief supplies had been severely affected by the surge in fighting. ''The food stocks at the port and main towns are quite healthy,'' said Mr. Morton.''But they are very low and, in fact, may have run out in most of the distribution points in other parts of the region.'' The New York-based Eritrean Relief Committee said recently that the intensifying military conflict and control of more territory by the rebels would have a ''significant impact'' on relief activities throughout the province. Calling the Ethiopian Army the ''aggressor against Eritrean civilians,'' the relief group said in a statement that tens of thousands more drought victims now live in areas controlled by the rebels. The committee's sister agency is the Eritrean Relief Association, which is the only relief agency working in the rebel-held territory of Eritrea and channels food aid from the Sudan to the Eritrean countryside. The committee said that the association's supplies were inadequate to meet the needs of drought victims and that local farmers had harvested enough food to support the dependent population for less than a month. It said donors had pledged about 64,000 tons of relief food, only 33 percent of the minimum needed to prevent famine.

1326-> ESSAY; The European Pillar
Last month, NATO held its last meeting. The Brussels session wasn't officially the final meeting - its joint communique was poignantly labeled ''A Time for Reaffirmation'' - but future confabulations cannot hide the fact that NATO is now a paper alliance. Its raison d'etre was fear of a Soviet invasion of Europe, and its essence was the guarantee that the United States would treat an attack upon Amsterdam as an attack upon Chicago. NATO's military strategy was to use conventional weapons to delay the Soviet movement westward, then to turn to battlefield nuclear artillery and missiles, and when those defenses failed, to expect the United States to launch a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union. None of that is present-day realthink. Despite the presence of 18,000 Soviet tanks and enough weaponry to decimate the Continent, few in Europe fear a Soviet invasion. Even fewer believe that America would launch a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union, inviting the leveling of American cities, to punish the Russians for rolling into Europe. That realization turns our ''nuclear umbrella'' into a parasol. ''Today the fear of nuclear weapons is greater than the fear of the Soviets,'' Richard Nixon, ever the realist, told the Washington Times editor, Arnaud de Borchgrave, last week. ''That's what made the better-Red-than-dead slogan a tempting option for some -and when you're facing death, it's probably a close call.'' The Russians believed Mr. Nixon was mean enough to push the button if they invaded Europe; nobody believes the next U.S. President will be that unpredictable, and all know that such a policy would have no popular support. The recent signing of the I.N.F. treaty, despite the forced smiles of European leaders, marked the military parting of the two ends of the North Atlantic alliance. A decade ago, when Mr. Brezhnev tried to dominate Europe with new midrange missiles, the Europeans and Americans countered with what turned out to be NATO's finest hour: despite the cries of our fearful freezeniks (including Jesse Jackson, who refuses to this day to admit his profound mistake) we placed an equal force of U.S. missiles in Europe to call the Soviet bluff. Mr. Gorbachev wisely backed off, signing a treaty that removes his cities from the threat of U.S. medium-range missiles. This move toward fewer nuclear weapons brought hosannas from around the world but now reminds Europeans that the defense of Europe must be done the expensive way - raising and equipping armies by themselves. Such military cooperation between Western European powers is called ''the European pillar.'' The U.S. used to worry about side deals within the Atlantic alliance; now Mr. Reagan welcomes the pillar, but cannot even whisper the reason: because it will be needed to prop up the region when we begin to take our 300,000 troops out. And ready or not, the 41st President will pull them out in the 1990's. The presence of a tripwire - the potential of enough U.S. casualties to justify our triggering a nuclear strike - is no longer in the U.S. national interest. The delay that their fighting would cause would not give the world time to stop the invasion; on the contrary, the ensuing brouhaha would reassure the invaders that U.S. public opinion was against heavy nuclear response. If so, that knocks into a cocked hat the whole notion of the use of a conventional force capable of delaying the Russians for three or four weeks. The delaying force would merely expose our strategic weakness of will (Edward Luttwak, this century's Clausewitz, is writing a book with this thesis). Only a conventional army capable of resisting and rolling back the Soviet in-vaders has any strategic value, and its cost is a burden Europeans are unwilling to assume. So what should be the successor to ''flexible response,'' which was the rhetorical but not strategic successor to ''massive retaliation''? I cannot vouchsafe that to you in the remaining two paragraphs (sure I could, but do not want to louse up my visa application to the Moscow summit meeting), but its basis goes beyond dickering for an asymmetrical reduction of forces. A superpower must act globally. Europe is one region, its component powers thinking only regionally in face of a worldwide threat. Our interest is to cooperate with the European region in resisting long-term Soviet expansion, but also to support and extend freedom in other regions like Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Central America. For Europe, today's pillar talk is healthy if it leads to regional self-reliance; for America, worldwide action to defend freedom requires a new freedom of action.

1327-> Montreal Journal; In Plain English, Printer's Sign Is a Cause Celebre
Allan Singer has paid a price for his principles, and whether that makes him courageous or stubborn could get you a good argument in many of this city's bistros and bars. So far, Mr. Singer has appeared in court 45 times and spent $120,000 of his own and his supporters' money defending his right to hang a battered sign outside his stationery store in this city's Notre-Dame-de-Grace district. The sign was simple, an ocher-colored board proclaiming ''Allan Singer Ltd., Printers and Stationers,'' but it contravened a 12-year-old law that made it an offense to hang a sign in anything but French in Quebec, where 83 percent of the 6.5 million people are French-speaking. Mr. Singer could have settled the matter in 1978 by paying a $25 fine and hauling down the sign. But the stationer, now 76 years old, stuck with his legal battle - and with his sign, until faltering business caused him to move his business two years ago, and the billboard was too big to hang on the railings outside - all the way to the Canadian Supreme Court. Argument on the case was heard in November, and the court's ruling is expected before the justices rise for the summer. New Political Battle Feared Most legal experts expect Mr. Singer to lose on the ground that his sign was not written in English and French, Canada's two official languages. But along with the Singer ruling, the court will hand down its decision on another case heard in its November session, involving a Montreal-based retail chain, Brown Shoes Ltd., that was prosecuted because it included English alongside French on its signs. Hundreds of other cases against shopkeepers who hung out bilingual signs depend on the outcome of the Brown case. If the court finds in favor of the shoe company, as is widely expected, it could set off a bitter political battle. Language issues have been explosive here since the British defeat of the French garrison at Quebec City in 1759, and there are fears that a new struggle over the primacy of French could re-ignite the passions among French-speaking Quebecers that led to a high tide of the Quebec separatist movement in the 1970's. For the moment, Quebec appears to be as stable as at any time in years. After its landslide defeat of the separatist Parti Quebecois in the 1985 provincial election, the Liberal Party of Premier Robert Bourassa negotiated an agreement that renewed Quebec's commitment to the Canadian confederation. That deal, involving recognition of Quebec as a ''distinct society'' in the Constitution, has yet to receive the assent of several provinces, but opinion polls show that it has the strong support of Quebec's French-speaking majority. Mr. Bourassa made a pledge to the province's 800,000 English-speakers during the 1985 campaign to allow bilingual signs, but after the election he hesitated, saying that most English-speakers placed a higher priority on ''social peace'' - meaning harmony with the French-speaking majority - than on their right to post signs. 'Persecution and Bullying' When Quebec's highest court ruled 5 to 0 in favor of bilingual signs in the Brown Shoes case, in December 1986, the Premier instructed the province's lawyers to appeal the case to the Supreme Court. The decision set off a round of skirmishing among militants, who want to influence the Premier before he decides, as he is constitutionally empowered to do, whether to override the Supreme Court's eventual ruling. Mr. Singer, the stationer awaiting the Supreme Court ruling, compared the climate to the ''persecution and bullying'' by Nazi Germany that caused him to volunteer for combat service with Canadian forces in Europe during World War II. Attired in a battered pin-stripe suit, he described with indignation how provincial investigators visit the store incognito, looking for stationery items with English-only markings. ''I can spot these fellows now, when they start coming in here and sniffing around among the rubber bands and paper clips,'' he said. On the opposite side of the dispute is the powerful Quebec nationalist group, the Societe St.-Jean-Baptiste, which has been barnstorming the province warning of a betrayal of the gains won by the Parti Quebecois. Nicole Boudreau, the 38-year-old former journalist who heads the society, aims to collect 101,000 signatures on a petition demanding that Mr. Bourassa stick by Bill 101, the 1976 law that established the primacy of French as the province's working language, as the language of instruction for most immigrant children - and as the only language to be used on signs. Mrs. Boudreau depicted French language and culture as being at inescapable risk - ''like a sugar cube beside a coffee pot'' - because of Quebec's position as the only predominantly French-speaking jurisdiction in a continent with 270 million English-speakers. The electoral defeat of the Parti Quebecois had fostered a climate of lethargy on the language issue among the province's ''most dynamic elements'' that could lead to the ''Louisianization of Quebec,'' she said. But at Alliance Quebec, the English-speaking lobby group that has financed many of the legal challenges to Bill 101, there is not much tolerance for the province's argument before the Supreme Court that freedom of expression for English-speakers is not reduced because they are obliged to hang out signs in French. ''You might as well say, 'You have the right to say what you want as long as you say it in Swahili,' '' said Michael O'Keefe, an Alliance official who speaks fluent French. ''What sort of freedom of expression is that?''

1328-> HEALTH; Shortage of Doctors Viewed As Likely by End of Century
The often predicted glut of physicians by the end of this century may not occur, and there may even be a shortage, say two reports in The New England Journal of Medicine. ''Most observers think that by the year 2000 there will be a considerable surplus of physicians in the United States,'' said the authors of one of the reports. But their own study suggests otherwise. ''Even under a conservative set of assumptions about the future, our study indicates little or no physician surplus is to be expected,'' the report said. Leaders of the project were Dr. William B. Schwartz of the Tufts University School of Medicine and Frank A. Sloan, professor of economics at Vanderbilt University. They estimated that 592,000 doctors would be needed by the end of this century and that about 585,000 would be available. The study also notes the increasing age of the population and assumes that there will be increases in health insurance coverage and steady increases in personal income. Medical Advances Cited The authors said there were many reasons for believing that the demand for physicians would grow substantially. Among the most important, they said, will be medical and technical advances, such as the increasing use of organ transplants, and of advanced diagnostic techniques, which are unlikely to replace existing techniques to any large degree. The authors also cited the expected increase in the number of patients suffering from AIDS. In the other report, an expert from the University of Arizona College of Medicine also predicted a shortage of physicians within the next 30 years. ''General population growth, the aging of the baby boom generation, declining enrollments in medical schools, the shrinking labor pool, lower physician productivity and the increasing unattractiveness of medicine as compared with other professions suggest that we may be headed for another shortage of physicians in the next 30 years,'' said the Arizona expert, Ernest P. Schloss.

1331-> Mcorp Expects $58.2 Million Loss in First Quarter
Mcorp, the second-largest bank holding company in Texas, said today that it expected a $58.2 million loss for the first quarter, nearly as much as its $59.5 million loss in the last quarter of 1987. Analysts said it was a sign that Mcorp's loan problems had not become as severe as those at other major financial institutions in Texas. The First Republicbank Corporation estimated Tuesday that it would lose $1.5 billion in the quarter, with most of the problems concentrated in real estate loans. ''I'm quite encouraged,'' said Robert Albertson, a bank analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Company in New York. Once the bank's problem loans clearly have peaked, Mcorp would be in a position to raise money by selling a block of the bad loans at a discount, he said. The company released the first-quarter projection to quiet speculation that, like First Republicbank, it too would report a big loss for the quarter, said George A. McCane, a spokesman. The final figures are due next week, he said. Federal Assistance Not Needed Mcorp is the only one among the state's six largest banking organizations that has said publicly that it can outlast its loan troubles without requiring outside capital either through merger or Federal assistance. Mcorp, which has $20 billion in assets, had a $10.2 million loss in the first quarter of 1987. It reported a $258.3 million loss for all of 1987, the worst year in its history. At the end of December, Mcorp had $955 million in problem real estate loans, or about 60 percent of its total nonperforming assets. The projected loss for the first quarter would cut Mcorp's equity to $788 million. The company's stock price was unchanged at $2.625 today on the New York Stock Exchange. Gene H. Bishop, chairman and chief executive, has maintained since October that problem loans at Mcorp's 60 banks across Texas have peaked. Mr. McCane said today that problem loans are expected to decline at some point before the end of 1988. The loans were essentially flat during the first quarter, according to the preliminary figures. The company said total foreclosed property and loans with payments at least 90 days past due were $1.62 billion at the end of March, compared with $1.59 billion at the end of December. Virtually all of Mcorp's estimated loss resulted from adding $57 million from revenues to the loss reserve. Charge-offs for uncollectible loans totaled $57 million in the quarter. Thus the loss reserve was projected as unchanged from the end of December, at $401 million. Loans to Other Banks Mcorp's funding remains so strong that it is lending money to other banks in overnight loans, said Mr. Albertson of Goldman, Sachs. ''From what we see, the company has a good chance of completing a restructuring plan that should get them in the black soon,'' he said. The results do not include the $190 million in profits that Mcorp expects from the sale of its 80 percent stake in Mtech, a subsidiary specializing in bank transactions. The added capital would increase Mcorp's ability to outlast future losses. The sale of Mtech to the Electronics Data Systems Corporation, for $281 million in cash and notes, was announced in early March and is expected to be completed this month. ''They appear to be holding the line, but they are doing so under tremendously difficult circumstances,'' said James J. McDermott, head of research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, in New York. He said that in the wake of First Republicbank's staggering losses, ''caution is the watchword.''

In its first acquisition move into the United States, Gold Greenlees Trott, a publicly held London-based agency, has negotiated the purchase of Babbit & Reiman Advertising, Atlanta, for $2.5 million down and additional payouts based on profits during the next four or five years. Foreign companies have previously showed no particular interest in purely regional agencies, but in an interview yesterday Michael Greenlees, chairman of the $200 million British shop, said he particularly fancied such agencies and would continue to regard them as acquisition targets. The American agency, billing about $38 million, was started two years ago by two former New York admen, Joel Babbit, 34, and Joey Reiman, 35. They will continue to operate the agency.

1335-> Marines Fire on Panama 'Intruders'
United States military spokesmen said today that 100 marines had been drawn into a two-hour night firefight with ''40 to 50 unauthorized personnel'' in military uniforms who had been spotted on the grounds of an American fuel depot. The incident, which was said to have begun with the detection of the intruders at dusk on Tuesday, filled the night air with the din of small-arms and mortar fire and led American authorities to seal off nearby Howard Air Base and a section of the Pan-American Highway for hours for what an official called ''safety's sake.'' Col. Ronald Sconyers, chief spokesman at United States Southern Command headquarters here, said he could ''neither confirm nor deny'' that the purported intruders were soldiers under the command of Panama's military leader, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. 'There Was Gunfire' The colonel said that there were no casualties on either side, and acknowledged under questioning at a news conference that military investigators had yet to find physical evidence to prove that the marines had not mistaken their own gunfire for an attack. ''When they felt they were being fired upon, they returned the fire,'' Colonel Sconyers said. Asked if he could rule out the possibility that the marines were shooting at shadows, Colonel Sconyers said: ''At this point in time, we don't categorically rule anything out. But there was gunfire, there were muzzle flashes -and we have no reports of our troops in those areas.'' Tension between military personnel of the two countries has increased since the indictment of General Noriega on drug charges in the United States and the arrival in the last month of 1,900 more American troops. Washington has imposed economic sanctions to try to force the general to give up control. Tuesday's incident was the second in less than two days involving newly arrived marine sentries guarding the 800-acre Arraijan tank farm, which supplies the base three miles away. The tank farm is in southern Panama, near the Pacific coast. On Tuesday afternoon, the Pentagon announced that a 25-year-old corporal had been accidentally shot and killed by his comrades early Tuesday as they investigated an intrusion on the tank farm grounds by ''six to eight individuals,'' who a Pentagon spokesman said could be ''logically assumed'' to have been Panamanian soldiers. Panama Dismisses Reports Panamanian military officials dismissed the American accounts of both incidents. A spokesman, Martin Alberto Paz, was quoted as saying of the latest incident: ''It seems they are trying to create confusion. It's the first time that the gringos don't know who's shooting at them.'' Colonel Sconyers said that the Panama Defense Forces, as the 15,000-member Panamanian military is called, had been kept fully informed of the incident as it unfolded Tuesday night, and that senior Panamanian officers had accompanied senior American officers to the scene. General Noriega told an Austrian television interviewer this afternoon that the latest incident was ''a demonstration of the nervousness of the marines and their lack of professionalism,'' adding that he hoped they would continue ''killing each other.'' Colonel Sconyers said the intruders had worn ''dark uniforms'' and used ''professional, military-type tactics.'' He told reporters that they had apparently escaped despite two hours of ''sporadic'' fire by the marines and a subsequent hunt by helicopters. He said there had been no communication with the intruders, and that a ''cease-fire'' had come about only because of ''a unilateral decision on our part to stop - and there was no return of gunfire at that time.'' Evidence Being Gathered Colonel Sconyers said that so far, the only physical evidence of the intruders were ''regular visual and night-detection-device sightings'' by the marines, most of whom arrived in Panama from Camp Lejeune, N.C., less than a week ago. He identified the marines as members of I Company, Third Battalion, Fourth Marine Regiment. Over the last month, he said, there had been ''an increased number of sightings and observations of intruders,'' and that the group Tuesday night was identified ''as not being the normal types of people.'' Asked if shell casings or bootprints had been found, the colonel said that the only evidence was the account by the company commander, a captain he did not identify. ''There is no other physical evidence because we're gathering that evidence right now,'' Colonel Sconyers said. Asked by a reporter if he did not think it odd that in two such incidents there had been no casualties among the intruders, no arrests and no evidence that unauthorized people had entered the tank farm, Colonel Sconyers replied: ''You'll have to draw your own conclusion on that. I'm not going to speculate on that question.'' The colonel said he did not know how deeply into American-controlled territory the intruders had penetrated, how far away they were at the time their ''muzzle flashes'' were seen, or how many shots the intruders had fired. ''No one has any idea how many shots they fired,'' the colonel said. ''In a situation like that, you don't sit there and count.'' In addition to the small-arms fire, Colonel Sconyers said that the marines had fired ''20 to 30 rounds of illumination mortars and three rounds of high-explosive mortars.''

Bill Green, the hammer thrower from the United States who tested positive for drugs at the Pan American Games last year, and Luis Morales, a sprinter from Puerto Rico, have been banned from international competition for two years, track and field's governing body announced yesterday in London. Green, 27 years old, was stripped of the silver medal he won in Indianapolis after testing positive for steroid use. Lawyers representing him are disputing the drug-test procedure. The governing body, the International Amateur Athletic Federation, said it had given Green permission to contest the ban before an arbitration panel. Morales, who competed at the University of Southern California and was a member of the 1984 Puerto Rican Olympic team, tested positive for drugs at the Pacific Northwest Indoor Games in Portland, Ore., on Jan. 23, a federation spokesman, Paul Fraser, said.(AP)

1340-> Van Gogh at a Discount
The Guggenheim Museum announced yesterday that after years of quiet negotiations, it had privately purchased a work by Vincent van Gogh ''at a fraction of what the same painting would bring at an auction in New York or in Paris.'' The painting, entitled ''Gardener,'' is a portrait of a young peasant done in 1889, the year before the artist's death, when he was living in St.-Remy, France. The museum bought the work from a European dealer, Ernst Beyeler, but it declined to specify the price. ''I was keen to get it,'' the director of the Guggenheim Museum, Thomas M. Messer, said yesterday. ''A fraction is a lot of money, but it's still a fraction.'' David Nash, director of fine arts at Sotheby's in New York City, said yesterday that the work could easily have brought ''in excess of $20 million'' at auction. The painting has been in private hands in Italy since the early 20th century, and Italian law forbids the export of such works. The museum will therefore be able to show the portrait only at its sister institution, the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, on the Grand Canal in Venice. By law, the Italian Government also has 60 days in which to raise the money to buy the painting itself.

1343-> Critic's Notebook; Great Evil Embodied In a Man
The cinema literature of the Holocaust has again been enriched by Marcel Ophuls, whose ''Sorrow and the Pity'' still points the way for anyone who would attempt to comprehend the subject on film. ''Hotel Terminus - the Life and Times of Klaus Barbie'' is another monumental Ophuls work that, in 4 hours and 27 minutes, examines the career of the Nazi officer who was convicted of war crimes in a trial at Lyons just one year ago. Though the film's subject is a single individual, ''Hotel Terminus'' is no less all-embracing than ''The Sorrow and the Pity,'' employing the same juxtaposition of interviews, reflections, recollections and newsreel footage. Associates, childhood friends and victims remember Mr. Barbie as a fine officer, a scholar or a modern-day Marquis de Sade, while the film audience is left to deal with an enigma. As in ''The Sorrow and the Pity,'' the scope of the new film is so broad and so complex that ''Hotel Terminus'' emerges ultimately not as a study of one person, place or event, but as a contemplation of the human condition. Though it is journalism, it has the resonances of the sort of great fiction that somehow applies to experiences far beyond its subject. ''Hotel Terminus'' gives importance and stature to the current Cannes Film Festival, where it was shown out of competition late this afternoon with one 10-minute intermission. During the intermission, a woman in the audience became hysterical and began berating everyone around her for not, it seemed, sharing her concentration camp memories. One young man told her, in effect, to shut up, saying that, after all, she shouldn't blame succeeding generations for the crimes of her generation. The exchange eventually involved other members of the audience and was calmed only when the film resumed. By chance, ''Hotel Terminus'' was shown on the same day that a West German film, Thomas Brasch's ''Welcome to Germany,'' was shown in competition in the festival's main section. The coincidence is eerie, and not at all to the advantage of ''Welcome to Germany,'' though the Brasch film appeared to be popular with the audience. ''Welcome to Germany,'' which has a fashionably fractured narrative style, is about a fidgety, abrasive American television director (played in a good, strong performance by Tony Curtis) who returns to his native Germany to make a film to exorcise a terrible (secret) guilt. As a young man, he was one of a small group of concentration camp inmates who agreed to appear in an anti-Semitic Nazi film in return for the promise of freedom in Switzerland. Only he survived. Like so many European directors, Mr. Brasch is fascinated by the possible confusions between the worlds of film and reality, which is not a problem faced by most people, and not even by most film makers except in this kind of fiction. One member of the audience at this morning's screening suggested to me that ''Welcome to Germany'' is really about the impossibility of comprehending the Holocaust in fiction. ''Hotel Terminus'' demonstrates the opposite. Though Mr. Ophuls's film is about actual people, places and events, the film uses them with the freedom and imagination not often found outside the best fiction. There still seems to be no clear-cut favorite among the 22 films competing for the festival's top prize, which will be announced next Monday night. The advance publicity for ''King of the Children,'' from China, proved unreliable. It's a prettily photographed, rural Chinese Mr. Chips. Audiences appeared to like Poland's ''Thou Shalt Not Kill,'' directed by Krzysztof Kieslowski, whose ''Camera Buff'' was released in the United States several years ago. It's an extremely dour, understated ''Crime and Punishment'' set in a contemporary society where, the film seems to feel, life is as much a punishment as being hanged by the neck until dead. A possible long-shot winner is Fernando Solanis's Argentine epic, ''Le Sud.'' Mr. Solanis is best known in America for his quasi-Peronist documentary ''The Hour of the Furnaces'' and, more recently, for ''Tangos, the Exile of Gardel.'' ''Le Sud'' (''The South'') is a beautifully stylized film using conventional narrative, music and dance to tell the story of a political prisoner who tries to pick up his life after the end of the Argentine military dictorship in 1983. Though it's impossible to know what's going on in the minds of the members of the jury, it was clear that local audiences were not as high on Paul Schrader's ''Patty Hearst'' as some members of the American press. Natasha Richardson gives a superlative performance in the title role, that of the 19-year-old publishing heiress who was kidnapped and brainwashed by a small, lethal but almost comic band of political terrorists. Mr. Schrader and Nicholas Kazan, the screenwriter, never attempt to explain Miss Hearst. The result is not your usual television docudrama. ''Patty Hearst'' is as chilly and disturbing as a nouveau roman that requires its readers to make their own connections. After the screening here, Mr. Schrader seemed defensive when some reporters suggested that he had made the members of the Symbionese Liberation Army look like comic book characters and had been overly sympathetic to Miss Hearst, whose book served as the basis of the film. ''I don't want to become some sort of Norman Podhoretz of movies,'' he said, starting off with ''Blue Collar,'' which is about auto workers in Detroit, and winding up glorifying the rich. He needn't worry. ''Patty Hearst'' is an exceptionally good and provocative work. Robert Redford came in Sunday for the out-of-competition screening of his ''Milagro Beanfield War,'' stopping off en route from Moscow, which wants to buy some of his films, back to the States. At his press conference, most of the questions were about his domestic affairs. Clint Eastwood, the only American actor more popular in France than Mr. Redford, arrives here Saturday for the showing of ''Bird,'' which he directed. Every Cannes Film Festival produces one joke that is repeated from the first day to the last. This year's is about the Egyptian princess who finds a baby floating on the Nile and takes it home to show the Pharaoh, her father. ''That,'' says the Pharaoh, ''is the ugliest child I have ever seen.'' Replies the princess, more or less agreeing, ''But he looked beautiful in the rushes.'' Maybe you have to be here.

1344-> Teen-Agers Invade the Kitchen; Not Even Shopping Is Safe
ONCE or twice a week, 15-year-old Jenna Bateman of Pittsburgh makes dinner for her family because her parents arrive home from work too late or too tired to cook. ''Sometimes after a long day, I don't feel like doing it either,'' Miss Bateman said. ''But it doesn't usually bother me.'' Miss Bateman said she enjoys cooking, unlike many of her friends, who just stick frozen food in the microwave oven. ''They want to make it easy,'' she said. ''Kids are always in a rush.'' Indeed, many young people are so accustomed to using the microwave oven that they see few advantages to traditional slow-cooking appliances. But whether they aim for speed or strive for culinary delights, one thing is clear: teen-agers are preparing more meals and shopping for groceries more often than they did in the past, mainly because their mothers are now working and simply do not have time. ''Teens are having to take a primary responsibility for grocery shopping and preparing meals,'' said Peter Zollo, executive vice president of Teenage Research Unlimited, a market research company in Lake Forest, Ill. In a national survey of 2,200 teen-agers done by mail last June and July, his company found that 80 percent said they had made a meal for themselves in the previous week, compared with only 64 percent in 1984. The survey had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points. Several nationwide surveys conducted by market research firms and food companies also show that teen-agers are doing more grocery shopping, which is vividly reflected in the dollars that parents provide for trips to the supermarket. According to the Rand Youth Poll in New York, which interviews about 2,400 teen-agers every year, young people received $27.4 billion to shop for food for their families last year, 20 percent more than the year before. Teen-agers today do not seem to be intimidated by the kitchen, maybe because they have grown up cooking for themselves more than prior generations. Suzanna Markstein, a 16-year-old New Yorker, makes her own dinner about once a week. ''It's just something you can do,'' she said. ''All my friends can cook something.'' While some teen-agers cook because there is no adult at home, others become interested in food as they develop their own tastes. For example, Cara Sullivan, 16, does not like meat, so while her family eats one meal, she sometimes prepares her own. ''My favorite thing is broccoli, uncooked, with salad dressing,'' she said. Selina Guber, a psychologist who is president of Children's Market Research Inc. in New York, a market research firm, considers the change a positive one. ''The kids feel they can take care of themselves at an earlier age than they used to,'' she said. ''I think it makes life a little bit easier all around.'' Helen Gustafson, who works as a hostess in a Berkeley, Calif., restaurant, relied on her two children when they were 9 and 13 years old to help make meals so that they would be ready when she arrived home. Mrs. Gustafson, who used that experience to write a cookbook for children, ''Dinner's Ready Mom'' (Ten Speed Press/ Celestial Arts, 1986), also tested her ideas and recipes by talking with 100 fourth graders in Berkeley, Calif., and with some of their parents. She said that cooking ''gives kids a chance to be useful and to be acknowledged.'' Adults who are accustomed to controlling the kitchen, however, might find it difficult to share their turf. Her research suggested that while upper-income and lower-income parents seem to have no trouble letting their children in the kitchen, middle-income parents resist. ''They feel guilty about letting their kids do this,'' she said. ''They feel morally wrong.'' Wrong or right, many overworked parents have to ask their children for help. As food and equipment companies recognize this, they are starting to study and respond to teen-agers' interests. In a survey that the Campbell Soup Company sent in November 1986 to a national sample of teen-agers, 411 of them listed their favorite foods. The top three among girls were homemade cookies, french fries and pizza; boys chose homemade cookies, ice cream and french fries. At dinner, the favorite entree for both sexes was restaurant pizza. Because of the growing purchasing power of young people, there will probably be more products geared to their needs. This month, for instance, Hasbro Inc. will sell a new line of cookware for children as young as 5; the cookware can be used safely in microwave ovens. The company said its research showed that parents will let children use microwave ovens at a very young age because the ovens have no open heat source; the parents thus consider them safer than conventional ovens. But in most of the recipes, Hasbro recommends that adults supervise young children. In general, researchers say, youngsters, like their parents, prefer foods that can be prepared quickly and easily. When they cook what they consider to be a homemade meal, they often use commercially prepared ingredients like canned sauces and mixes. Jim Hurley, 16, of Colorado Springs, said he bakes cookies from a mix because he doesn't know how to make them from scratch. ''I don't really know how to make food myself,'' he said. ''I just like to eat it.'' In a recent home economics class at John F. Kennedy High School in the Bronx, Nathaly Ramirez made fried rice. ''I need to learn how to cook,'' she said, ''and my mother doesn't have any patience with me.'' Her teacher, Ellen Kaplan, said high school students are doing more of the family's food preparation than before, but ''they don't really have any skills.'' They may not need that many skills. Many teen-agers, for example, are ardent fans of the microwave oven, which is now a fixture in about 70 percent of American households, according to industry figures. ''For what I cook, I like it better,'' said Richard Kozza, 13, of White Plains, who often uses the microwave oven to melt cheese on a bagel. Kathy Watanabe of Rye Brook, N.Y., who is 12, relies on the microwave oven to make a daily snack of hot cocoa or ''whatever is in the freezer,'' she said. Miss Watanabe is allowed to use the stove, but she said she could think of nothing she would want to cook on it. ''I don't really use it,'' she said. In Tulsa, Okla., 17-year-old Missy Davis said she often uses the microwave oven to heat a Stouffer's Lean Cuisine meal or a frozen pizza. ''Basically, I just stick to the frozen foods when I have to cook for myself,'' she said. ''It's just much easier, and it's instant gratification.'' It is hard to say whether these teen-agers will develop more traditional cooking styles as they get older. When Dale Rainone, 13, and Christine Ferrara, 14, were asked at a White Plains mall what kind of foods they expected to eat when they were living on their own, they responded in unison: ''Frozen things.'' They expect to keep using the microwave oven, they said, because it is easy and fast. ''I wouldn't want to be home during the week cooking,'' Miss Rainone said. ''Maybe on Sunday, or during the weekends.'' Like their parents, teen-agers report that a lack of time makes quick cooking appealing. Pamela Zients, who is 17 and lives in Chevy Chase, Md., said she likes to prepare chocolate chip cookies and graham cracker brownies, but doesn't have much opportunity to do so. ''I work 15 hours a week and go to school and play sports,'' she said. ''I don't have much time to bake or cook.'' Geoff Boyer, a high school senior in an Atlanta suburb who spends much of his time at drama practice and carrying out his duties as class president, said his mother sometimes works late at the office, his older brother is often out and his father is out of town on business, which tends to leave him fending for himself at dinner. ''We do a lot of microwave-type food,'' he said. Jennifer Hackney, 14, of Laurel Springs, N.J., sometimes makes her own dinner in the microwave oven and eats before her parents arrive home from work because she has to go to cheerleading practice. Although she favors the quick, easy foods, she said she recognizes a possible drawback: ''I like the frozen foods,'' she said, ''but things made from scratch taste better, and are better for you.'' Despite the widespread acceptance of the microwave oven, traditional appliances have not yet passed into disuse. Andrea Langford, 14, of Ardsley, N.Y., makes dinner three times a week for herself and her brother; it is usually macaroni and cheese, hamburgers or hot dogs, and she cooks it all on the stove. ''I don't like the microwave,'' she said. ''It dries things out.''

1345-> Market Place; Fund Managers Beat the Indexes
AFTER trailing the Standard & Poor's 500 index for four of the last five years, the average independent investment manager beat that index in the first quarter, and by a large margin. Helped by takeovers and stocks of the better-performing small-capitalization issues, the portfolios of the average fund manager at the independent firms gained 8.3 percent in the quarter, according to C.D.A. Investment Technologies, while the average stock mutual fund, as measured by Lipper Analytical Services, rose 7.4 percent. Meanwhile, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index climbed 5.7 percent in the period and the Dow Jones industrial average was up a mere 3.4 percent. C.D.A.'s study is not an exact measure of the managers' peformance records, but it is close. The firm calculates the returns of the managers' stock holdings starting at the beginning of the quarter. This approach assumes that none of the stocks were sold during the period. It also measures only the stock returns and does not include any short- or long-term fixed-income securities. The top-performing firm, B.M.I. Capital, which was up 27.4 percent, benefited from takeovers and the rise of small stocks, said James D. Awad, president. ''If your security analysis is working and the market is interested in your style, then you've got double leverage,'' he said. ''And we got it.'' B.M.I.'s analysts and portfolio managers, in investing their $400 million for institutions and individuals, focus on the stocks of small- and medium-capitalized companies. They look first for stocks with higher-than-average earnings growth rates and then they apply several valuation measures to find the most undervalued. During the first quarter, B.M.I. owned stocks of several companies that were the subject of takeovers or other restructurings. Among their holdings were Roper, American Standard, Western Auto, Flexivan, Triangle and York. Among the firm's largest holdings are Household International, which has moved sharply in recent days; Commercial Credit; Salomon Brothers; Polaroid and Dun & Bradstreet. In addition, the firm owns three ''beaten down'' technology stocks, Mr. Awad said. All three - Computer Consoles, Data Switch and Anacomp - sell at price/ earnings multiples lower than the average stock and are showing improved earnings gains. Mr. Awad believes that the shift in market leadership from the large stocks that make up the Dow to the smaller issues on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and those traded over-the-counter, is a real one. The stocks that make up the lowest 20 percent by captitalization on the Big Board are the cheapest and those that are in the top 20 percent are the most expensive, he said. Further, pension funds, like those of the Los Angeles police and firemen, which recently gave the firm $32 million, are beginning to pour hundreds of millions of dollars into these small-capitalization stocks. The second-best-performing money manager -which was up 27.2 percent - concentrated all of its bets on stocks of only one industry. The $175 million portfolio managed by the W.M.G. Company in Hartford is invested in shares of savings and loan institutions and regional banks. And four of the five largest holdings in the first quarter - University Savings, Citizens Financial Group, the Richmond Hill Savings Bank and the Southhold Savings Bank - were the subjects of takeovers, said William M. Griffin, the firm's founder. The firm concentrates on institutions that have excess capital and strong regional franchises as well as those that sell at discounts to their book value. Some of the largest holdings include American Society for Savings in Hartford, the Wilmington Savings Fund Society, the Crestmont Savings and Loan, the Norwich Savings Society, the F.F.B. Corporation and St. Paul Bancorp. The quarter's third-best performing manager, up 24.9 percent, was the Corinthian Capital Company. It was heavily invested in stocks of manufacturing companies that benefited from a lower dollar. In the last year, portfolio managers at the Englewood, Colo., firm have owned shares in Caterpillar, Deere, Firestone, Timken, Honeywell and Ingersoll Rand. ''We felt there would be a major secular renaissance in that sector of the economy,'' said John L. Keller, president. He describes his firm's style as contrarian with an emphasis on value. Mr. Keller believes that these manufacturing stocks, despite their strong performance, are still cheap. The firm's largest holdings now include Conrail, Caterpillar, Deere, Honeywell, 3M, Teneco and Timken. He also has almost 25 percent of his clients' funds invested in small stocks like Avatar, the C.M.I. Corporation and Western Capital, because he considers their prices low and believes they have large growth potential. The firm has almost 30 percent of its clients' $100 million set aside in short-term securities, Mr. Keller said, because of a concern that the market is vulnerable to a 15 percent decline.

1347-> MANY IN CONGRESS HAIL AFGHAN PACT
The Afghanistan settlement was praised by many members of Congress today as Secretary of State George P. Shultz prepared to leave for Geneva for the signing ceremonies. Mr. Shultz met with House and Senate members today in closed session and reportedly sought to allay the concerns of members who fear that the Geneva agreement will lead to a one-sided cutoff in military assistance to the Afghan guerrillas. The Secretary was said to have repeated Administration assurances that Washington would continue to aid the Afghan rebels as long as Moscow sent arms to the Kabul regime. Officials have stressed that the United States would be increasing the quantity and quality of arms sent to the guerrillas. The general tone of the comments in Congress today contrasted sharply with the concerns expressed by many members two months ago as the pace of the negotiations quickened. In February, the Senate approved a resolution that warned the Administration not to cut off aid to the guerrillas unless it was ''absolutely clear that the Soviets have terminated their military occupation'' of Afghanistan. The measure passed by a vote of 77 to 0. Many Change Their Minds But today, many who voted for that measure praised the new accords. ''We have achieved our principal objective, a Soviet withdrawal,'' said Claiborne Pell, the Rhode Island Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and was a co-sponsor of the February resolution. ''Critics of this accord would apparently prefer the Soviets to remain and the Afghans to continue to die until there is a perfect agreement.'' The Senate majority leader, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, who has been skeptical of the pact, said, ''I am ready to give this agreement a chance.'' House members also defended the settlement. ''I don't see this agreement as a sell out by the United States of the resistance forces - absolutely not,'' said Dante B. Fascell, a Florida Democrat who is chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Representative Charles Wilson, a Texas Democrat who has been a supporter of the guerrillas, also strongly endorsed the accord. He said it was an ''ignominious defeat for the Russians'' and represented a better outcome than many would have predicted. Some Still Object But a small group of members continued to voice strong objections. Senator Gordon J. Humphrey, Republican of New Hampshire, said: ''After questioning Secretary Shultz, my fears have not subsided. In fact, I am astounded that a grown Secretary of State intends to sign such a childishly dishonest agreement.'' The United States will not actually sign the accords but will act with the Soviet Union as ''guarantors'' of them. Mr. Humphrey's office said a letter signed by 15 senators and delivered today to President Reagan criticized the agreement and insisted that all understandings between Washington and Moscow be made public. That was a reference to an exchange of letters between Mr. Shultz and Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the Soviet Foreign Minister, about an understanding under which Washington will continue to supply the guerrillas as long as Moscow provides arms to Kabul. The principal concern of the critics is what they say is an apparent contradition between the terms of the Geneva accords, under which Pakistan and Afghanistan pledge ''noninterference'' in each other's internal affairs, and the American-Soviet side agreement. In proposing the side agreement in his letter, Mr. Shultz did not explicitly say the assistance would be sent through Pakistan but said Pakistan approved of the American proposal. SHEVARDNADZE CITES SUCCESS GENEVA, April 13 - Foreign Minister Shevardnadze, arriving here for the Afghan ceremonies, portrayed them today as a success for Mikhail S. Gorbachev's foreign policy. Meeting reporters at the airport, Mr. Shevardnadze did not mention plans to withdraw troops from Afghanistan. He called the settlement ''historic'' and quoted Mr. Gorbachev as comparing it in importance to the American-Soviet agreement banning land-based intermediate-range nuclear forces. ''Three hours ago I was at a meeting between Mr. Gorbachev and members of the American business community in Moscow,'' he said. ''Mr. Gorbachev compared the Afghan text to the historic intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty. The Geneva document is of similar historical importance.'' In a written statement distributed when he arrived, the Foreign Minister said the agreement was ''the first example of a peaceful resolution of a regional conflict on the basis of the principle of new political thinking,'' a phrase used by the Soviet leadership to describe its approach to foreign policy. In Moscow today, a Soviet spokesman also presented the agreement as a victory for Moscow, saying that under it Pakistan would be obliged to dismantle guerrilla bases and training camps in its territory within 30 days. But Pakistani officials here deny this. They point out that Pakistan acknowledges only having Afghan refugee camps on its territory and say these will be closed when the Russians create conditions in Afghanistan that allow the refugees to return home.

1348-> BOXING NOTEBOOK; Experience Profits a Promoter
In 1984, when Evander Holyfield, the Olympic bronze medalist, was considering which promoter he would fight for as a professional, he turned down an offer from Josephine Abercrombie's Houston Boxing Association, even though the association offered more money than he got from the promoter he chose, Dan Duva. Holyfield's hesitance about signing with Abercrombie's organization was caused, he said, by the association's lack of a proven record of taking fighters to fame and fortune. Abercrombie, a Houston socialite and venture capitalist, had begun promoting fights in 1983. Those early days were, by her own admission, difficult. ''To put it bluntly,'' she said recently, ''I didn't know what I was doing. My first time out, I got totally outmaneuvered. I paid out a lot of money and didn't get much fight for it.'' Abercrombie lost money in that first show and continued to show losses as she struggled to understand the fight business. ''One of the things I thought you could do is run it like a business and count on certain things happening,'' she said. ''I used to think - and how naive I was - that if you sign a fight, you have the fight.'' Abercrombie would soon get a crash course in how matches unravel: from real or pretended injuries to better opportunities arising elsewhere. ''Those kinds of things,'' she said, ''I just didn't understand.'' She learned, though. In the years since, her Houston Boxing Association has acquired credibility. Abercrombie said that her monthly boxing shows in a 4,200-seat arena in Houston have begun to pay a profit. Where once she ''leaned on'' high-powered friends to buy tickets to her shows ''It's your turn to help me,'' she would tell them - she said that the fight shows that her promoter, Stan Hoffman, puts together now sell on their merits. More important, Abercrombie's association has acquired fighters who have gained ring prominence and, in the case of Frank Tate, the Internationl Boxing Federation middleweight champion, and Calvin Grove, the I.B.F. featherweight champion, world titles. (Grove was scheduled to defend his title last night against Myron Taylor in Atlantic City.) Since a promoter's profits tend to rise once champions are under contract, the success of Tate and Grove were turning points in the association's story. But Abercrombie insisted that, for her, success went beyond dollars and cents. She recalled her reaction to the fight in which Tate won the title, last October against Michael Olajide Jr. ''I never had such a feeling in my entire life,'' she said. ''It was like being on a huge, big roller coaster, or like flying, or like having chocolate mousse, which I can't eat because I'm on a diet.'' Torres May Step Down Jose Torres is considering leaving his job as the chairman of the New York State Athletic Commission to write the authorized biography of Mike Tyson. Torres said that he had been approached by two major publishers to write the book and that if he chose to take the assignment he would leave the athletic commission. Torres has been discussing a middle-range six-figure advance for the book. He said he expected to know within a month what his course would be. Torres said Tyson had given him an oral assurance that he would have his permission to write the book. New Site for Fights With its first pro boxing card this Friday, Gleason's Arena in Brooklyn becomes a new fight venue for the city. Ron Scott Stevens of Powerhouse Enterprises Inc. said his group had signed an agreement with Gleason's to stage at least 36 boxing cards over the next 45 months at the arena. Stevens, a former boxing-magazine editor and matchmaker, said that in contrast to the city's other fight organization, Madison Square Garden Boxing, which stages regular cards at the Felt Forum, Powerhouse has no boxers under promotional contracts. ''So I'll try to make the most competitive fights we can make,'' Stevens said. Gleason's Arena, Stevens said, seats 1,100 people. By early this week, he said that about 500 tickets had been sold. All seats cost $20. Headlining this Friday's card are Felix Santiago (18-1-1, 14 knockouts) vs. Brian Nitz (7-1, 7 knockouts) and Alex Stewart (12-0, 12 knockouts) vs James Berry (7-2, 6 knockouts).

1350-> BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY; A Way to Neutralize Toxic Waste Sites
Toxic waste sites are often difficult to clean up, particularly when the wastes have seeped deep into the ground. The Environmental Protection Agency, working with two private companies, recently demonstrated a technique to neutralize PCB's at a site at Hialeah, Fla., by boring holes into the ground and injecting a neutralizing chemical and cement. The technique, known as in-situ chemical fixation, involves boring overlapping holes so that all the contaminated soil is treated and then left bound up in what engineers call a cement-soil hydration reaction structure. As part of the E.P.A. program, the treated area will be monitored in coming months to determine whether the migration of the PCB's through the soil has been halted and whether they have been completely neutralized. The technology to bore the holes, known as deep soil mixing, was originally developed by the Japanese. It was used at the Hialeah site by Geo-Con Inc., a toxic waste cleanup contractor based in Pittsburgh. The neutralizing agent being tested was a proprietary substance developed by International Waste Technologies of Wichita, Kan. In the process, large augers are used to bore holes through the contaminated area and into clean soil underneath. As the hole is bored, cement and the neutralizing chemical are pumped through the hollow center of the auger and mixed with the contaminated soil. Further mixing occurs when the auger is withdrawn. The contaminated soil, the neutralizing chemicals and the cement remain behind.

1352-> Sports People; Back in the Run
Ron Brown, who won an Olympic gold medal in 1984, then played wide receiver for the Los Angeles Rams for the last four years, announced yesterday that he was quitting football to return to track. ''I have been granted amateur status by the I.A.A.F. and would like to prove I'm the fastest man in the world,'' said Brown, who is seeking to collect another gold medal at this summer's Seoul Olympics. Brown is no longer under contract with the Rams and is technically a free agent. He was a member of the gold-medal-winning Unites States 400-meter relay team in the Los Angeles Olympics. The 27-year-old sprinter, who signed with the Rams in 1984, ahs averaged 25.2 yards as a kickoff re-turner. As a receiver, he had 26 catches for 465 yards last year. (AP)

1353-> CREDIT MARKETS; More Bond Gains Called Unlikely
The recent strong rally in bond prices is unlikely to continue, most credit market analysts contend. While recent economic data hint that second-quarter growth may not be quite as robust as the rise of nearly 4 percent in the first three months of the year, there is no evidence that the somewhat slower growth is easing inflationary pressures. And rising inflation is not compatible with falling interest rates. ''There are signs of inflation pressures that will limit the dip in interest rates and ultimately re-establish bearish sentiment in financial markets,'' analysts at Salomon Brothers noted in the firm's weekly ''Comments on Credit.'' Trend Toward Higher Wages Those signs were ignored last week, as investors shrugged off big gains in commodity prices and a Labor Department report showing that hourly earnings had risen in May at a 6 percent annual rate, continuing a trend toward higher wages that surfaced in April. Instead of heeding those signals, investors chose to buy bonds, setting off the biggest rally in months. Most of the gains were recorded among longer-term maturities. By week's end, yields on the Treasury's 9 1/8 percent bonds that mature in 2018 stood at 9.04 percent, down sharply from the 9.33 percent the bond yielded at the close of business on May 27. Technical Correction Expected The big price move came as a surprise to many analysts, who had expected interest rates to continue to rise. By the end of the week, many conceded that the market had been due for a technical correction. ''The market was oversold on the anticipation that the overnight Federal funds rate was going to go to 7 1/2 percent or higher,'' said William H. Gross, managing director of the Pacific Investment Management Company, a Newport Beach, Calif., concern that manages $16 billion in fixed-income securities. ''The market took some comfort from the fact that it didn't get there,'' Mr. Gross added. ''But I don't think there is much more on the down side to go, and I certainly wouldn't be a buyer of bonds at these levels.'' At the start of the Memorial Day weekend, a number of analysts were convinced that the Federal Reserve's most recent move to tighten monetary policy was intended to push the Federal funds rate to 7 1/2 percent, and there was widespread talk of an increase in the discount rate. Fears of an increase in the discount rate proved unfounded, and the Fed's actions last week seemed to suggest that its most recent tightening was not as pronounced as many had thought. ''The Fed may not want the funds rate any higher than 7 3/8 percent, and maybe not that high,'' said William Griggs, a managing director at Griggs & Santow Inc., a financial consulting firm. ''That had a lot to do with the market's improvement, but right now I would get defensive.'' Employment Data Comforting Market participants also apparently took some solace in the fact that employment growth last month had been somewhat slower than in April. ''The report confirms expectations of a slowing from the economy's heated pace of the last few quarters,'' the Salomon Brothers analysts wrote. ''A deceleration in employment growth, along with a shorter workweek and other recent indicators, points to a 2.5 percent to 3 percent annualized gain in real gross national product.'' However, that modest reduction in growth will not do much to cool inflationary pressures. Paul L. Kasriel, a vice president and monetary economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago, said: ''The reason I have trouble buying into this rally is that industrial commodity prices continue to rise. Typically you do not get a legitimate, sustained rally in bonds until prices of commodities like copper, aluminum and cotton have peaked. That has not happened.'' Last week, the Commodity Research Bureau's futures index, a measure of commodity prices that traders love but economists distrust, jumped 5 percent to a three-year high. Analysts agreed that the rise in the index overstated the risk of inflation. But the Journal of Commerce's index of industrial prices, which many economists consider a more reliable inflation indicator, also rose, by 1 1/2 percent last week. Producer Prices Report Due The markets could receive further sobering news about inflation on Friday, when a report on May producer prices is scheduled to be released. Economists expect the report - the most important economic statistic to be released this week - will show a four-tenths to five-tenths of 1 percent rise in wholesale prices, about the same as in April. ''The producer price number probably won't be good news for the market,'' Mr. Griggs said, ''particularly if we go into the number on Friday with bond prices at close to these levels.'' Baker Approves of Fed Policy WASHINGTON, June 5 (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d said today that the Federal Reserve was doing a good job of sustaining growth while keeping prices under control. ''I think fears of inflation are vastly overblown,'' Mr. Baker said on the CBS-TV program ''Face the Nation.'' ''We're not going to see it this year. It's going to be roughly right where we forecast it. And part of that is because the Federal Reserve is pursuing appropriate policy.'' The Reagan Administration has predicted that inflation will remain steady this year, increasing in the same 4 percent range as it did last year. But interest rates have risen and financial markets have been nervous in recent weeks over inflation concerns. Statistics released by the Government last week, however, showed the economy holding steady, soothing the markets somewhat.

1354-> Two Suits Filed By 60 Families At Harlem Fire
Sixty families that suffered either deaths, displacement or injuries in the fire at the Schomburg Plaza high-rise apartment house in Harlem last year filed lawsuits yesterday in State Supreme Court in Manhattan seeking a total of $414 million in damages from the city and the building's managers. One man, Robert Jenkins, whose wife, Martha, was burned to death in the fire and who saw three of his four children leap to their deaths from their 33d floor apartment, filed a civil damage suit against the city, the Fire Department and the building's landlord seeking $58 million in damages. In the other suit, 59 other survivors of the fire on March 22, 1987, sued for $356 million. The building's owner when the fire occurred was Frawley Plaza Associates and its managers were the Split Rock Realty Company and BSR Management. A Lack of Care The suits were filed less than a week after a grand jury in Manhattan found ''widespread negligence'' in the building's construction and maintenance. The grand jury also found that the Fire Department's response to the fire at Fifth Avenue and 110th Street was ''flawed'' and ''confused.'' A total of seven people, who were trapped on the 33d and 34th floors of the building, died in the fire. A $300 million lawsuit was filed last summer by three other survivors of the fire. Harry Lipsig, the lawyer for Mr. Jenkins, said the Fire Department failed to respond to the fire quickly or effectively. ''Many persons, including the Jenkins family, frantically called 911 to report a dire emergency and were woefully and negligently assured that help was on the way,'' Mr. Lipsig said. In the other suit, Paul Dansker, the lawyer for the 59 other families, said the fire would not have happened ''on Sutton Place.'' He contended that because the fire was in Harlem ''there was a conspiracy of lack of care.'' According to the Manhattan District Attorney, the grand jury found no grounds for criminal indictments in its investigation of the fire.

1356-> With the Economic Summit, Toronto Hopes Visitors Savor Its Melting Pot
When a rusty freighter carrying 174 Indian Sikhs nudged illicitly into a rocky Nova Scotia cove last summer, one of the Sikh immigrants waded ashore, attache case in hand, and asked the first resident he met for help in summoning a taxi to Toronto, more than 1,000 miles away by road. Like more than a million Italians, Hungarians, Chinese, Indians and people from the Caribbean who have settled in Toronto since World War II, the Sikhs were lured to a city that has outgrown its image as a colorless Anglo-Saxon bastion to become one of the continent's fastest-growing and most ethnically diverse metropolises. With 2.1 million people, Toronto is also by far the safest city of its size in North America, with rates of murder, robbery and car theft comparable to what many U.S. cities experienced in the 1950's. Host of Economic Summit For three days beginning next Sunday, the city that calls itself ''the most livable big city in North America'' will be the site of the annual economic summit meeting of the seven leading industrial democracies. President Reagan and the leaders of Britain, Canada, France, West Germany, Italy and Japan will be in the city to discuss exchange rates, agricultural subsidies and the role of gold. But civic and business leaders hope that the official delegations and the 2,300 journalists and support personnel assigned to the event will discover that the city known for decades as Toronto the Good has shed much of its past dullness to become one of the most appealing modern cities anywhere. ''In the postwar era, we had lots of civility, but not a great deal of color and excitement,'' Art Eggleton, the city's 44-year-old Mayor, said last week. ''Now, we've got the excitement, without losing the civility.'' Promoting the City As he spoke, work crews were hauling new carpets and paintings into his office, which is to be used by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney for his initial meetings with each of the six other leaders. The improvements are part of a $1.5-million effort by the city and the Province of Ontario to use the summit meeting to promote Toronto around the world, particularly in its rivalry with Athens to be the host of the 1996 Summer Olympics. Some of the old Toronto staidness remains. Last week, moves to permit shopping on Sunday afternoons were defeated because of opposition from church and civic groups. Winters, too, are depressingly long and cold, with a penetrating dampness that sweeps in off Lake Ontario and drives virtually the entire monied class of the city to vacations in Florida and the Caribbean. And the boom in growth here has not come without growing pains. Toronto faces problems with traffic congestion and in providing housing that people of modest means can afford. The number of homeless people is rising, although still relatively small for a city of Toronto's size. In addition, there is the threat that businesses here will suffer if a free-trade agreement with the United States is implemented. Today, however, the city is prospering. Its success is reflected by the downtown area, which is becoming as striking architecturally as Atlanta or Chicago. Dozens of skyscrapers face the lake, and many of them are linked by a subterranean concourse with six miles of shops, cinemas and restaurants. The Blue Jays, a baseball team that is only 10 years old, drew 2.8 million people in 1987 - the best attendance record in the American League - and next season will play in a new stadium that will be the first anywhere with a fully retractable roof. 'Safe and Sound' Aspects The biggest surprise for many first-time visitors is Toronto's ''safe and sound'' character, to use the phrase of a promotional videotape put out by the city. It is a city so clean that one of the American film companies shooting here last year had a garbage crisis. One lunchtime, a city sanitation truck moved down the street where the film was being shot and removed rubbish the production crew had distributed to make the neighborhood look like New York. After an urgent telephone call, the city brought the garbage back. In a pre-summit cleanup, a crew was hired to sand-blast graffiti from the city's walls. After two weeks and a few dozen walls, the crew began running out of work. Around the 40 miles of subway that have been built since the 1950's, a passenger can move from station to station without encountering anything more sullying than discarded tickets. And along the city's showcase University Avenue, bounded by hospitals and corporate headquarters and monuments to Canada's dead in two world wars, flower beds bloom throughout the summer with hardly any vandalism. Low Crime Rates Above all, Toronto is celebrated for its low rates of crime. Last year, there were 55 murders in the metropolitan area, compared with more than 500 in Detroit, a city 200 miles away with barely half Toronto's population. The Metropolitan Toronto Police compared the 1984 crime figures for Toronto with those the Federal Bureau of Investigation provided for New York City. It found that a resident of New York City was nearly seven times more likely to be murdered that year than a resident of Toronto; nearly 10 times more likely to be robbed, and nearly 20 times more likely to have his car stolen. Mayor Eggleton said visitors from Detroit had told him one of the things that drew them to Toronto was the safe streets. ''They just love to come up here and walk the streets at night,'' he said. The city has survived the social and economic changes that have strained the fabric of big cities elsewhere. ''In the 1960s, people predicted that the social harmony here couldn't last,'' said Peter Tomlinson, the director of economic development for the city. ''But here we are 20 years later, still more multi-ethnic than we were then, and there are no signs of the social fabric being torn apart.'' Diversity of Population The city was founded in 1793, and many of its early inhabitants were loyalists who fled the American Revolution. But 58 of every 100 Toronto residents now trace their origins to countries other than Britain or France, the colonial powers of Canada. More than a fourth of the city's population is of Italian descent. But the migration that has changed the city most in recent years has been from Asia and the Caribbean. The Chinese population here has surpassed 200,000, and is growing so rapidly with new emigrants leaving Hong Kong ahead of the Chinese takeover in 1997 that the city is expected to have the largest Chinese community in North America, ahead of San Francisco, by the early 1990's. According to city estimates, the Chinese invested between $1 billion and $2 billion in real estate in Toronto in 1987. The investment has fueled the city's property boom. House prices have doubled in five years, with a 36 percent rise in 1987 alone. Although costs are still modest by Manhattan standards, a three-bedroom downtown townhouse now sells for more than $500,000, while houses in the plush Rosedale and Forest Hill areas frequently go for up to $2 million. Little Racial Strife The arrival of Caribbean immigrants has given Toronto the largest black community in Canada. But there has been little racial strife. Nor are there slums of the kind common in many big cities in the United States, because a $200-million-a-year subsidized housing policy avoids concentrating poor tenants in high-rise buildings, or in any one area of the city. And with unemployment in Toronto below 3 per cent, virtually anybody looking for work can find it. ''A ghetto is only a ghetto if you can't work your way out of it,'' said Rosanna Scotti, who until recently ran a metropolitan office for ethnic affairs. According to Miss Scotti and others, a major reason for the ethnic harmony is the very thing that has been a cause of anxiety among Canadians as a nation, the sense that theirs is a weakly defined identity, not strong enough to support a powerful nationalism. ''We've not pressed people into abandoning their traditions, or made them feel inferior because they want to keep them,'' said Mayor Eggleton. ''We've made our ethnic communities feel that they are wanted.'' Problems With Growth In recent years, rapid growth has been accompanied by strains that suggest that Toronto may not be immune to the problems of other big North American cities. Fifteen years after environmental groups forced the abandonment of new expressway construction, the headlong growth of office space in the city core - at a rate three and a half times as fast as central Manhattan - has begun to cause serious traffic jams. A more serious problem has emerged in housing. With the average price of a house at close to $190,000, and anything near the city center costing twice that, a growing backlog of families face being excluded from home ownership. The numbers of people using the city's food banks and homeless shelters and living in the streets have risen to record levels, though these are still far below those for big cities in the United States. Bob Rae, Ontario leader of the New Democratic Party, a Socialist-oriented party that has strong support in the city, has accused the Liberal provincial goverment of allowing Toronto to become ''a playground for the rich and famous, in which working families cannot afford to live, cannot afford to buy a house and cannot afford to stay.'' Others, including David Peterson, Ontario's Premier, are concerned that the city could suffer if the free-trade agreement that the Mulroney Government reached last year with the United States is approved by Parliament. Mr. Peterson, the most prominent critic of the agreement, said his government's studies indicate that many industries in the Toronto area, especially the American-owned car and truck plants, will be particularly vulnerable. Mr. Eggleton, too, worries about the future. ''There are no guarantees,'' he said. ''We know that a lot of American cities were once where we are now. It's my job to see that we learn from what happened to them.''

1360-> Books of The Times; The Stories of Medicine's Heroes
Doctors The Biography of Medicine By Sherwin B. Nuland Illustrated. 519 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $24.95. Once upon a time, if you opened a history of medicine - a popular history, at least - you knew what to expect. A pageantlike celebration of progress, a story of great men making great discoveries. Recent writers have tended to be much less upbeat. They cast a cold eye on professional legends; they insist on setting medicine in its social and economic context and emphasize broad intellectual currents and cumulative efforts rather than the exceptional genius or the path-breaking hero. By comparison, Sherwin B. Nuland's ''Doctors: The Biography of Medicine'' wears a slightly old-fashioned look, though it is none the worse for that. Indeed, many would say that it is somewhat the better. Mr. Nuland, who teaches surgery and the history of medicine at Yale, is far too sound a scholar to indulge in bland hagiography. But he is equally on guard against the more fashionable vice of skepticism for skepticism's sake. When he is impressed by something, he isn't afraid to say so, and he is impressed by both the collective achievement medicine represents and the outstanding individuals who have done so much to shape that achievement and carry it forward. As its rather awkward subtitle indicates, his ''biography of medicine'' is neither a comprehensive history nor a miscellaneous collection of portraits. It consists of 15 substantial studies of great medical innovators or pioneers - only part of the story but enough to give you a good idea (down to the 20th century, at least) of the main outlines. In the early stages, the subjects largely select themselves. Mr. Nuland begins, and it is hard to see how he could have done otherwise, with Hippocrates and Galen. Of the two, it is Hippocrates who cuts the nobler figure, partly, perhaps, because so little is known about him. Half lost in the mists of legend, he has been able to serve for nearly 2,500 years as the ideal of the devoted physician. By contrast, the personal shortcomings of Galen (who was court physician to the emperor Marcus Aurelius in the 2d century) are well documented: he was boastful, arrogant, a tireless self-promoter. Yet for posterity, it is what the two men had in common that really counts. If Hippocrates was the Father of Medicine, Galen might be called the Father of Medical Research. Hippocrates began with the assumption that there was nothing supernatural about disease, that every illness had an intelligible cause. Galen maintained that treatment ought to be based on scientific findings, and his own discoveries included such revelations as the fact that arteries contain blood and the fact that the voice originates in the larynx (and not in the heart, as Aristotle had taught and everybody supposed). In the centuries after Galen's death, his lessons hardened into dogma, and for a thousand years and more they represented an obstacle to progress rather than an incitement. It was a major turning point in the history of science when it first dawned on the great 16th-century anatomist Andreas Vesalius that Galen had never actually dissected a human body and that he no longer had to feel bound by his authority. Vesalius's masterpiece, ''De Humani Corporis Fabrica'' (''On Man's Bodily Works'') was published in 1543, when he was only 28. It was a powerful expression of the Renaissance spirit, as Mr. Nuland makes clear, in art and scholarship no less than in science. The all-important illustrations, for example, were the work of a pupil of Titian, Jan Stephan van Calcar. Mr. Nuland can be seen at his best in his chapter on Vesalius's contemporary, the French surgeon Ambroise Pare. He gives an eloquent account of the ways in which Renaissance surgery responded to the new forms of suffering created by gunpowder, and his respect for Pare's technical skills is matched by the admiration and even affection he shows for the Frenchman's enlightened attitudes, for the humanism that made him a kind of medical equivalent of Montaigne. A surgeon himself, Mr. Nuland writes with special warmth about the surgeons among his doctors, not only Pare but also such towering figures as John Hunter, the Scotsman who did so much to upgrade surgery (and dentistry) in the 18th century, and Lord Lister, the apostle of antiseptic surgery in the 19th century. It is altogether in keeping that the man he selects to represent American medicine's coming of age should be William Stewart Halsted, the first professor of surgery at Johns Hopkins. At the same time the reader is never allowed to lose sight for long of the broader scientific advances on which improvements in practice ultimately depended. William Harvey and Giovanni Morgagni are shown completing the foundation work that Vesalius began: ''the little perpetual movement called Dr. Harvey,'' as a contemporary called him, with his discovery of the circulation of the blood; Morgagni, the indefatigable collector of case histories, with his insistence that every illness has its seat in a particular organ that has gone wrong. There is an excellent account of Rudolf Virchow, the 19th-century German who succeeded in tracking down the origins of disease further still, to the diseased cell. It is only when he reaches the 20th century that the biographical approach no longer serves Mr. Nuland well. True, he provides a sympathetic extended portrait of Helen Taussig, the cardiologist who played a central role in devising the ''blue baby'' operation; but in his final chapter, a survey of transplant surgery, he gives up the attempt to focus on any one individual. And the gaps in the story start becoming more obvious: there is virtually nothing about antibiotics, for example. Twentieth-century medicine is too complex, in fact, to be reduced to a chronicle of highlights and heroic achievements. But with that proviso, ''Doctors'' can be warmly recommended. Mr. Nuland succeeds in bringing his subjects vividly to life, and he leaves you with a much better understanding of what they achieved.

1361-> Wright Expects No Fallout From Inquiry
House Speaker Jim Wright, expressing confidence that he will be cleared of charges of conflict of interests related to his financial dealings, said today that he did not expect a House inquiry to affect his chairmanship of the Democratic National Convention next month. Maintaining that he has ''done nothing illegal, nothing violative of the rules of the House,'' the Texas Democrat defended himself in two television interviews that dealt primarily with the House ethics committee's unanimous vote on Friday to investigate him. Mr. Wright, who is scheduled to preside over the convention in Atlanta July 18-21, bridled on the CBS News program ''Face the Nation'' when an interviewer asked whether he thought it was fair to the Democratic Party for him to stand as its symbol with ''this cloud over your head.'' ''There is no cloud over my head,'' Mr. Wright said. ''No sir, I don't accept that one second.'' Asked whether there was any condition under which he might give up the chairmanship, he replied, ''I don't expect to.'' 'I Have Violated No Rule' On the ABC News program ''This Week,'' Mr. Wright said he had no preference whether the investigation was conducted by the House or an independent counsel. ''I'm not going to try to tell the committee how to run its business,'' he said. ''I have violated no rule, I'm certain,'' he continued. ''I may have done some things one time and another in my career that were bad judgment, but whatever mistakes I made have not been dishonesty.'' The third-ranking Republican in the House, Dick Cheney of Wyoming, one of 74 House Republicans who had called for the inquiry, had urged on the same program that outside counsel be retained in order for the investigation to be ''credible.'' ''The country perceives correctly that Congress exempts itself from all of the requirements that we impose on the rest of this society,'' said Mr. Cheney, chairman of the Republican Conference, the organization of all House Republicans. Mr. Wright insisted that there was ''nothing wrong with the contract'' on his book, ''Reflections of a Public Man,'' from which he received a 55 percent royalty. Questions have been raised about whether campaign funds were used to pay for the publication and whether government resources were used in its preparation. Friends and Charity Mr. Wright was asked about a report in Sunday's editions of The New York Times that his friends, who were barred by law from giving him money directly, had bought the book as a contribution to his income. The Speaker acknowledged that friends had bought the book, but he added, ''Selling the book, or marketing the book was not my business, except that I attended four or five signing parties.'' Mr. Wright, who has contended that devotion to public service has deprived him of income, said at one point, ''Royalty proceeds are going to my favorite charity, Mrs. Wright and me.'' The Speaker defended using a full-time staff assistant, Matthew Cossolotto, to help him prepare the manuscript, but he challenged accounts that Mr. Cossolotto had spent 200 hours on the project. ''Matthew called me and said he had not spent 200 hours, that he had estimated, oh, 100 hours or more,'' Mr. Wright said, The House ethics manual says that Congressional pay is for ''official duties'' and not ''to perform non-official, personal or campaign activities on behalf of the members.'' Question of Motives Mr. Wright argued that the allegations were a Republican ploy to counter political mileage that Democrats may get this election year from the so-called ''sleaze factor.'' A leading target of Democrats is Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d, the subject of an independent prosecutor's investigation into appearances of financial irregularities. Asked whether he might consider stepping down as chairman of the convention, Mr. Wright turned on the questioner: ''Do you mean to suggest that one lone Republican Congressman, because he gets spurious charges against the Speaker, should be able to dictate who the Democratic convention will or will not have?'' The reference was to Mr. Wright's principal accuser, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, who filed with the ethics committee the formal complaint of ''misuse'' of the Speaker's office for personal enrichment. Common Cause, a private watchdog group, has also sought an investigation. Asked about chiefly Republican complaints that he runs the House in an almost tyrannical fashion, Mr. Wright conceded, ''Maybe I have been too high-handed in cases. I have been so intent on adoption of the legislative program.''

1362-> South Africa Gives Details of Angola Military Role
The South African military has given the first detailed account of fighting 200 miles inside Angola, breaking a long official silence on the extent of its involvement there. Gen. Jannie J. Geldenhuys, Chief of Staff of the South African Defense Force, said at a briefing here Monday that substantial reductions had been made in the South African force in Angola, which he said never numbered more than 3,000 since Pretoria sent its troops to help Jonas Savimbi's guerrilla movement fight the Marxist Government in July 1987. He added that the reduction was part of a ''tactical withdrawal'' announced by the military on Dec. 5, which he said was continuing. Pretoria has repeatedly denied assertions by the Angolan Government that 7,000 to 9,000 South African troops were helping the rebels fight the Cuban-backed Government force. South Africa says the Angolans mounted an offensive against the rebels last May. The South Africans first admitted in October that they had entered the Angolan civil war in support of Mr. Savimbi's rebels, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola. Since then, they have maintained almost total silence on the fighting, releasing only statistics on losses involving white soldiers. General Geldenhuys said that a recent flurry of diplomatic activity intended to end the war had not influenced the decision to cut back the South African contingent in Angola. Defense Force headquarters in Pretoria announced tonight that an officer had died in a skirmish with guerrillas of the South-West Africa People's Organization near the Angolan border. A second South African soldier was missing. In a document given to reporters at the Monday briefing, General Geldenhuys provided a blow-by-blow account of fierce artillery, tank and air battles between the towns of Mavinga and Cuito Cuanavale, in Cuanda Cubango Province, from last September to Feb. 25. The Johannesburg Star quoted the general as saying that South Africa had achieved its primary aim, insuring that the rebel troops were not overrun in the Angolan Government offensive. He reportedly added that Mr. Savimbi's guerrillas had occupied positions vacated by South African troops. General Geldenhuys made no reference to a statement by President P. W. Botha, who said in an interview March 8, that South African troops would not be withdrawn from Angola until the approximately 37,000 Cuban soldiers begin to leave. Academic specialists on South African military matters interpreted the briefings as confirming that South African forces had reached an impasse after failing to take Cuito Cuanavale in the face of an Angolan counterattack. General Geldenhuys also reported that 31 South African soldiers were killed and 90 hurt between July 1987 and Feb. 25. Angola has said that hundreds of South Africans died, including black South African and South-West African soldiers. Pretoria says it does not disclose details of black losses because of possible intimidation of the families of these soldiers, who serve in black battalions. General Geldenhuys also said that 4, 768 Angolans were killed in the offensive. He said that Angola had deployed about 25,000 soldiers, including 1,000 Cubans.

1365-> Contract Ruling Backs A.T.&T. On U.S. Work
A General Services Administration appeals panel ruled today that agency employees had discriminated against the American Telephone and Telegraph Company in awarding contracts for telephone switching equipment to its rivals. The Board of Contract Appeals, a group of administrative judges that hears disputes on contracts, ordered the agency to cancel four contracts it had awarded to other companies and to give them to A.T.&T. The board found that the agency, which manages the Government's property, had improperly evaluated the phone company's bid information and that the agency's director of engineering, Sureshar Lal Soni, had leaked A.T.&T.'s secret bid prices to its rivals, the regional Bell telephone companies. Today's ruling comes as the G.S.A. is about to award contracts for the Government's new $25 billion telephone network, known as FTS-2000, which is already more than a year behind schedule. Unauthorized Examination Last week, G.S.A. officials and Congressional staff members reported that secret bids for the FTS-2000 might have been examined by someone without proper authorization. Many of the agency's officials and employees who worked on the switching contracts are involved with the FTS-2000. The decision on A.T.&T. is also important because it is the first ruling on accusations that have been made for some time by critics of the G.S.A.: that the agency's bidding practices are faulty and in need of revision. At least one of the other bidders, the Pacific Telesis Group, said it would appeal the panel's finding to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The Justice Department and the G.S.A.'s inspector general are conducting a criminal investigation into the contract dispute. The ruling is a major victory for A.T.&T., which filed a protest with the Board of Contract Appeals in October, accusing the agency of applying different standards to its bid than those used to evaluate the bids of its competitors. Herb Linnen, an A.T.&T. spokesman in Washington, said that the company was pleased with the board's decision and particularly that the board dismissed as ''frivolous'' the G.S.A.'s assertion that A.T.&T. may have also received proprietary bid information from Mr. Soni. ''We remain gravely concerned about the larger implications of the G.S.A.'s conduct in this entire matter,'' Mr. Linnen said. ''Clearly, based on today's decision, something must be done to restore public confidence in the integrity of the G.S.A.'s procurements.'' Clyde Pearce, the G.S.A.'s general counsel, said that the board's decision rejected A.T.&T.'s claim in its protest that the agency was intentionally biased against the company. He added that the mistakes that were made were technical flaws in the evaluation process that put A.T.&T. at a disadvantage. The disputed contracts, which are worth $55 million, would provide the Government with computerized switch operations in 12 major cities. A.T.&T. won five contracts and seven went to the Bell Atlantic Corporation, the BellSouth Corporation, U S West Inc., and Pacific Telesis. Awards Called Erroneous Judge Vincent A. LaBella, an administrative judge who issued the ruling on behalf of the board, said that the G.S.A. did not evaluate A.T.&T.'s bid proposal as it had specified it would when it solicited bids. He also said the agency improperly considered the company's volume discount. For this reason, he added, awards were erroneously made to Bell Atlantic for the Philadelphia location and to Pacific Telesis for San Francisco. He ordered the contracts terminated and awarded to A.T.&T. Judge LaBella also instructed the agency to award to A.T.&T. contracts that had previously been given to BellSouth for the Atlanta and New Orleans areas because Mr. Soni had disclosed to BellSouth officials a ''price to beat'' for the contracts and because it was improper for Mr. Soni to negotiate a Government contract with a company that employs his daughter, Neelam. Federal procurement laws prohibit a Government employee from engaging in auction techniques such as releasing a vendor's proprietary bid information to competitors or advising a vendor of its price standing relative to another bidder. ''What is clear from this record is that Mr. Soni implemented a type of auction technique that is clearly prohibited by regulation and violative of the statutory requirement for full and open competition,'' Judge LaBella wrote. 'Appearance of Impropriety' In addition, Judge LaBella noted ''the inescapable appeareance of impropriety'' from Mr. Soni's acceptance of gratuities in the form of free meals from BellSouth employees. In his ruling, the judge cited an expense voucher from a BellSouth official for a $48.92 lunch tab that read: ''Lunch at 'Bay Street,' Atlanta, Ga., to discuss pending G.S.A. ETN proposal and to discuss career opportunities within telecommunications industry. Attending were Lal Soni, network engineer G.S.A. Washington D.C.; Neelam Soni daughter of Mr. Lal Soni Atlanta & Self. Tax & tip included.'' Mr. Soni's lawyer, John Dowd, said, ''When all is said and done it will be demonstrated that Mr. Soni did not reveal any proprietary information or accept any gratuity.'' In reaching its decision, the G.S.A. board relied partly on information provided by the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, which is conducting an investigation into the matter. The board requested similar information from the office of the G.S.A.'s inspector general, which refused the request. Technological Framework The phone switch contracts are important since they would lay the technological framework for the FTS-2000 system. Winners of the phone switch work would have a cost advantage in the FTS-2000 bidding because the switches can be used to run the new Government phone network. ''I am deeply suspicious and concerned that the $25 billion contract is essentially being awarded under the same procedures with the same cast of characters - and there is no guarantee that the same thing won't happen again,'' said Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, a vocal critic of the agency's handling of the phone contracts. Scott Smith, a spokesman for Pacific Telesis, said in announcing that the company would appeal, ''We feel that G.S.A.'s cost evaluation of the bid was proper and should not have been reversed.''

1367-> American Brands Sets Sale of Nine E-II Units
American Brands Inc. said yesterday that it would sell the bulk of E-II Holdings Inc., a conglomerate it acquired only four months ago, for $1.2 billion. It identified the buyer as a family company headed by Meshulam Riklis, the 64-year-old Manhattan retailing executive who controls the Rapid-American Corporation, McCrory Stores and Faberge/Elizabeth Arden. American Brands, a diversified concern that includes cigarettes and liquor among its many products, paid about $2.1 billion to acquire E-II in order to avoid being taken over by the Chicago-based company. Apparent $100 Million Profit American Brands said the E-II assets being sold accounted for about $1.1 billion of the E-II purchase price. The sale would give American Brands an apparent profit of $100 million, before expenses. The company said it would keep the remaining $965 million in E-II assets. The Riklis Family Corporation is to pay about $950 million in cash and $250 million in preferred stock for the E-II assets. It would also assume $1.5 billion in subordinated debt. Under the deal, Riklis would buy nine E-II companies: Culligan International, a maker of water softeners; Samsonite, a luggage producer; Samsonite Furniture, a producer of leisure furniture; Home Fashions, a maker of window coverings; Beatreme Food Ingredients, a flavorings producer; Frozen Specialities, a pizza maker; Lowrey's Meat, a producer of meat snacks; Martha White Foods, a maker of corn meal and bake mixes, and Pet Specialties, a producer of pet food. American Brands said it would keep five E-II companies being bought at a cost of $645 million. This would include Aristokraft Inc., a maker of kitchen and bath cabinets; Waterloo Industries, a maker of tool storage products, and the Twentieth Century Companies, a producer of plumbing supplies. E-II had previously sold American Brands Day-Timers, a direct-mail marketer of diary planners, and Vogel Peterson, an office furniture manufacturer. American Brands said it would also retain 7.1 million shares of its own stock, bought at a cost of $320 million, or $45 a share, from E-II. American Brands stock closed at $44.875, up 12.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. The company said it was selling two other E-II properties, the Stiffel Company, a lamp maker, and Aunt Nellies Farm Kitchens, a food packer, to unidentified buyers. E-II was spun off by the Beatrice Companies in 1987 as a holding company for several businesses. American Brands acquired E-II for $17.05 a share in February after E-II said it was considering a takeover bid. American Brands countered with a hostile bid of its own for E-II, but the companies ultimately agreed to a friendly merger. American Brands, based in Old Greenwich, Conn., makes such products as Carlton and Lucky Strike cigarettes and Jim Beam bourbon and Gilbey's gin, along with other consumer goods. It is also involved in financial services and insurance. William J. Alley, chairman of American Brands, said the E-II deal and a stock buyback begun last winter would give American Brands five E-II operations and, when completed, 17.1 million shares of its own stock. He predicted that these transactions would improve the company's earnings per share this year. With the 7.1 million shares purchased in the E-II deal, he said, American Brands has already bought more than 15.5 million shares this year, trimming its shares outstanding to about 95 million. In response to a question, Robert J. Rukeyser, a spokesman, said American Brands no longer regarded itself as a takeover target. Faberge/Elizabeth Arden is noted for its cosmetics and Rapid-American operates more than 1,200 stores nationwide under such names as McCrory and J. J. Newberry. But Mr. Riklis is probably best known by many people as the husband of Pia Zadora, an actress and nightclub performer.

1368-> Education; Unusual Coalition Is Elected at Massachusetts U.
Campaigning against rising college costs and for improved racial relations, an unusual coalition has elected a large slate of candidates to the top posts of student government at the University of Massachusetts. The coalition, the United Student Agenda, was formed earlier this year by students who classify themselves on the political spectrum as liberal, moderate, left of center or conservative and was headed by a self-described Communist. The diverse politics of the coalition's members, the platform upon which they ran and the thoroughness of their victory could make the school a model for other schools in the region. In February, a brawl between white and black students led to a student takeover of a campus building in which leaders of the United Student Agenda supported demands for increasing members of minority groups at the school. The coalition also issued a call to block a state plan to increase tuition by 60 percent over the next several years at all the state's public colleges. The group also advocated more student control of campus life. #55 on Slate Elected With a core of about 50 leaders, 150 campaign workers and several hundred supporters from other campus groups that joined the coalition, all 55 candidates running on the United Student Agenda slate were elected to posts on the university senate and the board of governors and as student president and student trustee. The coalition's victory against candidates who held views described as conservative to the far right could be the birth of a new political force, said Dennis L. Madson, vice chancellor of student affairs. The leadership of the student government, which controls a $3.5 million student trust fund, had swung from left to right in the last five years. ''U.S.A. reflects a level of political alliance and organization that we haven't seen for 10 years,'' Mr. Madson said. Other schools across the country have also been jolted by racial incidents in recent years. Nearby at Smith College, students responded to racial tensions with a protest march and demands that the administration create a more hospitable climate for minority students. At Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H., the president, James O. Freedman, has condemned a radical right publication, The Dartmouth Review, as partly responsible in stirring up racism. However, the most recent student elections at Smith and Dartmouth did not emphasize racial concerns. In Amherst, Stephanie M. Orefice, 20 years old, a self-described conservative turned moderate, ran for student trustee on the U.S.A. slate. To her, the need for racial harmony and low cost public education were more important than divisions between the political left and right. ''I don't consider U.S.A. a liberal organization,'' she said. ''Our platform of a campus free of racial violence, democratically run with student participation which promotes quality affordable education, is one of basic student rights.'' New Officers in July Ms. Orefice will take office July 1 as student member of the board of trustees for the University of Massachusetts. which oversees three campuses with 39,848 students. John Dunlap, 20 years old, who describes himself as a moderate, joined the coalition late in the election. Last winter, at the time of the building takeover, he was an independent student senator. He said that led him to realize, ''Racism is prevelent here.'' He said he used to think ''People could afford an education if they took a year off to work.'' Now he believes that rising tuition ''hurts minorities'' and could alter the school's mission to serve all state residents. Some members of the coalition, such as Edward D. Chambers, a 19-year-old freshman, are thinking even far ahead when it comes to student government. Mr. Chambers, who joined the coalition after its opponents challenged the electoral victory of Jackson Rabinowitz as student government president, said: ''I believe the tide is turning on conservatisim. In the '60's and '70's students were radical, in the '80's conservative and in a few more years we'll see liberal activism again. ''I may not be here then but I'd like to see a strong coalition so when the opportunity arises, we'll be unified and working hard.''

1369-> CREDIT MARKETS; Treasury Bonds and Notes Mixed
Prices of Treasury bonds and notes were mixed in muted trading yesterday, despite a report that suggested at first glance that inflation pressures may be moderating. The report, which showed that consumer prices in May rose by a small three-tenths of 1 percent, helped the market early in the session. But the price gains evaporated after traders and analysts had time to examine the data, which showed that lower food prices were a contributing factor to the relatively modest monthly increase. With the drought continuing in the Grain Belt, analysts said that sort of performance is not likely to continue in the months ahead. ''Today's number didn't give us a real indication either way,'' about inflation, said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at First Fidelity Bancorporation in Philadelphia. ''But indicators in the real economy like commodity prices and average hourly earnings are going up. I think inflation is rising a little bit, and I think the Fed does too.'' Reaction to Federal Funds As on Monday, price movements were more pronounced among shorter-term Treasury notes and bills than at the long end of the maturity spectrum, as traders continued to react to what they perceive to be a slightly higher overnight Federal funds rate. The continued rise in short-term rates may soon force commercial banks to raise their prime lending rate, currently at 9 percent, Mr. Levy and a number of other analsyts said. ''The banks' cost of funds has gone up enough to justify a half-point increase in the prime,'' said Robert A. Schwartz, vice president and senior financial economist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. ''But what will determine whether or not the banks will go is loan demand. Right now and for the past three months, it has been quite strong.'' Another rate that is also tied to the banks' cost of funds, the broker loan rate, was raised to 8.50 percent, from 8.25 percent, yesterday by the Bankers Trust Company. The rate, which banks charge on short-term loans to brokerage houses and investment banks, changes much more frequently than the prime. Short-Term Rates Up By late yesterday, interest rates on three-month certificates of deposit had risen by three basis points from Monday, to 7.65 percent. The overnight Federal funds rate, meanwhile, was trading at around 7.50 percent, as it did a day earlier. ''If the funds rate remains at 7.50 percent or above, and certificate of deposit rates move up further, you can expect a one-quarter of a point increase in the prime,'' Mr. Levy said. Other short-term rates also rose. The two-year Treasury notes to be auctioned tomorrow were offered on a when-issued basis late yesterday at a price to yield 8.16 percent, up three basis points, or three-hundreths of a point, from Monday. And the four-year notes to be sold on Thursday were quoted at a price to yield 8.52 percent, up from 8.49 percent on Monday. In the secondary Treasury bill market, interest rates on three-month bills rose by five basis points, to 6.54 percent. Six-month bills were up by four basis points, to 6.85 percent. The rise in domestic short-term rates came on a day when West Germany's Bundesbank pushed up one of its key short-term rates by one-fourth of a percentage point, to 3.50 percent. The move had been widely anticipated and had little impact in the credit markets. Rates Stabilized for Now Treasury bond prices, which slipped badly last week, remained fairly steady for the second consecutive session. In late trading, the bellwether 9 1/8 percent bond that matures in 2018 was offered at 100 14/32, up 3/32 on the day, to yield 9.08 percent. ''It looks like long rates have stabilized for the time being,'' Mr. Schwartz said. ''But looking out beyond the next week or two, we still feel that rates are going to head higher.'' Mr. Schwartz emphasized, however, that any increase in long rates was not likely to be large. In part, that view is due to the fact that the Congress does not seem likely to increase the Treasury Department's authority to sell 30-year bonds. Proposals under discussion by the House Ways and Means Committee for raising new taxes contain no mention of increasing the Treasury's authority. It had been thought that an increase in authority might be tacked on as an amendment to the ''technical corrections'' bill. Unless the ceiling is raised by Aug. 1, the Treasury may be forced to issue more 3-year and 10-year notes at its quarterly refunding auctions. New York City Offering Away from the Government bond market, new issue activity in the corporate and tax-exempt municipal bond markets was heavy yesterday, as a number of new issues were priced. Among the new tax-exempts was a $450 million offering of general obligation bonds from the New York City. The bonds were sold in two parts: $330 million worth of serial bonds and a separate term bond that matures in 2017. The serial bonds carry maturities that range from 1988 to 2017. Yields at the time of pricing range from 4.75 percent on the bonds maturing in 1988 to 8.25 percent on the bonds that mature in 2017. The term bond, which is noncallable for life, carries an 8 percent coupon and was priced at par. Merrill Lynch Capital Markets acted as lead manager for the underwriting. The issue is expected to carry ratings of A by Moody's Investor Service and A-minus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation. Corporate Bonds Among the new corporate bonds issued yesterday was a $300 million offering of five-year 9 3/8 percent notes from the Continental Corporation. The notes, which mature in 1993, were priced at par, and yield 74 basis points above Treasury securities with a comparable maturity. Salomon Brothers acted as lead manager for the underwriting, which is rated A-1 by Moody's and AA by Standard & Poor's. Late in the day Gibraltar Financial of Los Angeles offered $190 million of three-year notes. The 8 7/8 percent notes, which are backed by a letter of credit from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, are noncallable for life, and were priced at par, 55 basis points over the yield on Treasury securities with a comparable maturity. Merrill Lynch Capital Markets acted as lead underwriter for the offering, which is rated AAA by both Moody's and Standard & Poors.

1371-> Education; Black Dean to Head Institute at Mississippi State
This week Charles W. Washington, associate dean of the School of Government and Business Administration at George Washington University, was named director of the John C. Stennis Institute of Government at Mississippi State University. He said he has got used to the mixed reaction of some old friends and colleagues. ''They usually say first, 'Charles, that's great,' '' Mr. Washington said. ''Then they pause, and add, 'Charles - Mississippi? Are you sure this is right for you?' '' Mr. Washington knows that his friends' questions spring not just from the fact that he will be leaving a rewarding, 12-year association with a prestigious university in the nation's capital to take up residence in the small college town of Starkville, Miss. The questions also stem from the tangled juxtaposition of fact and history and perception. Mr. Washington is black. And the 10-year-old Stennis Institute, named for the nation's oldest and most senior Senator, John C. Stennis, is in a state where some of the bloodiest battles of the civil rights movement were fought two decades ago. The 87-year-old Senator, a 1923 graduate of Mississippii State, is retiring this year after 41 years in the Senate. A Community Commitment Many people still believe that Mississippi, as Mr. Washington said, has ''one of the worst reputations for race relations in the country.'' Sitting in his modest, third-floor office at George Washington University, the 45-year-old administrator, who was born in Georgia and reared in Florida, said he largely shared that view until he visited Starkville. ''I had always thought of Mississippi as 'another place,' a state that wasn't quite part of the modern United States,'' he said. ''But I was very impressed by the people at the institute and the university. I spoke with the Mayor, the Chamber of Commerce, local politicians, bank presidents and others, and I sensed from them all the commitment to support the institute's expanding effort to make significant improvements in Mississippi's quality of life.'' Mr. Washington acknowledged that these words might be considered the standard things a university official would say to help town-gown relations. But, speaking of the institute's search committee, he said, ''There had to be a desire to get beyond the past and a commonality between my views and their views for them to have offered me the job.'' That common link, according to several people inside and outside Mississippi who know both the state and Mr. Washington, lies in Mississippi's need to improve both the processes of state and local government and the ability of those governments to serve their citizens. Mississippi has long been among the lowest-ranked states in per capita income, employment and literacy. Nearly 27 percent of its citizens 25 years of age and older have had no schooling beyond the eighth grade, compared with about 25 percent for the rest of the South and 17 percent for the nation as a whole. ''Mississippi has long been known as a state with a poorly developed political system and procedures,'' said Alfred Zuck, executive director of the National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration, who is a longtime friend of Mr. Washington. ''His appointment is a further sign of interest there in significant change.'' Delmer Dunn, Regents Professor of Political Science at the University of Georgia, also said Mr. Washington's appointment ''has a significance beyond the fact that he is very, very capable.'' ''It's imperative that universities, particuarly land-grant universities, in the South be seen as responsive to all the citizens of the state,'' said Mr. Dunn, a former director of the university's Carl Vinson Institute of Government. ''This is a clear statement that Mississippi State is intent on doing that.'' Mr. Washington, who is to start his new job on Aug. 1, declined to discuss any changes he would make in the institute's operation, saying that would have to wait until he talked with a broad cross-section of people there. But he asserted that, given Mississippi's economic and educational profile, the Stennis Institute's mission of promoting ''civic literacy'' had a mission beyond the typical roles taken by such university-based organizations. Improvements in Public Service In broad terms, the Stennis Institute's role is similar to those of the more than 200 university-based institutes of government or public affairs, whether it is the John F. Kennedy Institute at Harvard University or the Lyndon Baines Johnson School of Government at the University of Texas. It trains students and public officials in public service and, through a mix of academic research and action-oriented projects, seeks to improve the quality of public service in the state. But unlike its wealthier counterparts, the work of the Stennis Institute has been hampered by its modest budget, about $100,000 annually. It employs only two full-time staff people, the director and assistant director, and the number of programs it can sponsor is limited. The institute does provide technical assistance to local governments, such as helping rural communities to form fire departments and organizing seminars for local and state officials and community leaders. Part of Mr. Washington's responsibilities will be to expand the institute's activities and influence, which is one reason several of Senator Stennis's colleagues are sponsoring a $1,000-a-plate dinner here on Thursday. The proceeds from the dinner, which is expected to draw 1,000 people, including President and Mrs. Reagan, will go to the institute.

1373-> Casino Is Sponsor For a Temple Game
Temple's basketball game next December against the national champion, Kansas, in Atlantic City has stirred some controversy. Win or lose on the court, Temple will beat Kansas financially with money from a source that Kansas officials said came as a surprise to them: gambling. The Showboat Hotel, Casino and Bowling Center agreed to pay the rental for the 11,026-seat Convention Hall and will give Temple an additional $100,000, according to Don Davidson, vice president of marketing for the casino. Based on previous contracts, Temple should also get about $150,000 from NBC for the national telecast of the game Dec. 10. NBC declined to confirm the amount. Kansas would receive about $15,000 under a home-and-home agreement in which Temple played at Kansas two years ago and received a similar guarantee. Charlie Theokas, Temple's athletic director, other Temple officials and Davidson said they saw no problem with a gambling casino sponsoring an intercollegiate event, since the casino business is so highly regulated. Kansas' athletic director, Bob Frederick, said he was concerned. ''We had no knowledge of the sponsorship involvement by an outside organization,'' he said. ''We have obvious concern about sponsorship from a gambling casino.'' Theokas said he did not understand Frederick's concern. ''This is a Temple home game,'' Theokas said. ''Temple is renting the game from Atlantic City Convention Center. That's all.'' The Showboat has sponsored Temple football and basketball games on radio. A National Collegiate Athletic Association rule limiting casino participation in intercollegiate athletics applies only to playoff games, but Jim Marchiony, an N.C.A.A. spokesman, said that could change. Marchiony said the N.C.A.A. was concerned ''about the tie-in with a college basketball game to a casino.'' ''There is no question that it sets a distasteful precedent,'' Marchiony said, ''especially in light of the gambling scandals that have rocked college basketball. ''This does not violate N.C.A.A. rules. What you have is an example of why the manual is so thick. The intent is obviously there, but there is no specific rule to cover this.''

1374-> Unequal Stock Class Opposed
The chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee has told the Securities and Exchange Commission that he believes the commission has the legal power to stop companies listed on public exchanges from issuing stock with unequal voting rights. In a letter released today, Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, told the S.E.C.'s chairman, David S. Ruder, that ''the commission has the authority to mandate a one-share, one-vote rule.'' He added, ''It is time to move forward with sound and appropriate safeguards that will insure the continued participation of the American shareholder in corporate policy.'' The letter, dated last Thursday, addressed one of the most contentious issues facing the S.E.C. In recent years, companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange have argued for the right to issue new stock that has less voting power than existing stock. Though some see dual classes of stock as an innovative tool for financing acquisitions and raising new funds from overseas investors, others contend that different classes of stock will be used to diminish the voice of the small shareholder.

1376-> Bush Says U.S. Should Continue Its Arms Buildup
Vice President Bush today called for continuing support for military spending, arguing that the Reagan Administration's arms buildup had pushed the Soviet Union toward domestic reform. The Vice President spoke a day after Mikhail S. Gorbachev proposed an overhaul of the Soviet political system, including the creation of a new post of president and a partial transfer of power from the Communist Party to popularly elected government bodies. While Mr. Bush expressed ''guarded optimism'' about the proposed changes in a speech here to the World Affairs Council, he laced his comments with skepticism and doubts, and warned, ''the cold war is not over.'' ''Some of the dramatic reform that General Secretary Gorbachev proposed just yesterday would truly, if implemented, be revolutionary,'' Mr. Bush said. ''And should the reforms he's talking about be put into practice, it would represent historic change.'' 'A Fitting Capstone' But the theme running through Mr. Bush's remarks was less sanguine. In fact, at times, he sounded like the early President Reagan, who called the Soviet Union the ''evil empire.'' ''My point is that it was eight years of American strength that confronted the Soviet Union with the true costs of aggression and necessity to reform,'' Mr. Bush said. ''That is why the Moscow summit was such a fitting capstone to the President's career, for the hope of that summit built on eight years of moral determination and hard work rebuilding American might. ''But this said, we must remember, the cold war is not over. We must be bold enough to seize the opportunity of change, but at the same time prepared for, as one pundit titled his column, 'the protracted conflict.' '' Mr. Bush argued that internal change began in the Soviet Union as the Reagan Administration began building up the nation's military, supporting ''freedom fighters and spending money on technological advanced systems such as a defense system against nuclear missiles.'' 'Focused the Competition' ''It is this support that has enabled the Afghan resistance to force the Soviet Union to pull its army out of Afghanistan,'' he said. With a planned defense against missiles, he said, ''we focused the competition on our greatest strength and the Soviet's greatest weakness, technology,'' In response to a reporter's question aboard Air Force 2, Mr. Bush argued that it had not been internal concerns, such as the failing Soviet economy, that were behind the changes pressed by Mr. Gorbachev. ''I think the Soviet Union recognizes that they were not going to get through the unilateral concessions in arms control agreements what they wanted,'' he said. ''I don't think it is the economy that is solely driving their desire for arms control. I don't think it is our economy that is driving our desire for arms control agreements. There is a greater principle involved than strictly one's own economy.'' 'Cannot Tolerate Lawlessness' That argument is expected to be a debating point this fall between Mr. Bush and Michael S. Dukakis, the likely Democratic Presidential nominee. Mr. Dukakis has sought to add another element to the discussion by arguing that record spending by the Pentagon contributed to the arms procurement scandal unfolding in Washington. Appearing sensitive to that criticism, Mr. Bush again condemned those he accused of undermining ''America's security.'' ''They will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law, and, if guilty, we will throw the book at them,'' he said. ''We cannot tolerate lawlessness, in the Congress, in the Pentagon, the executive branch or on the streets.'' But Mr. Bush said that it would be a ''tragedy'' if the conduct of ''a few individuals'' so far implicated in the procurement scandal was used to undermine support for a strong military. He suggested that Congress was already reacting in a manner that might prove damaging. ''The first reaction in Congress to the scandals, to increase the regulatory bureacracy at Defense, though understandable, that's only going to add to the complexity and worsen the problem,'' he said. ''The answer is to reduce, cut and simplify, including staff and executive overhead.''

1377-> ABROAD AT HOME; No to King George
The most audacious effort in generations to exalt the constitutional power of the President has been decisively turned back. That is the larger meaning of the Supreme Court's decision yesterday in the independent counsel case. The Court upheld against all challenges the law providing for special prosecutors to investigate wrongdoing in the executive branch. It rejected claims that, under the Constitution, the President must control investigations of his own subordinates' suspected crimes and must have absolute power to remove prosecutors at will. The particulars of what the Court held must seem unsurprising. After painful experience of abuses, in Watergate and after, Congress chose not to let the executive investigate itself. Instead, judicially appointed counsel with a fair degree of independence would do the job. It was a common-sensical response to an urgent problem of governance. But a strident public campaign pushed the idea that special prosecutors infringe on the President's constitutional power. The Reagan Administration supported it. And it won an extraordinary victory in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. That is why the Supreme Court's categorical rejection of the constitutional argument is so important. No decision in recent terms of the Court has had deeper implications for the American system of government. The radical right in this country had seized on the independent counsel issue as a way to advance Presidential power. Day after day The Wall Street Journal denounced the counsels as a threat to the Presidency -and the country. ''Congress brazenly violated the Constitution'' in creating them, the Journal said. The vision behind that argument was of a Presidency supreme and essentially unchallengeable. It was as if those who framed the Constitution at Philadelphia in 1787 had created a President on the model of King George the Third. The Court of Appeals made that royalist vision a threatening reality by the way it approached the independent counsel issue. It engaged in astonishing judicial activism - a breathtaking willingness to disregard the plain words of the Constitution. The Constitution happens to have an exceptionally explicit provision allowing Congress, whenever it deems that ''proper,'' to vest the appointment of inferior Federal officers ''in the courts of law.'' The Supreme Court held squarely in 1880 that that language gave Congress broad discretion to have judges make appointments. But the Court of Appeals majority said it would not follow the ''plain meaning'' of the constitutional provision because it conflicted with the need for a ''unitary executive.'' If courts could appoint prosecutors, it said, why the next thing they would be appointing Agriculture or Defense officials. Imaginary horribles paraded through the opinion. Chief Justice Rehnquist, writing for a 7-1 majority, disposed of all that judicial invention with dignified dispatch. The Constitution meant what it said, he wrote, and so did the Court in 1880. Judges should respect the power given to Congress, and Congress had acted here with reason. It was highly significant that the opinion was by the Chief Justice, a conservative and a man who certainly respects executive prerogative. It was one more sign - there were others this term - that he is moving to speak with a centrist voice for the Court, especially when there are institutional concerns. Not only did Chief Justice Rehnquist calmly reject the arguments against independent counsels. Along the way he intimated that administrative agencies independent of Presidential control are constitutional - in disagreement with a view much argued by Attorney General Meese and others. The Reagan Administration's Solicitor General, Charles Fried, had argued in the Supreme Court that the only constitutional way for Congress to ensure investigation of suspected criminal executive officials was to threaten the President with impeachment. The unreality of that argument - the absurdity, some would say - is even plainer now. The two judges in the Court of Appeals majority, Laurence Silberman and Stephen Williams, were both Reagan appointees. Judge Silberman's opinion will remain as a high-water mark of conservative judicial activism. Chief Justice Rehnquist's opinion was also in striking contrast with the views of another person who might have been sitting on the Supreme Court, Robert Bork. Years ago, Judge Bork called the special prosecutor law unconstitutional. Chief Justice Rehnquist's opinion shows us how far that view was from the mainstream of constitutional judgment.

1378-> Baseball Notebook; Would Reds Dismiss Rose?
George Steinbrenner has never had a problem dismissing the ever-popular Billy Martin or Lou Piniella, but Pete Rose's popularity would be a severe test for Marge Schott if the Cincinnati owner becomes sufficiently disenchanted to dismiss him. Rumblings about Rose's status have grown in direct proportion to the Reds' descent in the National League West standing. Murray Cook, the Reds' general manager, said it's ''newspaper talk; it's not an issue.'' ''I have nothing to say about it,'' he said. But would he actually have anything to say about it if Schott wanted to make a change? Probably about as much to say as the Yankees' general manager has in such decisions. Schott gave the Reds a pep talk Tuesday night, but she declined a request for a telephone interview on the Reds' and Rose's status. ''She just doesn't want to make any comments about the team,'' said Joyce Pfarr, Schott's administrative assistant. ''It's something she doesn't want to discuss through the media.'' The Reds, picked by many to win the division title, reached their low point of the season the other day when they tumbled 10 1/2 games from first. In finishing second the past three years under Rose, their biggest deficit was 11 games, that point coming in September 1986. Last season they were never more than nine games out, and they were in first place for 105 days. First place has been a foreign location to them this season. ''Any time you lose there are going to be rumblings,'' said Sparky Anderson, the Detroit manager, who was once dismissed in Cincinnati despite having won five division championships, four pennants and two World Series. ''I don't care who you are. Nobody is too big to escape that, not me, not nobody.'' When the Reds dismissed Anderson after the 1978 season, popular opinion ran heavily on his side. He has no doubt that a similar situation would exist if the Reds terminated Rose's tenure. ''You're dealing with a guy who represents a city, who has lived there all his life, who is going to be a Hall of Famer,'' Anderson said. ''If they do it, no one person could do it. You'd have to have it done by committee: the owner, the general manager, the farm director, everybody. I wouldn't want to be one of the committee if the team didn't right itself after you fired him. Pete's a big guy there. He's earned every piece of that.'' Anderson apparently remains a ''big guy'' in Cincinnati because he has been mentioned by some fans as the man to do the job Rose has been unable to do. Anderson is happy with the Tigers, but he has another reason for rejecting such a thought before it gains momentum. ''I'd never go home,'' he said. ''My wife asked me if I ever would and I said no. I don't believe you can go home. I can walk in that city forever as a king and I wouldn't want to lose that. I love the city; I love the people. But I would never return. It wouldn't make any sense.'' No Pressure? Five managers have been dismissed this season, one more than all last season. Only one change had been made by this time a year ago. The reason for the change in frequency seems obvious. Last year, club executives were reluctant to make changes because they felt they would be pressured to hire black managers if they dismissed their managers. This year, the first manager fired, Cal Ripken Sr., was replaced by a black, Frank Robinson. Executives either feel that Baltimore's move relieved the pressure or feel less constrained a year after remarks by Al Campanis focused national attention on baseball's hiring practices. The Evans Hypothesis Home runs are down (by 30 percent), and theories are up. Some people say the pitchers are better; some say the hitters are worse. Others blame the weather, among other things. Last year, when home runs were up and at record numbers, the most common theory was that the ball was livelier. Dwight Evans, a thinking man's player, didn't agree with the lively-ball theory last year, but he does think it's the ball this year. ''The ball we had last year was the same ball we had for years,'' said Evans, the Boston Red Sox veteran. ''It was the same ball as when Mantle and Maris played. I guarantee it. But the ball this year is softer. You can take your thumb and push it in and squeeze the ball. You hit the ball hard a couple of times and it's lopsided. You almost want to foul it off and get it out of play.'' They Told You So When the Cleveland Indians leaped to an unexpectedly good start, skeptics suggested that everyone wait until they played the Eastern teams before granting them contender status. The Indians have played Eastern teams the past four weeks, and the skeptics are smirking. Entering last night's games, the Indians had a 9-16 record against the Yankees, Detroit, Boston and Toronto and had fallen from a game and one-half behind first to six games out. The 9-16 record is a .360 percentage, which is worse than the Indians' percentage of .377 for all of last season, in which they lost 101 games. The Yankees' record in the same period against Eastern teams wasn't much better: 10 victories, 14 defeats. They fell from leading by a game and one-half to trailing by three. The Tigers, on the other hand, compiled a 17-8 record and gained six and a half games in the standing, from three and a half out to a lead of three games over the Yankees.

1379-> Wimbledon; Navratilova Plays Catch-Up, Briskly
This is expected to be just a formality, probably requiring less than an hour of her time. Because of the rain delays the last two days, there is still an opening for one player in the women's semifinals at Wimbledon. Martina Navratilova is expected to fill the position Wednesday. If she advances, as expected, against Ros Fairbank of South Africa, Navratilova will join Steffi Graf of West Germany, Chris Evert and Pam Shriver, all of whom reached the semis today. That would also mean that the top four seeded players played according to form. Navratilova had left Wimbledon in a foul mood Monday evening when rain halted her fourth-round match against Larissa Savchenko of the Soviet Union in the first set, with Savchenko up a break, 4-2. Navratilova was upset because her match was allowed to begin when she thought it was too dark. ''I think they need a meter to judge when it is too dark to play,'' Navratilova said today after rallying to beat Savchenko, 6-4, 6-2. ''When I took my glasses off between games, I couldn't see who was who sitting in my box.'' Seeking a Record Ninth Navratilova is trying for a record ninth singles title at Wimbledon. She shares the record at eight with Helen Wills Moody, and has won six in a row. Popular opinion is that only Graf, ranked No. 1 in the world, has a chance to end Navratilova's domination on the grass courts, where her serve-and-volley game has no equal. If Navratilova is to be defeated before the final, someone will probably have to play the match of her life, or it will take an odd set of circumstances, much like what developed Monday. Navratilova was only too aware of that. ''I had to serve in the rain; there were drops on my glasses,'' she said. ''The adverse conditions were a great equalizer. Then my big concern today was going out there before seven o'clock, when it would get dark again.'' Light rain delayed play until late afternoon, and Navratilova spent the idle hours watching movies and a tape of the Mike Tyson-Michael Spinks fight, which, admittedly, was a very short subject. Savchenko was in the players' tea room, eating scones, drinking coffee and admitting she would rather wait one more day before finishing the match. Her lead did not give her an abundance of confidence. ''Martina started slowly,'' Savchenko said today before the match was resumed. ''I think she was just practicing with me.'' She was being too modest. Although Savchenko is slow around the court, she hits the ball extremely hard. Navratilova came out in a very businesslike manner, holding her serve, then breaking Savchenko to even the set at 4-4. There was a sigh of relief, but Navratilova did not relax, holding again to lead, 5-4, then closing out the set by breaking Savchenko with a forehand service-return winner. Savchenko's strong serve-and-volley game kept her in the match until Navratilova broke her in the sixth game of the second set, to lead, 4-2. Savchenko began to lose interest, offering little in the way of opposition after that. ''At the end, I was serving and she was barely holding the racquet,'' Navratilova said. ''This is only Wimbledon. But it was going to take a herculean effort to beat me.'' That is what probably will be needed to beat Graf, who was impressive again, beating Pascale Paradis of France, 6-3, 6-1. Graf will now face Shriver, who defeated Zina Garrison, 6-4, 6-4. Last year, Shriver was embarrassed by Graf in the quarterfinals, losing in 51 minutes. ''It can't be worse than that,'' said a hopeful Shriver, who is playing with a type of mononucleosis. Evert advanced with her most impressive match thus far, defeating Helena Sukova of Czechoslovakia, 6-3, 7-6. If Navratilova beats Fairbank on Wednesday, it will set up one more chorus of the oldest song in women's tennis: Evert versus Navratilova.

1380-> Boxing Notebook; Tyson-Bruno Bout: Maneuvers Begin
A handshake agreement exists for Mike Tyson to fight Frank Bruno on Sept. 3 in London, but the deal was made by Bill Cayton, who Tyson has said is no longer his manager. Tyson has sued Cayton in an effort to break their relationship. Whether the heavyweight champion goes forward with the bout against Bruno, who is the mandatory challenger of the World Boxing Council and World Boxing Association, remains to be seen. Tyson has said more than once since his 91-second knockout of Michael Spinks in Atlantic City on Monday that he wants to retire. Jarvis Astaire, co-promoter with Mickey Duff of Bruno, has asked Jim Binns, the legal counsel of the W.B.A., to represent the British promotion's interest. Binns and Michael Winston, Tyson's New York-based attorney, spoke yesterday by telephone and plan to meet soon. Astaire said Tyson's share of the Sept. 3 fight against Bruno at Wembley could go as high as $8 million. ''Fighting Frank Bruno for that sort of money is certainly in Tyson's best interest,'' said Astaire. ''If you pushed the bout back a few months we wouldn't be able to stage it outdoors; Tyson would get less than half the money.'' Counting the Money Shelly Finkel, head of the closed-circuit operations for Tyson-Spinks, is projecting a gross just under $70 million for total revenues from the fight Monday. . . . Tyson's attorney said the fighter wanted to resolve his dispute with Cayton ''as expeditiously as possible.'' ''My recommendation,'' said Winston, ''is to see if we can work together to resolve this without litigation.'' But Winston declined to say precisely what Tyson's objective would be in such a resolution. Barring a settlement, Winston said he would go forward with the suit. Rooney Does His Job Credit Tyson's trainer, Kevin Rooney, for having the champion ready despite the outside problems leading up to the fight Monday. Afterward, Rooney made it clear that while he had no argument with either Tyson's wife, Robin Givens, or her mother, Ruth Roper, he remained a Cayton loyalist. ''Bill Cayton is an honest man,'' said Rooney. ''My last fight in 1985 I made five grand in Atlantic City. After the fight, Bill said he wouldn't give me the money till I was ready to leave. 'Cause he knew I like to gamble. He figured I'd be stupid and blow the money. I like that about him. He's careful with his fighters' money. ''I'm for Mike Tyson. I'm his trainer. I'm his friend. But my feeling is when nothing's wrong, don't change it.'' An Early Victim Brief as Monday night's heavyweight championship bout was, Michael Spinks will still receive his guaranteed $13.5 million. When Don Halpin fought Tyson in May 1985 - it was Tyson's third professional bout - Halpin got $750. Where Spinks left the ring with only his pride wounded, Halpin, whom Tyson knocked out in four rounds, came out of it with a fractured nose and a cut on his forehead that, he said, required 35 stitches. And while Tyson versus Spinks is bound to be remembered for years to come, Tyson versus Halpin has been reduced to an agate line in the boxing record books. But for Halpin, a 35-year-old corrections officer from Lowell, Mass., the memory lingers. ''He busted me up pretty good,'' said Halpin. ''I didn't fight for more than two years after that, though I kept working out in the gym to fill the time. When Tyson hit me, it didn't hurt. It was more like being hit by a car. I didn't feel it. Bang, and I was on my hip, bleeding all over.'' Halpin, a father of two children, said he was proud to have lasted four rounds against Tyson at a time when Tyson's opponents usually did not make it past the first round. As Tyson's career prospered, Halpin followed it. ''I stayed pretty interested,'' he said. ''It makes you feel good when someone you fought becomes champion.'' Halpin's 9-year-old son, David, took a son's pride in the fact that his father had fought the heavyweight champion. But when he told his elementary-school peers that his father had fought Tyson, they did not believe him. ''They called him a liar,'' said Halpin. ''He got into a few fistfights on account of that. So I called the promoter of the fight, Lorraine Miller, and asked her if I could have a video cassette of the bout.'' Miller sent him the cassette, which put an end to grade-school cynicism. ''Since then, he's had a few buddies over to watch the cassettte,'' Halpin said of his son. ''My son's kinda proud that I fought Tyson.'' Halpin has also shown the tape to fellow workers at the Massachusetts Correctional Institute in Concord. ''There's a VCR there because the inmates watch a film once or twice a week,'' said Halpin. ''A few inmates saw the Tyson tape, too. People watch and shake their heads, 'Whoa!' They can't believe you fought the guy. I fought plenty of tough characters. Tex Cobb. Jimmy Young. Mike Tyson was the toughest. No doubt.'' Unconvincing Victories While Azumah Nelson retained his W.B.C. superfeatherweight title by stopping Lupe Suarez over the weekend, his legs (and his future) look a bit shaky. Hector Camacho, who won a questionable decision over Reyes Cruz on Saturday, is not what he used to be, either. . . . Buster Douglas is a clever fighter who, based on his performance against Mike Williams (a seventh-round knockout) on the undercard of Tyson-Spinks, is no worse than the various heavyweights mentioned as future Tyson opponents. That group includes Jose Ribalta, Carl Williams, Francesco Damiani and Tim Witherspoon. Douglas knocked Williams down three times with just a stiff jab. His big problem is stamina.

1381-> ANNA WINTOUR TRANSFERRED TO HEAD VOGUE MAGAZINE
Anna Wintour, editor of HG, the former House & Garden, is to take over Vogue magazine, S. I. Newhouse Jr., chairman of Conde Nast Publications Inc., announced yesterday. The move has been rumored for months and consistently denied by spokesmen for Conde Nast, which owns both magazines. The new editor in chief of HG is to be Nancy Novogrod, now an editor and formerly executive editor at the Crown Publishing Group. Ms. Wintour replaces Grace Mirabella. Ms. Wintour, 37 years old, was born in Britain and began her career as deputy fashion editor at Harpers & Queen, a British mmagazine. She moved to New York and, from 1976 to 1986, worked for several publications, including New York magazine and Vogue, where she was creative director for three years. In 1986 she was sent by Conde Nast to revitalize British Vogue. Last fall she returned to New York to make over House & Garden. Editor in Chief Since 1971 Under Miss Mirabella, who became editor in chief in 1971, Vogue has achieved considerable success. In 1987, it's circulation was 1,245,712 and advertising revenue was $79.5 million, according to the Magazine Publishers Association. The move to replace Miss Mirabella, who said two weeks ago that she had no plans to resign, comes as Vogue is thought to be losing ground to Elle. ''It's attracting a lot of interest among the traditional Vogue advertisers,'' said Michael Drexler, national media director of Bozell, Jacobs, Kenyon & Eckhardt. ''The scuttlebutt in the fashion industry is that Elle could be the new standard for the fashion industry, and that's got to be a bit disconcerting to Vogue.'' ''There's pressure to contemporize the magazine, to introduce editorial that's more risque,'' Mr. Drexler added. ''Some kind of revitalization.'' Born in Manhattan, Mrs. Novogrod, 39, graduated from Mount Holyoke College and was an editor at Clarkson N. Potter, where she rose to executive editor. ''We will inch back to interior design,'' she said yesterday of her plans for HG. 'I think the life-style features will stay, but my interest is beautiful rooms and design and gardens.'' New editors at both magazines may be symbolic of changing readership. ''Elle came on the scene and appealed to a much younger reader,'' said Leo E. Scullin, senior vice president of Young & Rubicam Inc. ''It represented a changing sense of style that young women have. Vogue also has to change as younger readers come into its market and older ones move out.'' Similarly, House & Garden ''resembled my old college textbook,'' Mrs. Novogrod said. Under Ms. Wintour, it got snappy graphics, celebrities at home and decorators in designer clothing. The changes at Vogue and HG are effective immediately.

1382-> THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Campaign By Women's Voter Group
THE League of Women Voters of New York State, an outgrowth of the women's sufferage movement and almost 70 years old, is preparing to mount its first advertising campaign seeking new members and donations. The advertising is being contributed by Lintas:New York, which is working through the Advertising Club of New York. Just as the league is changing its ways in the modern world so is the club, which has been serving as a catalyst for pro bono campaigns for about five years. Marion S. Sinek, president of the league, explained at a news conference yesterday that the league was having membership and fund drives because ''the world is going through a transition in the volunteer sector,'' adding: ''Women in the work force have different kinds of things they want to do. Things that to them might be more important.'' The campaign will also have its educational aspect, for as Ms. Sinek put it, ''Some people think we are out of date fighting the battles of yesteryear.'' The agency has come up with the advertising theme line ''We're tougher than we look,'' which will be the sign-off for all advertising and is particularly appropriate when it appears in big black letters on a pink lapel button. The campaign will explain that while the league continues to do its traditional registration of voters and distribution of explanatory materials on controversial legislation, it also its goal of educating, informing and increasing public participation in government today. And since it needs money to do that, each of the four print ads prepared by the agency contains a coupon soliciting $35 memberships, as well as contributions. Part of the cost of producing the campaign is being supported by MONY Financial Services. Glossy proofs suitable for reproduction of the print ads are at this very moment being mailed to the myriad of daily and weekly newspapers throughout the state in hopes that they will be moved to give them free space. Lintas:New York will also be producing a 10-second TV commercial as well as a radio ad. The various advertisements will cover such aspects of the league as its taking male members for the last decade, its fighting for anti-toxic waste legislation and its supporting legislation for day care centers. Taken together they indicate the wide-ranging interests of the league. The television spot will make the point of the theme line beautifully. The camera looks down a hall at a door marked ''City Hall'' and moves toward it as we hear the click, click, click of a woman's high heels. The voice-over says, ''There's no issue, bill or politician [ a hand comes up and knocks on the door ] we won't tackle.'' The door explodes inward. ''The League of Woman Voters. We're tougher than we look.'' The flattened door of City Hall also serves as the cover picture of a brochure prepared by the agency with the head, ''Being a Member of the League of Women Voters Can Open a Lot of Doors.'' According to Benjamin S. Greenberg, chairman of the public service committee of the Advertising Club, this is the biggest such campaign to be placed through the club. It helps that Richard D. O'Connor, chairman of the volunteer agency, is also president of the Ad Club. Past campaigns mounted through the club have included one for the Fertility Research Foundation; another for the State of New Jersey that tried to get neighborhoods to accept homes for the mentally retarded, and an educational campaign for the Arson Strike Force. Coming next is an advertising effort to encourage organ donations, sponsored by Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center and the Regional Transplant Office for the Northeast.

1384-> An Assertive Japan at the Summit
Exit Ronald Reagan in a display of harmony. Enter Noboru Takeshita with strength not previously seen from Japan. Symbolically, that's the story of the economic summit meeting in Toronto. All the leaders of the industrial world agreed to needed debt relief for the third world's poorest countries; it was an idea Washington had long resisted. Meanwhile, the new Japanese Prime Minister pressed an intriguing broader approach, looking to the biggest debtors as well. Over all, this year's gathering of the Group of Seven - West Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Canada, Japan and the United States - was as notable for issues it skirted as for those it dealt with. That's been the norm in recent years. What started 13 years ago as an informal get-together on economics has become an all-purpose extravaganza. Economic problems, no matter how serious, give way to crises of the moment, like drugs and terrorism. For Mr. Reagan, that was a relief this time. No one dwelled on the distortions created by America's budget and trade deficits, problems he generated and now leaves unresolved. The one notable accomplishment at Toronto was agreement on debt relief for the world's poorest countries; which ones and how much remain to be seen. The seven leaders adopted a plan with three options: forgive some debt outright, as France plans to do, reduce interest charges, or stretch out repayment, as advocated by a Reagan Administration still slow to acknowledge any need for special treatment. But in terms of total third world debt, the poorest owe only a small fraction. The real problem has always been the big Latin American debtors, South Korea, the Philippines and a few others - and here's where Mr. Takeshita comes in. Riding an extraordinary boom at home and continued strength in foreign trade, Japan asserted a new challenge to Washington's dominance of debt strategy: it proposed a debt-reduction plan focused on the biggest debtors, with a central role for the International Monetary Fund. The plan received little discussion, partly because of its late introduction and partly because some leaders were reportedly uneasy with its thrust. But beyond the substance, there's no mistaking that Japan was flexing its muscles. With America in the throes of a Presidential election, it was foreordained that the Toronto summit talks would be friendly and inconclusive. This was no occasion for solving problems that resist solutions in the best of times. It was occasion for a graceful exit by Mr. Reagan - and an impressive entrance by Mr. Takeshita with some interesting new ideas.

1385-> U.S. Recalls Mexico Envoy Over Militant's Release
The United States has recalled its Ambassador to Mexico to protest Mexico's decision to free a Puerto Rican nationalist wanted by the United States for terrorist activities. The nationalist, William Morales, is reported to be the leader of a Puerto Rican independence group known as the Armed Forces of National Liberation, or F.A.L.N. He was freed last Friday and allowed to flee to Cuba. He had served five years of an eight-year sentence for killing a Mexican policeman. The United States was not informed of the release and is trying to get an explanation for it from the Mexican authorities, the State Department spokesman, Charles E. Redman, said today. Mr. Redman said the Reagan Administration was angered over the description of Mr. Morales by the Mexican authorities as a ''political fighter.'' The United States termed ''outrageous'' Mexico's refusal to extradite Mr. Morales on those grounds. ''It is inconceivable that an important friend such as Mexico could find such violent acts to be a legitimate exercise of political activity,'' Mr. Redman said. Linked to 50 Attacks According to Mr. Redman, Mr. Morales was implicated in more than 50 Puerto Rican terrorist attacks in the United States, including the 1975 bombing of an aircraft in New York in which 4 people were killed and 60 were wounded. He has been sentenced in New York to up to 99 years in prison on state and Federal charges of possessing weapons and explosives. Mr. Morales, who is 37 years old, was arrested in New York in 1978 after a bomb he was making went off, disfiguring his face and blowing off most of his hands. In 1979, he escaped from Bellevue Hospital in New York, where he was being fitted for artificial hands. He cut through a window gate and lowered himself 40 feet to the ground, using elastic bandages as a makeshift rope. A Formal Protest Mexico's Ambassador to Washington, Jorge Espinosa de los Reyes, was summoned to the State Department on Monday night to receive a formal protest over the release of Mr. Morales. The United States Ambassador, Charles Pilliod, left Mexico City today for consultations in Washington. The Mexican Government failed to respond to repeated requests for comment on the United States action. Ambassador Espinosa told the State Department that Mr. Morales was freed under Mexico's interpretation of its extradition treaty with the United States, according to Mr. Redman. ''We strongly reject these explanations and deplore that Mexico has chosen to free this terrorist,'' Mr. Redman said. Blow to Reagan Policy The United States has been seeking Mr. Morales's extradition for years, and his release is another blow to the Reagan Administration's policy of using extradition in its efforts to prosecute terrorists and drug traffickers. In Colombia, for example, where officials have been assassinated for their public support of the extradition of drug traffickers to the United States, Washington was unable to stop the secret release from jail six months ago of Jorge Ochoa Vasquez, a Colombian billionaire wanted on drug trafficking charges in the United States. Mr. Morales's release reportedly came after the Mexican Foreign Minister, Bernardo Sepulveda Amor, rejected the American extradition request last week on the ground that Mr. Morales was a ''political fighter for the independence of Puerto Rico'' who has been persecuted for political reasons. The extradition treaty between the two countries has a ''political offense exception'' that excludes the extradition of political prisoners.

1386-> Judge's Ruling Is Near
Federal Judge David Doty will rule in Minneapolis Monday whether to grant unrestricted free agency for more than 300 National Football League players, a source said yesterday. There had been speculation that Doty would call the parties back tomorrow and might ask for a hearing to obtain more testimony before making a ruling. But the source said that Doty's ruling on Monday ''will not require that and will have definite impact.'' The players are seeking an injunction freeing them from their respective teams because their contracts expired in February while there was no collective-bargaining agreement between management and players. The players hope to seek offers from other teams as N.F.L. training camps open. Three camps open on Sunday and the rest within the following two weeks. On June 17, Doty ruled that the league's management and its players were at an impasse in labor negotiations and took under advisement the matter of whether to rule that the players were unrestricted free agents. Under the collective bargaining agreement that expired last summer, teams had the right to match other teams' offers to their players, and had to be compensated if they lost free agents. The Key Issue in 1987 The players' union made free agency the key issue in labor talks last year and the failure to reach an agreement led to a 24-day strike last fall. From the players' perspective, Doty's decision to rule on Monday whether to grant an injuction rather than seeking a hearing keeps alive the hope for unrestricted free agency. Though whatever Doty decides will likely be appealed, the door remains open for him to refuse a management request for a stay of an injunction. ''I wish I could be that optimistic, but one thing I have learned is not to try to predict the court,'' said Gene Upshaw, the executive director of the players' union. ''Our chances are still 50-50. The injunction is going to be hard to come by, and if we don't get it, we're in for the long haul with no quick way to resolve it.'' Jack Donlan, the director of the N.F.L. Management Council, representing the owners, said: ''We never anticipated a hearing.'' 'Maybe Tomorrow, Fellas' ''I see this hardly as anything more than the union viewing this as 'Maybe tomorrow, fellas, Maybe tomorrow, fellas,' '' Donlan said, referring to the union's hope that unrestricted free agency will come in a matter of days. ''I've said all along, this at some point and time will be decided at the table with a collective-bargaining agreement,'' Donlan said. Doty is scrutinizing two primary factors in making his decision on whether to grant the injunction. First, he will have decided how the Norris-La Guardia Act, which limits injunction in labor cases, applies. He will also have to decide how much irreparable harm would be caused to the players if the injunction is not granted, how much harm to management will be caused if it is granted, how likely the players would be to prevail in a trial and what affect an injuction would have on the public interest. In his decision, he will analyze the policy underlying Federal labor law and Federal antitrust law.

1387-> Lake Mendocino Journal; Landlocked 'Jaws' Grabs Attention
When people here say that the fish are really biting this year, they have teeth marks on their legs to prove it. In at least half a dozen incidents over the last two weeks, fish have latched on to swimmers and boaters as though they were auditioning for another sequel to ''Jaws.'' Three of the victims have required medical treatment. ''By golly, there's something unusual going on here,'' said Weldon E. Jones, a biologist with the State Department of Fish and Game in nearby Ukiah. ''Generally, fish don't attack people.'' Lake Mendocino, about 120 miles north of San Francisco, is an important camping and recreation area for residents of Northern California. The Army Corps of Engineers created it in 1958 by building Coyote Dam on the east fork of the Russian River. But despite a record heat wave that kept temperatures near 110 degrees all last week, the lake was virtually empty of swimmers. ''The numbers are way down,'' said Adam Duce, who has a summer job cleaning picnic and camping areas and clearing brush and fallen tree branches. ''There's almost no one coming here since the biting started.'' Mr. Duce's co-worker, James M. Hetfield, said he subscribes to a theory receiving wide acceptance locally: someone has released South American piranhas in the lake. ''They sense blood, like sharks,7' he said, ''and if you get in their territory, they'll bite.'' A competing theory, equally intriguing, has it that because the lake lies atop a former Pomo Indian burial site, ancestral spirits are taking their revenge. Last week, in the interests of scientific discovery and increased tourism, Mr. Jones led an investigative team onto the lake at night in an aluminum- hulled boat rigged with a 300-volt device that temporarily stuns fish, allowing them to be caught in nets and inspected. Thirteen species were found, including shad, bluegill, bass, bullhead and Mississippi silverside, but no piranhas. Among the discoveries were a 17-inch bass and a 24-inch catfish, both of which were capable of delivering the bites, Mr. Jones said. He said that a combination of late spawning because of the heat and poor foraging conditions had likely made the fish ''a little cranky and protective of their nests.'' He said that in past years biologists had bred larger, more aggressive fish in the lake in order to maintain a balance and to provide anglers with a good catch. But had they inadvertently created carnivorous catfish and killer largemouth bass? ''We've certainly produced a better-growing fish,'' Mr. Jones said. ''But there may be some undesirable aspects, like biting people.'' Mr. Jones acknowledged that the Army Corps of Engineers, which administers the lake, has received telephoned reports that people had taken fish related to piranhas from their home aquariums and released them into the lake. He added, however, that such reports did not worry him because piranhas need very warm water to survive. ''They can't exist in the wild here,'' he said. Trouble is, people say, the long spell of hot weather has caused the water to be warmer than usual. The United States Bureau of Reclamation has even begun releasing colder water from the northernmost part of the state into the Sacramento River east of here to lower its temperature. The river water, at an unusually warm 59 degrees, threatens salmon eggs now hatching along a 65-mile-long spawning area. Furthermore, local confidence was badly shaken earlier in the week when a 13-year-old girl fishing with a worm on a line caught a piranha in the chilly waters of the Willamette River in western Oregon. It has generally been a difficult season in the relationship between humans and nature's other creatures. At Lake Shasta, 150 miles northeast of here, a vacationer awoke last week on his houseboat anchored in the middle of the lake to find his arm in the mouth of a black bear. A spokesman for the Department of Fish and Game said the bear had probably been attracted by the smell of food being cooked on the houseboat earlier and had made a slight error in judgment. The startled bear released the arm and swam away; the vacationer suffered only minor cuts. To the south, the village of Sausalito on San Francisco Bay has been invaded by spawning toadfish that make such an obnoxious humming noise at night that sleepless residents plan to gather on July 31 to answer them with a chorus of kazoos. Back at Lake Mendocino, Mr. Jones believes that the whole fish-biting saga will end up as a Gary Larson ''Far Side'' cartoon. He imagines a drawing of two fish telling tall tales over a glass of beer and one saying to the other, ''You should have seen the leg that got away.''

1389-> Manley Is Out for 30 Days
Dexter Manley, the Washington Redskins' defensive end, was placed on the 30-day nonfootball illness list yesterday by Pete Rozelle, the National Football League commissioner. ''I have instructed Dexter Manley to remain out of the Redskins' training camp until August 26,'' said Rozelle, who, after meeting with Manley last Friday, made his decision in accordance with the N.F.L.'s drug program. Under the program, which has been in effect since the beginning of the 1986 season, a player who tests positive twice for substance abuse must be placed on the nonfootball illness list for a minimum of 30 days. Treated Last Year Neither the league nor the Redskins would reveal what substance Manley tested positive for. Last year, Manley was treated for alcohol abuse in a Minnesota clinic. That treatment has been documented, and in March Rozelle and Manley had a meeting in which Rozelle was given an update on the situation. ''I had heard so much speculation and I'm happy and Dexter is happy that this is finally over,'' said Manley's attorney, Bob Woolf. ''We are certainly going to abide by the commissioner's decision. ''Dexter will continue on the alcohol treatment program he has undergone since the clinic, and he will probably be on that the rest of his life. He is a recovering alcoholic and admits that. But there have also been a lot of positive things in Dexter's life and he will continue in those, too.'' A Popular All-Pro The 29-year-old Manley is an All-Pro player and is the Redskins' career leader in sacks. He is one of the most vocal and popular Redskins and seems to manage to attract attention. For example, when the Redskins signed the former Chicago Bears' free agent, Wilber Marshall, to a five-year, $6 million contract, Manley criticized the decision as unfair and demanded to be traded. The Redskins have long viewed Manley as a player who needs motivation, structuring his contracts so that much of his salary comes from incentives. Last season, he earned $1,500 for every quarterback hurry, and he made 17 in 1986 for an extra $25,500. ''I just spoke to Dexter,'' Woolf said. ''He's glad this thing is finally settled and can't wait to join his teammates.'' Could Play in Opener Although he was placed on the 30-day list, Manley would still be eligible to play in the Super Bowl champions' regular-season opener Sept. 5 against the Giants. Joe Browne, a spokesman for the league, when asked if Rozelle's ruling involved new treatment, had no comment. Coach Joe Gibbs and General Manager Bobby Beathard of the Redskins also professed ignorance of whether Manley was undergoing treatment. ''I feel good about the fact that Dexter is in good hands,'' Gibbs said. ''There are people working with him to help him with his problem.'' Woolf said his client was not undergoing any new treatment. Instead, Woolf said, he was continuing the aftercare from his stay at Hazelden Institute in Minnesota. '30 Days Is a Long Time' Gibbs, speaking at a news conference at the team's training camp in Carlisle, Pa., said: ''I was talking to Dexter today and he missed being here and we miss him. Thirty days is a long time but it could be worse. I hope he gets back in here and we can get him ready. ''I didn't know what to expect. You never know. The commissioner could have kept him out indefinitely. ''We just talked about football. He said he brought this on himself. He didn't take it as seriously as he should have during the off season.''

1390-> Pakistanis Still Languish in Bangladesh Camps
To the Editor: President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq of Pakistan continually talks about democracy and constitutional law (''Another Broken Promise in Pakistan,'' editorial, June 18), but the ingredients of democracy - freedom of the press, freedom of speech, freedom for political prisoners and freedom of all political parties to take part in general elections - have always been resented by his Government. General Zia has dismissed the three-year-old elected Government of his hand-picked Prime Minister, Mohammed Khan Junejo, returned the country to his own authoritarian rule and called for a general election within 90 days. Since 1977, when the general seized power, he has ignored the vital issue of the 250,000 Pakistanis in Bangladesh camps. He has used many ploys to delay repatriation, which negates the initial principles and philosophy of the origins of Pakistan. After all, these Pakistanis staked their lives and property not once, but on two occasions - at the partition of India in 1947 and the willful secession of Bangladesh in 1971. The Government of Pakistan recognizes this problem, agrees that they are Pakistanis and is ready to repatriate them, and has been promising to address this vital issue since 1977. Now Pakistan contends that it need funds for transportation and rehabilitation. Several Islamic philanthropic organizations have volunteered the necessary funds, but the matter is still delayed under one pretext or another. During these years the quarter of a million Pakistanis have, while hoping for repatriation, been turned into a hapless, forsaken lot, living the most miserable life in shanty camps in abject poverty and total degradation; their whole personality has been shattered and irrevocably changed. For years they have waited, prayed and pleaded, but to no avail, while the Pakistan Government has procrastinated and dragged its feet, making excuses, the predominant one being financial and social strain. Who is going to believe General Zia's announcement on television June 15 that the Islamic legal code, known as Sharia, will be the supreme law in Pakistan? ''All future law-making at the Federal and provincial levels must conform to Sharia,'' he said. But he has not brought any Pakistanis from Bangladesh over the last 17 years. How can he speak of Sharia? Which comes first in Islam, Sharia or humanity? JAVED HASHMI Public Relations Secy., Intl. Council for Repatriation of Pakistanis New York, June 21, 1988

1391-> Marriott Net Increases 1%
The Marriott Corporation, which owns hotels and restaurants, said yesterday that net income for the second quarter had risen 1 percent, to $64.5 million, or 53 cents a share, from $63.9 million, or 47 cents a share, a year earlier. Marriott, based in Bethesda, Md., said sales for the period had risen 14 percent, to $1.7 billion from $1.49 billion. For the six-month period, Marriott reported an increase in net income of 4.5 percent, to $109.3 million from $104.6 million. Earnings per share rose to 89 cents from 77 cents. Sales rose 14 percent, to $3.33 billion from $2.91 billion. J.W. Marriott Jr., the company's chairman and president, credited the improvement in Marriott's results to an increase in occupancy in lodging operations and the addition of 28 hotels to the 377 in existence.

1392-> Lawsuit Accuses Lockheed Unit of Waste
A lawsuit unsealed today contends that workers at the Lockheed Missiles and Space Company used Government computers to run a football pool, built a private airplane at public expense and billed the Government for time used to write the Bible into a computer. ''I think we're looking at the tip of an iceberg as far as secret and top-secret programs go,'' said Margaret A. Newsham, 45, a former employee of Lockheed and one of the plaintiffs. Ms. Newsham, who appeared at a news conference today, was dismissed as a software analyst by Lockheed Missiles in 1984 for purportedly padding her time card. She was joined in the suit by Martin Overbeek Bloem, 34, an engineer who still works for the company. Under Federal law, if the unit of the Lockheed Corporation is found to have defrauded the Government, the plaintiffs would be entitled to claim a share in any money recovered. A Lockheed spokesman, George Mulhern, said, ''We very vigorously deny that false claims have been or are made or condoned by the company.''

1394-> Challenge for Jet Linebackers
They are ordinary players without extraordinary help in front of them or behind them, so the Jets' linebackers find themselves caught in the middle. The group that will be unveiled on Saturday for the exhibition opener at Philadelphia is missing two regulars. That makes the remaining linebackers' jobs doubly difficult. They must operate without a pass rush in front, and with inexperienced defensive backs behind. Bob Crable, the most experienced linebacker and the new signal-caller for the defense, will be out until the season starts as he nurses a sprained right knee. It is not the knee that was operated on a few years ago, but the injury comes at a time that Crable has been moved to inside right linebacker, a position he has not played in years. Gordon Has Bruised Thigh The other injured starter, Alex Gordon, theoretically the dangerous pass-rushing linebacker, has a thigh bruise that will sideline him for a week. But even when they return, they will join a unit that needs time. ''We're in a state of identifying people,'' the linebacker coach, Jim Vechiarella, conceded today. ''Right now, we're installing them.'' The Jets have not had a dominating linebacker since Joe Klecko helped make Lance Mehl great in the early 1980's. Klecko, the defensive lineman, was often double-teamed and even triple-teamed. That allowed Mehl, who played behind him, to charge in and make tackles. Mehl recently retired, though, after a second serious knee injury. In theory, the Jets will open the season with Gordon at outside left linebacker, Troy Benson inside left, Crable inside right, and Kevin McArthur and Onzy Elam sharing the outside right spot. Elam would see action during passing situations. For now, though, Ken Rose will take Gordon's spot while Kyle Clifton takes over for Crable. ''Crable's injury has set him back,'' said Vechiarella. ''There's a lot of new responsibility back there. But he's got a lot of skills to be a leader.'' Crable, entering his seventh season, was hurt during practice Wednesday. He was the Jets' top pick in 1982. Late in the 1984 season, he suffered a knee injury that required major surgery and that kept him out of part of the 1985 season as well. Gordon, never known as a pass rusher in college, was the Jets' No. 2 draft choice last year. He picked up two sacks in the second game, at New England, but was affected more than most players by the strike. ''He had just started to learn,'' said Vechiarella. ''But he missed a lot of work with the strike and then he had to start all over again. In camp he was making great progress last week until he was hurt.'' TV Doubleheader The Jets-Eagles game will be shown on tape over Channel 11 after the live telecast of the Giants-Packers game at 8 P.M. . . . Kyle Mackey will take over Saturday night from Ken O'Brien, indicating that Mackey could be the No. 3 quarterback behind O'Brien and Pat Ryan. Giants' Roberts Stays Home William Roberts, the Giants' starting left tackle, who injured his ankle early this week, did not travel with the club to Green Bay for the game Saturday night. Mike Ariey, a free agent out of San Diego State, will start in his place and will split time with Eric Moore, the No. 1 draft pick, who signed on Monday. ----Roberts Stays Home William Roberts, the Giants' starting left tackle, who injured his ankle early this week, did not travel with the club to Green Bay for the game Saturday night.

1396-> Indicted GAF Executive Is a Student of Chess
In describing why he loved the game of chess so much, James T. Sherwin told a reporter last year: ''You can engage in diversionary tactics. You can try to fool your opponent into thinking you can do one thing and you're really doing something else.'' Yesterday Mr. Sherwin, once the third-ranked chess player in the nation and now vice chairman of the GAF Corporation, was indicted by a Federal grand jury for purportedly using similar tactics to outwit the stock market for the benefit of GAF. The United States Attorney's office in Manhattan has also brought stock-manipulation charges against GAF. No other executives, including Samuel J. Heyman, GAF's chairman and chief executive, have been charged. College at Age 16 Mr. Sherwin, who is known as mild-mannered and quietly intense, is a New York native who attended Stuyvesant High School and entered Columbia College at the age of 16, later graduating with top honors. He ultimately went to Columbia Law School and began a career in law working for the firm of Kaye Scholer Fierman Hays & Handler. In 1960, he joined GAF, where he rose as a protege of the late Jesse Werner, Mr. Heyman's predecessor. Mr. Sherwin left the company in 1983 to accept a post as executive vice president and chief financial officer for Triangle Industries. Shortly after that Mr. Heyman took control of GAF, after a long proxy fight, and he tenaciously courted Mr. Sherwin to return. Mr. Sherwin did come back to GAF in mid-1984 as the second in command. Since then people who have watched GAF have remarked that its business strategies often have the hallmarks of a very sophisticated chess game. In Mr. Sherwin's office, an elegant chess board is usually set up with a game that seems to be in progress. The arrangement often features an opening that Mr. Sherwin has used successfully in chess matches. It is called the Samish Variation against the King's Indian Defense. 'A Normal Amount of Risk' Edmar Mednis, a longtime friend of Mr. Sherwin's and a professional chess player, said the Samish Variation says something about Mr. Sherwin's style of playing chess: ''It's a normal amount of risk, but Jimmy was never a crazy wild attacking player. He liked active play but on a sound foundation.'' Although Mr. Sherwin no longer competes regularly in championship play, he is the president of the American Chess Foundation and is a play-by-play commentator for chess matches broadcast on public television. ''In the chess community he has a reputation for unimpeachable integrity,'' said Allen Kaufman, executive director of the American Chess Foundation. Shelby Lyman, who is a television chess commentator with Mr. Sherwin, once told a reporter how Mr. Sherwin had attended an important match the day after having surgery to repair a broken elbow and shattered wrist. ''He was in pain, but he pushed it aside,'' Mr. Lyman had said. Mr. Kaufman also recalls that he and Mr. Sherwin, when they were both just out of college and short on money, hitchhiked to California to compete in an important tournament. Visions of Chess Pieces Mr. Sherwin has admitted that he takes a chess magazine to bed every night ''just to put visions of chess pieces in my head before I sleep.'' But at least one friend said there might possibly be differences between Mr. Sherwin's code of behavior at the chess board and elsewhere. ''Personally, it's of very high order,'' said Mr. Mednis, who said that Mr. Sherwin's personal morality ''is impeccable'' - business aside. ''But notice my qualification,'' he added. ''Jimmy once made a comment to me which I thought was interesting - 'in business there are times when you would be willing to absorb more legal risk than you would in your own personal affairs' - which made me think in point of fact he is willing to do more things as part of his job than he would be himself personally.'' Mr. Sherwin lives in Princeton, N.J., with his wife, the former Hiroko Yoshikawa. He has three children from a previous marriage.

Wendy's International Inc., the fast-food restaurant company, said that it had adopted a plan intended to protect shareholder interests in an unfair takeover effort. Wendy's said the shareholder rights plan was not adopted in response to any known takeover effort. Under the plan, shareholders will receive for each share a right to buy, if certain conditions are met, a fraction of a share of a new series of preferred stock for $25. The price of the company's stock on the New York Stock Exchange fell 12.5 cents, to $5.875. On Thursday, the company had reported a fivefold increase in second-quarter earnings, to $9.6 million, from $1.9 million in the year-earlier period. Revenues rose only slightly, to $275.1 million, from $270.5 million.

1399-> Ex-Bendix Chairman's Fresh Start
The board of the Morrison-Knudsen Corporation tapped one of its own yesterday as chairman and chief executive - William M. Agee, the brash and controversial former chairman of the Bendix Corporation. Mr. Agee, who is 50 years old, is a native of Boise, Idaho, where Morrison-Knudsen is based, and has been a director of the construction and engineering company for 11 years. William J. Deasy, 51, who had been the company's chief executive, will continue as president and add the title of chief operating officer. The chairman's post had been vacant since William H. McMurren died of cancer in 1985. The Battle at Bendix Mr. Agee's career at Bendix was cut short when he led initiated a takeover attempt of the Martin Marietta Corporation in 1982. Martin Marietta turned on its attacker and began buying Bendix stock, in one of the first examples of a ''Pac-Man'' defense. Both companies spent millions of dollars and neither prevailed. Instead, Bendix was taken over by the Allied Corporation, now Allied-Signal Inc., in early 1983. And Martin Marietta was left heavily in debt. Mr. Agee also made an unsuccessful takeover run at the RCA Corporation and stirred a controversy at Bendix when he rapidly promoted Mary E. Cunningham to vice president for strategic planning. They later married but denied having any romantic involvement while at Bendix. Catherine Clark, the analyst for Reich & Tang L.P., a money-management concern that is a large investor in Morrison-Knudsen, said the company's switch from an engineering-oriented chief executive to one who treats companies like stocks in a portfolio is likely to shake things up. 'I Can Do the Job' Mr. Agee is considered an able financial operator as he takes on the mission of reviving Morrison-Knudsen. The company lost $59 million on revenue of $1.86 billion last year, reflecting heavy write-offs from a real estate operation that was discontinued and the disappointing performance of its West Coast shipyard. The company, for all its red ink, has little debt and reasonably strong cash flow, and it could tackle a large acquisition - especially if it raises additional capital through asset sales, investment bankers and analysts said. Mr. Agee said he was not reluctant to become chairman and chief executive of the construction and engineering company, even though he does not have an engineering background. ''There's no question in my mind that I can do the job,'' he said. A long-time adviser to the company commented: ''Bill has been a very active board member. If there was going to be a change, Bill makes a logical choice.'' Mr. Deasy will now run operations, where he has spent the bulk of his career, while Mr. Agee focuses on strategic planning and financial management. Agee's Other Venture Since leaving Bendix, Mr. Agee and his wife have founded Semper Enterprises, a venture capital firm in Osterville, Mass. Mr. Agee said he would remain involved at Semper on a ''very limited basis'' and would reduce his involvement with the dozen or so companies in Semper's portfolio. Last month, Morrison-Knudsen's stock rose sharply after Edward F. Heil, an Illinois businessman in the construction business, disclosed that he owned 6.2 percent of the company and might seek a seat on the board. The company has rebuffed his overtures and installed a ''poison pill'' defense, and Mr. Heil amended his filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission to state that he is a passive investor. 'Generally Favorable View' ''I would say he has a generally favorable view of Mr. Agee but has not had an opportunity to meet with him,'' said Mr. Heil's lawyer, Thomas McNamara, of Jenner & Block in Chicago. Morrison-Knudsen's stock rose $1.50 yesterday, to $43.50, on heavy volume on the New York Stock Exchange. Mr. Agee said the shipbuilding operation, which had operating losses of $10.7 million on revenues of $115 million in 1987, would report to him. If the unit loses all the contracts it is currently bidding on, he said, ''it obviously forces us to take a hard look at curtailment or restructuring.'' ''On the other hand, if we get one or two, that could look a bit better for us,'' he said. Unexpected Costs Morrison-Knudsen's earnings were also hurt in the second quarter of 1988 when it took an additional $65 million pretax charge for unexpected costs in liquidating the real estate portfolio and a $20 million pretax loss provision for cost overruns on its Navy contracts. Mr. Agee said he planned to spend at least $30 million to expand existing divisions. Last year, the company spent $49 million. He did not rule out acquisitions as a way to rebuild some of the company's stronger business lines, including contract coal mining, construction and engineering and railcar manufacturing. Ms. Clark of Reich & Tang, estimated that the company would produce $6 to $7 a share in cash flow in 1988. ''Earnings haven't looked good,'' she said, ''but as far as financial shape, which I define as low debt, good cash flow and staying power, they're one of the best.'' Rebuilding Confidence Some impressive rebuilding will be needed to regain the confidence of some investors who have been selling the stock lately. ''The management to me lost credibility,'' said Ronald L. Welburn, portfolio manager for Glickenhaus & Company, which sold its Morrison-Knudsen shares after the company announced its second-quarter results. Mr. Agee's new position represents a coming home. He attended the University of Idaho before earning a master's degree in business administration from Harvard University in 1963. He then returned to his hometown to work for the Boise Cascade Corporation and became a senior vice president by 1971. Mr. Agee said he has spent ''60-plus percent'' of his life in the Boise area. Mr. Agee joined Bendix in 1972 as chief financial officer. He became its chairman in 1976, at the age of 38. He married Ms. Cunningham, who is also a Harvard business school graduate, in 1982.

1400-> Hostage Dies as German Drama Ends
A hostage was killed and two fleeing bank robbers were seriously hurt today when they were captured in a shoot-out with the police on a highway near here, ending a two-and-a-half-day ordeal for a busload of people held hostage. The 54-hour episode, much of it televised, attracted wide attention in West Germany after the team first robbed a Gladbeck bank Tuesday and took two hostages. The two robbers and a woman who was their accomplice then seized a bus with about 25 people on board and led a wild police pursuit interspersed with periodic standoffs and widely publicized interviews. The ambush today on the Cologne-Frankfurt Autobahn ended a 430-mile trip during which the robbers were chased by hundreds of policemen in cars and helicopters and crowds of journalists. The killing of the hostage today brought the final toll to three dead. At a stop on Wednesday near Bremen, about 130 miles from the bank robbery, a 16-year-old Italian hostage from the bus was shot dead by the gunmen. Also Wednesday, a police officer was killed in a road accident during the chase. Bank Employees Seized During the bank robbery in Gladbeck, in the Ruhr region, on Tuesday morning, the gunmen took two bank employees hostage. Soon after that, they chose to deal with the police through a radio program. After the police granted them a car and some money, they fled and officers lost the trail. On Wednesday, they surfaced in the northern city of Bremen, taking a third hostage before hijacking a public bus with nearly 30 passengers. They then allowed themselves to be interviewed by television and other reporters, and, waving their revolvers, even let a television crew onto the hijacked bus. Shortly after that, outside Bremen, they allowed two journalists to replace the two bank employees as hostages just before the young Italian, Emanuele de Georgi, was shot in the head. His body was dragged off the bus by the journalists. The gunmen then took the bus across the Dutch border, a few miles into Dutch territory, where it was surrounded by police cars early today. Then, with a new getaway car provided by the Dutch police, the two gunmen and their accomplice took two young women off the bus as hostages and sped back to West Germany. By lunchtime today they were parked outside a cafe in the middle of Cologne, surrounded by journalists. Sitting in the auto and still brandishing their revolvers, they were filmed drinking coffee and smoking, and, together with the hostages, were interviewed by television and radio reporters. Auto Forced Off Road After the interviews, Udo Robel, deputy editor of the Cologne daily Express, squeezed into the sedan to help the gangsters find their way out of the city. He was dropped off on the Cologne-Frankfurt highway shortly before the shoot-out. As their car approached the ambush spot on the highway, which was busy with vacation traffic, several armored vehicles forced the gangsters' auto off the road and rammed it before hurling stun grenades and opening fire. One of the hostages, an 18-year-old woman, was shot in the heart and killed. The other, also an 18-year-old woman, was seriously wounded. The police identified the gunmen as Hans-Jurgen Rosner, 31, and Dieter Degowski, 32, both of whom had long criminal records. Mr. Rosner was first convicted when only 14 years old and had served 11 years in prison before he absconded while on parole two years ago. The accomplice was identified as Marion Loblich, 34 years old, Mr. Rosner's companion. Press Coverage Criticized The episode brought criticism of both the extensive press coverage and the police handling of the affair. In an interview on West German television tonight, Herbert Schnoor, the Interior Minister of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, accused journalists of interfering with and hampering police operations. Mr. Schnoor defended the police actions in the ambush, saying it was necessary because the gangsters had become uncontrollable. ''We would have liked to have avoided it, but we saw that they were so unpredictable that we had to intervene,'' he said. ''It is a terrible failure when a hostage we wanted to protect is killed.'' Heinz Gunther Husch, a conservative member of Parliament, said the police had been wrong to wait. ''They should have acted more decisively, even if this would have meant risking the death of the hostages,'' he said. Burkhard Hirsch, a Liberal Free Democratic member of Parliament, said he was concerned that ''two criminals got a public podium through media coverage.'' Johannes Gester, a Conservative member of Parliament, said: ''It is unbearable that gangsters are able to parade themselves on television. The public should be informed, but not at the cost of the hostages and police.''

1401-> FUTURES/OPTIONS; Soybeans Rise for 3d Day On Dry-Weather Forecasts
The price of soybean futures advanced yesterday for the third day on the Chicago Board of Trade amid weather forecasts that raised the prospect of further damage to the vulnerable soybean crop. Grain futures were mixed in light and cautious trading. On other markets, livestock and meat futures rose, and energy futures rallied. Analysts said the support in the soybean market stemmed in part from lighter-than-expected rainfall on Thursday night and yesterday in the central Corn Belt, where soybean plants stunted by drought are struggling to produce pods and beans. Forecasts for hot, dry weather in the Midwest next week added strength to the soybean market, as did expectations that the Agriculture Department would reduce its 1988 estimates of soybean production in a report scheduled to be released next Thursday. Last month, the department estimated soybean production at 1.65 billion bushels. A reduction would reflect further deterioration in July. The estimates released last Thursday and yesterday by several private analysts estimated soybean production at between 1.42 billion and 1.54 billion bushels. Trading was relatively light yesterday despite the bullish weather and crop forecasts. The analysts said many traders were still reacting to losses sustained when the grain markets turned sharply lower about two and a half weeks ago after a weekend of unexpectedly heavy rain. ''People are very reluctant to take positions over the weekend,'' said Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research Department Inc. in Chicago. After yesterday's close, the National Weather Service predicted above-normal temperatures and rainfall that is expected to be normal to below-normal in the Midwest for five days beginning next Thursday. On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, most cattle futures prices rose for the third day on indications of stronger demand for beef by retailers, said Thomas Morgan, the president of the Sterling Research Corporation in Arlington Heights, Ill. He said that cash cattle prices were holding steady despite more slaughters. ''Retail demand is good,'' Mr. Morgan said. ''They're featuring beef and not featuring chicken because chicken prices are so high.'' He added that pork futures rallied in a mostly technical rebound from depressed levels. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, energy futures rallied, also on technical factors, because of the absence of new developments in supply and demand, the analysts said. ''There doesn't appear to be any news coming out of OPEC one way or the other in the future, so the technicals are taking over for the time being,'' said Sharokh Nikkhah, a vice president of energy futures trading for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 23 cents to 30 cents higher, with September delivery at $15.26 a barrel.

1402-> Johnson Calls, Myers Delivers
For the 28th time this season, Dave Johnson flashed the red-alert message to the bullpen: Send Myers. And for the 18th time, Randy Myers trotted to the mound with his heater and either won or saved a game for the Mets with his strikeout pitching. This time, he even trotted into the game in the seventh inning with the Mets leading the Cincinnati Reds by one run, two men on base and a count of two balls and no strikes on Kal Daniels, who had hit a home run off Ron Darling one inning earlier. Myers fired the heater three times and restored peace, wiped out the next six batters, nobody hit the ball out of the infield and the Mets beat the Reds, 5-4, last night. Myers, who is 27 years old and a certified flake from Vancouver, Wash., has become so important to the Mets this season that his manager even calls for him in advance. Not Feeling Well ''I was feeling queasy and came into my office to lie down in the seventh inning,'' Johnson said. ''Before I left the dugout, I told Mel Stottlemyre, 'If Darling gets into trouble, get Myers up.' ''I was lying down watching on my TV, and I saw Ronnie hit Barry Larkin with a pitch. So, as bad as I felt, I hustled outside again. And, by then, he had two balls on Daniels. So, I got Myers in there right away.'' Johnson shook his head in some wonder, and said: ''It only takes him five or six pitches to get ready. He gets warmed up faster than it takes him to tie his shoelaces.'' ''When you come in with two balls and no strikes on the hitter,'' Myers said, describing his high-risk occupation, ''you can't fool around. And you can't throw it down the middle. I worked both corners, and then threw a slider outside and got him.'' Darling needed a fast rescue operation because he blew his lead in one of the fastest sequences in memory. He went into the sixth leading by 2-0, suddenly surrendered two singles and two home runs and just as suddenly four runs crossed for Cincinnati. ''It was some of the best stuff I had all year,'' Darling said later. ''But it's kind of scary when you give up four runs. And it'll probably go down in history as the fastest four runs on record. About a minute and a half. But I got behind two big hitters, came in with the next pitches and they took me out.'' All things considered, Pete Rose concluded, even after beating the Mets twice in three nights with stout pitching of his own, it's not likely that anybody will shove the Mets around much this season. ''Resist the Mets?'' the master of the Reds asked. ''Nobody can do it. Their pitching is too good.'' ''But in the playoffs, you could beat them,'' he said, not conceding everything. ''Look at the way we pitched them here. After two games, if this was the playoff, we would've been 2 and 0.'' But last night, he tried to make it three in a row with a rookie pitcher with the storybook name of Jack Armstrong. But this Jack Armstrong had been a big leaguer for less than one month, and still hadn't won anything. This was his fourth start in the big leagues, and he invited trouble in the first inning when he walked Wally Backman with one down and tried to throw his fastball past Darryl Strawberry with two down. Strawberry knocked the ball high and deep into the yard beyond the bullpen in right field, out where the visiting team parks its bus. It was his 21st home run of the year, the most in the National League, and it gave Darling two runs to protect. Darling did exactly that for five innings. He allowed only a walk to Kal Daniels and a single to Chris Sabo in the first inning, but survived. Then he retired 14 of the next 15 batters he faced until Larkin singled to left with one down in the sixth. Now the batter was Daniels, and Darling got behind, two balls and no strikes. And Daniels drove the next pitch into the left-field bulpen for a 2-2 tie. Now the Reds were crouched. Chris Sabo singled and Paul O'Neil hit a home run over the fence in right, and the Mets suddenly trailed by two. But Armstrong opened the home half of the sixth by giving up a double to Kevin McReynolds, and he was gone. With Strawberry waving his bat, Pete Rose called for the left-handed Rob Murphy, who responded to the immediate problem by striking him out. But the long-range problem remained. Howard Johnson drew a walk, Dave Magadan singled to right and the Mets were one run away. Then Gary Carter pinch-hit for Mackey Sasser and lined a single to left, and they were all even again. It was ironic: Carter had gone to bat 27 times in 11 years without delivering a pinch-hit, and now in 1988 he had delivered three in three times at bat. He also chased Rob Murphy from the game in favor of the right-handed Rob Dibble, who struck out Kevin Elster. But then, the coup de grace: Darling lined the next pitch into center for a single, the third run crossed, the Mets snatched the lead and set the stage for Randy Myers one more time.

1403-> In Yonkers, 4,000 Units Are Delayed
When four members of the Yonkers City Council decided to defy a court-ordered housing desegregation plan, they did so by voting down an amendment to the city's zoning ordinance that would dramatically change future development in Yonkers. The effect of their vote against the amendment was to reject the second phase of the housing plan, the construction of 800 moderate-income apartments. Last January the Council, against angry protests from residents, approved the first phase, 200 units of low-income public housing. But the practical effect of the amendment, the 27-page Affordable Housing Ordinance, would be the construction of 4,000 new apartments in the next four years, in developments twice as dense as the city's zoning now allows. That would mean 1,000 apartments a year, three to four times what Yonkers, a city of 194,000 people, has annually added to its housing stock in recent years. 'Asking a Lot' ''That is a pretty heavy absorption,'' said Howard P. Sturman, a real-estate developer from Mount Vernon who is about to build 600 condominiums on the Hudson River in Yonkers. ''If the horizon were longer,'' he continued, ''it might be doable, because Yonkers has so much to offer as a residential community, but that is asking a lot.'' The 800 units of housing are part of a long-term housing plan ordered by Judge Leonard B. Sand of Federal District Court in Manhattan to correct discrimination against minorities in Yonkers's housing policies. Proposals are already being taken from private developers to build the other 200 low-income units. It is the way in which the moderate-income housing is to be built that will bring sweeping changes to the physical makeup of the city and its planning process. The 800 units, intended for families making from $14,750 to $35,400, will be spread out across north and east Yonkers in predominantly white, middle-class areas by requiring any builder of a project with more than 10 units to price 20 percent at a rate affordable to such families. The other 80 percent would be priced at full-market levels. The units can be built in the form of condominiums, cooperatives or rental apartments, but home ownership is preferred under the plan. To attract developers despite the middle-income requirement, the city, the plaintiffs and a housing adviser to Judge Sand created an package of incentives, outlined in the zoning amendment that has twice been rejected by the councilmen. Tax-Free Materials The lures include an automatic doubling of a site's density, abatements or reductions in city real-estate taxes on the cheaper units, and discounts on utility costs for the first six years. In addition, developers can ask the city to change the zoning of a parcel from commercial to residential and would be able to buy construction materials tax-free. The incentives are intended to enable the developers to turn a profit despite pricing 20 percent of the units below the market, and several developers have already expressed interest to Oscar Newman, the housing expert who advises Judge Sand and helped draft the plan. But in case enough developers do not come forward to reach the goal of 200 units of affordable housing a year, Mr. Newman said he has identified 10 parcels of city-owned land that would be turned over to developers for free or to a nonprofit developer. Overwhelmed Neighborhoods? But some 3,000 units that have already been approved by all the necessary city agencies - including 1,800 in a Hudson River redevelopment plan -will not be subject to these requirements. Many residents fear that the buildings would overwhelm neighborhoods with single-family and two-family homes. On Monday the Yonkers Planning Board voted, 4 to 1, against the ordinance, arguing that it would kill its power to reasonably shape the city and that it would permit high-rise buildings in single-family neighborhoods. Almost half of Yonkers is zoned for residential uses, while only 9 percent is zoned for commercial or industrial. Thirty-five percent of the residential area is made up of one- and two-family homes; there are 13,565 cooperative apartments and condominiums and another 47,898 rentals. But the housing plan essentially permits developers to go up in height just one notch in a neighborhood. For instance, in an area with single-family homes, a builder could put up two-story row houses. Where there are row houses, a builder could construct three-story walk-ups. Existing walk-ups will have as neighbors five- or six-story buildings with elevators and those, in turn, would stand next to new 12-story structures. Mr. Newman indicated that 12 stories would most likely be the height limit. A developer working in an eight-story zone would be able to increase the height to 12 stories, not 16, but he or she would be allowed to have a ''90-10'' mix, which would make up for the smaller density bonus. Of the 800 units, 10 percent will be one-bedroom apartments, 60 percent will be two-bedrooms and 30 percent will have three bedrooms. A four-person household will occupy a two-bedroom apartment. The plan requires that the lower priced units be fully integrated with and look the same as the market-rate units. But because apartments on upper floors usually sell for more than those on lower floors, developers will be able to set aside the top two floors for the market-rate units. First Preference People who now live in public or subsidized housing in Yonkers will be given first preference in these apartments, followed by Yonkers residents and those who work in Yonkers. All must meet the income requirements, which were created according to the median income in the New York metropolitan region, as determined by the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. As of January 1987, the median income for a four-person household was $29,500. In order to buy an apartment or home in Yonkers in today's competitive market, however, one must be making 150 percent of that figure. Therefore, the 800 units will be available to those making between 50 and 120 percent of the median income, or from $14,750 to $35,400 for a four-person household. The average occupant will have an annual salary of $26,181. Under the guidelines, residents in the affordable units can pay no more than 30 percent of their monthly incomes on rent, in the case of rental units, or in maintenance fees and mortgage payments, in condominiums and co-ops. Given the expected income range, monthly payments would range from $369 to $885 a month. When one tenant moves out of an affordable rental, the next tenant will have to meet the same income requirements. With the co-ops and condominiums, the owner ''will be able to sell it for more than he got it, but will not be able to sell it at the market rate,'' Mr. Newman said, adding that the owner-occupied units will remain affordable for 30 years, at which time the condominium owners association will be able to treat them as market-rate units. The question of who will oversee the building boom is still unsettled. Under the current plan, there would be an Office of Housing Implementation that would attract developers and help them with their proposals, but the usual city agencies and the City Council would handle the review process. But Mr. Newman said that ''foreseeing the kind of difficulty that has attended the passage of anything to date,'' Judge Sand might appoint an independent commission, to work in tandem with the Office of Housing Implementation, once the zoning ordinance is finally enacted.

1409-> Democrats Never Lost Because of Liberalism; Two Essential Forces
To the Editor: Rachel C. Reinstein (''An American Legacy,'' letter, Aug. 30) repeats the error of which she complains. First, she argues that her creed, liberalism, should be defined in terms of its finest accomplishments; then she depicts the conservative as a greedy infant. She can't have it both ways. If she wants to define her own faith by its best side only, then in fairness she must indulge the fantasies of the conservative as well. If she can say that the conservative is just greedy, then certainly the conservative can say that she is just naive. Better would be an attitude of independence from both these positions. Then we could more clearly see how our political history is the product of a constantly evolving tension between a force that primarily seeks to preserve the established culture and a force that seeks primarily to perfect it. The aim of politics in America ought to be the unity of these forces, since both are essential and neither is avoidable. CARL OGLESBY Cambridge, Mass., Aug. 30, 1988

1410-> COMPANY NEWS; Rolls-Royce Gets $1.69 Billion Order
Rolls-Royce P.L.C. said it had received a $1.69 billion order from American Airlines to provide engines for the airline's Boeing 757 fleet. Rolls-Royce said the order was one of the biggest airline engine contracts in history. American, the third-largest United States carrier, has plans to buy 50 Boeing 757 jets with an option for another 50. The value of the contract includes expected spares for the life of the planes. Deliveries are due to start next year. Rolls-Royce, the smallest of the three leading airline engine manufacturers, competes with the General Electric Company and the Pratt & Whitney division of the United Technologies Corporation. Rolls-Royce said that the RB211-535E4 series engine had been selected for more than 75 percent of the 757's ordered or delivered.

1411-> Health: Birth Control; Despite Widespread Fear, IUD's Are Safe for Many Women
Women in monogamous relationships who use an intrauterine device for birth control are at no higher risk of developing pelvic inflammatory disease than women who do not use contraceptives, a new study has found. Although in women who are not monogamous the devices increase the risk of the disease, which can cause infertility, the risky period is confined to the first four months after the device is inserted, other studies have found. And other evidence suggests that this risk may be reduced if women take an antibiotic when the IUD is inserted. The new findings and other evidence counter the widely held impression that the IUD is inherently dangerous for all women. The research is increasingly allowing doctors to identify women for whom the device is most likely to pose a risk of disease, and those for whom the risk is low. Award Renewed Alarm New alarms about IUD's were raised last week when a Minnesota woman, Esther R. Kociemba, was awarded $8.75 million in her case against G. D. Searle & Company, which made the Copper-7 IUD. Mrs. Kociemba had a Copper-7 IUD inserted in 1977 and, 12 days later, had a pelvic infection that left her unable to have children. A jury in Federal District Court in St. Paul found that Searle, a unit of the Monsanto Company, was negligent in testing the Copper-7 and failing to warn Mrs. Kociemba that the device could cause infection and infertility. Hundreds of cases against Searle are still pending. Medical experts say, however, that any legal findings of improper action by IUD makers in failing to provide women with proper warning of the known risks does not contradict the growing scientific understanding of what those risks are and how they vary among individuals. Scientists say that monogamous women have less risk when they use IUD's because they are less likely to be exposed to sexually transmitted diseases, particularly gonnorrhea and chlamydia. These bacterial infections are the leading cause of pelvic inflammatory disease. Bacteria Is Danger When an IUD is inserted, it can carry with it vaginal bacteria that can infect the uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes, where eggs are fertilized. Untreated, the infections can lead to tissue scarring and infertility. Some cases of pelvic inflammatory disease are caused by bacteria that are normally present in the vagina and rectum, said Dr. Nancy C. Lee of the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. But she said most are caused by sexually transmitted bacteria, without any use of IUD's. One type of IUD, the Dalkon Shield, which was marketed in the early 1970's, has been linked to disease problems in numerous court cases. Last month, a judge in Federal District Court in Richmond, Va., approved a plan to administer a trust fund of $2.4 billion among 195,000 women who claimed they were injured by the Dalkon Shield, made by A. H. Robins Company. But some of the women and their lawyers have challenged the plan as inadequate. Many researchers think the Dalkon Shield was more dangerous than other IUD's because it had a filamentous tail that could transmit bacteria into the uterus. ''There's the Dalkon Shield, and then there's everything else,'' said Dr. David Grimes of the University of Southern California Medical School in Los Angeles. ''The Dalkon Shield episode tainted IUD's.'' Use Has Dropped ''There are 200 new articles a year published on IUD's and the data are remarkably consistent,'' Dr. Grimes said. ''The more we know, the better it looks.'' Neither the Dalkon Shield nor the Copper-7 is on the market in the United States, but two other IUD's are, one only since June. Recent studies indicate IUD use in the United States dropped 50 percent in the last five years, from 7 percent of the women trying to avoid pregnancy, to 3 percent. The studies were conducted by Jacqueline Forrest of the Alan Guttmacher Institute in New York, a nonprofit organization devoted to family planning, ''Women in this country have a skewed idea of the risks of IUD's,'' said Dr. Louise Tyrer of Planned Parenthood Federation in New York, who believes that the relative safety of IUD's when used by women at lowest risk of pelvic inflammatory disease is not widely appreciated. The role of IUD's in causing pelvic inflammatory disease has been difficult to study, in part because it most commonly occurs for reasons that have nothing to do with IUD's. A Common Infection The problem with IUD's has been ''guilt by association,'' said Dr. Grimes. Pelvic inflammatory disease is extraordinarily common, he explained, but many women who developed the disease and wore an IUD assumed that they would not have had the infection were it not for their IUD. A quarter of a million women are hospitalized each year for pelvic inflammatory disease and a million women develop the infection each year, Dr. Grimes said. Dr. Lee, in an analysis of data collected from 1976 to 1978 by the National Institute for Child Health and Human Development, looked at the risk of pelvic infection in IUD users who said they were monogamous. In her study, published in the July issue of Obstetrics and Gynecology, she found that women who were married or living in stable, monogamous relationships had no increased risk of infection when they used an I.U.D. In a previous analysis of these data, which did not account for the number of sexual partners a woman may have had, Dr. Lee and her colleagues found that the women had a nearly four-fold increase in their risk of pelvic disease in the first month after an IUD was inserted. Effect of Other Methods The risk decreased to about twice the normal in the second and third months, and after four months it was about the same as the risk of a woman who did not use a contraceptive. Barrier methods of birth control, such as condoms and diaphragms, seem to reduce the incidence of pelvic infections by blocking bacteria; birth control pills also offer some protection, possibly because they change the mucous over the cervix, the entrance to the uterus. Confirming the hypothesis that IUD's lead to infections because bacteria are pushed in with them when they are inserted, Dr. Grimes and his colleagues found that a single dose of an antibiotic when an IUD is inserted can cut the pelvic infection rate by a third. Dr. Grimes conducted his study in Nairobi, Kenya, with a group of 1,800 women who were at high risk of sexually transmitted diseases. Dr. Tyrer and other experts said that the ideal candidate for an IUD is a woman who is in a stable, mutually monogamous relationship, and who has no history of pelvic inflammatory disease. Dr. Tyrer also recommends that the women plan to have no more children, so that she will not be plagued with doubts and recriminations if she uses an IUD and then finds she is infertile. For appropriate candidates, IUD's can be extraordinarily safe and effective, Dr. Tyrer said. The Paragard, made by Gynopharma Inc. in Somerville, N.J., has a pregnancy rate of just 7 in 1,000 fertile women per year, which is better than the birth control pill, which has a failure rate of about about 20 per 1,000. This IUD, introduced last June, is a copper T-shaped device. The Progestasert, made by the Alza Corporation of Palo Alto, Calif., contains the female sex hormone progesterone and has been on the market since 1976. It has a failure rate of 2 to 3 percent a year, about the same as the pill, said Bonnie J. Burdett, an Alza spokeswoman.

1413-> CREDIT MARKETS; Treasury Issues Climb Modestly
Prices of Treasury bonds and notes rose modestly in very light trading yesterday as traders marked time until the weekend. ''There is very little customer involvement,'' one government securities trader said. ''The Street has pared down their positions, and we are looking toward the weekend. We are just sort of biding time.'' Traders either overlooked or shrugged off a news report that the Congressional Budget Office's mid-year economic review, to be released today, would include sharply lower estimates of the Federal budget deficit for the current and future fiscal years. The substance of the news report, which ran on Market News Service, was subsequently confirmed by officials at the budget office. $155 Billion Deficit Expected The Market News report said that the new estimate for the 1988 fiscal year deficit would be $155 billion, down from the $161 billion that was projected last winter. And for the fiscal year 1989, which begins Oct. 1, the budget office estimated that the deficit would total $148 billion, well below the $177 billion shortfall projected earlier. The lower deficit estimates reflect economic growth that has been much stronger than anticipated, the study reportedly states. That conclusion comes as no surprise to the credit markets, where interest rates have risen substantially since March. And analysts said it would be some time before the increase in rates had an effect on economic activity. More Tightening Predicted ''I would think that some fourth-quarter economic numbers will start to look somewhat softer than those we have seen through the first half of the year,'' said Louis v.B. Crandall, chief economist at R.H. Wrightson & Associates, an economic consulting firm. ''But between now and then the Fed will continue to tighten, and bonds will continue to do worse.'' Reflecting that continued tightening, Mr. Crandall said that yields on the Treasury's 9 1/8 percent bonds due in 2018 will rise to 10 percent ''or above'' by the end of the year. There was no upward pressure on yields yesterday, as technical factors continued to provide some underpinning to prices. By late in the day, the 9 1/8 percent issue was offered at 97 1/4, up slightly more than 1/8 point on the day, to yield nearly 9.40 percent. Meanwhile, the Treasury's 9 1/4 percent 10-year notes were offered at 99 3/8, up 3/32, to yield 9.34 percent. The market's sluggish activity and the fact that a slew of new notes and bills will be auctioned next week led some market participants to say that upward pressure on short-term interest rates could appear shortly. Among the Treasury issues to be sold next week are new two-year and five-year notes. The two-year notes, which will be sold on Tuesday, were offered on a when-issued basis late yesterday at a price to yield 8.73 percent, virtually unchanged from Wednesday's close. The five-year notes, to be auctioned Wednesday, were offered in when-issued trading yesterday at a price to yield 9.05 percent, unchanged on the day. Short-term Treasury bill rates were unchanged on the day. The Federal Reserve Board reported yesterday that the two broadest measures of the nation's money supply moved in opposite directions in the week ended Aug. 8. The Fed said that M-2 fell by $1 billion, to a seasonally adjusted $3,025.5 billion. An even broader measure, M-3, increased by $3 billion, to $3,824.8 billion. The money supply figures had no impact on bond prices. The Fed also said that discount window borrowings by banks from the Federal Reserve System averaged $556 million in the week ended Wednesday, up from $525 million the previous week. Activity in the secondary markets for corporate and tax-exempt municipal bonds was very light yesterday, with little or no movement in prices. The pace of business was much quicker in the new-issue market, however, as a number of borrowers used the second straight day of little or no movement in interest rates to price new issues. Tracor Bonds Priced Among the corporate issues priced yesterday was a two-part high-yield bond offering from Tracor Inc. The first part of the offering consisted of $190 million of 10-year senior subordinated notes. The notes, which carry a coupon of 14 percent, were priced at par, and are rated B-2 by Moody's Investors Service and B- by the Standard & Poor's Corporation. The second part, $367 million of subordinated discount debentures due in 2000, was priced at 46.767. These debentures will act like a zero-coupon bond until 1993, and then pay a 16 percent coupon thereafter. The debentures are rated B-3 by Moody's and B- by S.&P. Merrill Lynch Capital Markets acted as lead manager for the underwriting.

1417-> Dukakis Woos Southern Blacks And Denounces U.S. Drug Policy
Michael S. Dukakis stumped through the South today, delivering his strongest appeal yet to black voters in a citadel of the civil rights movement. He also attacked his Republican opponents, accusing them of failure in the war on drugs and the space program. In the Birmingham church where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. prayed over the coffins of three of the four black girls killed by a bomb 25 years ago, Mr. Dukakis vowed that his administration would never ''turn our heads and wish that hate crimes never took place.'' At the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., standing by a mock-up of a planned space station, he said the Reagan Administration had allowed the space program to lose its sense of purpose. And in Miami, where Mr. Dukakis basked in the ethnic pride of a Greek civic group's convention, he accused the White House of ''stonewalling'' a Congressional investigation into whether possible illegal activities by Panama's leader, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, had affected American foreign policy. Mr. Dukakis said the White House orders to agencies not to cooperate with the investigation were handed down out of fear that the inquiry might prove embarrassing. 'Nobody Is in Charge' The Democratic Presidential nominee also charged that Vice President Bush, his Republican rival, had failed in his duties in the war against drugs. ''Nobody is in charge,'' he declared. ''We have chaos again in the war against drugs, in the Pentagon.'' In Miami, Mr. Dukakis was asked whether he believed Senator Dan Quayle, Mr. Bush's running mate, should have served in Vietnam instead of joining the National Guard in 1969. He declined to answer, as he did when asked four times about the general issue of whether a citizen should join the armed forces in time of war. ''I can only speak for myself,'' said the Massachusetts Governor, who served in Korea as an Army prizvate from 1955 to 1957 after the war. ''I served my country. I did so proudly.'' The issue of the Noriega inquiry was addressed today in California by Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman. Mr. Fitzwater said the Administration would not provide the information concerning General Noriega because the Justice Department had concluded that the request was ''beyond G.A.O.'s statutory authority.'' ''Even were the request within the G.A.O.'s legal authority,'' he went on, ''there are statutory and constitutional objections to providing various specific categories of the information requested.'' He said the Administration objected, in particular, to the disclosure of intelligence and law-enforcement information. On the second day of a campaign trip during the Republican National Convention, Mr. Dukakis came to Birmingham to start what aides have promised would be a concerted effort to reach black voters, who largely eluded him in the primaries this year. ''You are true American heroes,'' he said in a speech at the Sixth Avenue Baptist Church, a largely black congregation. It was in this church that Dr. King held the funeral service in September 1963 for three of the four girls killed by a bomb at Sunday school in the basement of another Birmingham church. ''We can turn our heads and wish that hate crimes never took place,'' Mr. Dukakis said. ''Or, inspired by the memory of Cynthia Wesley, Addie Mae Collins, Carole Robertson and Denise McNair, we can exert the moral leadership we need to banish racial and religious violence forever from this country. And that leadership must begin in the White House.'' Issue of Civil Rights The main body of the speech was Mr. Dukakis's standard stump speech on economic opportunity. But it contained a more forceful statement on civil rights than Mr. Dukakis delivered two weeks earlier to a virtually all-white crowd at the Neshoba County Fair in Mississippi. There, he elected to omit reference to three civil rights workers who were slain in 1964 near Philadelphia, Miss., in one of the most brutal murders of the civil rights era in the South, and made scant mention of civil rights issues. ''What better place than here in the Sixth Avenue Church to resolve that we will complete the task that you have so bravely carried forward,'' he said, ''that we will not rest until every form of bigotry and racism and religious intolerance will be banished from this land,'' he said.

1418-> Dodgers vs. Athletics: Big Trade Pays Off for Both
In the aftermath of the Mets' loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the final game of the National League pennant playoff, Joe McIlvaine stood in the Mets' clubhouse and recalled a moment 10 months earlier. ''I was standing between Fred and Sandy thinking this is a great trade for these teams,'' the Met executive related. ''As it turned out, we were the last three teams playing.'' McIlvaine was recalling the eight-player, three-way deal last December among the Mets, the Dodgers and the Oakland Athletics. The Mets and the Dodgers played for the National League pennant. Now the Dodgers will play the Athletics in the World Series beginning here Saturday. The Dodgers, McIlvaine concluded, ''got the more immediate help; we got the future help.'' Maybe Next Year ''They won immediately,'' he said. ''I guess we'll win in the future.'' Whatever the Mets do in subsequent seasons remains for that time, but for the present, the situation is unique because of the involvement of the teams in the trade. The trade - engineered by McIlvaine, Fred Claire of Los Angeles and Sandy Alderson of Oakland -brought the Dodgers Alfredo Griffin, their shortstop; Jay Howell, their top relief pitcher, and Jesse Orosco, another member of the bullpen. The Athletics got Bob Welch, who is their No. 2 starting pitcher. Dave Stewart, Welch and Storm Davis, Oakland's starting trio, will try to do what the Mets' heralded pitchers could not do. The Athletics have more than those pitchers and are considered a relatively heavy favorite to beat the Dodgers. But the Mets had more than their pitchers and they, too, were supposed to beat the Dodgers. Which raises a question: Are the Dodgers the 1988 version of the Minnesota Twins? The Twins, with 85 victories last year, were a most unlikely team to win the World Series. But they did, beating the more talented St. Louis Cardinals in seven games. The Dodgers readily admitted that they were not as talented as the Mets, but they beat them, roughing up their pitchers in the process. Mets' Starters Failed Ron Darling, David Cone and Sid Fernandez each pitched poorly in one game, and Dwight Gooden squandered a lead in the ninth inning of Game 4. The Mets' talented relief tandem of Randy Myers and Roger McDowell was never a factor because the Mets almost never had a late-inning lead they needed one of them to protect. The Athletics have similar pitching strengths. Their three starters and Dennis Eckersley, the major league leader with 45 saves, pose a large roadblock for the Dodgers to overcome. The Athletics also have the type of explosive hitting the Mets displayed during the season. Jose Canseco, Mark McGwire and Dave Henderson hit a total of 98 home runs and drove in 317 runs. They will provide a serious test for the Dodgers' pitchers. However, just as the Dodgers' hitters showed disdain for the Mets' pitchers, the Dodgers' pitchers stymied the Mets' hitters. Darryl Strawberry hit only one home run. Keith Hernandez, in a stretch during the middle games of the playoff, failed to hit safely in six times at bat with a total of nine runners on base. Three times he struck out and once he hit into a double play. He grounded into another double play in the seventh game. Kevin McReynolds didn't get a hit in his first 12 times at bat. Howard Johnson got one hit in 18 times at bat. Relievers Pitched Well The Dodgers got two victories from Tim Belcher, their rookie starter; they got effective relief efforts from Brian Holton, Ricky Horton and Alejandro Pena and they got the series of a pitcher's life from Orel Hershiser, who was the most dominant force in the playoff. As surprisingly good as the Dodgers were, though, they could have a problem repeating that type of play against the Athletics, who easily swept the Boston Red Sox in four games in the American League playoff. Having heard all season that they weren't good enough to win the National League West championship, then hearing that they couldn't beat the Mets, they soared to an emotional altitude that cannot be maintained for weeks at a time. The Yankees learned that in 1976. They played such an emotional struggle against the Kansas City Royals in what was then a five-game playoff that they were exhausted at its conclusion and just happy to have reached the World Series. In the Series, however, they were flat against the Cincinnati Reds, a stronger team, and never had a chance. The Reds swept four games. Because they lost 10 of 11 games to the Mets during the season and heard constant talk about it for weeks before the playoff, the Dodgers set out to prove that those results were misleading. Achieving that proof was their ultimate goal. Now that they have achieved it, will they be able to regenerate themselves quickly and turn on their drive against the Athletics? That task will be as difficult as any undertaken this season by the Dodgers' highly emotional manager, Tommy Lasorda.

1423-> Cuban Riot Study Says Clues Weren't Heeded
Officials at two Federal prisons where Cuban inmates rioted last November failed to secure the facilities partly because early signs of trouble were not relayed to them by prison personnel, a Justice Department report concludes. Officials at the Federal prisons at Oakdale, La., and Atlanta also had no plans for dealing with institution-wide disturbances, according to the report, which was dated Feb. 1 but was not made available until Wednesday. The rioting, which lasted 8 days at Oakdale and 11 days at Atlanta, included the taking of prison guards as hostages and resulted in one death of a detainee and millions of dollars in damage to the institutions. It was touched off by a State Department announcement of an agreement with Cuba that would have led to deportation of some of the inmates. The report said Oakdale officials had ignored warning signs, including an inmate food fight in the cafeteria, and important information was not conveyed to prison officials. On Atlanta, the report said the warden was assured by his staff that Atlanta inmates were calm after the Oakdale rioting began, despite evidence to the contrary.

1427-> Paper in Minneapolis Curbs Use of Unidentified Sources
A Minneapolis newspaper has set strict rules for its staff on the use of unidentified sources after three of its articles raised questions about its handling of news. The Minneapolis Star Tribune, on its front page Thursday, said the new rules would ''replace the mostly unwritten guidelines and standards we've relied on before.'' The paper said the move was in response to questions raised about its use of so-called anonymous sources in three articles. ''While anonymous sources are a critical element of some important stories,'' The Star Tribune said, ''frequent reliance on them in the newspaper increases the risk of inaccurate or unfair journalism and can adversely affect the newspaper's credibility with readers.'' One Article Prompted Lawsuit One of the three articles led a local politician to file a successful libel suit against the paper. The case is under appeal. On Wednesday, The Star Tribune printed a correction about an article that included anonymous information about the ABC News program ''20/ 20.'' It had received that article from The New York Times News Service. The New York Times, in an editors' note last Tuesday, said: ''The writing and editing of the article violated the paper's standards of fairness.'' On Aug. 2, The Star Tribune ran an article questioning the ethics of a local physician's decision to perform heart surgery. Two days later, in a front-page note to its readers, the paper said the article had been based on secondhand information and publishing it had been ''a serious lapse in journalistic judgment.'' Under the new guidelines, The Star Tribune said, anonymous information will be printed ''only when necessary to provide important information and only after both a reporter and editor are satisfied that we are meeting our standards for accuracy and fairness.'' The paper said it would ''avoid making promises of confidentiality to sources that are not in the newspaper's or the readers' best interest.''

1429-> COMPANY NEWS; Copyright Battle Lost by Interlego
The Danish makers of Lego toy bricks lost a four-year legal battle to stop Tyco Toys Inc. of Moorestown, N.J., from making Lego-like products. A British court dismissed an appeal by Denmark's Interlego A/S of a Hong Kong court ruling on copyright infringement. ''This is a tremendously significant victory for the company,'' Tyco's general counsel, Michael Kennedy, said in New York. Tyco and Interlego are locked in similar legal battles elsewhere. Tyco sells its toy plastic bricks in about 12 countries. Mr. Kennedy noted that Interlego was ordered to pay the legal costs of three hearings, estimated at more than $:100,000, or about $186,000.

1430-> Police Chief of Metro-North Indicted in Computer Misuse
The police chief of the Metro-North Commuter Railroad was indicted yesterday on charges that he improperly used a New York State police computer system to investigate job applicants, their relatives and people who were suing the railroad. The indictment against the chief, John V. Esposito, includes allegations of ''computer trespass.'' Authorities said he is believed to be the first police official to be prosecuted under a 1986 law restricting the use of confidential criminal justice records compiled in computers. After pleading not guilty in a courtroom in Manhattan, Mr. Esposito said his use of the computer system ''is standard operating procedure'' by police chiefs throughout the state as part of routine background examinations of prospective employes. ''If I'm convicted, not a police chief in New York State is safe from this kind of prosecution,'' Mr. Esposito said outside the courtroom. Suspended With Pay He described the indictment as ''garbage'' and said it was based on evidence presented to a grand jury by the office of the special state prosecutor, Charles J. Hynes, after the prosecutor's staff had failed to uncover any corrupt acts by Mr. Esposito in a 22-month inquiry. Mr. Hynes is responsible for investigating corruption and misconduct involving criminal justice matters in New York City. Mr. Esposito, 60 years old, has been the head of the 130-member railroad police force since June 1985. Three hours after the indictment was handed up, the president of the railroad, Peter E. Stangl, suspended Mr. Esposito but allowed him to continue to draw his salary of $69,651 a year. In a statement, Mr. Stangl said, ''it appears that the chief's actions were done in the conduct of Metro-North business and did not involve any personal gain.'' He said Mr. Esposito's pay status would be reviewed after an inquiry into the charges by railroad officials. Records on Applicant's Relatives The 32-count indictment, brought by a grand jury in Manhattan, accused Mr. Esposito of using the New York Statewide Police Information Network, called Nyspin, to seek information about possible arrests and convictions of three men and a woman who had applied for jobs as officers. Mr. Esposito also obtained records of three relatives of one of the applicants and used the computer for information about two men who were suing Metro-North for false arrest by the railroad's police force, the indictment said. The information about the nine people was obtained between last Sept. 4 and Feb. 4, from a Metro-North police department computer that has access to information collected by Nyspin, the indictment said. The Metro-North computer is in the department's heaquarters at Grand Central Terminal. Nyspin is jointly operated out of Albany by the state police and the State Division of Criminal Justice Services. The system includes the arrest and conviction records, known as rap sheets, of people accused of criminal charges in New York State and other states. It also contains outstanding warrants for people sought on criminal charges throughout the country and motor-vehicle infractions against New York State drivers. Richard H. Magnum, a special assistant state attorney general, who is in charge of prosecuting the case against Mr. Esposito, said Nyspin could be used by police agencies only ''in the administration of justice.'' He said state law banned its use to obtain information for background checks of employees or in civil suits. ''Any unauthorized use is an invasion of privacy,'' Mr. Magnum said outside the courtroom. In addition to computer trespass, the 32-count indictment charges that Mr. Esposito coerced Metro-North employees into using the computer without authorization and that he falsified official records by stating that the information was being sought in connection with disorderly conduct investigations. The most serious count against Mr. Esposito is criminal trespass, a Class E felony that carries a maximum prison sentence of four years. Mr. Esposito, who lives in Marlboro in Ulster County, was released without bail after his arraignment before Justice Felice Shea of State Supreme Court in Manhattan. Later, at an impromptu news conference, Mr. Esposito acknowledged that he had used the computer system to obtain records of people who were not under criminal investigation by his department. He said a check of one job applicant turned up criminal records for three close relatives. ''Would you want me to give a gun and a badge to someone like that?'' he said.

1433-> Racial Motive Investigated In Death of Kingston Woman
The slaying of a 19-year-old woman whose body was found Tuesday morning near abandoned railroad tracks in Kingston, N.Y., may have been racially motivated, officials said yesterday. The letters ''K K K'' had been scratched into the skin of the victim, identified as Anna Kithcart, a black who lived in Kingston, said Chief James Riggins of the Kingston Police Department. He said the man who found the body, Joseph Kiernan, 41, a white Kingston resident, was charged with sexual misconduct with the body but was not charged in the slaying.

1435-> YELLOWSTONE FIRE NEARS SCENIC AREA
Brisk winds carried a 108,300-acre forest fire over defensive lines today, fanning flames to within less than half a mile of one of Yellowstone National Park's most scenic areas and forcing officials to close the park's west entrance. Elsewhere in the West, a fire in Montana that had come within a mile of a nuclear missile silo turned away, while firefighters struggled with blazes in Utah, Idaho, Oregon, Washington and California. Fire crews in Yellowstone began hosing down the 600 cabins and other buildings at the Canyon area, one of the largest developments in the nation's oldest national park, as flames became visible from the area. No Immediate Threat By late afternoon, firefighters had drawn the flames away from Canyon by setting backfires, fire officials said. While there was no immediate threat to structures at Canyon, officials said they would know if the area is out of danger before Sunday. Two of the park's five entrances are now closed. With two other fires in the park, ash and smoke reduced visibility significantly in Wyoming and brought haze and brightly colored sunsets to Colorado. In southern Montana, firefighters battled a pair of forest fires that had burned close to 60,000 acres. Crews were trying to contain a 37,200-acre blaze southeast of Helena, while a 900-acre fire in central Montana moved away from a Minuteman missile silo. Zail Chapman, dispatcher for the Helena National Forest in Great Falls, said the silo was ''completely secure.'' Olin Greene, the Oregon State fire marshal, issued a statewide prohibition on outdoor burning in southwest Oregon, where three major fires had charred 2,600 acres. A 2,000-acre fire burned north of Wallowa in northeast Oregon. Series of Lightning Storms The declaration cleared the way for the National Guard to help fight the fires, but no troops were called out. A 650-acre fire four miles northeast of Grants Pass was the closest to any town. The fires in southwestern Oregon started with a series of lightning storms Tuesday night; at least 60 fires, most of them small, were reported. In western Idaho, flames from a 2,200-acre fire near Hells Canyon forced fire bosses to divert at least one helicopter to try to keep it from spreading into a stand of commercial timber. Four other major blazes were burning on over 4,000 acres elsewhere. In Washington, two fires covered more than 500 acres southwest of Mount Rainier National Park, while more than 20 small fires flared up around the state. A 200-acre fire was burning in eastern Utah's Ashley National Forest, a 350-acre fire in northern Utah, and a 150-acre fire in northern Utah at the Powder Mountain Ski Area.

1438-> Jake Lindsey, World War II Hero Honored by Congress, Dies at 67
Jake W. Lindsey, a combat hero of World War II who received the Medal of Honor at a special Congressional ceremony, died of a heart attack Monday at his home in Waynesboro, Miss. He was 67 years old. Mr. Lindsey, then a technical sergeant, was the 100th infantryman awarded the Medal of Honor in World War II. As such he received his medal from President Truman at a joint session of Congress in May 1945, six months after the exploits that earned him the award. In four days of fighting in the Huertgen Forest near Hamich, Germany, Sergeant Lindsey's platoon, an element of the First Infantry Division, had been reduced to 6 men of the original 40. The platoon captured its objective but faced an enemy counterattack. Fought Off Enemy Company The sergeant, although wounded, faced a German infantry company, backed by five tanks. With rifle and grenade fire, he killed more than 20 Germans, knocked out one of the tanks and then, after his ammunition was exhausted, took his bayonet and engaged in hand-to-hand combat. His citation, read by Gen. George C. Marshall, stated: ''His unerringly accurate fire destroyed two enemy machine-gun nests, forced the withdrawal of two tanks and effectively halted the enemy flanking patrol. Later, although painfully wounded, he engaged eight Germans, who were establishing a machine-gun position, in hand-to-hand combat, killing three, capturing three, and causing the other two to flee.'' 'The Essence of Victory' Mr. Lindsey, who was 24 years old at the time, quit high school in 1939 to enter the regular Army. He heard President Truman acclaim his gallantry as ''unselfish valor'' and ''the essence of victory.'' Mr. Lindsey also served in the Korean War, in which he received a battlefield commission as a second lieutenant. Later he gave up his bars for the stripes of a master sergeant. He retired from the Army in 1963 and then spent 10 years with the United States Forest Service. He leaves his wife, Lucille; a son, William, and a daughter, Renee, all of Waynesboro; a son, Jake Jr., of Holbrook, Mass., and a daughter, Gail Darling, of Brockton, Mass.

1439-> ALL 20 ACQUITTED IN JERSEY MOB CASE
One of the longest criminal trials in the United States ended abruptly today with the acquittal of 20 defendants accused of making up the entire membership of the Lucchese crime family in New Jersey. The defendants and their friends erupted in cheers and applause in Federal District Court here as the foreman of a jury selected 21 months ago read 77 separate not guilty verdicts. The jury had deliberated for 14 hours. The case was a major loss for the Government, which has used large and lengthy racketeering trials to jail several organized-crime leaders in New York City and elsewhere. 'Increases Our Resolve' ''The jury said never, never again should the Government waste the public's money this way,'' said Maria Noto, whose client, Daniel Ricciardi, 33 years old, was accused of selling cocaine. She said the jury ''rejected the script written by the Government and its paid witnesses.'' Samuel A. Alito, the United States Attorney for New Jersey, said: ''This only increases our resolve. Obviously we are disappointed, but you realize you can't win them all. ''Rest assured,'' Mr. Alito continued, ''we will continue our offensive against organized crime and narcotics trafficking, which victimizes the citizens of our nation and state.'' Controlled Lucrative Market The 20 defendants, described by law-enforcement officials as ''young, aggressive, intelligent and sophisticated,'' were accused of running a criminal enterprise here and in Florida that included the sale and distribution of cocaine, as well as credit-card fraud, gambling and loansharking from 1976 to 1985, when they were indicted. The prosecutor contended that the Lucchese organization controlled a lucrative network that brought drugs to New Jersey and New York and maintained close working relations with members of the Genovese and other crime families in the New York metropolitan region. But the defense contended that the prosecution was overzealous, finding conspiracies and fraud where they did not exist. ''The jury saw through everything and did what justice required,'' said Stephen H. Skoller, who represented Anthony Accetturo, 49, of Hollywood, Fla. Mr. Accetturo was accused of being the leader of the organization in New Jersey. ''Unfortunately, this won't deter the Government from pursuing this type of case again,'' Mr. Skoller said. Relied on Wiretaps The Government, relying heavily on wiretaps obtained from a restaurant in the Ironbound section of Newark known as the Hole-in-the-Wall, where the defendants were said to operate, also presented several convicted criminals as key witnesses. More than 90 witnesses testified altogether. The star witness for the Government was Joseph Alonzo, an admitted drug addict and alcoholic who was convicted of shooting his cousin, a defendant, five times. The Government had used the case as a symbol of its efforts to crush organized crime in New Jersey not only in such traditional areas as illegal gambling and narcotics but also in legitimate enterprises such as the construction industry. The trial is considered to be the longest criminal proceeding in the country, surpassing the ''pizza connection'' heroin smuggling case in New York City, which ended in March 1987 after 17 months. The trial in New Jersey cost millions of dollars, including fees for some defendants' court-appointed lawyers, although the exact cost has yet to be determined. Juror fees alone cost the court more than $1,200 a week while the cost of protecting Government witnesses ran into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Length of Deliberations The short time it took the jury to deliberate took both sides by surprise. The jurors had available to them more than 40,000 pages of transcripts and 850 exhibits. And Mr. Alito said that while some of the testimony in those transcripts was from disreputable witnesses, as the defense asserted, there was testimony from others who were not confederates of the defendants. At the same time, the Justice Department has been successful in prosecuting the heads of four of New York City's major Mafia families with the testimony of the organized crime groups' former associates. It lost a case, however, in March 1987 when a jury acquitted John Gotti, the man the authorities say is the head of the Gambino family. The defendants here were clearly elated as they left one door of the courthouse, marched down the street cheering and went to another door, where the jurors were expected to exit. As the 12 jurors were escorted by Federal marshals to a waiting van, the defendants again applauded and cheered and thanked them. Some of the jurors waved back. Several cried, and one yelled, ''Good luck!'' Refused to Believe Criminals The jurors refused to comment on the case, telling marshals they did not want to be approached by reporters. ''This was a situation where the defendants deserved what they got,'' said Robert Brown, a lawyer who represented James Fede, 33, of Newark. ''The jury has been listening to thugs, liars and drug addicts for 21 months. No wonder they don't want to talk.'' Thomas Ashley, who represented Gerald Cohen, 46, of Pompano Beach, Fla., also thanked the jury, saying, ''They fully understood the case.'' ''They refused to believe convicted criminals,'' he said. Judge Harold A. Ackerman of Federal District Court in Newark refused to comment, except to say ''I'm glad it's over.'' These were the defendants acquitted of racketeering charges: Anthony Accetturo, 49, Hollywood, Fla. Michael Taccetta, 40, Florham Park, N.J. Martin Taccetta, 37, Florham Park, Michael's brother Michael Perna, 46, Belleville Thomas Ricciardi, 36, Lakewood Alfonse Cataldo, 45, Florham Park Jerome Voglino, Livingston Robert Spagnola, 41, Mountainside James Fede, 34, Belleville James Gammero, 30, Belleville Michael Ryan, 38, Belleville Walter Esposito, 38, Florham Park Joseph Licata, Florham Park Gerald Cohen, 46, Pompano Beach, Fla.

1440-> A Bitter 'Whisky War' in Ireland
''Keep the Spirit Irish'' is the message trumpeted from billboards on street corners. But as the long-running battle for control of the Irish Distillers Group P.L.C. draws to a dramatic finish, the only near-certainty is that soon the Irish whisky industry will be in foreign hands. Irish Distillers has effectively abandoned its fight for independence by inviting a bid from Pernod-Ricard S.A., France's largest wine and spirits company. Distillers' board is backing Pernod-Ricard's $412 million bid even though it is less than the $480 million offer from Grand Metropolitan P.L.C. of Britain. The world's largest spirits marketer, Grand Met announced that it would dismantle Dublin-based Distillers if it were successful in its pursuit, which it began in late May - first with a consortium and now alone. Court Ruling Due Before long, the corporate brawl that has been dubbed ''the whisky war'' should be over. A crucial court ruling is scheduled for Wednesday. Afterward, the Irish Government must weigh in. It has broad and vaguely defined guidelines for intervening in takeovers, especially when foreign predators are involved. ''Issues such as employment implications, competition and the common good are all considered,'' said Albert Reynolds, Ireland's Commerce Secretary. Indeed, the Government blocked the 1972 bid by the Seagram Company of Canada for Irish Distillers. But today, Dublin, like other European governments, has its eye on 1992, when commercial barriers among the 12 nations of the European Community are to be eliminated. That prospect has already caused the pace of cross-border mergers and acquisitions in Europe to increase significantly. For months, the Irish Government has been urging its citizens and companies to prepare for 1992. So although the Government verdict on the Irish Distillers fight is likely to be a Cabinet-level decision, investment bankers and political analysts doubt that the Government will block both foreign bids for the company. No matter who wins, the acquisition of Irish Distillers will represent the biggest takeover ever in Ireland - and the most bitter. The fight for Irish Distillers intensified markedly over the weekend. Grand Met made an extraordinary bid on Sunday. And Pernod-Ricard demanded and received a sitting of the Irish High Court, which convened at 2 A.M. Monday at the home of a judge and granted a temporary injunction to stop FII Fyffes P.L.C., an Irish food importer that is Distillers' largest shareholder, from selling out to Grand Met. Pledge by Pernod Pernod is a family-controlled company whose products include anise-flavored Ricard and Pastis 51; Suze, a bitter aperitif; Wild Turkey bourbon, and Yoo Hoo chocolate drinks. It has assured Irish Distillers and the Government that it would keep the company intact. It has vowed to preserve the current management's autonomy and to keep nearly all of the company's 1,100 workers. Grand Met, whose best-known brands are Smirnoff vodka and J & B Scotch, said it would keep Jameson and Paddy Irish whisky and Cork Dry gin. But it said it would sell Bushmills, Powers and Tullamore Dew Irish whiskies as well as Huzzar vodka. ''The Grand Met bid represents a major threat to the Irish whisky industry and to employment in Ireland,'' Michael Cummins, marketing director of Irish Distillers, said. Bid Sweetened on Sunday Still, Grand Met brings more than a different business plan to the fight. It also has the higher bid: On Sunday it increased its offer to $480 million from the $366 million it bid on Aug. 19. It is offering Irish Distillers shareholders 525 Irish pence, or $7.58, a share. By contrast, the Pernod bid is 400 Irish pence, or $6.50, a share. Even though the Pernod bid was officially announced on Monday, after the higher Grand Met bid was declared, Pernod says it has legally binding assurances from shareholders with 51.8 percent of Irish Distillers' stock. Those assurances, however, were amassed over the weekend, many of them secured before Grand Met sweetened its bid. The hearing scheduled for Wednesday before the High Court will decide whether FII Fyffes is committed to Pernod or is free to sell its 20.4 percent stake to the higher bidder. A Rich Prize In Irish Distillers, the foreign suitors are pursuing a company whose portfolio of established whisky brands, led by Jameson and Bushmills, is a rich prize. Distillers appears ready for growth after some difficult years. The company trimmed its work force by 207 employees in 1986 and 1987. But more important, analysts agree, has been the global overhaul of its marketing strategy, which Mr. Cummins, a young executive recruited from Guinness, has overseen. An uncoordinated marketing effort - which often resulted in six or seven distributors of Irish Distillers' brands competing against each other overseas - has been scrapped. It was replaced by what Mr. Cummins calls ''the two-brand strategy.'' That involved focusing its campaign in each market on two Irish whiskies, with Jameson as the linchpin. The advertising has tried to establish a premium image for Irish whisky by sounding three themes: history, quality and taste. The company, for instance, can claim the oldest distillery in the world, the Old Bushmills distillery in County Antrim, Northern Ireland, licensed in 1608. Moreover, Irish whisky is triple-distilled, whereas Scotch is distilled only twice. The company stressed that point with an ad headline resembling a soccer score: ''Ireland - 3, Scotland - 2.'' The new strategy was test-marketed in Britain, beginning in 1981. Since then, sales of Jameson and Black Bush, the Bushmills premium brand, have jumped to more than 70,000 nine-liter cases from less than 30,000 cases in Britain. In 1984, the strategy was put into effect in West Germany, the Netherlands and France, and sales in those markets rose to 90,000 cases in 1987 from 65,000 in 1984. Martin Hawkins, an analyst at the Kitcat & Aitkin Company, a London brokerage, estimates that Irish Distillers' sales could jump from 2.35 million nine-liter cases to 4 million cases over the next five years. The higher volumes would lower per-unit costs and operating profit margin per case could rise to $14.40, from $10.45, he said. Sharp Rise in Profits Seen Analysts predict that Distillers could earn a pretax operating profit of $25.9 million in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30 and more than $32 million in the 1989 fiscal year, up from $18.9 million last year. The market in which Irish Distillers has made little progress is the United States, where Irish whisky sales have been static in recent years at about 300,000 cases, or roughly $40 million at retail, said Impact International, a trade newsletter. That is about two-tenths of 1 percent of the American spirits market. Mr. Cummins attributes this poor performance to a misguided, down-market ''shamrocks and shillelaghs'' approach to marketing. In June, Irish Distillers started its premium, two-brand strategy in America, pushing its Jameson and Bushmills brands in California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Colorado and Florida. New York will be added after the marketing drive is honed. American analysts, however, are skeptical. ''It may work for Irish Distillers, but there is no evidence yet that it is,'' said Frank Walters, director of research for Impact International.

1441-> Market Place; A Short-Sale Plan That Backfired
A STRATEGY based on an expectation of a decline in the Japanese stock market has backfired for some aggressive New York money managers. A number of these so-called hedge fund managers are said to have sold short the American depository receipts of some large Japanese stocks. To their dismay, the stocks of the underlying companies soared on Wednesday and yesterday, which in turn sent higher the prices of depository receipts that trade on the New York Stock Exchange and over the counter. These certificates represent a specified number of shares in the Japanese companies. ''The short-sellers are being squeezed quite hard,'' said Robin Norton, senior vice president at S. G. Warburg & Company in New York. He declined to cite any firm as an example. However, officials at New York's Tiger Fund, one of the largest hedge funds, have said in recent months that they were shorting the Tokyo market. In a short sale, investors sell shares of securities they do not own. They bet that the price of these shares will fall and that when they settle the transaction they can then buy the depository receipts at prices lower than those in the original agreement and pocket the profit. In recent days, brokers say, the hedge fund managers have been scurrying to settle these transactions as the value of the depository receipts has risen sharply. In Wednesday's trading, for example, Honda Motor surged 24 7/8, to 167 5/8; Matsushita Electric jumped 14 1/4, to 202 1/4, and Sony climbed 2 1/8, to 41 1/4. This week's action in Tokyo follows months of speculation by United States investors that the market there was due for a correction, if not a full-blown collapse. Many fund managers in the United States have been mystified by the strength of Japanese stocks. Until recently, the only way American investors could bet on a decline in Japanese share prices was by selling short the depository receipts that trade in New York. However, their strategies have been hurt by the two-tier characteristic of the Tokyo market. When the market was climbing, much of its strength was isolated in the most heavily traded issues, which were mostly in the steel, shipbuilding and shipping industries. But most of the depository receipts available in the United States are certificates representing shares in what the Japanese call blue-chip companies like Honda, Matsushita Electric, Sony and Hitachi. In the last few weeks, shares of the bigger stocks like Nippon Steel have fallen in value while prices of the blue chips have surged. So some of the leaders fell in value but the issues in the second tier have surged, stunning the short-sellers. From the beginning of July through yesterday, for instance, shares of depository receipts for Honda climbed from 129 3/4 to 177 3/4; Hitachi rose from 105 7/8 to 141 1/4, Sony advanced from 37 7/8 to 43 1/2, Toyota moved from 34 3/8 to 43 7/8 and Matsushita Electric climbed from 182 1/8 to 204. Analysts attribute this week's sharp moves in Tokyo to rising interest rates and higher oil prices. On Monday, the Nikkei index suffered its worst one-day decline this year, plunging more than 513 points, to 27,149.03. The next day share prices rebounded more than 404 points. This has capped a month in which the Tokyo market has begun to lose some of its vigor, market strategists say. Indeed, during July the Tokyo market has fallen 3 percent while the broad market in the United States has advanced 1 percent. On a currency-adjusted basis, the difference is even greater. For investors using dollars, Japanese stocks are off 2 percent since June while stocks in the United States are up 5 percent, said Alan Benasuli, director of international research at Drexel Burnham Lambert in New York. ''Clearly it's lost its momentum,'' Mr. Benasuli said. A number of professionals think the market rotation is marking the end of leadership by the industrial companies. ''You are seeing the end of a cycle,'' said Donald M. Krueger, senior vice president of Sanyo Securities America in New York. He noted that in recent months, almost 60 percent of the volume was represented by trading in only the 10 largest stocks. Mr. Krueger and other strategists think that blue-chip companies like Honda and Hitachi are replacing the industrials as market leaders, even though the steel stocks recovered in yesterday's trading in Tokyo. Portfolio managers in Japan have grown cautious and shifted some of their assets into these higher-yielding and more defensive stocks, they assert. ''Investors decided to shift to the second group,'' said Hideo Karino, general manager of the foreign stock trading group at the Nikko Securities Company in New York. For this reason, these advisers say that investors who sell short the American depository receipts in these securities will continue to suffer losses. ''If Americans try to approach the Tokyo market the way they approach the U.S. market, they will lose money,'' Mr. Karino said.

1442-> Naval Forces in Gulf Have Civil Flight Data
To the Editor: Further on your report about uneasiness among commercial airline pilots and air traffic controllers in the Persian Gulf over the last year's United States naval buildup there (news story, July 10). Now that we know that the Iranian commercial airliner on a scheduled passenger flight from Bandar Abbas to Dubai was within the legal limits of that official airway, we have the right to be concerned about the safety of flight in other and all international airways. This is not a new subject. In 1961, Robert S. McNamara, then Secretary of Defense, became aware that the far-flung global commercial airway system crisscrossed many zones of interest to the United States Armed Forces and that differentiating between friend and foe on the world's airways was becoming an important safety concern, for crews and passengers, and for the military units providing national security. Mr. McNamara had been informed that air traffic controllers from all over the world were meeting in San Francisco to establish an international association to do something about just these concerns. I was the officer sent to that convention representing the military services of this country. The International Air Traffic Control Association was formed during that meeting and has continued on through the years. Our first requirement was that the official language of the worldwide system be English, and that all other policies and practices would be uniform throughout. Comprehensive training programs were established to assure uniformity. Thus it would be possible for the elements of the military forces of all nations to listen, record and computerize all these commercial flight and schedule data. The original United States Air Defense Command, which was established in Colorado Springs in 1951, had been doing this for the North American continent and its oceanic approaches since that time. This means that United States naval forces in the Persian Gulf and in the neighboring Gulf of Oman can have no excuse to fire upon commercial and other lawful air traffic for lack of information. All Navy vessels, and particularly the Aegis ships of the Ticonderoga class (that includes the missile cruiser Vincennes) must have these data in their computers and must have their radios tuned to this clear traffic at all times. Furthermore, as it has been agreed, the ship's captain does not have the authority - in peacetime - to redirect traffic that is under the air traffic controller's direction. Midair collisions and other dangers could result. The shooting down of Iran Air Flight 655, with 290 passengers aboard, was an unacceptable atrocity. The Navy has known too long that civil air data are available and that all ships at sea are responsible for using them. L. FLETCHER PROUTY Alexandria, Va., July 10, 1988 The writer, a retired Air Force colonel, was chief of special operations, office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

1444-> F.D.A. Rules Allow Use of More AIDS Drugs
To the Editor: While we commend your coverage of the Food and Drug Administration's regulations for ''treatment investigational new drugs,'' called IND (Science Times, July 5), which quotes us, you miss an essential point. As you state, it normally takes eight to nine years or longer for a new drug to move through the F.D.A. approval process. The purpose of the treatment IND regulations is to allow access to drugs to treat life-threatening illnesses as early as phase II, if the drug is safe ''and may be effective'' (21 C.F.R. 312.34 (B) (3), Federal Register May 22, 1987, page 19,476). There is a critical difference between ''may be effective'' and final proof of effectiveness, which is the standard the F.D.A. uses in determining approval of a new drug for commercial marketing. The ''may be effective'' standard in the treatment IND regulations merely requires that a drug show reasonable promise. There are numerous treatment drugs for acquired immune deficiency syndrome now in phase II or phase III trials that have been shown to be safe and potentially effective. If the F.D.A. would follow its own regulations, thousands of AIDS patients, who are dying and for whom there are no effective treatment drugs (many cannot tolerate azidothymidine, AZT), might have the benefit of drugs that could improve their condition. The F.D.A.'s unlawful disregard of its own treatment IND regulations bespeaks the Reagan Administration's let-them-die attitude toward people with AIDS. JAY C.

1446-> Nicaragua Challenged On Jailings
Lawyers for five prominent opposition leaders who have been jailed for the last month are challenging the authorities' application of Nicaraguan law in the case and contend that their clients' fate will ultimately be decided by Sandinista political leaders, not the courts. ''These people are not really being tried for violations of the law,'' said Enrique Sotelo Borgen, one of the defense lawyers. ''They are being tried for political defiance. They are hostages to some future political deal. They will be freed at the moment the Government decides it is prudent to free them.'' But Government officials contend that too much attention is being paid to the case, and that foreigners upset by the proceedings should put pressure on other Central American nations that, they say, have failed to live up to the regional peace accord. The five opposition leaders, together with 33 other prisoners, were arrested after an anti-Sandinista rally July 10 in the town of Nandaime. The 38 are being held in the Granada Penitentiary, 35 miles south of the capital. All are charged with a group of felonies, including illicit association, property damage, crimes against authority and assault on police officers. Scores Were Injured At the Nandaime rally, a scuffle broke out in which demonstrators pelted police officers with sticks and stones. In response, the police fired tear-gas grenades and beat protesters with truncheons and rifle butts. Ten police officers and scores of demonstrators were hurt. Defense lawyers have lodged complaints asserting that the presiding judge is violating various legal guarantees. They say he has accepted tainted evidence, refused to accept statements from defense witnesses and ignored a constitutional requirement that counsel be present when defendants are questioned. In Granada, where the proceedings are under way, Judge Ariel Jimenez, a member of the Sandinista Front and a former Interior Ministry official, is taking statements from the prisoners at the rate of several per day. Half a block from the crumbling adobe courthouse, lawyers sit in an office sipping coffee, unable to take part. The Nicaraguan Constitution asserts that lawyers for those accused of crimes have the right to be present with their clients ''from the beginning of the process.'' But Judge Jimenez said in an interview that the guarantee did not apply to the period when defendants are brought in to make their official statements. ''These people are not yet on trial,'' the judge said, as one of the lesser-known defendants was questioned by an aide at a nearby desk. ''Prisoners generally deny their guilt in the beginning, and that is happening here.'' Terms Could Exceed 10 Years The judge said he could not guess what sentences might be imposed on the defendants, but under the laws covering the crimes they are charged with, sentences could exceed 10 years. Of the 15 witnesses brought to Granada last week by defense lawyers, Judge Jimenez chose to hear only four. He cited a provision of the penal code that requires only that judges call as many witnesses as they determine are ''indispensable or convenient for the determination of the truth.'' All 38 defendants were originally sentenced to six months in prison by the police, who in Nicaragua have the right to decree such sentences without trial. But those sentences were revoked by the Government and full trials were ordered. The defense lawyers say the new trials constitute double jeopardy, which is banned by Nicaraguan law. ''This trial is so full of legal errors that any appeals court could throw it out immediately if the order came down to do that,'' said Ivan Salvador Madriz Aguilar, who is coordinating the defense team. On Tuesday, defense lawyers filed a complaint alleging that Judge Jimenez was legally ''deaf and blind'' because he had ''considered our defendants guilty from the beginning.'' Prison Visits Allowed Although defense lawyers have been banned from the courtroom, they have been allowed to visit their clients at the Granada prison. Doctors have been permitted to examine two defendants, Alejandro Sandino and Myriam Arguello, and have asked that for medical reasons, both be released to await trial at their homes. Both Miss Arguello, who is 61 years old, and Mr. Sandino are leaders of the Conservative Party. The other prominent defendants are Agustin Jarquin Anaya of the Social Christian Party and two leaders of the Democratic Coordinator, Nicaragua's principal opposition coalition. They are Carlos Huembes, an anti-Sandinista labor leader, and Roger Guevara Mena, a lawyer who has been previously imprisoned for his political activities. After several requests, a reporter was given permission to interview several defendants. But at the appointed hour Wednesday, the prison warden, Guillermo Miranda, said he could not authorize such interviews. Supporters of the prisoners are collecting signatures on a petition seeking their release. But opposition leaders say they are convinced that only political negotiation will produce a Government order to end the proceedings. ''The Sandinistas have closed the Catholic radio station and put these people in jail, and those are bargaining chips,'' said Anna Maria Ruiz, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Coordinator. ''If they start negotiations with the contras again, or if there is pressure from other countries to loosen up inside Nicaragua, then opening the radio station and freeing the prisoners are the two main things the Sandinistas have to offer.'' A year ago, the Sandinista Government and four other Central American governments signed a peace plan pledging that ''freedom in all its forms'' would be guaranteed throughout the region. The author of the plan, President Oscar Arias Sanchez of Costa Rica, has called for the reopening of Nicaragua's Catholic radio station and the release of the prisoners jailed after the Nandaime protest. Private Deals Suggested Relatives of several defendants said in interviews that security agents had sought private arrangements that would lead to freedom for some or all of the prisoners. They said that agents had asked the leading prisoners to propose a solution, but that the prisoners had refused. ''One possibility is that they could be released on condition that they agree not to participate in any more political activities, but they won't agree to that,'' said Gilda Guevara, the wife of one of the defendants. ''I think ultimately some kind of political solution will be reached.''

1447-> Iraq Chief Insists on Broad Accord, Not Just Truce
President Saddam Hussein said today that his country could not settle for a cease-fire that would only ''temporarily freeze'' war activities, and that it was seeking a comprehensive peace agreement with Iran and the normalization of relations. The Iraqi leader's comments appeared to be an effort to explain his Government's sudden reluctance to carry out a Security Council resolution calling for a cease-fire with Iran that Iraq accepted a year ago. Once Iran reluctantly accepted the cease-fire proposal, Baghdad raised the diplomatic stakes by going beyond the terms of the resolution and demanding direct negotiations with the Islamic regime in Teheran, which had previously declared President Hussein's downfall to be its prime war aim. President Hussein and other Iraqi officials criticized Iran's apparent refusal to enter direct negotiations, arguing that the Teheran Government of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was not sincere in its expressed readiness to end the eight-year-old war against the Baghdad Government, led by Mr. Hussein's Baath Socialist Party. Commenting today on the speech, the Speaker of the Iranian Parliament, Hojatolislam Hashemi Rafsanjani, said: ''Our enemies have been disarmed already. There is no sound mind in the world which accepts that the Iraqi Baath is for peace.'' The official Iraqi press said President Hussein, speaking in a telephone conversation with Libya's leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, said, ''A cease-fire alone cannot stop the war, but it can suspend it temporarily, to allow it to be resumed worse than before.'' Mr. Hussein went on to say, according to Iraqi television and radio reports, that ''Iraq's desire for peace is profound.'' Iraq Demands Direct Talks He added that his country viewed Resolution 598, the plan for a cease-fire and negotiations to end the war that was passed by the United Nations Security Council a year ago, as ''a basis for a durable peace between Iran and Iraq, not as a temporary formula to freeze certain war activities or a cease-fire only.'' Mr. Hussein reiterated a view that has been expressed here repeatedly by Iraqi officials in the last few days: that the Iranians intended only to secure a tactical cease-fire that would give them a chance to rebuild their armed forces and their shattered economy. He cited as proof Iran's apparent rejection of direct talks with Iraqi representatives. Iraq has demanded direct talks as a first step toward normalizing relations between the two nations. ''To reject direct dealing means one does not want peace or to conclude a peace accord,'' Iraqi television quoted Mr. Hussein as saying. ''It means Iran deals on a tactical basis for well-known purposes.'' Iraqi officials here also said the substance of an extensive statement by Ayatollah Khomeini, read Wednesday in his name on the official Teheran radio, was proof that Iranian intentions were not peaceful. The speech contained much more bellicose language than early comments made available Wednesday by press agencies from Teheran. 'Keep Hatred in Chests' At one point, the Iranian leader called upon his people to ''keep your revolutionary hatred and revenge in your chests,'' and he said the decision to accept Resolution 598 was meant to turn the tables against Iraq in the international arena. A senior Egyptian diplomat here said Iraqis had very little confidence ''in any pledges coming out of Teheran,'' adding, ''They are reading everything coming out of there with a very suspicious eye.'' The Egyptian, whose Government is a close ally of Iraq's, said that while Iraq was indeed very anxious to end the war, ''the Iraqis are not likely to move until they see that a cease-fire is a firm engagement for peace, not just an interruption of the war.'' Other diplomats here said Iraq was fearful of giving its population the slightest hint that the war is over before an accord is signed, because such a signal would lead to demobilizing the population.

1449-> Book Notes
Orion Takes Off Long after Icarus flew a single mission on wax-jointed wings, modern warplanes stayed aloft by using propellers instead of jets. The airborne past comes to mind because of nostalgia for the looks and even the names of old military aircraft -Flying Fortresses, Thunderbolts, Tomcats, Spitfires - and wonder at the new ones that fly at supersonic speeds, from the X-1 to the yet-to-be-built X-31A. These now dominate the pages of a new imprint called Orion Books, from Crown Publishers. The imprint covers the beat of wings, but why Orion? ''From the time I was a kid, looking up at the heavens, I was fascinated by the constellation,'' said Carl Apollonio, the publisher. ''Orion symbolized the hunter, in the best sense of the word. The name stood for two of my interests, aviation and astronomy. I've been a civilian pilot since 1948.'' Mr. Apollonio wears another hat at Crown, a publishing company that was acquired by Random House last month. He is the vice president and director of sales. ''The idea for the imprint,'' he recalled, ''was proposed to Alan Mirken, Crown's president, and he said, 'Go.' Just like that. In 13 years, I went from a publisher's rep in Florida, carrying a line of books, to having my own imprint.'' Orion's books include aerospace history, military history, transportation and general scientific and technological themes. One of Mr. Apollonio's not-too-secret weapons is Walter Boyne, former director of the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum, who serves as consulting editor. Mr. Boyne is author of ''The Wild Blue'' and ''The Smithsonian Book of Flight.'' Among the titles already in print are ''Last Flight,'' by Amelia Earhart, ''The Battle of Hurtgen Forest,'' by Charles Whiting, ''The Soviet Manned Space Program,'' by Phillip Clark, and ''Going Downtown: The War Against Hanoi and Washington,'' by Jack Broughton. Orion's most poignant book is ''The War Poets,'' by Robert Giddings, a literary critic. It includes poems by, and biographical facts about, a number of the British World War I poets - Rupert Brooke, Robert Graves, Wilfred Owen, Siegfried Sassoon, Edmund Blunden. Because of the human toll of that terrible war in the trenches, ''The War Poets'' has an antiwar tone. Frontline Letters War on the American landscape 125 years ago is at the heart of ''The Granite Farm Letters: The Civil War Correspondence of Edgeworth and Sallie Bird,'' edited by John Rozier. This unusual discovery of the wartime letters between a prosperous Georgia planter and his wife and young daughter, will be published by the University of Georgia Press in November. A defender of slavery, Mr. Bird owned Granite Farm, a large cotton plantation with many amenities. He considered his slaves to be''servants,'' to be looked after. The Birds believed in a society divided by caste - both race and class. He was devoted to wife and family, and there is great tenderness in their letters. Summoned by the Confederacy to defend his way of life, Mr. Bird became a loyal soldier, who in retrospect could turn defeat into stalemate and even victory at Gettysburg. Not long after that battle, he wrote to his wife from a Virginia encampment: ''We can whip Meade's army if they don't have all the position, and badly, too. We did whip them at Gettysburg, but at awful loss, and the heavy ordnance was all exhausted. Nothing you've ever heard or read of can give you an idea of the terrific fire Lee opened on their heights. Not less than 300 cannon belching forth at once. It had to be discontinued from exhaustion of ammunition. Captured officers say they would have had to abandon all their positions, if it had kept on 30 minutes longer. They finally had to retreat, but Lee had to do so at the same time.'' Howard Fast's Latest Howard Fast, one of the most prolific writers in the country, is author of such popular historical fiction as ''Citizen Tom Paine'' (also a play), ''Freedom Road,'' ''April Morning'' and ''Spartacus.'' When Mr. Fast appeared before a Congressional investigating committee in the early 1950's, he was asked whether he believed in the overthrow of the Government. He refused to answer, citing the Fifth Amendment, and asked for permission to explain the meaning of that Constitutional right. Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, the Wisconsin Republican, told him not to do so, saying all Americans knew what the Fifth Amendment meant. Mr. Fast again asked for a chance to elaborate. Then, according to the author, this exchange took place: SENATOR McCARTHY: Write a book! MR. FAST: I shall and I will! Now he has fulfilled that pledge in his latest novel, coming out later this month from Houghton Mifflin. Called ''The Pledge,'' the novel includes a foreign correspondent, involved in the McCarthy era, who is railroaded into jail by a Congressional committee. The author once reported from abroad and spent three months in prison for refusing to disclose names of contributors to an organization considered subversive by the Attorney General. Mr. Fast said yesterday, ''All these years I've wanted to tell this story.'' He has written more than 60 books and is still going strong. ''I'll be 74 in November,'' Mr. Fast said. ''I console myself with what James Branch Cabell used to say: 'An author won't die in the middle of a book.' ''

1453-> U.S. Bomb Squad Is Growing
The military's bomb squad is nearly doubling as the United States tries to respond to world terrorism, a Navy officer says. The Navy recently opened a $18.6 million training center here to teach technicians how to deal with explosives. The move was a reponse to ''the growing threat of international terrorism,'' said Lieut. Comdr. H. F. Mixter, the officer in charge. Other factors he cited in a recent interview was that ''the world's weaponry is far more sophisticated than it used to be,'' and changes in battlefield strategies. But he declined to be more specific, saying that information was classified. All Branches at School The Eglin school, one of only two of its kind in the United States military, trains Army, Air Force, Marine and some foreign military students, as well as Navy personnel. Defense Department officials decided to build the school three years ago, after a survey showed that an 89 percent increase in explosives ordnance demolition technicians would be required by the four services from 1985 to 1990, Commander Mixter said. The school was built at Eglin, a 724- square-mile air base on the Florida Panhandle, because it had enough space to accommodate the school. That space allows for test ranges where explosives can be set off. And the region's normally temperate weather permits year-round outdoor activity. Another factor is that, of the few bases meeting those criteria, Eglin is the closest to the Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal School at Indian Head, Md., the military's only other center for bomb squad training. Common Training Pays Off The new school has a staff of 23 officers and 160 enlisted personnel. About 45 officers and 280 enlisted people are in training at any given time; about 20 percent are women. The school expects to graduate 1,200 students each year. Commander Mixter said the common training for all branches, relatively rare in the American military, pays off when explosive ordnance demolition technicians from different services work together in the field. ''Regardless of the service, you know that he knows what you know,'' the commander said.

1456-> About New York; On Top Where King Kong Once Romped
At the age of 18, Laura Fries landed her first job as a secretary in a hosiery company in the Empire State Building. She worked there for four years, but never deigned to visit the top of what was then the planet's tallest building. ''I was a New Yorker,'' she explained. ''I knew New Yorkers don't do touristy things.'' Mrs. Fries, now 47 years old, has more than made up for lost time. Prancing around the 86th-floor observatory as if she owns the place, she gestures to the clock on the Metropolitan Life Building, which she allows might seem matter-of-fact until you realize the clock is three stories tall. She points to the Flatiron Building - ''the first skyscraper'' - and confesses a particular liking for the view in late afternoon, when chaise lounges materialize outside penthouses. The World Trade Center just might look like the boxes in which the elegant Empire State Building came, but Mrs. Fries is not entirely sure that would be a nice thing to say. ''Nights are best,'' she said. ''It's like you're looking at the sparkling city from an airplane that never lands.'' Lest Mrs. Fries seem an incurable romantic, think again. For over three years she has been the Empire State Building's director of observatories and haunts King Kong's preferred piece of architecture because she is paid to haunt it. It is serious 60-hour-a-week work. At one point, Mrs. Fries grabs a rag from a worker and ferociously polishes a metal fixture herself. The embarrassed worker gets a chance to repeat the job. ''It's not a matter of being tough,'' Mrs. Fries insisted afterward. ''It's a matter of right and wrong.'' Mrs. Fries, an effervescent Portuguese-American, must be doing something right. Each of her three years has seen record attendance, with last year's total surpassing 2 million for the first time and this year's crowds exceeding that pace by 15 percent. A major reason has been a surge of foreign tourists. Because of the multifarious languages heard in elevators, Mrs. Fries has taken to calling the Empire State Building ''the true Tower of Babel.'' The attraction transcends the edifice's 60,000 tons of steel, 10 million bricks and 6,000 windows in much the manner the Eiffel Tower transcends its metal frame. Mrs. Fries thinks the Grand Canyon is an apt comparison. ''We're a colossus, a monolith, a myth,'' she said, sputtering as she groped for yet more adjectives. Truth to tell, the Empire State Building is fraying at the edges. Some elegant mahogany elevators are sadly damaged. Attempts to control grafitti in the small upper observatory at the 102d floor have been met almost instantly with gougings of romantic commitments. ''But no four letter words - except love,'' Mrs. Fries noted. And, now, smoke damage from a fire on Aug. 12 means another repainting will be necessary -with equally predictable results. Still, Mrs. Fries has made progress in things from cleaning to marketing to getting rid of police-style uniforms for the guards. And that figures to be just the beginning. ''I'm moving on to the next phase,'' she declared, declining to elaborate. Mrs. Fries's journey from the hosiery company on the 14th floor of the Empire State Building to the summit was circuitous. There was marriage, a child and the following of her husband's career south to Texas and north to Canada while grabbing a college education on the run. Friendships with executives of Helmsley-Spear Inc., for whom Mrs. Fries had worked years earlier, became the ticket to the top of the building the company manages. It has become Mrs. Fries' domain. On a recent day, she stopped at the front information desk to converse with 77-year-old Hughie Brosnahan, who came to work in 1937 as a temporary employee and is still waiting to be told he can stay permanently. She pointed to shapes in the marble that some swear are angels, others contend are ladies sipping tea and still others think are people pushing shopping carts. Then there was a quick conversation with the young man paid to dress in a gorilla suit. He is tiring of the jokes. Mrs. Fries then checked which elevators were in service, weighing this information against tickets sold. Always, she must be ready to order quick changes. Recently, three bulky Japanese sumo wrestlers were given an entire elevator that would normally have carried 20 people. Next moment, she is making plans for the New York Attractions Network, an alliance she started to promote tourism among the city's top attractions. And has the woman who worked in the Empire State Building for four years without visiting its summit made it to the Statue of Liberty? ''Not yet,'' Mrs. Fries said. ''But it's going to be there for awhile.''

1457-> New York State Agencies Struggle to Meet Information Requests
To the Editor: I suggest that William A. Starna, (''Stumbling Through New York's Freedom of Information Thicket,'' letter, Oct. 13) is being unfair to New York State agencies that try to comply fairly and in a timely manner with all Freedom of Information Law requests. In my capacity as public information officer for the State Banking Department, I process an average of 75 freedom of information requests each month. We are a two-person department, with my secretary handling the logistics of every request. This activity is a relatively small part of my duties. The process is cumbersome and is done manually. My agency, like most, does not have the luxury of computerized retrieval. Files must be found and searched, and the information retrieved. And at each step, a clerk, an examiner, a director or deputy must determine what is confidential and what is not. That takes time and often leads to misunderstanding. Furthermore, many requests are imprecise, often freewheeling searching expeditions, or they involve research by department personnel. For example, a law firm will ask for a certificate of merit and all the supporting documents for the most recent ''de novo'' bank charter application. Why? Simply to be able to copy the format for a client who also wants to open a bank. Never mind that there is ample law on the subject and a kit that shows how to make out an application. My job, in responding to Freedom of Information Law requests is simply to turn over documents, not get involved in a research project. Individuals (and that includes corporations) doing business with a state regulatory agency are entitled under the law to privacy, and their home addresses, finances, business plans and the reports of investigatory agencies are privileged. Would you really want it otherwise? Would you want information about you, your family, your business projections and the like available to anyone who requests it? I think not! I believe all information should be made available to anyone asking for it - from any part of government. Keeping things secret and keeping information confidential for whatever reason is a waste of time. If anyone wants information badly enough, whether a journalist seeking a Pulitzer Prize, a college professor hot to publish or a Soviet K.G.B. agent who wants to keep the playing field level, he or she will get it and relatively quickly. Obviously, my view is in the minority. Most people - probably even Professor Starna and journalists - want information made selectively available. R. H. SYKES New York, Oct. 14, 1988

1458-> Sports People; Inquest to Be Ordered
An inquest will be ordered before the end of the week into the cocaine death of the football player David Croudip, Gwinnett County Coroner Randolph D. Simpson said yesterday. Croudip, a defensive player and captain of the special teams for the Atlanta Falcons, died Oct. 10. Although there is no dispute that Croudip died as a result of taking cocaine, Simpson said, questions about the circumstances of his death have been raised by conflicting stories told by Croudip's wife, Holly. She said she was the only person present when her husband had a seizure after taking cocaine in a fruit drink. In one television interview, she said that her husband never used drugs. But she has reportedly told the Gwinnett police that Croudip had been in drug treatment in California. Croudip's mother, Josephine Thornton, sent a letter to Simpson Tuesday asking him to hold an inquest.

1459-> Review/Opera; A Revised 'Hoffmann'
The mania for critically revised editions is getting out of hand in the world of opera. ''The Tales of Hoffmann'' by the Music Center Opera here -though its admirable features include a strong performance by Placido Domingo in what may be his best role -offers an uninspiring example of what can happen when musicology takes the lead without a strong counterbalance of good theatrical horse sense. Many old scores have been getting a thorough scholarly brush-up in the last two decades, and many have been the benefits therefrom. But recent seasons have seen much inflated promotion (editions now have loudly hyped ''world premieres''), and -perhaps to back up the promotion -exaggerated or downright misleading claims have been made for the wonders a re-examined text will reveal. There is more than a suggestion in much of this that musicological rectitude matters more than good performance or even, in a few cases, good music. Editors figure prominently in the history of ''Hoffmann'' because Offenbach died with the opera unfinished and with some portions in disarray. The original presenters worked to put together the best show possible according to the values of their day; by good and reasonable standards of modern scholarship, their work was flawed. But the first attempt at a critical edition, by Franz Oeser (published in 1978), did not meet with full approbation, and significant new manuscripts were discovered in 1986. Michael Kaye's new edition is much closer to Oeser than to the traditional ''Hoffmann'' (to which it is misleadingly compared, with hardly a mention of Oeser, in the summary by Mr. Kaye distributed here), but different in many details. Both critical editions restore prominence to Hoffmann's sidekick Nicklausse in his double role as the poet's muse, reshape radically the Giulietta act and provide performers with several alternatives in choosing songs for the principal singers other than Hoffmann. And that brings us to the real problem, which all the concern about 12 bars here and a variant line there -however necessary - can mask. In both Oeser and Kaye, the Giulietta act is drastically weaker, theatrically and musically, than the ''corrupt'' old version. We can choose between two undistinguished songs for Giulietta and at least two versions of the denouement; we get lots of meandering filler material, and we lose the two knockout numbers - the ''diamond aria'' and the climactic septet - that, along with the Barcarolle and Hoffmann's aria, make the scene live. The Antonia act and the epilogue are also weakened somewhat. The musicological message to the audience sometimes seems to be, ''That's how he wrote it; eat your peas.'' This is not acceptable, first because death denied Offenbach his own opportunity to trim, reshape and improve, and second because abdication of artistic judgment in deference to the enshrined ideal of the composer's intentions is bad policy. Other things are clear improvements: the prominence of the muse, the first-rate trio in the Olympia act, and several minor details. And it's always important to know what you're dealing with. But after knowledge must come discrimination and judgment. And the cart must not lead the horse. The performance here was badly unfocused: neither Frank Corsaro's direction (despite scattered good touches) nor Richard Buckley's conducting had persuasive shape or momentum. It was most unwise to throw out the recitatives (not by Offenbach, but often very good) in favor of dialogue (in French, often very bad). It is a pleasure to see Mr. Domingo having such a good time with a part: his prologue and Olympia act were delightful, and his voice, though not as tractable as the music really wants, rang out superbly. But he could not carry the show alone. The multiple incarnations of his nemesis were very well sung by Rodney Gilfry, but inept staging badly undermined their sinister impact. Julia Migenes was just not up to the assumption of the multiple heroines; barely managing the music, she gave an underenergized dramatic performance as well. Stephanie Vlahos was a fair Nicklausse; the smaller roles were not on the whole well done. All in all, a sure-fire opera became a long, ill-paced, ill-constructed evening. That's not progress.

1460-> SPORTS PEOPLE; Cavalier Star Out
Ron Harper, who would have been guarding Michael Jordan, will probably miss the Cleveland Cavaliers' opening playoff game in Chicago against the Bulls tomorrow night, Coach Lenny Wilkens of Cleveland said yesterday. Craig Ehlo, a 6-foot-7-inch forward-guard, will replace Harper in the starting lineup if Harper can't play, Wilkens said. ''It doesn't seem possible that Ron will be able to play in the first game, but we'll keep evaluating the situation on a day-to-day basis,'' Wilkens said. ''He's having treatments and his ankle is still sore, but he's walking around more. We'll play it by ear.'' Harper sprained his right ankle late in the first half of Cleveland's 107-103 victory at Chicago last Friday. Cleveland went 11-13 when Harper missed 24 games early in the season with a severely sprained left ankle and a chipped bone in his left foot.

1461-> Review/Dance; Phaedra's Tragedy in 2 Retellings
For the final week of its season, which concludes Sunday night, the Martha Graham Dance Company has introduced two more works by Miss Graham. ''Celebration,'' the 1934 stunner revived last year, is very much a plus. ''Phaedra's Dream,'' created in 1983, is something of a minus. This second treatment by Miss Graham of the Phaedra myth is a minor work, but its inclusion at the City Center (131 West 55th Street) is part of an interesting gimmick. For the first time in New York, ''Phaedra,'' Miss Graham's more substantial retelling of 1962 and the schematic ''Phaedra's Dream'' were seen nearly back to back. Moreover, Christine Dakin was the superb Phaedra in both versions and in a blazing tour de force, managed to give a very different interpretation in each work of the same character. ''Phaedra's Dream,'' performed on Saturday afternoon after ''Phaedra'' on Friday, is long on concept and short on choreography. Nonetheless it has a special twist that has its roots in Greek drama. Here, in Miss Graham's reductionist outline, Hippolytus, Phaedra's stepson, is made to spurn his stepmother because he is attracted by a male figure called the Stranger. Miss Graham is too astute to leave things at that. She has made the action part of a dream, and the dream itself is presented at first as a ritual drama with the characters offering Noh-like bows to the public. The identity of the Stranger is never revealed. In true Graham style, he may be an inner aspect of Hippolytus, symbolizing a secret instinct. Or he may even be a fantasy father-figure, for at a key moment the son folds up on the Stranger's thighs just as Theseus did on the lap of Jocasta in Miss Graham's ''Night Journey.'' Theseus, unaware that he is Jocasta's son, is also her lover in that scene. It is not too much to suggest that Miss Graham expects her public to catch the choreographic allusions to her own work and that the incestuous image we think we see in ''Phaedra's Dream'' is actually there. Euripides, in his play ''Hippolytus,'' suggested that his hero was asexual, beholden to Artemis, goddess of chastity; he had, in fact, angered Aphrodite, goddess of love, for his ''scorn of women.'' Miss Graham takes it from there in ''Phaedra's Dream.'' Hippolytus is seen as caught up in a tug of war between Phaedra and the Stranger. Miss Dakin, ''asleep'' and writhing on her bed, foresees the drama to come, including Hippolytus's death. Isamu Noguchi's monumental decor includes a huge disk and a lintel fragment that the characters nearly use as weapons. There is one highly memorable moment when Miss Dakin sits in a split atop the wheel, a defiant angry feminine spirit. The performance as a whole was marked by a remarkable tension and anger. Donlin Foreman's powerfully danced Stranger was the aggressor and Kenneth Topping's Hippolytus was not an unwilling player in this domestic triangle. Too often one overlooks what strength and support the male partners commit to the Graham choreography. Both men were outstanding, and one won't forget Mr. Foreman plunging into a back fall while Miss Dakin stands on his thighs. The music - George Crumb's ''Lux Aeterna'' - was played on tape and tended merely to hang in the air. The dancers had to plow through the sound and Miss Dakin was the inexorable leader of the pack, fighting every instant for what her heroine desired. In ''Phaedra'' on Friday night she showed, most impressively, a very different and lyric face as a woman torn by desire. Miss Graham has made this Phaedra a victim of the gods or goddesses. The all-new cast featured Mr. Topping again, looking properly bewildered as this Hippolytus. Denise Vale's Aphrodite had a prom-queen tinge that was not out of place and Thea Nerissa Barnes, ambiguously turning a smile into a snarl, was a witty Artemis. Mr. Foreman's Theseus was a nuanced drunken lout who was still a king. Kim Stroud as Pasiphae, Phaedra's mother, danced with provocative angular force. It was an exciting cast, brimming with apt theatricality. On Saturday ''Seraphic Dialogue'' had Terese Capucilli, strongly ecstatic as Joan of Arc awaiting sainthood. Her solos were outstandingly danced, imbued with the dramatic tension and accents that only she can give. Each solo distilled the aspect of Joan that was portrayed later by Miss Vale, Jacqulyn Buglisi and Joyce Herring. Miss Capucilli's saint is a warrior at heart, sweeping in gesture, and she most definitely does not want to be a martyr. Mr. Foreman's St. Michael was movingly paternalistic toward her. As for ''Celebration,'' this joyful study in form and energy, danced with stamina and exuberance by 12 women who are members of the junior Graham ensemble, looks as dazzlingly experimental as ever. Stanley Sussman conducted Louis Horst's score with his customary intelligence.

1462-> Review/Television; The Met Opera's 'Ariadneauf Naxos'
Tonight at 8:30 on Channel 13, ''The Metropolitan Opera Presents'' (formerly ''Live From the Met'') concludes its season with ''Ariadne auf Naxos.'' Produced by Samuel J. Paul, the series has been at its best this year with a mix of unusually telegenic productions. The two previous presentations were ''Turandot,'' approached with unbridled lavishness by Franco Zeffirelli, and a handsome, well-acted rendering of ''The Tales of Hoffmann.'' Staged by Bodo Igesz on a set designed by Oliver Messel, this production of ''Ariadne'' manages to make the relatively ''small'' work comfortable within the vast reaches of the Met's stage. And for television, Brian Large has kept the cameras fixed tightly on the principals, pulling back only infrequently for shots of the full stage. A sense of intimacy is carefully maintained, and the effort works beautifully. With music by Richard Strauss and a libretto by Hugo von Hofmannsthal, ''Ariadne'' had it first performance in 1912 as a one-act divertissement for a shortened version of Moliere's ''Bourgeois Gentilhomme.'' The play was being offered in a Hofmannsthal translation with incidental music by Strauss. Instead of offering his guests a Turkish ballet, M. Jordain, the nouveau riche social climber, regaled his guests with an opera. There was one problem. Demanding both actors and singers, the production was too expensive for most theaters. Back to the drawing board. By 1916, the opera was plucked out of the play and given a prologue of its own. That is the version usually seen today. The setting is now Vienna, and the prologue takes place in the palace of the city's richest man, whose lackeys rush about arranging for the after-dinner performance of an opera. The young composer is not happy to discover that his serious work about transcendent love will be followed by an Italian comic troupe. He is even more upset when the arrogant patron decrees that both presentations will be performed simultaneously. The poor fellow - the role is sung by a soprano - finds himself in the traditional performing-arts bind: there will be either an opera with ''a few mutilations'' or no opera at all. The rest is the opera itself. The majestic Ariadne, professing her disdain for the foolishness of this world, is supported regally by the trio of Naiad, Dryad and Echo, their roots clearly in the Rhinemaidens that Richard Wagner fancied. The sprightly Zerbinetta, reveling in her fickleness, cavorts with four male comedians out of opera buffa. The concept is clever, allowing Strauss to range from soaring dramatic arias to dazzling coloratura exhibitions. Much, if not all, of course, depends on the singers. In this instance, the Met hasn't stinted. Dominating the Prologue, Tatiana Troyanos is the ardent composer, gloriously otherworldly even as she succumbs to the more immediate charms of the spirited Italian star. This is all the more understandable because Zerbinetta is played by Kathleen Battle, who looks and sounds enchanting. And quite literally dominating the opera is Jessye Norman as Ariadne, rising from her melancholy swoons to deliver an extraordinarily rich, ravishing demonstration in the art of the dramatic soprano. James King's Bacchus is, unfortunately, not in the same imposing league. The intermission after the Prologue is fleshed out with a short documentary produced for Maysles Films by Susan Froemke, Pat Jaffe and Peter Gelb, who is also executive producer of ''The Metropolitan Opera Presents.'' Going backstage to rehearsals for ''Ariadne,'' the film finds little to surprise most buffs, but, perhaps unintentionally, there is an amusing lesson on how to stroke artistic egos. James Levine, the conductor and company director, is seen working with several of the stars. His vocabulary relies heavily on exclamations. With Ms. Norman: ''Fabulous!'' With Ms. Battle: ''Sensational!'' Back to Ms. Norman, who sweetly wishes that Ariadne had ''about six more lines'' in the Prologue: ''Terrific!'' Mr. Levine later assures her, ''Just fabulous! Unbelievable!'' He's a bit incredible himself. This performance of ''Ariadne auf Naxos'' was taped at a Saturday matinee on March 12. At the time, it was broadcast live to a potential audience of more than 200 million viewers in Europe and, in a first, in the Soviet Union. This evening's presentation will be simulcast in stereo on WQXR (1560 AM, 96.3 FM).

1463-> Senate Panel Votes to Subpoena North Diaries in Drug Inquiry
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 16 to 1 today to subpoena the private working diaries of Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North in its continuing investigation of international drug smuggling. Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, expressed concern that the originals of the diaries had never been turned over to the Government in uncensored form. He said the originals might be in the hands of Colonel North or his lawyer, Brendan V. Sullivan. Mr. Sullivan's office said that neither he nor Colonel North would have any comment on the subpoena. The subpoena calls for Colonel North, who was on the staff of the National Security Council, and Mr. Sullivan to produce 2,848 pages of handwritten diary notes with no deletions. The notes cover the period from September 1984 until November 1986 when Colonel North was dismissed from his position on the National Security Council in the controversy over the sale of arms to Iran and the diversion of some profits to the Nicaraguan rebels. #1,269 Pages Are Censored A version of the North diary has been made available to the Congressional committees investigating the Iran-contra affair, but Senator Kerry said the Colonel North and Mr. Sullivan heavily censored 1,269 pages with black ink. Speaking of the diaries, Mr. Kerry told the committee: ''I'm not asserting that there's a smoking gun or something hidden or that some of the redactions are not appropriate. My assertion is that given what has already been declassified, I don't know how we can proceed with our investigation without being able to see all of it.'' Senator Kerry has made it clear that he believes there was a connection between drug running and efforts to supply and arm the contras. Some testimony before his subcommittee on narcotics and terrorism has focused on that possibility. Contra leaders have denied involvement in drug trafficking. Censored versions of the diaries originally were provided to the Congressional Iran-contra panel under the grant of limited immunity from prosecution given to Colonel North in exchange for his testimony before the panel last year. Senator Kerry said that in order to speed up the hearing process the Iran-contra panel had permitted Colonel North and Mr. Sullivan to block out sections they deemed to be irrelevant to that investigation. But Senator Kerry said John Nields, chief counsel of the House Iran-contra committee, said there were many sections that appeared to be ''very relevant'' to his panel's narcotics investigation. North Facing Trial Colonel North is facing trial on Federal charges in the Iran-contra affair, but Senator Kerry said he had been assured by the staff of special prosecutor in the case, Lawrence E. Walsh, that making the documents available to the Foreign Relations Committee would not interfere with the prosecution. Colonel North and three co-defendants were indicted by a Federal grand jury on March 16 on charges of conspiracy, theft and wire fraud involving what the prosecutors said was the secret sale of United States weapons to Iran and the diversion of the proceeds to the contras. Colonel North retired from Marines, effective at the end of the month. Seventy-four pages of Colonel North's notes were released today. Often interspersed in notations about logistics of the efforts of the Nicaraguan contras are references to drugs, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Customs Service, the Panamanian ruler, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, and agents of the Central Intelligence Agency. But Senator Kerry complained that most such references were preceeded or followed with large blacked-out sections. One note dated June 27, 1984, reads, ''Drug Case - DEA progress on combatting cocaine,'' and refers to possible Colombian negotiations to move drug refining to Nicaragua. An entry from the previous month notes that C.I.A.'s Latin American chief, Duane Clarridge, had called and indicated that (name deleted) ''contact indicates that Gustavo is involved with drugs.'' The identity of ''Gustavo'' is unclear.

1464-> Review/Theater; 650 Years Between Parallel Lives
There are entertaining moments in ''The Green Death'' by Peter Mattaliano, and a few laughs, but those are small satisfactions in a play billed as a black comedy that drags its way through more than two hours of confusion. The most memorable incident in the production at the Actor's Outlet Theater is the change of scenery in the first act. Charles E. McCarry has devised a set that is transformed in an instant from a dark medieval inn to a gleaming neo-classical Connecticut mansion. It deserves the applause it gets. In fact, until then the play shows a bit of promise. During the Black Death in 1347 a lustful priest and nun blunder into an empty tavern to enjoy each other and share a bag of money looted from a monastery. But they are immediately joined by a noblewoman, a knight and his squire, a witch who is an alchemist and a knave who has the plague. The struggle of these thieves and rogues for survival and pleasure in a world ruled by death is at times surprisingly funny. Switch to Connecticut 650 years later. The characters are now a rich widow, a television reporter, a businessman, a scientist, a sociologist, a servant and a medium - or, in her New Age jargon, a channel. They are the same people as in the first episode, facing the same problem: a plague called the Green Death, so named because its victims' thumbs and forefingers turn green as they die. It always kills the poorest people in any cohort. But there is an exception, and the secret of this one poor survivor's immunity provides what little plot there is. The occasions for dark humor in such a setup are all too obvious, and here too obviously exploited. Furthermore, Mr. Mattaliano seems to have thrown in every old gag that came his way. There are simple-minded skits on everything from exercising to lisping and to top it all off there is a cannibal banquet. That the wisp of a story does not survive this mindless maze of diversion is no wonder. Most of the actors have the good sense to seize any comic opportunity they can find and play it for what it's worth. It is their exuberance that provides the few moments of real pleasure. MIDAS TOUCH WITH A GREEN THUMB - THE GREEN DEATH, written and directed by Peter Mattaliano; setting by Charles E. McCarry; lighting designer, Randall Etheredge; costume designer, Joseph A. Cigliano; choreographer, Patricia Wilcox; fight director, Brandon E. Doemling; production stage manager, Juliann Flynn. Presented by Actor's Outlet Theater, by special arrangement with Randy Charnin. At 120 West 28th Street. WITH: Nelson Avidon, Ralph Buckley, Frank Dahill, Janis Dardaris, Stephani Hardy, Suzy Hunt and Steve Robinson.

1465-> SPORTS OF THE TIMES; Who's Hiding the Money?
All over America today, parents are ripping apart their sons' mail, attacking music cassettes with hammer and screwdriver. This is it, the big break, no more cheap cars, no more clipping coupons. Imagine the disillusionment when all they find is yards of plastic tape. ''All right, where is it?'' fathers are shouting. ''Where is what?'' the sons are replying. ''Don't play dumb,'' the fathers are saying. ''I read about the young man in California who signed for a package containing 20 $50 bills, delivered by an air freight company.'' ''Pop, that was from the University of Kentucky,'' the sons are explaining. ''Nobody's sending me any bills in the mail. I'm a student. I'm not an athlete.'' IT has come to this, bills fluttering out of a torn package containing a video cassette, documented by workers in an airport freight depot. Suspicions of recruiting abuses by the University of Kentucky basketball program. Again. It's a good thing this latest apparent scandal was broken by The Los Angeles Daily News and not by a paper closer to the U.K. campus. The last time anybody got evidence on Kentucky basketball, a few years back, people were so upset that they canceled their subscriptions to The Lexington Herald-Leader, which hurt that paper's credibility so badly that it merely earned a Pulitzer Prize for the disclosures. A video cassette would be the most illustrious hiding place since Whittaker Chambers retrieved State Department documents from a pumpkin during the Alger Hiss trials. In the current VCR frolics, Chris Mills, the basketball prodigy, signed for the package apparently sent by Dwane Casey, an assistant coach at U.K. His father, Claud Mills, was informed by Emery Worldwide officials that the package contained $1,000. Father and son both deny seeing the bills. There is no attempt to assign guilt in this little drama, but the clues suggest the inherent dishonesty of big-time sports. To see college athletes with sports cars and gold jewelry and designer clothes is to know that at least some of the loot is trickling down to them, even if through ruses like VCR packages, no-show jobs or rewarding handshakes from boosters after a good game. ONE could argue that this is part of education, part of growing up, to understand that college officials and boosters will find a way to circumvent the rules. But maybe it's time to make honest men out of college athletes. (The women don't generate enough money to cheat on this level, at least not yet.) Ernest Chambers, a Nebraska state legislator, thinks it is time to put players on salary. A registered independent from Omaha, Senator Chambers managed to get a bill passed by the majority of 49 senators in the unicameral Nebraska Legislature, but Gov. Kay Orr vetoed the bill on April 13 when it was too late for the Senate to take further action. The bill said football players in Nebraska would be paid a stipend (Chambers suggests an equal sum between $500 and $1,000 per month), but only when at least four other state legislatures of Big Eight schools passed similar bills. Meaning, don't hold your breath. ''The Governor said state law is not the appropriate format,'' said Doug Parrott, the director of communications for Governor Orr. ''She urged the Board of Regents to make a decision on the issue and convey it to the N.C.A.A. She did not discuss the merits.'' Many college officials insist that a scholarship is valuable compensation for playing football or basketball, but Chambers, not an athlete himself, argues that athletes are short-changed. ''They can't have other jobs during the season because they work hard at what they do,'' he said. ''They are the only students who can be publicly embarrassed on national television. They can lose their scholarships. They are marketed and sold in a commercial package. There is $10 million generated by Nebraska football alone. But they cannot be paid.'' MANY college coaches, particularly Dale Brown, the often prophetic basketball coach at Louisiana State University, have expressed guilt that they cannot even shell out funds for a player to go home in a family emergency. Tom Osborne, the Nebraska football coach, who did not return a telephone message, has talked about stipends for athletes in the past, but he opposed Senator Chambers's bill. Senator Chambers does not think free college tuition is enough because athletes are often channeled into courses that do not lead to graduation. He said athletes should be paid for their labors, ''just as if they were cutting cane or digging coal.'' ''I like to watch football,'' said Senator Chambers, a barber by occupation. ''But I watch it with a divided mind. They get injured, they're no good to themselves. Their options are not good. Most of them become the flotsam and jetsam of football, but the public only cares when they are playing.'' Many of the players chosen in this week's draft by the National Football League have already dropped out of school to prepare for pro ball. Many of them will never again get back to a college campus. Some people argue that it might be time to pay athletes the equivalent of their college education and let them decide whether they want to go to class. Probably fewer men would get any kind of rudimentary education in that case, but it would be their choice. Or, a nice $1,000 a month above free tuition would reward athletes for their labors. None of this would end the frantic maneuvers to recruit blue-chip athletes. But maybe it would stop some of the subterfuge. Instead of sending the money in unmarked bills, hidden in a VCR, which just may have been the case in that Kentucky-California package, they could send the money in more conventional ways. Normally ''The check is in the mail'' is the biggest lie in America. In this case, it would be a step in the right direction.

1466-> Review/Ballet; First 'Sleeping Beauty' Of Ballet Theater Season
''The Sleeping Beauty'' is surely the grandest choreographic spectacle of the 19th century. With its curses, spells and struggles between good and evil, it's also a good story. And, though the pace is leisurely, it's a story well told, thanks to the choreographic variety of the dances that Marius Petipa created in 1890. For a production of this ballet to come alive, the cast must both dance well and take the story seriously. ''The Sleeping Beauty'' was often very much alive on Monday night at the Metropolitan Opera House when American Ballet Theater offered Sir Kenneth MacMillan's staging of the classic for the first time this season. Susan Jaffe, who portrayed Princess Aurora, the heroine, improved steadily as the work progressed. She looked rushed, rather than eager, at her first entrance and, although she sustained the balances in her Rose Adagio competently, she never quite created the illusion that she was a radiant young woman in the springtime of her life. But once the choreographic perils of the adagio were behind her, she relaxed in her dancing. Partnered by Ross Stretton, her dignified and attentive prince, she created a sense of calm with the spaciouness of her movements in the vision scene and her final pas de deux with Mr. Stretton was genuinely aristocratic. Cast as Aurora's fairy godmother, the Lilac Fairy, Christine Dunham was always gracious. Yet she could have commanded the stage more authoritatively in her struggles with the evil fairy, Carabosse. The dancers of the prologue's other fairy variations included Lucette Katerndahl, Deirdre Carberry, Julie Kent, Amy Rose and Christina Fagundes, several of whom seemed aware that these variations are most effective when they are treated not simply as collections of classroom steps, but as choreographic images of the blessings bestowed upon Aurora. Ms. Kent's lightness was attractive and, in a variation filled with pointing gestures of the fingers, Ms. Fagundes was clear and emphatic, without turning harsh. In the final divertissements, the jewel variations were charmingly led by Alessandra Ferri. Her partner was Wes Chapman, who moved with attractive ease. However, Bonnie Moore and Johan Renvall sometimes looked forced in the Bluebird pas de deux. Mr. Renvall was also weighed down by an unbecomingly bulky headdress. Michael Owen proved a distinguished mime in the travesty role of Carabosse. Looking remarkably like Queen Elizabeth I of England, he seethed with venom and made every gesture dramatically telling from his violent outbursts of rage to the small, but furious, tremblings of his fingers. John Taras was amusing as a pompous courtier, and Victor Barbee and Jennet Zerbe made the king and queen young, benevolent monarchs. Although Nicholas Georgiadis's settings for this production, which was first presented last year, are appropriately opulent, certain aspects of them remain bothersome. Some of the palace decorations resemble cake icing and meringue, and the hunting-party scene appears to occur in a swamp, rather than a forest. Moreover, the scenery is sometimes so detailed that the costumes do not stand out clearly against it. Nevertheless, despite these scenic problems, on Monday there were many times when the dancing stood out and glowed. Jack Everly conducted Tchaikovsky's score, which, with its dramatic intensity and melodic beauty, helps make the fine choreography look especially distinguished.

1467-> Jersey's Top Court Limits the Death Penalty to Intentional Murders
The New Jersey Supreme Court ruled today that the death penalty could be imposed only on those who intentionally commit murder. In an opinion written by Justice Robert L. Clifford, the court held that ''the infliction of capital punishment on one who does not intend his or her victim's death is a violation of our state constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.'' The court noted that the provision in the State Constitution was narrower than that in the United States Constitution. While Federal case law would allow execution of those who commit homicides through ''reckless indifference to human life,'' the New Jersey court said they would not be subject to the death penalty under the state law. The court's analysis, which it said was intended to cure a flaw in the state law, came in a decision that overturned the capital-murder conviction of a man found guilty of the burglary of a home and the killing of one of the residents in 1982. The case was remanded for a new trial on that charge and a new death-penalty hearing if warranted. The court upheld other charges on which the defendant, Walter M. Gerald, 30 years old, of Pleasantville, had been convicted, including aggravated assault and felony murder, which does not carry the death penalty. The other six justices concurred in the result of Justice Clifford's opinion, but Justice Daniel J. O'Hern wrote a separate opinion differing on one point and Justice Alan B. Handler wrote an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part from the majority. Justice O'Hern said the majority opinion created a noncapital class of murder that appeared to be already covered by the law dealing with aggravated assault. Justice Handler said the entire death-penalty law was unconstitutional because of a lack of uniform standards to guide prosecutorial discretion and assure fair sentencing. Justice Clifford held that to be subject to the death penalty a person must cause death by his or her own hand and must do it knowingly and purposely or hire someone to do so. The court ruling drew a distinction between ''purposely and knowingly causing serious bodily injury resulting in death'' and ''purposely and knowingly causing death.'' Even though the result is the same, the court said, the death penalty is appropriate only in the latter case.

1469-> Open Positions on Short Sales Increase 3.4% on Nasdaq
The National Association of Securities Dealers reported yesterday that the number of shares sold short and not yet covered for the most active over-the-counter securities edged up by 4.7 million shares, or 3.4 percent, in the month ended April 14. The increase in the ''short interest'' brought the total number of uncovered shares sold short to 140.3 million, compared with an adjusted 135.6 million in March, the association said. Those figures represent short-selling activity for the 2,553 securities traded in the association's national market system in April, 15 more than in March. In a short sale, an investor, betting that a stock price will decline, sells borrowed stock, expecting to buy back an equal number of shares later at a lower price and thus make a profit. In March the short position rose 1 percent. Some traders and analysts consider such a rise bearish, because it presumably represents a strong, cumulative belief that the market will turn down. Others interpret a higher short interest figure as a bullish sign, because the short-sellers must eventually return to the market to replace the stock they borrowed. ''That is a bullish sign when the short sales are up,'' said Robert O'Toole, an executive vice president in charge of over-the-counter trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ''It's not a big, big percent, but it is definitely a bullish move. A short increase of 3 percent means there's a lot of stock to be bought back, a lot of buying power that someday has to be covered.'' Assuming that all short-sellers covered their shorts simultaneously, the April short interest would amount to 1.48 days of average daily Nasdaq national market system volume, unchanged from March, the association said. The association also said that short interest in 1,273 less active securities traded in its automated quotation system but not in the national market system totaled 50.1 million shares in April, down 10.4 percent from 55.9 million shares in March, when 1,247 securities were involved. The number of shares in which a short position is still held by investors is totaled by each exchange and by the N.A.S.D. each month.

1472-> University Given $20 Million By Perot for Medical Studies
The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, one of the most respected medical schools in the nation, said today that it was receiving a $20 million gift from H. Ross Perot, the Texas businessman, to support its Nobel Prize-winning cholesterol research and to train medical scientists. The donation, which will be paid over 10 years, is the largest ever received by any arm of the University of Texas. Mr. Perot, who has been an outspoken advocate of education and research in Texas, gave $15 million for a new biotechnology research center at the University of Texas at San Antonio last September. At a news conference at the Southwestern Medical Center today, Mr. Perot said: ''This institution is teetering on the brink of world-class status. The depth here is really exciting.'' Mr. Perot, founder and former chairman of the Electronic Data Systems Corporation, left the company in December 1986 after the General Motors Corporation, which bought E.D.S. in 1984, acquired his interest in G.M. for $700 million. Work Led to a Drug The Perot gift will be used to expand the research of Dr. Michael Brown and Dr. Joseph Goldstein, who shared the 1985 Nobel Prize for medicine for their discoveries of how cholesterol is absorbed by human body cells. The drug lovastatzin, developed from their work, is widely used to reduce the threat of heart attacks in patients with high cholesterol levels. The gift will also expand research on diabetes, kidney and prostate disease and disorders of the brain and nervous system. The money will also be used to more than triple the number of students at the medical center working toward doctorates in both medicine and one of the natural sciences. That would make its dual-doctorate program one of the largest in the nation. The program is expected to have 90 students, with 15 entering each year. Now there are 26 students with five admitted each year. The Southwestern Medical Center is one of 25 medical schools with the dual-doctorate, a six- or seven-year curriculum known as the Medical Scientist Training Program. Medical educators consider it the nation's best program for preparing medical researchers of the future, with most students having ranked among the top one percent of the nation's medical school applicants. High tuition costs have been a major factor in reducing the number of students applying for the medical scientists program. The Perot award will give post-doctoral students up to $25,000 a year, in addition to present stipends of $20,000 to $25,000. Students working toward their medical degrees will receive full tuition scholarships, plus annual stipends starting at $12,000 for the first two years, and reaching $18,000 in the final year of the progrm.

1475-> Walkouts Disrupt Republican Caucuses in Michigan
Michigan's Republican caucuses, the first of the 1988 Presidential campaign, were disrupted tonight by delegate walkouts, and the campaign of Vice President Bush charged that followers of Pat Robertson tried to confuse the process to deny Mr. Bush a victory. ''They couldn't make it, so they tried this crummy thing,'' said Mary Matalin, Mr. Bush's political director. ''They couldn't win it on the numbers.'' But Mr. Robertson's campaign vigorously denied this. It said his supporters had walked out of many meetings because of legitimate disputes over rules. The Michigan Republican party has been bitterly divided by the dispute between the Bush and Robertson forces. They had fought in the press and in the courts over a series of rules changes, each charging the other with trying to manipulate the process. There were walkouts in at least 26 of the state's 124 county conventions and the Bush campaign estimated that as many as 30 of them had broken up in the furor over rules. The county conventions were electing delegates to a state convention. The state convention, in turn, will elect Michigan's 77 delegates to the Republican National Convention at the end of the month. Robertson Camp Disputes Tally The results, as reported by news services, showed Mr. Bush with a large lead statewide and he seemed certain to emerge the victor in that tally. With 94 percent of the 124 meetings reporting, Mr. Bush had 896 delegates, or 67 percent, and Mr. Robertson had 354, or 22 percent. Representative Jack Kemp of New York had 261, or 17 percent. But Ben Waldman, Mr. Robertson's spokesman, said the official count inflated the Bush total because it included meetings where Mr. Robertson's delegates had walked out, thus allowing Mr. Bush sweeping victories. Mr. Waldman denied the Bush charge that Mr. Robertson's campaign intentionally disrupted the vote. ''There are a lot of those conventions where our people were locked out, or where they gave us no choice but to bolt,'' Mr. Waldman said. Ms. Matalin, however, said the Robertson supporters walked out of several of the meetings only after they had established that they lacked the votes to win. 'Illegal and Null and Void' Typical of the walkouts was one by Mr. Robertson's supporters at the Ingham County convention. Mr. Robertson's forces walked out after losing a procedural ruling to supporters of Vice President Bush. James Muffett, Mr. Robertson's county coordinator, then rose and declared the meeting ''illegal and null and void.'' He led his supporters out of the hall to Chadwick's, a nearby restaurant, where they held a rump convention. Over recent months, Mr. Bush's campaign had gone to court to overturn rules governing tonight's process that had been passed by the Republican state committee, which is controlled by the Robertson campaign and its allies. Mr. Bush has won all the legal battles, although Mr. Robertson's campaign is continuing with appeals. In effect, Mr. Bush's campaign argued that tonight's meetings should have been held in accordance with the court rulings. Mr. Robertson's campaign insisted that the state committee's rules should apply. The walkouts made it more likely than ever that tonight's meetings would not decide, as they were supposed to, which candidate the Michigan delegation will support at the Republican National Convention in New Orleans this summer. The battle could lead to an accreditation fight over the Michigan delegation at the New Orleans convention. Bush Was Seen as Likely Victor Since all the delegates to the caucuses had already been chosen and their preferences largely made public, Republicans in various camps were able to agree before the voting began tonight that Mr. Bush was certain to emerge victorious in 7 of the state's 18 Congressional districts, and Mr. Robertson in 4. Bob Dole, the Senate minority leader, declined to participate in Michigan's tumultuous process, as did two other Republican Presidential candidates, former Gov. Pete du Pont of Delaware and former Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. But supporters of Representative Kemp, the other Republican Presidential contender, have played a key role in the infighting here, since neither Mr. Robertson nor Mr. Bush had an absolute majority of the delegates and needed to woo the Kemp backers to take control in many areas. Initially, Mr. Kemp's supporters allied as a group with Mr. Robertson's, in an effort to embarrass Mr. Bush here. Mr. Kemp himself formally supports the coalition with Mr. Robertson. Split in Kemp Camp But Mr. Kemp's backers are now split, many of them having switched sides and formed alliances with Mr. Bush. As a result, Mr. Kemp had delegates on Robertson-dominated slates in some districts tonight and on Bush slates in others. The disruptions tonight followed what had appeared to be a retreat by Robertson supporters earlier in the day from their threats to walk out over the rules disputes with the Bush forces. ''Both sides have gotten to the brink of mutual annihilation,'' Ben Waldman, a spokesman for the Robertson campaign, said early in the day, ''and they backed off when they saw how horrible it would be.'' But here in Ingham County tonight, the Robertson campaign seemed to be following a prepared script that suggested that the walkout was part of a broad campaign strategy. After objecting to the seating of a group of party officials that the Bush campaign insisted were entitled to vote under recent court rulings, the Robertson delegates declared the convention illegal, called a new one and streamed to the exits. The breakdown of Michigan's caucus procedures into a bitter series of lawsuits and battles over rules has been an embarrassment to the state's Republicans, who had hoped to enhance their influence by being the first in the nation to vote. Today former Governor William Milliken criticized the entire process. ''We've had nothing really but chaos here,'' he said, ''and it hasn't served the two-party system, in my judgment.'' Backfire Against Bush The Michigan procedures were initially established with the idea that party regulars, mainly those loyal to Mr. Bush, would win control easily and send a Bush delegation to the national convention. But the plan backfired on its architects. At a party primary in August 1986, Mr. Robertson shocked the Bush campaign by winning a large share of the precinct delegates who voted in tonight's caucuses. The Robertson campaign gained that victory by placing more candidates on the ballot than Mr. Bush did. As a result, Mr. Robertson had about 40 percent of the delegates, and Mr. Bush found himself short of a majority.

1476-> Dance: City Ballet in 'Piano Pieces'
ONE of the pleasures of frequent ballet-going is the chance it gives to see dancers step into new roles. On Wednesday, the New York City Ballet offered such an opportunity in a performance at the New York State Theater that boasted four role debuts in Jerome Robbins's ''Piano Pieces.'' The dance, created in 1981 and set to solo piano music composed by Tchaikovsky, is one of Mr. Robbins's lightest pieces. A sherbet of a ballet, it displays its dancers as frolicsome young people caught in brief moments of quiet, contemplative passion. And its lead male role challenges the interpreter with dancing that must be fast, precise and quick-shifting in focus, as well as unwaveringly insouciant and even teasing. Peter Boal is one of the company's most gifted classicists and he made deft work of the role's pivoting turns and jumps, flicking them off in just the right continuous flow of dancing. He also brought an appealing sunniness to his two solos, recovering from one moment of imbalance with a memorable grace. But Mr. Boal has a small, slight build and he often seemed to skim across the choreography's surace rather than sinking with its earthy folk accents. Lindsay Fischer, new in his role, was an exemplary partner to Kyra Nichols in the ballet's ''Reverie'' duet. His eyes never left her, and his arms stretched, with all the music's languidness, to support her and offer a soft-edged, open cage for the glittering bird suggested by Ms. Nichols's dancing. Lauren Hauser dove delicately into the piquant ''November-Troika'' duet, in which she was partnered by an enjoyably mischievous Jock Soto. Ms. Hauser's dancing has a crystalline precision that presents and frames the smallest steps and gestures with telling but unobtrusive clarity. Her small-scaled pawing of the air in the ballerina's supported midair ''walk,'' for instance, were one of the delights of the performance. Kelly Cass is clearly a young performer to watch. A flea-sized dynamo, she is capable of great charm and that charm shone through the ''Polka de Salon,'' danced with Mr. Boal and Roma Sosenko. The good lean cast also included Maria Calegari and Leonid Kozlov. A coltish Margaret Tracey and Jeffrey Edwards and Damian Woetzel, both dancing with crisp vigor, stood out in the corps. The program was completed by ''Les Gentilhommes,'' by Peter Martins, and ''Walpurgisnacht Ballet'' and ''Agon,'' both by George Balanchine. Robert Irving conducted.

1477-> West to Resume Farm Aid to Ethiopia
The World Bank and several Western nations will resume agricultural development aid to Ethiopia, which has agreed to create new incentives for food production to combat a famine, United Nations officials and diplomats say. The policy change by Ethiopia's Marxist Government is seen as an important success for the West's position of linking new development aid for the poorest African countries to market-oriented policies that encourage farmers and businesses to increase production. The resumption of Western agricultural aid to Ethiopia is unlikely to have an immediate effect on the famine that developed late last year, officials say, although it should lessen the risk of further food shortages. The nations resuming agricultural development aid do not include the United States, which cut off all assistance except emergency famine relief in 1977. The Administration remains barred by law from resuming development aid because of the Ethiopia's poor human rights record. Million Tons of Food Pledged Michael Priestley, the United Nations emergency relief coordinator in Ethiopia, said this week that nations had pledged 1,036,000 tons of the 1.3 million tons of emergency food aid that the United Nations estimates Ethiopia will need this year. Since the 1974 revolution that overthrew Emperor Haile Selassie and brought the Marxist regime of President Mengistu Haile Mariam to power, the United States, the World Bank, the European Community and several other donors have suspended or reduced agricultural development aid to Ethiopia to protest the Government's policies. But these nations and organizations are providing Ethiopia with emergency food supplies to relieve the famine. The agricultural policies to which aid donors objected included the creation of Soviet-style collective farms, the forced resettlement of peasants, a Government monopoly of the food trade and the setting of artifically low food prices that gave farmers no incentive to increase output, officials say. The World Bank suspended new assistance for rural farmers in 1984. The European Community signed a five-year, $250 million aid program with Ethiopia in 1985, but it has refused to allocate money for rural agricultural development projects since then. Britain has ended its aid program for Ethiopia, and the Swedish program was reduced. But in December the Ethiopian Government began to change its agricultural policy under pressure from aid-giving nations and its second major famine of the decade, officials say. Russians Encouraged Changes Even the Soviet Embassy in Addis Ababa encouraged Ethiopia to make the changes, a Western aid official reported. In particular, the Government increased the price paid to farmers by the state-controlled Agricultural Marketing Corporation for part of their grain harvest and allowed them to sell the rest themselves. It is also lifting internal controls on the movement of food inside the country, allowing a free market to develop. Officials warn that the Government remains committed to the collectivization of all Ethiopian agriculture on Stalinist lines within 10 years. But they say this pledge now appears to be no more than political verbiage. The World Bank has been impressed enough by Ethiopia's performance since December to send a mission to Addis Ababa last week to discuss the resumption of aid to grain farmers. The mission went first to Brussels to coordinate its plans to resume agricultural development aid with the European Community, officials say. World Bank Plans $30 Million The World Bank now expects to provide $30 million to $50 million a year to help grain farmers increase output. At first this money will come out of the roughly $100 million the bank is already providing for other development projects in Ethiopia. But if the Ethiopian Government sticks to its initiatives, officials say, the World Bank hopes to increase the overall amount. The European Community is likely to spend $80 million of the aid it has earmarked for Ethiopia on rural agricultural projects. Other European nations say they are considering renewing or increasing their aid. The British Aid Minister, Christopher Patten, visited Ethiopia last month and expressed satisfaction with the agricultural measures. A British parliamentary committee will also visit Ethiopia this month to consider a resumption of aid.

The 16-day festival, with competition in eight sports, will begin with the opening ceremony Saturday at the University of Calgary's McMahon Stadium, and the city is ready. Colorful banners hang from light poles all across the city. Signs with words in several languages point out directions. On the outside of a firehouse along the northern edge of the Bow River, the five Olympic rings blaze in neon lights. ''Firemen Welcome the World,'' says a sign underneath. 'Absolutely Incredible' ''The whole city is on the edge,'' said Steve Pecsenyicki. As one of 85 high school students who doubles as Howdy or Hidy, the mascots dressed as bears, he gets around. ''Nobody can believe it's finally happening,'' he said. ''It's absolutely incredible.'' The spirit is everywhere and virtually unavoidable. Houses all over the city are still hung with Christmas lights, many now arranged in the configuration of the five rings. Olympic posters are more common than stop signs. A local strip joint had scheduled a Miss Nude Olympics Pageant until local Olympic officials threatened a lawsuit, charging copyright infringement. The contest went on under a new name: The Miss Nude O-Word Pageant. And all over are people wearing Olympic paraphernalia: hats, caps, jackets, T-shirts, sweaters, sweat shirts, ski jackets, sunglasses, blouses and pins. Especially pins. Almost every country, sport, venue and sponsor has a pin of its own. People trade them, sell them and wear them. Counseling Available The organizing committee has even arranged for a local psychologist to be available to staff members and volunteers after the Olympics to combat feelings of post-Games letdown and depression. To produce an undertaking of this magnitude, enormous amounts of manpower were required. The organizing committee - Olympiques Calgary Olympics - recruited 10,000 volunteers, most of whom live in the area, to serve in myriad capacities. You can't miss them. They wear OCO buttons, OCO blazers, OCO ties, OCO dresses, OCO parkas and drive cars with OCO license plates. Les Vestre, a truck driver, donated three of his four weeks' vacation to drive a van, a real truckman's holiday. In his six-hour shifts, he chauffeurs people around the University of Calgary campus, stopping at the athletes' village, the speed-skating oval and the Father David Bauer ice skating arena. Is it ever boring? Silly question. ''People are always asking me questions,'' he said. ''Or there's a pin-trading session to get involved in.'' Volunteer Since '83 Brett Holt, who works for the telephone company here, has been a volunteer since 1983, two years after Calgary was awarded the Games. So far this year he has taken off 15 days without pay and used all his vacation time to serve as an escort for Hidys and Howdys. ''In some towns on the torch run, we'd have 10,000 people come up to us,'' he said. ''You can't imagine what that's like.'' The mascots can. ''Little kids come up,'' said Joy Griffith, a Hidy. ''They want to hug and kiss you, have their pictures taken with you. For some of them, Hidy and Howdy is the closest they'll get to the Olympics.'' ''At least now they know we're bears,'' Pecsenyicki chimed in. ''When we started, people thought we were just some kind of furry animals, like rabbits, chipmunks, dogs or mice.'' Nowhere are the sights and sounds of the impending celebration more visible than McMahon Stadium, a 35,000-seat structure expanded to seat 60,000 for the opening and closing ceremonies. It is usually the home field for the university's football team and the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League. It has undergone a dramatic renovation, with workers clanging and banging changes into position nearly round the clock. For more than a week, the Olympic rings - interlocked circular balloons, actually -have graced the main entrance, along Crowchild Trail. Lighting the Torch H The opening ceremony, which costs $10 million, will end with the lighting of the Olympic torch by the last of 6,520 torch-bearers, who have carried the Olympic flame over 11,160 miles of the country. The organizers are keeping the identity of that person a secret, but have disclosed that it will be a Canadian. Before the torch is lighted, spectators will be entertained by 5,500 performers, a precision flying group, the parade of athletes and the release of 1,000 homing pigeons, three of whom are expected to be the first medal winners. A gold, silver and bronze medal awaits the first three to return to Bassano, a small town 62 miles east of here. The Mayor of Calgary, Ralph Klein, can barely hide his pride. Finally, people are noticing his city for something other than a cow town, the fortunes of which have recently been tied to the fluctuations of the oil industry. He talked about how Calgary had made the most of its opportunity, preparing, planning, and coping with problems when necessary since the International Olympic Committee awarded these Games to Calgary on Sept. 30, 1981. ''The Olympics are a lot like mumps,'' the Mayor said. ''You get them only once, usually. Our city is ready.''

1479-> Film: Tony Bill's 'Five Corners,' With Foster
''FIVE CORNERS,'' opening today at the Baronet and other theaters, is about coming of age in the Bronx in the autumn of 1964, when student activists were listening to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., young women were still doing their darnedest to look like Jacqueline Kennedy and glue-sniffing was an acceptable way to attain a high. Directed by Tony Bill, the film is based on John Patrick Shanley's first screenplay. Mr. Shanley's second screenplay serves as the basis for Norman Jewison's slickly homogenized current hit, ''Moonstruck.'' This is worth noting, for although ''Five Corners'' often strains credulity (and patience), it almost always seems far more authentic than the saga of the lovelorn Cher in ''Moonstruck.'' The ''Five Corners'' screenplay is both overstuffed and underdeveloped. Mr. Bill's direction doesn't iron out unsightly bumps, but neither does it mute the voice of what often sounds to be a strong and original new screenwriter. In a period of approximately 24 hours, ''Five Corners'' tells the stories of Linda (Jodie Foster), her sometime boyfriend James (Todd Graff) and Harry (Tim Robbins), who's about to go off to register voters in Mississippi. Their comparatively placid lives are thrown into chaos with the arrival back in the neighborhood of Heinz (John Turturro), a young psychotic who has been serving time for the attempted rape of Linda. Mr. Shanley and Mr. Bill set their scene and introduce the characters with a good deal of humor and insight. There's a very funny early sequence in which a bored neighborhood Romeo pays two strangers five bucks to take his girlfriends off his hands. The movie hits just the proper note of comedy mixed with melodrama when two couples find themselves trapped, possibly fatally, in an elevator shaft. It's not the elevator that finally does in the characters, but the mechanics of the plot, which, to keep things moving, demands that halfway intelligent people suddenly behave as if they'd lost their minds. With the exception of Mr. Turturro and Rose Gregorio, who plays Heinz's equally demented mom, nobody in the otherwise excellent cast seems at home with his Bronx accent. Each speaks as if holding onto a tiger's tail with his teeth, which isn't easy. Miss Foster, more beautiful today than ever, doesn't look especially at home in her plain wash dresses, but the performance is a good one. Equally intelligent are Mr. Graff, Mr. Robbins and Elizabeth Berridge, as a bubble-headed glue-sniffer who longs to settle down with a wedding ring and a husband. In their own separate category are Mr. Turturro and Miss Gregorio, who give ''Five Corners'' a larger-than-life, melodramatic dimension that ultimately makes the rest of the movie look small. The Old Neighborhood FIVE CORNERS, directed by Tony Bill; written by John Patrick Shanley; director of photography, Fred Murphy; edited by Andy Blumenthal; music by James Newton Howard; production designer, Adrianne Lobel; produced by Forrest Murray and Mr. Bill; released by Cineplex Odeon. At Baronet, Third Avenue at 59th Street; Art Greenwich Twin, 12th Street and Seventh Avenue; Olympia, Broadway and 107th Street. Running time: 92 minutes. This film is rated R. Linda...

1480-> Mush From the Office Seekers
Amid the din of the Presidential debates and the rambling reflections that are conveyed to the public in 20 to 30 second whiffs across the TV screen, a rather odd conclusion is born. It is this: Only rarely has any candidate publicly confronted the challenges, changes and dangers that the 41st President will surely have to deal with. The ardor with which the candidates attack each other is nowhere to be found when some surly voter asks an idiotic question like, ''What are you going to do to get us fiscally sane again?'' As one who has been in and out of politics for 35 years, I can certify that questioners (and questions) like that become awfully tiresome, not to mention presumptuous. By the way, if such a question has been answered, no one recorded it for TV. At some point in the campaign, before two candidates are nominated, someone has to say, with some precision, how he will try to adjust what is so clearly out of joint - for example, the deficits, both budget and trade. Just thinking about these gargoyles breeds dark agonies in the hearts of candidates, their managers and their media experts. How else to explain the haggard responses? To paraphrase Winston Churchill, most candidates feel about deficits and what to do about them as if they were holding a wolf by the ears. Yet the numbers, cheerless as they are, have to be looked at, even through squinted eyes. A trillion dollar budget. Spending at some 23 percent of the gross national product, with Federal budget deficits at 3.5 percent of the G.N.P. The Congressional Budget Office's estimate of a 1989 deficit of $176 billion and rising higher if we slide into recession. Debtor nation status, the first time in more than 70 years. Trade deficits at the $160 billion level annually. Only about 25 percent of the entire Federal budget subject to discretion, with the rest entitlements. Query: ''At what fiscal point does the whole thing blow up?'' Answer: ''I believe in a strong America with jobs, justice for all, compassion, courage, values, home sweet home - and thank you all for coming.'' No President, no matter how charming or vaguely resolute or heavily elected, can embark on any program, domestic or foreign, nor can he lay claim to greatness unless he presides over a robust economy. And yet, if one observes the debates, and thrashes through the position papers, one will find only vacancies, intermissions and the fastidious avoidance of the word ''taxes.'' Even subjecting the candidates to water torture would extract no confessions except perhaps a gurgling sound that under auditory inspection comes out as ''revenue enhancement.'' Freely translated, this means, ''I will deploy no tax before its time, and I sure as hell won't call it that.'' But ever since Pavlov and his experiments, candidates for offices higher than that of constable know that whoever says ''I will have to raise taxes'' might as well put the blindfold on and ask for a cigarette, while the firing squad marches out of the polling booth. True, Presidents have proved themselves capable of every attitude except candor. But candor in the TV election age is first cousin to self-immolation. This is a condition not instantly congenial to office seekers. Yes, we are reminded that we have canonized Franklin D. Roosevelt, who first mesmerized the public with his exhortations that he would balance the budget immediately upon assuming power. (He did.) But is it unlikely that we will advance on November with the nominees unsullied by any definition of their aims and unsoiled by any contact with ''how'' we're going to pay for what we spend? Probably. It is bizarre to journey into a future without having some notion about where we are going, how we are going to get there and what we will find when we arrive. No one can plot such a journey without first confiding how he is going to deal with this messy business of financing the nation's daily needs. How does he do that without saying wicked, truthful things like, ''We must bring in more money to do what we have to do.'' The trouble is, as Oscar Wilde noted, ''If one tells the truth one is sure sooner or later to be found out.''

1481-> Film: 'The Grand Highway,' Childhood in France
IN ''The Grand Highway,'' the French director Jean-Loup Hubert gives us his romance with childhood innocence. The autobiographical story, set in a pretty peasant village in 1958, has the makings of a nostalgic glance backward, full of easy charm and sentimentality. Louis, an adorable 9-year-old, is sent from Paris to the country for three weeks while his mother has a baby. And though the film has its moments of cheap charm, it is unexpectedly rich in warmth, wit and intelligence. Through the child's eyes we are lured into an enchanted landscape, as lush as Monet's gardens, only to have Mr. Hubert insistently block this lyrical vision with a cold, adult look at his characters' disenchantment and at the harshness of peasant life. The result makes ''The Grand Highway'' more convincing, more charming. Louis's naivete is near total. He doesn't realize that his father has left his mother; he has never met Marcelle, the old friend of his mother with whom he is to stay, or her husband, Pelo. From the minute Louis and his mother arrive by bus on a blistering hot day, the child seems painfully vulnerable. Mr. Hubert's son, Antoine, plays Louis, captured in the last stages of boyhood, before a hint of puberty has appeared. With his wide eyes, pathetically narrow shoulders and skinny legs, Louis is the picture of heart-wrenching sweetness, who arrives to find Marcelle skinning a rabbit, scooping out its eye with a twist of her knife. Marcelle sees a treat for Louis's first supper; Louis sees a dead bunny. Worn out and unhappy, the childless Marcelle does not have a clue about how to make Louis feel at home. She gives him a room overlooking the cemetery, where he sleeps in the bed of Pelo's dead grandmother, whose stern picture stares down at him. The room is full of spooky noises - some of them made by Pelo, calling out animal sounds to frighten the child. Marcelle's husband, it turns out, is coarse when he's sober and vicious when he's drunk. On another night Louis lies in bed and listens as Pelo tears up the room that was meant to be a nursery - their stillborn child was a boy who would have been Louis's age and whose room Marcelle has kept intact - and forces himself on his wife. Marcelle and Pelo's hostile marriage is the unlikely backdrop for Louis's funny adjustment to country life. Soon he is climbing trees with his friend Martine, who is something of a flirt and a tease at age 10. Barefoot, wearing short red frocks, always sitting so her underpants show, Martine is the kind of girl who taunts Louis into climbing with her to the top of the steep church roof; there they urinate into the gutters and make the gargoyles spurt a stream onto a nun below. As Louis and Martine gobble unripe apples, Martine's sister passes by with her boyfriend. ''Don't blame me if you get sick,'' she says, and Martine shoots back, ''Don't blame me if you get a baby.'' Then she drags Louis off to spy on the couple making love and later stands in the street mocking her sister - ''Oh, oh,'' she says, barely suppressing a giggle -while we see the parish priest slowly walking up behind her. With its misplaced boy hero, its deft blend of humor and sorrow, and especially in the playful friendship of Louis and Martine, ''The Grand Highway'' sometimes seems like a French version of ''My Life as a Dog.'' But the hero of the Swedish film always had a mischievous gleam in his eye; Louis is more conventional, always guileless and baffled. Antoine Hubert is so natural that at first it seems he is not acting at all. (The director has said he created the character by observing his son.) But when Louis discovers his father has abandoned him, he reacts with such hurt and anger that Antoine Hubert is clearly a genuine actor. Richard Bohringer (best known to American audiences as the hip but strange Gorodish in ''Diva'') turns the potentially trite and horrid Pelo into a strong, sympathetic man. He takes the boy fishing and to his carpentry shop, becoming the father-figure Louis yearns for. Mr. Bohringer, astoundingly straightforward, wards off all the cliches about good-hearted monsters and cruelty born of grief that lurk around the edges of the story. The story, after all, is not what matters here. It is the atmosphere of Mr. Hubert's film that makes us feel we have entered his village, that the mismatched details of life there make sense, as they do when Martine picks the drunken Pelo up off the street and carts him home in a wooden wheelbarrow to their sweet-looking vine-covered cottage. ''The Grand Highway,'' which opens today at the Paris, was the top French-made film at the box office last year, and the No. 6 film overall (just behind ''Beverly Hills Cop II''). Its appeal may be due to the superficial tug of emotions. But under its sweet nostalgia, Mr. Hubert's film is moving because he refuses to idealize the past or to ignore its bitterness. Death of Innocence THE GRAND HIGHWAY, a film by Jean-Loup Hubert; in French with English subtitles; director of photography, Claude Lecomte; camera, Jean Paul Meurisse; edited by Raymonde Guyot; music by Georges Granier; produced by Pascal Hommais and Jean Francois Lepetit; released by Miramax Films. At Paris, 58th Street, west of Fifth Avenue. Running time: 104 minutes. This film has no rating. Marcelle... Anemone Pelo... Richard Bohringer Louis... Antoine Hubert Martine...

1484-> MUSIC; Some Concert 'Firsts' Are Scheduled
''BEAUTY in music is too often confused with something that lets the ears lie back in an easy chair,'' wrote Charles Ives, the pioneering American composer. Ives also noted that ''music (and all art, like all life) must be a part of the great organic flow, onward and always upward, or become soft in muscles and spirit, and die.'' Many concertgoers, of course, are all too ready to be seduced by the comforting repetition of the warhorse classics. They run the other way when ''new'' pieces, or even unfamiliar ones, are on display - in the process, of course, missing out on the thrill of musical discovery.Some fascinating firsts are coming up this week. Let us begin at Wave Hill in Riverdale, where today at 3 P.M. the New Amsterdam Singers (with instrumental friends) are presenting a concert intriguingly dubbed ''Rhythm, Rhyme and Resonance.'' The program is devoted to 20th-century music for voices, bells, marimba and flute, but fear not: a glance at the list of master composers - Barber, Thomson, Copland, Persichetti, Bernstein and Williams - makes it abundantly clear that lyricism will join the aforementioned three R's. Next Sunday's Wave Hill recital similarly dives happily into the 20th century, although the Fiati Chamber Players are beginning their recital with Schubert's delectable ''Shepherd on the Rock,'' for soprano, clarinet and piano. Thereafter, however, they offer the zesty Woodwind Trios of Ibert and Poulenc, then present the world premiere of Deolus Husband's ''Why I Live at the P.O.'' Call (212) 549-3200 to get driving directions or to make reservations for either concert. Returning to today's schedule, the Concert Society of Putnam and Northern Westchester, which has never been content simply to trot out the old favorites, premieres a new work by Alison Nowak during its 3:30 P.M. program at the Drew Methodist Church in Carmel. Commissioned by the society to honor its late director, Walter Hagen, the new piece features the mezzosoprano Bonnie Forgacs with David Gilbert conducting the society's own Chamber Orchestra. Also on the program are two Serenades for Strings: the famous Opus 22 of Dvorak, and a little- known, though warmly gracious, score of that same title composed in 1964 by Alexander Tcherepnin (277-8564). Not exactly new, but certainly pieces that don't get around much any more, form the backbone of the Music for a Sunday Afternoon concert starting at 4 P.M. today in Tarrytown's Christ Church. The guest artists are Gary Steigerwalt and Dana Muller, and their program of music for one piano, four hands lists Debussy's ''Petite Suite'' (usually heard in orchestral transcription), the witty Poulenc Sonata, a Mendelssohn rarity, ''Allegro Brilliante,'' two Finnish Folksongs arranged by Busoni, and -most unusual of all - a suite of ''Poetic Waltzes'' by Frederick Converse, who was, among his many other notable credits, the first American composer to have an opera (''Pipe of Desire,'' in 1910) introduced at the Metropolitan (591-6855). * ''Romantic Celebrations'' are the promise of the next subscription concerts of the New Orchestra of Westchester, and sure enough we find evocations of two legendary pairs of lovers via Faure's ''Pelleas and Melisande'' and the Suite No. 2 from Ravel's ''Daphnis and Chloe,'' along with that quintessentially romantic Piano Concerto, the Schumann A minor, with Ruth Laredo as the guest soloist. But Paul Dunkel, the music director, has not ignored love in our own day, wherefore the program also boasts the world premiere of ''The Exiled Heart,'' written especially for the New Orchestra by the young Mamaroneck composer Michelle Ekizian. ''Michelle's music is clearly of our time,'' Mr. Dunkel said, ''but it nonetheless has a very romantic sound, with lush, sometimes splashy orchestral colors. It's difficult to perform -no community orchestra could touch this piece! - but its expressive impact is quite strong.'' For reservations to the 8 P.M. Saturday performance, or its 2 o'clock repeat next Sunday afternoon, call the State University of New York box office at 253-5900. * For those listeners starved for the classics, next weekend brings relief. At 8:30 P.M. Saturday, the Emelin Chamber Music Society has an all-Schubert program, including the ''Trout'' Quintet, at the Theater in Mamaroneck (698-0098). And next Sunday at 7 P.M., the renowned Swedish baritone Hakan Hagegard offers Schubert songs and Mozart arias at his State University recital, with the pianist Warren Wilson. (253-5900) A classical-romantic surge is also at the heart of a most unusual threeday, three-concert series at the Julie Harris Theater in Scarborough. ''This is a jewel of a hall,'' said Mary Ann Scialdo, the artistic director of the series. ''Intimate, it has just 256 seats - and acoustically perfect, it is perhaps the finest small recital space in Westchester. Our hope is to turn this sadly underused facility into a major performance center for everybody in the county.'' No less a luminary than Ignace Jan Paderewski played the dedication recital here, back in 1917, so piano music is the focus of the coming programs, designed as benefits for both the Theater Restoration Fund and the Clear View School. All of the artists, incidentally, are local residents: George Newlin of Chappaqua, who plays Bach, Busoni, Liszt and Rachmaninoff Friday at 8 P.M.; Briarcliff's Miss Scialdo and yours truly, offering works by Barab, Mozart, Ravel and Poulenc at that same hour on Saturday; and Camille Antoinette Budarz of Ossining, exploring romantic music by Polish composers, and joining the Lyric Chamber Players for the Poulenc Sextet, next Sunday at 3 P.M. (762-0657). * Finally, two notable events in a lighter vein are due next weekend: Friday at 8 P.M., the remarkable jazz pianist Billy Taylor plays at the John Jay Auditorium in Cross River (666-9181); while Saturday at 8 P.M., it is blues at the Tarrytown Music Hall, featuring two great veterans, Taj Mahal and Dave Van Ronk (245-3695).

1487-> Workers' Total For New York Soaring in 80's
Employment in New York City in the 1980's has risen to its highest level since the years just after World War II, with women experiencing the largest gains, according to a Federal report issued yesterday. From 1979 to 1987, employment of city residents rose by 249,000, to 3.048 million, the report, issued by the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, said. Women over 20 accounted for two-thirds of all the employment growth in the period, primarily in the clerical field but with increases also in the professional, managerial and technical fields, the report said. Over the eight-year period, the number of employed adult female residents in the city has risen by 163,000, compared with a rise of 106,000 for men. Thus, women accounted for 65.5 percent of all employment growth among city residents from 1979 to 1987. More Teen-Agers Working Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the bureau's regional commissioner, said, ''For women, the figures reflect movement into traditional jobs such as clerical but also movement into the professional, managerial and technical fields.'' There was also good news for younger workers and minority workers. The unemployment rate for teen-agers, at 18.1 percent in 1987, was at a 17-year low, down from 26 percent in 1986. During the previous 11 years, the jobless rate among city residents 16 to 19 years old was in the 30 percent range. The report also said that black and Asian workers continued to increase their share of the civilian labor force. They made up 32 percent of the labor force in 1987, up from 26 percent in 1977. Last year, unemployment in the city fell to its lowest levels since the early 1970's, indicating that 1987 was ''a year of strength and vulnerability,'' Mr. Ehrenhalt said. While the overall picture was good for New York City, Mr. Ehrenhalt said, the employment rate for most of the demographic groups sampled was far below the national rate. Among residents 16 years and older, the proportion holding jobs was 52.4 percent in 1987, about 9 percentage points below the national rate.

1489-> REPEAT CAESAREANS AREN'T ALWAYS ESSENTIAL
While it is true that some women choose repeat Caesarean birth out of ignorance [ Long Island Journal, Jan. 24 ] , from my own experience I believe it is more common that women are not told by their physicians that vaginal delivery after Caesarean birth is feasible. Six years ago I had a section because of a breech presentation. When I again became pregnant, I informed my obstetrician that I wanted a trial labor. He agreed, with reservations. Subsequently, I discovered I was being billed for a repeat section. The next obstetrician I consulted had so many stipulations to a vaginal birth after a Caesarean that it made it a virtual impossibility. Undaunted, I tried another doctor, who billed me $100 (without an examination) for a five-minute harangue on my irresponsibility. I was five months pregnant before I found an encouraging doctor. My second pregnancy resulted in a vaginal birth. I am now in the ninth month of my third pregnancy. I have a supportive group of physicians and am confident that I will once again deliver in the standard fashion. But before I found them, I called obstetricians closer to my home and was told that they ''didn't do that sort of thing.'' As more and more women become aware of the fact that repeat sections are not always necessary or even desirable, I hope physicians' attitudes will change as well.

Her father is the executive vice president of Chanin Management and the Chanin Construction Company in New York. Her mother, Leona Chanin, is the national treasurer of the American Jewish Congress. The bride is a granddaughter of the late Irwin S. Chanin, an architect and builder. The bridegroom, a graduate of Vanderbilt University, is an associate vice president of Prudential-Bache Securities in New York. His father is a radiologist at Baptist Hospital in Miami. His mother, Marian Sneider, is a clinical social worker.

1495-> DINING OUT; Robust Italian Fare in Stamford
IN Italian, il mulino means the mill, and that has little connection to the shopping center Il Mulino is part of. But never mind. This small new storefront restaurant in the Springdale section of Stamford is prettier inside than outside, with gray wood walls and partitions counterpointed by greenery, pink tablecloths and red Leatherette booths. While the decor seems unrelated to the name, the menu has no identity problem. It is clearly Italian, with certain dishes - appetizers like the crunchy fried calamari served with a spicy red sauce and tender fresh scungilli salad in a garlicky vinaigrette - prepared with authority. On the whole, the best dishes are the ones that do not demand subtlety. Escarole and bean soup, for instance, was a hearty cold weather choice that had the extra embellishment of chopped garlic to give it vigor. A satisfying entree was veal chops Gorgonzola -two thick meaty chops replete with thick mushroom slices and a piquant cheese topping that was thin enough to double as a salad dressing. Calamari fritti, an appetizer at lunch, made an even better dinner entree. Two shrimp dishes are also recommendable: shrimp fra diavolo in a well-seasoned peppery red sauce and shrimp scampi Il Mulino, robustly flavored with a garlic-mustard-butter-wine sauce. None of the other dishes was an outright disaster, but their biggest weakness was blandness. An order of broiled bay scallops, for instance, was dotted with paprika, but lacked flavor. Spiedini alla Romana (two large blocks of batter-dipped mozzarella in an anchovy sauce) was marred by an excessively greasy sauce and a flabby batter enveloping the melted cheese. An order of fried mozzarella, also two slabs, was so flavorless it might have been frozen and reheated. Two other entrees, pork chops scarpariello and saltimbocca alla Romana, would have been acceptable if not marred by glutinous sauces. In the saltimbocca, the prosciutto layered over the veal escalope was excessively salty. Of the many pasta dishes on the menu, the ones we ordered varied in execution. Baked ziti sorrentino was al dente, but its only flavor accessory was melted cheese. Tortellini alla panna was overcooked, with an excess of pea-studded cream sauce overwhelming it, and fettuccine Alfredo suffered a similar fate. A small side dish of escarole, drenched in garlic and oil, was served with each entree. An option was a side order of spaghetti or linguine. An order of asparagus gratinati looked like blackened sticks beneath a melted cheese blanket, but the waiter quickly them. The firm Italian cheesecake had a crumbly texture, but surprisingly little flavor for being premises-made. Other desserts, with commercial patinas, had even less appeal. The chocolate mousse cake was moist, but lacked chocolate intensity. Hazlenut cake had a tallowy butter-cream filling and frosting and cappuccino cake seemed to be cappuccino in name only. A three course dinner for two was $43.35, with tax, tip and beverages extra. Il Mulino has the look of a comfortable neighborhood Italian restaurant. If you order selectively, you can have a filling, economical meal. IL MULINO Satisfactory Springdale Shopping Center, 1078 Hope Street, Stamford. 322-3300. Atmosphere: Cheerful storefront dining.

1496-> THE GENOME PROJECT
I find it hard to determine which is worse, the human genome project financed by the Federal Government or the human genome project sponsored by Walter Gilbert's Genome Corporation (''The Genome Project,'' by Robert Kanigel, Dec. 13). In the first case, concentrating hundreds of millions of dollars on this one megaproject in the era of Gramm-Rudman budget cuts is sure to starve hundreds of small, more promising biomedical research projects. And the second possibility would be one of the worst examples of the crass commercialism that has come to dominate genetic research in recent years. The result may be nothing more than the equivalent of a Library of Congress full of gibberish, because, in order to ''read'' the genome, it is necessary to know the ''punctuation'' (where one gene ends and the next begins) as well as the sequence. It might be better to start with a more modest project, the sequencing of one of the smaller human chromosomes, to see what, if anything, can be learned from it. ROBERT J. YAES, M.D. Lexington, Ky.

1497-> Jersey Ends Move to Retry Rubin Carter
New Jersey prosecutors said yesterday that they would not try Rubin (Hurricane) Carter and John Artis a third time for a triple-murder in a case that provoked national attention over charges that the authorities had framed both men. The 21-year legal conflict ended in effect when the Acting Passaic County Prosecutor, John P. Goceljak, filed a four-page application in the county courthouse in Paterson to dismiss all charges against the two men. ''It is just not legally feasible to sustain a prosecution, and not practical after almost 22 years to be trying anyone,'' Attorney General W. Cary Edwards said in Trenton. Mr. Edwards, whose office participated in the decision, added, ''It is time we put this matter to rest once and for all, and I wish Mr. Carter the best of luck and a very productive life.'' Mr. Goceljak, although declining to say whether he believed the two men were guilty, said several factors made it impossible to retry them. He cited the current unreliablity of the prosecution's sole eyewitness, Alfred P. Bello, and the unavailability of other witnesses because of the passage of time. #20,000 Pages of Testimony The prosecutor also said court rulings made it doubtful the prosecution could reintroduce as a motive an allegation that Mr. Carter and Mr. Artis, who are black, had killed three white people in a racially motivated crime. The four-page application appeared to mark the final entry in a case that has accumulated 20,000 pages of testimony and legal documents. Mr. Goceljak, who has participated in the prosecution 15 years, said in his application that the case had ''received the attention of more courts and proceedings than probably any other case in the history of this state and possibly any other state.'' Mr. Carter, a former professional boxer who fought for the middleweight championship, and Mr. Artis were convicted by juries in 1967 and 1976. Both verdicts were overturned by appeals courts on the grounds that the prosecutors had withheld evidence favorable to the defense or had introduced tainted evidence. Mr. Carter and Mr. Artis contended in their appeals that they were victims of racial bias by the authorities, who were under pressure to solve the fatal shootings of two men and a woman June 17, 1966. in the Lafayette Bar and Grill in Paterson. Cause Celebre in 70's In a terse statement, lawyers for the two men, said they were ''extremely pleased with the decision of the State of New Jersey.'' In the mid-70's, between the first and second trials, civil-rights figures, politicians and entertainers rallied behind Mr. Carter. He became a cause celebre, with fund-raising concerts and protest demonstrations on his behalf. However, Mr. Carter's supporters largely abandoned him after he and Mr. Artis were found guilty the second time, in 1976, and when the appeals began in state and Federal courts. The 50-year-old Mr. Carter served almost 19 years of a life term. He was released without bail in November 1985 after a Federal District judge overturned the second verdict. Since his release, Mr. Carter has lived in seclusion and declined to be interviewed. Mr. Artis, 41, was paroled in 1981, after serving 15 years of a life term. Under 6-Year Prison Term In unrelated charges, Mr. Artis pleaded guilty in June in Passaic County to conspiracy to distribute $50 worth of cocaine and receiving a stolen handgun. He is serving a sentence of up to six years in prison. Lawyers for Mr. Artis are appealing the term as unduly harsh. They maintain that a county judge improperly cited Mr. Artis's convictions in the murder case as a reason for a prison term, instead of releasing him on probation as a first-time offender. Paterson police officers said they picked up Mr. Carter and Mr. Artis as suspects in the Lafayette Grill murders because they were in a white car that resembled the getaaway vehicle. For the last two years, county prosecutors had unsuccessfully sought in Federal courts to reinstate the convictions. The United States Supreme Court rejected their petition Jan. 11, leaving the prosecutors with the option of holding another trial or dismissing the indictment. A defense lawyer, Myron Beldock, said Mr. Carter and Mr. Artis had no intentions of filing civil suits for malicious prosecution or false imprisonment.

1498-> Police Charge 2 In Killing Done To Stop a Thief
A Bronx man was killed Monday outside a Manhattan grocery store, while apparently trying to steal a car, and two employees of the store, one of whom owned the car, were charged with second-degree murder, the police said yesterday. The shooting took place at about 3 P.M. outside Lizzie's Superette at 220 Nagle Avenue in the Inwood section, a police spokesman, Sgt. John Clifford, said. The victim, Luis Hernandez, 26 years old, of 1386 Nelson Avenue in the High Bridge section of the Bronx, was pronounced dead on arrival at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. He had been shot at least once with an unlicensed .38-caliber revolver that was recovered at the scene, Sergeant Clifford said. The store employees, Froilan Ramirez, 43, of 773 Autumn Avenue in the East New York section of Brooklyn, and Felix Rodriquez, 26, of 371 Etna Street in East New York, were taken into custody immediately after the shooting by plainclothes officers from the Special Anti-Crack Unit who were patrolling the neighborhood, Sergeant Clifford said. The police said initially that Mr. Hernandez had been beaten by a crowd. However, Sergeant Clifford said yesterday that while a baseball bat was found beside the body, it was unclear if he had been hit with it. According to the police, someone came into the store and told Mr. Ramirez that a man was trying to steal his car. Mr. Ramirez went outside and saw that the engine of his gray 1984 Oldsmobile was running and its ignition casing was smashed, but he did not see anyone in the car. He told police that he returned to the store for a few minutes and went back outside with Mr. Rodriquez. ''The physical evidence at the scene indicated Mr. Ramirez fired the shots,'' Sergeant Clifford said. Employees of the grocery said yesterday that they did not know anything about the events the police described. But across the street, at Red Rock Liquors, an employee, Robert Avila, told of hearing shots fired and seeing the car rolling backward across Nagle Avenue. He added that most of the people in the neighborhood, which is beneath elevated subway tracks and is plagued by crack dealing and other crimes, would sympathize with the suspects in the shooting. ''These guys acted out what a lot of people in the community wish they could do,'' he said. ''They just got fed up.''
