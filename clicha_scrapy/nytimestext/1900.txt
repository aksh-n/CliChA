From "The Great Boer War." by A. Conan Doyle.

21-> HOW RAILWAY STOCKS FARED.
The railroad stocks were singled out for attack by the bears at the opening of the market yesterday, and some of the standard issues, such as St. Paul, Rock Island, Union Pacific, and the Baltimore and Ohio issues, broke sharply.

Isaac Devoe, ill and eighty-three years of age; is imprisoned for debt in Ludlow Street Jail. Once Mr. Devoe was wealthy, said to have been worth a quarter of a million dollars, but now he stands a fair prospect of remaining in jail, unless some one liquidates for him a debt of $614.77. 
--------
44-> Some Happenings in Good Society
The passing of May and the advent of June will this year be marked by no special excitement in the world of New York society. Decoration, or, rather. Memorial Day, for the latter and more poetical term is most often used, will bring, if the weather is fine, the usual crowds at the country clubs and golf tournaments everywhere. 
--------
45-> THE ECUMENICAL CONFERENCE.
Without doubt the best and most efficacious fact about the Ecumenical Conference which has just adjourned is the fact that it has been held. The only predecessor to it that New York has known was the Evangelical Alliance, which held its sessions twenty years ago, and made a most impressive demonstration of the power of the Protestant Churches, at least of their power to make a demonstration. 
--------
46-> Article 4 -- No Title
WASHINGTON, May 2 -- The reported engagement of gold at New York for export is not disturbing the Treasury officials.

--------
49-> COMMANDER FREEMAN ILL.; Board of Survey Inquires Into the Naval Officer's Physical Condition.

--------
54-> FIGHTING THE INEVITABLE.
Don Quixote's combat with the windmills was a practical operation compared to the contest that the Democratic Party continues to wage, under its present leaders, against the National banks. The infatuated knight at least believed that he was engaged with real monsters, and that it was his duty to attack them at any risk to life or limb. 
--------
55-> RATIFICATION IN BROOKLYN; Union League Club Indorses McKinley and Roosevelt. NOTABLE SPEAKERS PRESENT Lieut. Gov. Woodruff, Gen. Woodford, and Others Heard -- Resolutions Adopted with Enthusiasm.

--------
56-> HOW LIND LOST VOTES.; Carelessness of Democrats Said to Have Cost Him 15,000.
From The St. Paul (Minn.) Globe, (Dem.)

--------
58-> MR. CLARK'S VINDICATION.
It is plain that Mr. CLARK of Montana is not to be allowed to get into the United States Senate without more trouble than he had expected. The alert and untiring Senator from New Hampshire has in effect given notice that any new application will be considered in the light of the facts brought out in the inquiry into the first election. 
--------
59-> BOSTON STOCK MARKET.
BOSTON, Oct. 31. -- Business in mining stocks fell off to-day to very small proportions, and, barring Amalgamated, was flat in the extreme. Amalgamated sold between 90 1/2 and 91 1/2. Montana eased 6 1/2 to 315, at which price 1,000 shares sold in one lot; later the price rallied. A transfer of a large interest in the stock evidently is making through the Stock Exchange, but what it represents is veiled in mystery.

--------
63-> DEMOCRATS GONE ASTRAY.
It is natural for protectionists to look with abhorrence upon a successful and productive internal revenue law. In so far as it is successful and productive it lends to make customs duties unnecessary for the support of the Government and justifies the demand that they be reduced or abolished. 
--------
64-> VIGOROUS PHILIPPINE POLICY.; Active Campaign About to Begin to Determine Size of Army Necessary There.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 9. -- The active and vigorous campaign which Secretary Root has ordered Gen. MacArthur to prosecute is about to begin.

--------
72-> Scott and Dogs.
From The Gentleman's Magazine. Dogs play a really important role in Scott's works, and no two are alike, but all are worthy of the love with which their artist evidently regarded them. His lines to the dog who for three months guarded the remains of his master, who had perished on Helvellyn, are not indeed equal to Wordsworth's poem on the same subject; but one portion of them seems worthy of quotation: 
--------
73-> YACHT MAY BE BARRED; N.Y.Y.C. Committee Can Refuse to Recognize Boston Boat. SITUATION HAS NO PRECEDENT Yachtsmen Discuss the Announcement of Thomas W. Lawson's Willingness to Build a Cup Defender.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 3 -- There are ten new members of the Fifty-sixth Congress elected to fill vacancies caused by death or resignation, two of the vacancies occurring in the State of Iowa. 
--------
551-> THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE.
The Presidential campaign has been opened by two nominating conventions and two pairs of candidates have been named. It may be said that of these the so-called "Middle of the Road Populist" ticket is negligible. In one sense it is. It will get few votes if, indeed, it survive the perils and accidents of the next few months, and it is not in the least likely to figure in the electoral returns.

ST. LOUIS, May 11. -- The aspect of affairs in the great street railroad strike today showed a complete reversal of the conditions prevailing yesterday.

--------
561-> CITY HALL PARK THRONGED; An Eager, Cheering Crowd Reads the Election Returns. Fifteen Thousand People Watch the Bulletins -- Democratic Shouts Soon Yield to Republican Cheers.
The ever-thrilling story of the Nation's battle of the ballots, as flashed upon the screens along Newspaper Row last night was read in ragged scraps fresh from the telegraph wires by a gathering fully as large, just as variegated, just as interesting, and just as noisy as ever thronged that section on election night. 
--------

--------
564-> Women Here and There -- Their Frills and Fancies
It seems to be fatal in anything to take a number of chances.

--------
565-> BRYAN AND STATE RIGHTS.
To the Editor of The New York Times: There is one feature of Mr. Bryan's advocacy of the Federal control of industrial enterprises that clashes violently with what is conceded to be a fundamental rule that all consistent Democrats must have imbibed with the pap of their political teachings, and which traverses most completely the very groundwork of the Democratic idea of the proper functions of the Federal Government.

--------
567-> STREET CAR DYNAMICS.
The decision handed down by the New York Court of Appeals recognizing the responsibility of an electric railroad company for compensatory damages to a woman injured by being thrown down by the jerk of a car in starting is likely to deprive passengers fortunate enough to get seats and wise enough to hold them of one of their principal diversions. 
--------
568-> MR. ODELL AND THE SENATOR.(2)
There are signs that the entente extra-cordiale assumed to exist between Mr. ODELL, the candidate for the Governorship, and Senator PLATT has been somewhat impaired, and that the relations between the Senator and the actual Governor may turn out to be consistent with the self-respect of the latter and unsatisfactory to the former.

--------
577-> THE YELLOW CLOUD.
The cloud that overhangs Christendom at the end of the nineteenth century of the Christian era is not black, but yellow. The Chinese question has assumed great and formidable proportions. Doubtless, it is formidable, in great part, simply because, according to the Latin saying, it is unknown.

--------
581-> THE REMOVAL OF GARDINER.
It is easy to imagine that Gov. ROOSEVELT rose from the reading of the papers of yesterday with a feeling that his action in regard to the District Attorney had failed to impress the public mind as he supposed that it would. The World approved the action on general principles, and with little reference to the facts adduced in evidence.

591-> "REBUKING" M'KINLEY.

To every careful reader of the Scriptures the names of the blind son of Timeus, and of the rich publican Zaccheus, are almost as closely identified with the City of Jericho as the name of Joshua, who destroyed it, (Joshua, vi., 21-26.) or that of Hiel, who rebuilt it. (First Kings, xvi., 34.) The one was a beggar -- the other, rolling in wealth -- but there, both became "the sons of God."

Ex-Manager W.A. Oakley of the Columbia crew made public yesterday his report of the rowing finances of the university for the past season.

THERE has been much said, written, and printed in regard to the probability of this country becoming at an early date a large exporter of bituminous coal, and the question is one of such moment that those who are interested in the industrial welfare of the Union must be glad to learn of the possibility of this new development in one of our leading products.

--------
648-> RIGHTS AND WRONGS OF TRADE UNIONS.
The practical settlement of the strike of the machinists with substantial concession to the strikers of their demands is an event which ought to be carefully considered by all employers of labor on a considerable scale. Two facts would seem to be pretty clearly established by it. 
--------
649-> THE CANADIAN GENERAL ELECTION.
Yesterday the voters of the Dominion of Canada held their general election. For the last two months the Conservative campaign, under the leadership of Sir CHARLES TUPPER, has been carried on with considerable vigor against the Premier, Sir WILFRID LAURIER, and the Liberal Government, without, however, exciting much comment in Great Britain or attracting much attention in the United States.

In the following list "mtg" stands for mortgage and "RS" for revenue stamps.

662-> PLANS TO SPEND THE SURPLUS; Shipping Bill, Nicaragua Canal, and More Liberal Pensions May Get Rid of It.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4. -- All conjectures about the surplus for the fiscal year ending next June seem to have been too conservative, according to the report of Secretary Gage. Hitherto the surplus for the year has been estimated at not more than $40,000,000, but the Secretary finds that it will be quite $80,000,000, or a little more than the surplus for the last fiscal year, which was $79,500,000 in round numbers.

He was known to his legion of acquaintances as "Jimmy" Corcoran of "Corcoran's Roost." 
--------
671-> THE PRESBYTERIAN CREED.
That the Presbytery of New York had gone upon record as opposing any revision of the Presbyterian creed would be in any case an interesting piece of intelligence.

685-> "YOU KNOW HOW TO MANAGE THIS THING."
FILKINS was right. He understood PLATT perfectly. He was in need. One WHALEN of Ogdensburg, who shamelessly admits that he is a Democrat, had un- derbid the firm of FILKINS on a State contract for building an armory at Medina, and there were many reasons, among them the plain requirements of the law, for supposing that the contract would be awarded to the lower bidder.

692-> OUTSIDE SECURITIES.
Trading in the market for outside securities yesterday was on a much smaller scale than on Monday, and still greater irregularity in prices appeared.

Stedman's "An American Anthology" in THE NEW YORK TIMES SATURDAY REVIEW of Nov. 24, has made some asscrtions, which, she says, "cannot fail to evoke criticism. It is very evident that Mr. Jacobs has not given the 'Anthology' an exhaustive reading, and certainly his spirit, was not in touch with that, which compiled such a work.

696-> THE NEW SECTIONALISM.
How long will the Democrats of the solid South insist on being saved by the North and West from the consequences of their blind, stupid folly?

698-> Modern Ocean Coal Gluttons.
From Cassier's Magazine. In the last ten years the race for the transatlantic record has been far more interesting than any other period, for it has been in this decade that the great coal burners have been built.

699-> Electra at City Island.
CITY ISLAND, N.Y., April 17. -- The new centreboard sloop Electra, recently completed at Herreshoff's for a member of the New York Yacht Club, arrived in City Island Harbor this morning, en route for Fire Island from Bristol.

--------
867-> WHAT IS DOING IN SOCIETY.
Nearly all entertaining ceases from today on till Easter. Beyond the meeting of the sewing classes and those of the different clubs for bowling, badminton, an other athletic pastimes, there will be little to chronicle. Even dinners and evenings a cards will be more or less put aside, an many will eschew the theatre and opera. 
--------
868-> BENCH ASSAULT AND DEFENSE.
The sixth annual dinner of the Church Association for the Advancement of the Interests of Labor was held last night at the Tuxedo. The Rev.

--------
869-> STEALING BRYANS THUNDER.
The Republicans have basely plagiarized Mr. W. J. BRYAN'S anti-trust issue. We long ago warned him that he would be quite unable to make political capital out of the octopus, as the other side would express a degree of campaign horror and alarm at the aspect and habits of the creature that even he, with his prodigious facilities for utterance, could not hope to equal. 
--------
870-> New England Collegiate Champions.
BOSTON, May 21. -- Ray Murray, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, won the two-mile bicycle race for the New England Intercollegiate Athletic Association championship at Charles River Park to-day, in 4:38 3-5; B.L.

--------
871-> MARKET CONDITIONS.
At the opening of yesterday's market strength showed -- but only briefly. The professional talent of the Stock Exchange made vigorous raids, and quotations were forced down substantially, and, in some parts of the market, easily. 
--------
872-> BOERS AND CONGRESSMEN.
The experienced New Yorker must feel some compassion for that envoy of the South African republics who on Thursday expressed his satisfaction at meeting, on the steps of the City Hall, such a "representative" audience. That collection of Tammany politicians and City Hall Park loungers has about as little to do with the real representation of the city as any that could be assembled. 
--------
873-> OTTAWA AFTER THE FIRE; Desolation and Misery Greet the Eye on Every Side. POOR NOT ONLY SUFFERERS Middle-Class Victims Bear Privation in Silence, Too Proud to Ask Aid -- Scenes in the Shelters.
OTTAWA, Ontario, May 5 -- Getting off at Nowhere is easily accomplished by some of those who come into the fire-swept City of Ottawa at its junction with Hull. The old Canadian Pacific Railway station is a thing of the past, as its blackened ruins show.

PEKING, May 30. -- The situation is somewhat better, the Chinese troops having occupied all disturbed localities.

875-> BROWN'S RIDE FINISHED.; His Original Schedule Unequaled, but a Record Was Established.
At exactly six minutes and a half after 9 o'clock last night Will A. Brown completed his 2,000-mile bicycle ride down on the Merrick Road. He started at noon on May 12 to ride twenty consecutive centuries in seven days, and would probably have accomplished the task in the stipulated time but for the bad weather experienced during the latter part of last week. 
--------
876-> TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS.; Large Entry List Insures a Most Successful Tournament.
WASHINGTON, May 21. -- The New York contingent of lawn tennis experts arrived here to-day and the Southern Championship Tournament will open to-morrow afternoon on the courts of the Bachelors' Lawn Tennis Club.

--------
877-> THEY OBEY THEIR MASTER.
While it is true that Mr. PLATT has absolutely dominated this convention, it is also true that his platform could not have commanded unanimous acceptance did it not accord with Republican sentiment, in this State. Four years ago he carried his point, but only at the cost of showing the strong popular disapproval of his course. 
--------
878-> SHIPPING BILL DISCUSSED(2); Senator Frye Says Opposition Is Wild and Insane. WHAT GOVERNMENT WILL PAY Subsidies, According to Mr. Frye, Cannot Exceed $7,500,000 Per Year -- Status of Foreign Built Ships.

881-> CAPT. TITUS'S PLANS TO REPRESS VICE; He Will at Once Attack Evil in the Tenements. TO HOLD OWNERS RESPONSIBLE Flaunting of Corruption in the Faces of the Innocent to Cease -- The First Results.
A material change in the outward appearance of the "Red Light" district of the east side was effected yesterday. The coming of Capt. Titus, who succeeded Capt. Herlihy of the Eldridge Street Police Station, wrought the transformation -- a transformation that will hold at least for a time if the utterances of Capt. Titus bear fruit. 
--------
882-> TOPICS OF THE TIMES.
In reflecting upon the failures and defalcations that are just now or recently have been the subject of much comment in this city, the character of the bookkeeping done for the unfortunate firms and corporations at once impresses itself upon the mind. Now, bookkeeping worthy of the name is a science absolutely exact. 
--------
883-> FINANCIAL ANNOUNCEMENTS.
Announcement that the North River Savings Bank has diverted the sixty-ninth semi-annual dividend to be credited to depositors is made in another column. 
--------
884-> STEEL AND IRON STOCKS.
Persistent selling of the steel and iron stocks yesterday resulted in a further decline in those issues, and as a result nearly all the stocks on the general list were sympathetically affected. No reason for the selling appeared, the move against the securities being conducted by an organized, bear pool without regard to the earnings of any of the companies whose shares were assailed. 
--------
885-> PRISONER'S RUDE AWAKENING.; Lone Vagrant in a Prison Van Jarred by Collision with a Trolley Car.

ATLANTA, Ga., Nov. 8 -- John G. Carlisle has wired The Atlanta Journal, in response to a request from that paper, his views on the reorganization of the Democratic Party. Mr. Carlisle says: 
--------
887-> ART AND ARTISTS.
Titles to books, as for pictures, have their significance, but without the same importance for the latter as for the former. The name an artist gives his picture on the catalogue may draw attention. The No. 999 attracts the visitor because it has for name "The Constitution and the Guerriere." It may be a shocking picture, with an impossible sea, but with the plentiful smoke of the guns. 
--------
888-> "GRIM SAVAGERY" OF WAR.
To the Editor of The New York Times: May I trespass on your space with one more word, this time in answer to "An American," who is surprised that I sympathize with the Filipinos, although some of them occasionally commit atrocities. All wars are accompanied by atrocities, nor is this one an exception. 
--------
889-> PUERTO RICANS' POVERTY.; Many Delegations to San Juan -- Possible Income of the Island.
SAN JUAN DE PUERTO RICO, April 5 -- Delegations of country people continue to arrive at the Governor's palace almost daily and express their urgent need of relief.

--------
896-> SENATE TALKS OF TRUSTS; Argument Grows Out of Army Appropriation Bill Debate. TRUSTS AS BENEFACTORS Mr. Sewell Says Standard Oil and American Sugar Refining Companies Benefit the People.
WASHINGTON, May 1 -- During the greater part of the session of the Senate to-day the Army Appropriation bill, carrying supplies for the military of more than $114,000,000, was under consideration.

--------
900-> LORD ROBERTS'S ADVANCE.
It is plain that the long delay of Lord ROBERTS was judiciously employed. His evident intention was to accumulate so much of stores and of the material of transportation that when the advance was once begrun there should be no faltering. Thus far these preparations have been effective and successful. 
--------
901-> BOERS AGAIN ACTIVE.; Botha Said to Have Established a Gov- ernment at Roosendal.
PRETORIA, Nov. 18 -- The Boers are active. It is alleged that Commandant Louis Botha has established a Government at Roosendal, north of Middleburg, and that with the L150,000 which he has available he is paying the fighting burghers a crown per day.

--------
905-> THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY.
The United States Circuit Court of Appeals in Virginia has handed down a decision which would seem to be an extremely tardy judicial recognition of the obvious fact that a married woman living with her husband may be the head of the family. The appellant, a Mrs. RICHARDSON of Plum Point, Va., was Postmistress of the village and conducted a general store. 
--------
906-> CLASS B AMATEUR BILLIARDS.; Finals in the A.A.U. Tournament Will Take Place This Week.
Barring postponements of ties, the National Class B billiard tournament, which was begun last Monday at the Knickerbocker Athletic Club in this city, will be brought to a close this week.

--------
913-> THE ALOOFNESS OF THE LITER- ARY MAN.
A few weeks ago we were discussing the disinterested pursuit of reforms, in which Lowell, Curtis, and Warner, three literary men highly representative of American culture, engaged. It suggests the question of whether or not the single-minded direction or thought to one aim or its diffusion to many has been characteristic of men of letters. 
--------
914-> SENATOR DAVIS WORSE.; Acute Inflammation of the Kidneys Has Set In -- Dr. Murphy Telegraphed For.
ST. PAUL, Nov. 12 -- The condition of Senator C.K. Davis took a decided turn for the worse to-day, new complications developing.

--------
916-> OUTSIDE SECURITIES.

--------
917-> AGUINALDO AND BRYAN.
To the Editor of The New York Times: THE TIMES does not make the ridiculous assertion that another newspaper does, that "if you see it in its columns it's so," meaning by "it" the news presumably, and THE TIMES could make the assertion with far more truth than its neighbor. Now, when a good newspaper makes a statement we like to think it is so. 
--------
918-> IN THE HANDS OF HIS FRIENDS.
It seems to be established that Admiral DEWEY has realized the unwisdom of a canvass for the Presidency, "personally conducted," and that he has put himself in the hands of his friends, in the good old mode common to candidates and prizefighters. It is recognized among politicians that the judgment even of an experienced and crafty politician is not to be trusted when it is he himself who is a candidate, especially for the Presidency. 
--------
919-> The Annals of Fairyland.
It is hardly to be supposed that the children of the present generation, for whose edification the present volume can be warmly recommended, realize how rich they are not only in beautiful stories, but also in the wealth of detail lavished upon the preparation of volumes intended primarily for their gratification. 
--------
920-> DEAD IN RESERVOIR WELL; Laborer Entombed in Old Shaft at Forty-second Street. Micci Fell Sixty Feet Into Sewer Connection and All Trace of His Body Lost.

--------
926-> A CHRISTIAN SCIENTIST'S WILL.; Bequest to the First Church Contested by Brother of Testatrix.
The Christian Science doctrine will be thoroughly explained before the contest over the will of Helen C. Brush is ended.

In a will dated May 24 she gave $10,000 to her sister, Mrs. Almira J. Southard, and $1,000 to her brother, James E. Brush. 
--------
927-> "TREACHERY" TO BRYAN.
The careless and slovenly habit of calling W.J. BRYAN a Democrat breeds endless confusion. Here is The Buffalo Times, for instance, upbraiding certain Democrats in this State who have considered the possibility of electing the Democratic candidate for Governor, even if the candidate for President is beaten, a result which it declares could be attained only by "treachery to Mr. BRYAN." 
--------
928-> CITY EMPLOYES' DISMAY; Two Thousand Men-Dismissed in the Various Departments. Mr. Croker's War Upon Protective Associations Declared to be the Cause -- Police Defied Him.
Over two thousand city employes have lost their jobs during the past week, and there has been much walling in the Tammany camps of several politicians. All the leaders have been asking questions as to why this sudden descent should be made on office holders so soon after election, and why 2,000 of the faithful should be dismissed to spend a very cold and cheerless Winter. 
--------
929-> FICTION OF THE SEASON.; Works by Robert Grant, Miss Fowler, Mr. Brady, Mr. Benson, Mr. Weyman, and Others. FICTION OF THE SEASON.
The disastrous result upon culture in all its forms, ethical no less than intellectual, of "raw haste, half-sister to delay," is made very plain in the pages of Robert Grant's "Unleavened Bread." A certain "American spirit," as colossal in self-conceit as in ignorance, blocking the wheels of real progress, is shown in all its arrogant ugliness, and in sharp contrast to the graciousness and charm of true culture. 
--------
930-> INSURANCE MAN ARRESTED.; Montreal Agent of the New York Life Charged with Obtaining Money by False Pretenses.

LONDON, Dec. 21 -- Nearly all the morning papers have editorials on the action of the United States Senate in connection with the Hay-Pauncefote Canal treaty.

--------
938-> GEN. GREENE AND THE REPUBLICAN COMMITTEE.
The withdrawal of Gen. FRANCIS V. GREENE from the Chairmanship of the Republican County Committee is a matter for regret to all who desire the regeneration of our city and its rescue from the evil organization that was fastened upon it in 1897 by the policy of the Republican machine at that time.

1350-> THE FISHERIES, GAME AND FOREST COM- MISSION.
The faithless public servants whom Gov. ROOSEVELT has just taken steps to oust from the offices they have so unworthily filled by appointing an entirely new Fisheries, Game and Forest Commission, are the same men who in 1896 officially recommended the adoption of a Constitutional amendment designed to destroy the provision for the protection of the forests incorporated in the Constitution in the revision of 1894.

--------
1360-> MR. ROOT ON CUBA.
Everybody will be glad to have Mr. ROOT'S testimony to the manner in which the present Government of Cuba is working, and his opinion upon the manner in which the more complete remission of Cuban affairs to the Cubans is likely to work.

--------
1366-> HEARD ABOUT TOWN.

To The New York Times Saturday Review: I was pleased with the article "Kipling Again," signed "May Harris," in your issue of Saturday, Aug. 4.

To The New York Times Saturday Review: I have recently read a letter In THE SATURDAY REVIEW, signed by Mr. Arthur T.
