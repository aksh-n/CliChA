264-> THE SCREEN; 'Objective, Burma,' a Realistic and Excitingly Told War Film Starring Errol Flynn, Opens at the Strand Theatre Here
The Warners have achieved a startling degree of realism in "Objective, Burma," which opened yesterday at the Strand. This is without question one of the best war films yet made in Hollywood. There are no phony heroics by Errol Flynn or any of the other members of a uniformly excellent cast. These boys conduct themselves like real soldiers and even the newspaper correspondent is a credit to the craft. The Warners have erred only in the film's excessive length. It runs approximately two hours and twenty minutes, or roughly thirty minutes more than appears to be absolutely necessary."Objective, Burma" is the hard-bitten story of a group of tough, tight-lipped paratroopers who are dropped deep in the Burmese jungles to wipe out a troublesome Jap radar station. Many of the scenes are the real thing, and the shots of the boys jumping out of the planes look as though they were borrowed from the Army's film archives. In fact, the whole picture has a strong documentary quality, even in the writing. There is surprisingly little dialogue and what is said is spoken tersely, or with a touch of earthy humor.These troopers appear to be a composite of the famous groups known as Merrill's Marauders and Wingate's Raiders, for this account deals mostly with a harrowing trek across Burma's difficult terrain. After destroying the enemy radar unit without a casualty, the raiders are ambushed by a Jap patrol as they await their sky taxis in a jungle clearing. Cut off, they set out for another airstrip, according to prearranged plans, but they are doggedly pursued by the Japs all the way and eventually are left with no other choice than to walk their way out fighting.It is a heroic campaign, indeed. Pitched battles with vastly superior Japanese search patrols are frequent, and are explosively depicted Yet, at no time does any of the action smack of improbability. The hostility of the jungle leaps out overpoweringly from the screen. The night scenes are especially effective in their eeriness, the stillness of the sound track being broken only by the weird cries of the birds and animals. And there is a tremendously exciting sequence when the Japs attempt to storm the American position in the dark.Errol Flynn has never had a better role than that of Captain Nelson and he has never imbued a portrayal with so much realism. As a middle-aged reporter, who expires near the end of the grueling march, Henry Hull is excellent. The only reason we singled those two out from George Tobias and all the others is that they have the strongest roles."Objective, Burma," directed exceedingly well by Raoul Walsh from a first-class script by Ranald MacDougall and Lester Cole, is a stirring tribute to the sterling fighting men who helped to reopen Burma after the initial Japanese onslaught in the Pacific. OBJECTIVE, BURMA, based on a story by Alvah Bessie; screen play by Ranald MacDougall and Lester Cole; directed by Raoul Walsh; produced by Jerry Wald for Warner Brothers.

452-> THE SCREEN; Defense of Moscow by Air
That the Soviet military juggernaut today has hurtled across Silesia's borders to stand less than 200 miles from Berlin is due in noticeable measure to the unflagging efforts of the Russian air arm. With the arrival of "Moscow Skies" at the Stanley Theatre on Saturday, those indomitable stalwarts received their first cinema salute. Not an entertainment in the strict sense of the word, since raw courage in battle can hardly be termed entertaining, the film, nevertheless, graphically depicts against the background of a simple romantic story the heroic defense of Moscow by its fighter pilots in the early, tense days of the Nazi campaign against Russia.In developing the rather primitive plot the producers have invested the picture's players not only with heroism but with humor and realism. The story of a callow pilot fresh from training, whose romance with a nurse is secondary to his avowed task of stemming the waves of Junkers which threatened the Russian capital in the autumn of 1941, is at once a heart-warming and fitting tribute.Behind the horse play and camaraderie of his fellow-aviators is their grim hatred and respect for the enemy. This lieutenant's transition to their seasoned status is swift. After he luckily downs a German bomber on his first day aloft, his baptism of fire continues in pace with the ever-mounting Nazi aerial offensive. And, finally, when the invaders have been driven from the skies, the lieutenant, now a hero, has viewed not only a hard-won victory but the savagery of conflict and the death of an intrepid comrade in arms.Peter Aleinikov, last seen here in "No Greater Love," plays Lieutenant Streltsov with understanding and restraint.

658-> THE SCREEN; 'Tonight and Every Night,' Film Musical, With Hayworth, at the Music Hall--'Murder, My Sweet,' Arrives of the Palace At the Palace
With a blitzed London theatre as the locale and the-show-must-go-on as the theme—you know, chin up and face the music while the bombs are coming down—Victor Saville has shaped a very pleasant and sentimentally romantic musical film for Columbia under the title of "Tonight and Every Night." He has got some melodious songs for it, he has dressed it in lovely pastel shades and he has given it all to Rita Hayworth and a most agreeable cast to play. If your taste is for gaiety touched with pathos, you will find it at the Music Hall. Our ventured guess is that it will be there for quite a little while.Mr. Saville has fetched his story from the mildly successful play of Leslie Storm called "Heart of a City." And it is the story of a London revue troupe, starring the quite American Miss Hayworth, which continues to give nightly shows despite the blitz and some rather heavy pressure upon the hearts of Miss Hayworth and other stars. That pressure derives from her involvement with a most charming RAF man, played by Lee Bowman, who, at one point—well, you know how things are during a war.By the grace of some able script writing and Mr. Saville's directorial care, the story never drops to maudlin bathos. In fact, it rather keeps a gallant air. And it permits an appropriate succession of music and dance interludes. Miss Hayworth is fetching in the first one, "What Does an English Girl Think of a Yank?" and she puts forth some radiance and talent in a ballet number, "Cry and You Cry Alone." "You Excite Me" is her Hit Parade tempter and she teams very nicely with Janet Blair in a comic song skit, wherein the two play service ladies, called "The Boy I Left Behind."Miss Blair draws the song plum, however. It is the title number and it is smartly produced against a highly original background representing an animated newsreel screen. And Marc Platt, the interpretive dancer who helped make "Oklahoma!" what it is, gets the nod as the show's big sensation with the brilliant solo dance that he does. Mr. Platt's flying leaps in this picture should carry him to Hollywood heights.A glowing word, too—and that is meager—for the film's exceptional décor, for the svelte and subtle use of subdued colors in settings and costumes. It is pleasant to see a color picture which avoids the shocking, livid hues and gratifies the visual sense rather with mellow, sophisticated shades. Indeed, Mr. Saville's whole picture is in a smooth and sophisticated style. It is nice to be able to recommend it for a musical hour and a half. TONIGHT AND EVERY NIGHT, screen play by Lesser Samuels and Abem Finkel; based on the play "Heart of a City," by Leslie Storm; music by Jule Styne; lyrics by Sammy Cahn; produced and directed by Victor Saville for Columbia Pictures.

Gavin MuirMurder and assorted violence continue to be the order of the day at the Palace, where a superior piece of tough melodrama called "Murder, My Sweet," arrived yesterday, a few hours after the departure of that other intriguing study of crime, "The Woman in the Window." This sort of fare has been going on at the Palace since the first day of the year, when "Experiment Perilous" arrived to delight the armchair gumshoes. Three such hit pictures in a row is enough to turn any respectable theatre into a chamber of horrors, so there's no telling what sort of black magic the Palace might come up with next.Meanwhile, check off "Murder, My Sweet" as a sure cure for low blood pressure. This is the story of a private detective who would take a dollar from anyone, with no questions asked. Phillip Marlowe is just a shade above his clients, who might be politely called questionable characters. He is not a particularly shrewd operator as Dick Powell draws him, but he has a persistence and capacity for taking a beating that is downright admirable. This is a new type of character for Mr. Powell. And while he may lack the steely coldness and cynicism of a Humphrey Bogart, Mr. Powell need not offer any apologies. He has definitely stepped out of the song-and-dance, pretty-boy league with this performance."Murder, My Sweet" sticks fairly close to its source—the Raymond Chandler novel, "Farewell, My Lovely," about a private "dick" who sets out to find a missing feminine link in the life of a stir-happy brute and is drawn into a complex web of murder, blackmail and double-dealing revolving around a missing jade necklace. Whole passages of Mr. Chandler's pungent sardonic dialogue were preserved by John Paxton, the script writer, and Edward Dmytryk's direction maintains the racy pace of the novel. The ending has been altered, but not the spirit. As in the case of "Double Indemnity," the Hays office has literally let the feminine protagonist, a malevolent blonde, played revealingly and suggestively by Claire Trevor, get away with murder.Practically all of the supporting roles are exceptionally well played, particularly by Mike Mazurki, the former wrestler, as the brutish Moose Malloy; Otto Kruger as Jules Amthor, quack-psychologist and insidious blackmailer; Anne Shirley as an innocent among the wolf pack, and Don Douglas as the police lieutenant. In short, "Murder, My Sweet" is pulse-quickening entertainment.Also on the Palace program is "On Guard," an inspiring two-reel record of the activities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in combating enemy espionage and sabotage. J. Edgar Hoover, FBI director, appears in a foreword. The film contains what now seem to be incredible sequences of Nazis boldly parading in uniform at Bund camps here and of the Madison Square Garden rally. The subject, a chapter in RKO's "This Is America" series, also shows the films which the FBI made of Frederick Joubert Duquesne, Nazi spy leader, and Jap agents operating in this country.

976-> THE SCREEN; 'Thunderhead,' Based on a Book by Mary O'Hara, Featuring Roddy McDowall in Its Cast, Opens at Victoria Theatre
As the cinematic colt of "My Friend Flicka," Twentieth Century-Fox's new film, "Thunderhead," runs true to breeding form in movie sequels; it is a close imitation of its dam. Its two-legged actors are the same ones seen in the previous horse film. Its locale is the same—a Western horse ranch—and it blazes in Technicolor hues. A boy's love for a horse is the topic, as it was in that other film, and the youngster still learns by experience—as he did two years ago.But the fact that the studio swapped horses—or rather, Mary O'Hara did, when she wrote "Thunderhead" as a sequel to her earlier popular book—is cause for the obvious diminution of emotional intensity in the new film. This picture, now showing at the Victoria, is "My Friend Flicka" with stubble on its chin. For Thunderhead, the snow-white colt of Flicka, which becomes the object of affection in this film, is a very masculine equine and has the rude and violent temper of his sex. The earlier passages of the picture, in which Roddy McDowall raises the colt and manfully breaks it to the saddle, are quite in a soft and cuddly mood. But when Thunderhead grows into a charger, the whole show has a change of voice.As a consequence, the nature of this picture is more in the outdoor action line, with a kicking and biting battle between two stallions as the big climactic scene. And, before that, a race in which the new horse demonstrates that he has lots of speed but no stability is designed for excitement without any appreciable "heart." There is plenty of outdoor magnificence in the backgrounds of rolling range and streams, and occasional flashes of affection shown between father and son. But "Thunderhead" is essentially a horse opera with a wistful remembrance of things past.Master McDowall is some years older than he was in "My Friend Flicka"—and it shows. He has reached, both in fact and in performance, what is known as the gawky stage. Let's say he is not quite as sensitive and appealing as when Flicka was his friend. Preston Foster and Rita Johnson again play father and mother methodically. The title performer is a handsome but rather violently forbidding beast. THUNDERHEAD, screen play by Dwight Cummins and Dorothy Yost; based on the novel by Mary O'Hara; directed by Louis King; produced by Robert Bassler for Twentieth Century-Fox.

1127-> THE SCREEN
"This," murmurs Aline MacMahon, "is a str-r-range story that I am going to tell—," as she opens Hunt Stromberg's new picture at the Capitol, "Guest in the House." And, brother, she isn't fooling. For a more cracked and incredible tale than this quaint one of a mischief-making female has not lately disturbed the screen. As a play by Hagar Wilde and Dale Eunson, it had a moderate run, we understand, but as a film it is openly in peril of being laughed into a quick decline.The fault is as much in the story as it is in the handling by all concerned, for the story is cheaply synthetic and about as logical as a crooner's song. It is the story of an oddly spiteful female who comes to live in a happy home and, by constant and callous conniving, manages to drive everybody almost mad. She pretends to be sickly and helpless, she plays Liszt's "Liebestraum" all the time, she goads the servants into open rebellion and she makes the husband appear a faithless louse. In the end, however, good old auntie—that's the part Miss MacMahon plays—shows this character an empty birdcage which, for some reason, frightenes her to death.Why the birdcage, you may ask, and why the tolerance of such an obvious spoiler from the start? Those are little matters which nobody remembered to make clear. The nature of the lady's bent toward evil is never fitly explained, and certainly the ease with which she gets by is a tax on credulity. Furthermore, in his direction, John Brahm has permitted the film to be so cluttered with dialogue and posing that it all moves at slow and ponderous pace.Nor is any help rendered by Anne Baxter, who plays the wrecker with so much coyness that anyone, shy of a blind man, could see that she was up to tricks. And Ralph Bellamy is equally ridiculous as a middle-aged Byronic beau who tries to be boyish and amorous and also solemn and wise. Miss MacMahon remains in the background, which is a happy place for one in this film, while Ruth Warwick, Scott McKay and Jerome Cowan get entwined with the torturings up front.Mr. Stromberg is an eminent producer, but his grip certainly slipped on this job. Naughty, Naughty!GUEST IN THE HOUSE, screen play by Ketti Frings; from the stage play by Hagar Wilde and Dale Eunson; directed by John Brahm; produced by Hunt Stromberg for United Artists.

1339-> THE SCREEN; A British Picture
Cognizant of the fact that the war affected not only warriors and Baedeker towns, but also the arts, the producers of "Battle for Music" have provided both a treat for music lovers and a commentary on an uncommon brand of courage in the English-made picture which came to the Little Carnegie Playhouse on Saturday. For, although the story of the London Philharmonic Orchestra's fight for survival during the awesome days of the blitz is inexpertly fashioned, it nevertheless is warmly and pointedly told. And if the actors, most of whom are actual members of the famed aggregation, do not exactly measure up to Academy Award standards, then their orchestral performances more than make up the deficit.Among the latter are excerpts from Beethoven's Fifth, Mozart's Fourth and Sibelius' Second symphonies, as well as Tchaikovsky's "Romeo and Juliet" and Delius' "La Colinda" under the varied baton techniques of Sir Adrian Boult, Dr. Malcolm Sargent, Constant Lambert and Warwick Braithwaite. And to round out the musical fare, Moiseiwitsch and Eileen Joyce, concert pianists, appear with the group to play Rachaninoff's Concerto No. 2 and Grieg's Concerto in A minor, respectively.For the story's sake, J. B. Priestley deserts the literary field to whip up a benefit concert for the orchestra, the members of which had resolutely decided to continue as a unit under their own management rather than disband. And Jack Hylton, band leader, aware of the financial and cultural crisis, assists by arranging a tour of England's movie and variety houses to take the orchestra out of its native habitat to the vast audiences of the hinterlands. But, while these non-musical sequences may leave much to be desired, it is as a permanent record of an internationally acclaimed team of artists that "Battle for Music" is at once an unusual and rewarding film. A British PictureBATTLE FOR MUSIC, script and dialogue by Leigh Clowes; an English film produced and directed by Donald Taylor; a Strand Film Production presented here by Four Continents Films, Inc., with the London Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Sir Adrian Boult. Dr. Malcolm Sargent, Constant Lambert and Warwick Braithwaite and Eileen Joyce and Moiseiwitsch as piano soloists and featuring J. B. Priestley, Jack Hylton, Brian Michie, Thomas Russell, Francis Stead, R. B. Morley, Charles Gregory, F. G.

1415-> THE SCREEN; 'I'll Be Seeing You,' Drama of a Shell-Shocked Soldier, With Joseph Cotten, Ginger Rogers, Opens at Capitol
Several attempts have already been made by Hollywood to image the drama of the veteran returning from the war—and several attempts have already made variable hashes of the job. But now Producer Dore Schary has come along with a simple and straightforward film which handles this most urgent subject in a sane and affecting way. "I'll Be Seeing You" is the picture and it opened at the Capitol yesterday. This is a pressing recommendation that as many of you see it as can.For the veteran whom Mr. Schary cinematically brings home from the war is no hot and be-medaled hero, no jaunty and zealous Rover Boy. He is a plain, undistinguished sergeant and a psychoneurotic case. He is a pleasant and harmless young fellow—the sort that many of us are likely soon to know—whose only betrayal of "shell shock" is his peculiarly apathetic air. And his one and poignant anxiety, which is characteristic of such upset men, is the fear that he will never be able to restore himself to normal health and life.By bringing this chap, on a furlough, into contact with a girl on prison parole, and having the two—each not suspecting the other's embarrassment—live for a happy Christmas holiday in a natural civilian atmosphere, Mr. Schary has set a situation which is charged with dramatic force. And he has drawn a symbolic parallel which has significant implication and overtone. For he shows in a quiet and sensible fashion how society, with the best intentions at heart, can shock and disturb the re-establishment of such people to a normal way of life. He has shown the need for tact and wisdom in the social relations with such folks.This picture, it must be said, is sounder, from a purely psychological point of view, in its earlier and steadier phases when it is credibly establishing its case. Here Mr. Schary and his associates have put a literal and naturalistic style to excellent use in creating an honest American atmosphere. Except for one sequence in flashback, which very melodramatically explains why the girl in the case is really innocent, the tone and texture of the tale is bona fide. The whole American family pattern and the special problem are comprehended here.The latter phases of the picture, wherein the veteran undergoes some bouts of shock and the modest plot of the drama rises to take command, are somewhat less convincing. And, despite one visually lacerating scene in which the soldier has a relapse, they are not altogether sound. But they are emotionally disturbing. They give the picture a strong sentimental lift. And they send one forth rejoicing that the heart has healed the nerves.In the principal roles and under the direction of William Dieterle, Joseph Cotten and Ginger Rogers give performances that are excellent. Mr. Cotten, because his role is obviously the more demanding and tenebrous, deserves the highest honors. He plays the shell-shocked veteran with supreme restraint and with a calm and determined independence that beautifully reveals his pain and pride. Miss Rogers is altogether moving as the girl likewise injured by fate, but her role is plainly fashioned for reflection and counterpoint.Shirley Temple is splendid as the daughter of the house in which the drama is played out, and Spring Byington and Tom Tully are most congenial as a typical Mom and Dad. Mention could be made of two or three fine scenes reflecting a sensible understanding of the soldier's case, and of the whole warming mood of the picture. But you should see it and enjoy them for yourself. I'LL BE SEEING YOU; screen play by Marion Parsonnet; based on a story by Charles Martin; directed by William Dieterle; produced by Dore Schary for Selznick-International and released through United Artists.
