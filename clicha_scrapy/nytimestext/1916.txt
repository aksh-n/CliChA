176-> A NEW FOX STAR IN THE ASCENDANT; Pretty June Caprice Is Introduced at the Academy of Music. FAIRBANKS AT THE RIALTO Presented in a Stunning Bret Harte Picture Set Amid the Giant Redwood Trees.
Every power in the world of motion pictures wishes with all his heart he could find a second Mary Pickford and, if you keep your eyes open, you are pretty sure to catch each of them, at one time or another, in the act of trying to create one. In June Caprice, William Fox seems to have such confidence that he makes the staggering boast she will be the best known woman on the screen before the year is out. It remains to be seen. Her first picture, however, can be seen at once, for it was introduced yesterday on the screen at the Academy of Music.The new Fox star is young, pretty, graceful, petite, with an eloquence of gesture that augurs a bright future in the movies. Obviously, she enters that class of small and beguiling women of the screen wherein, at present. Mary Pickford and Marguerite Clark are preeminent. Her first scenario, like most movie romances, is on an exact level with a heart-throb by Laura Jean Libbey. It is called "Caprice of the Mountains."A rich vein of scenario material for the irrepressible Douglas Fairbanks was tapped when his directors started on the Bret Harte stories and the first of these photoplays. "The Half Breed," was put on view at the Rialto yesterday. It is a picture that has many beauties and when you behold its western story unfolded against a background of redwood trees, you know for sure that California was just made and put aside to wait for the coming of motion pictures.Much of the action is set in the giant forest and as a half-breed who looks rather more like Peter Pan than not. Fairbanks even lives within one of the great trunks, although this, to any one who has lived in a suitcase, is no great feat. Fairbanks has infrequent opportunities here for his talented smile but his muscles are starred and, from the way he bounds about, you realize that he can, whenever he leaves the movies, become a pugilist or represent us at the Olympic games. That is, if they do not kill him."Paying the Price" is the name of a good Brady-made World picture that accompanies the new chapters of Billie Burke's serial at the Globe. It weaves some spectacular torpedo practice into a story that stars the beauteous Gail Kane. The movies never care much about the probabilities, the directors apparently going on the supposition that a great majority of their spectators will not know any better. But this photoplay achieves the wildest of improbabilities when it flashes the caption. "The bride of a month—a neglected woman," and then displays a sunlit picture of Miss Kane. That is going a little too far.Wallace Reid and Cleo Ridgely are the stars at the Strand, where "The Selfish Woman" is being shown, while at the Broadway you might, if you had felt like it, have seen Donald Brian in "The Smugglers." Beginning today there will be an outburst of Charlie Chaplin all over town when "The Vagabond" is released.Billy Van, the actor who was taken to Bellevue Hospital on Saturday night after an attack of apoplexy in a room at 306 West Forty-fifth Street, is not Billy B. Van. as was erroneously reported. The stricken man, who is a prisoner in the hospital on a charge of having a revolver in his room, is a black-face comedian. He has not appeared on the stage lately.Both Vans belong to the White Rats Club, where it was said yesterday many inquiries from friends of Billy B. Van had been received. The latter appeared at the Brighton Theatre last night, closing a week's engagement.

Edward Higginson of Boston has written you under date of Feb. 7, asking, "Why always refer to the local militia as national guard?" I think the answer is plain.

SUCH figures as the witty, dashing, and fashionable Chevalier de Boufflers are not rare in the memoirs of the middle of the eighteenth century.

428-> AMERICA PREPARING."; Deeply Interesting Army and Navy Review in Motion Pictures.
Every one in the city-literally every one—should go to the Lyric Theatre to see "America Preparing," a deeply interesting motion picture of the army and navy at work and at play, which was exhibited there for the first time last evening. You see America's defenses from the men in camp at Plattsburg to the cavalry riding along Sierra Madre traits; you watch the firing of fourteen-inch guns; you journey through the clouds above Pensacola in a hydro-aeroplane and go to a ball game with the marines from the Texas. Glimpses of such scenes are familiar enough in the weekly news reviews which are part of the program of every motion picture house; here we have such glimpses in such abundance that they last all evening.Here is a preparedness film that does not argue. There is no wild picture of America invaded. There is no scene showing an enemy officer (strongly resembling the Kaiser) at the moment of knocking down the Capitol at Washington. The review of our defenses, from the superb West Point and Annapolis pictures to the long line of battleships, leaves you feeling like the rabbit that wanted to fight the bulldog. You come out of the Lyric momentarily inclined to the belief that America would make short work of a world in arms against her. There is nothing to suggest any shortcomings—nothing, that is, in the pictures themselves. The key to "America Preparing," as preparedness propaganda, is given in the program in this single line, "Quality we possess—we must have quantity." It is as though Director Kemble, in behalf of the army and navy, proffered this fine sample as an inducement to all Americans to go down into their pockets and buy some more of the same—much more of the same.This motion picture, by the way, ought to prove a most effective recruiting agent for the sunny side of the life of a soldier or a man-o'-warsman is kept always toward the audience. "America Preparing" shows the civilian some things he has never seen before, and it makes the army and navy inviting.Edward C. Doyle, Staten Island's champion against the encroachment of the garbage plant men had an inspiration yesterday. Once he was employed by the State Conservation Commission, so he knows something about the laws they have had passed, and it occurred to him that one of these laws forbade any one to interfere with an oyster bed after an owner had planted it in waters adjacent to his property.So Mr. Doyle went to Perth Amboy and chartered the sixty-foot power oyster boat Captain Nick, in charge of Captain William B. Post and a crew. Then he loaded 150 bushels of seed oysters in the bows and sailed away for Lake Island, which Mr. Boyle says he owns, and to which title is also claimed by the garbage contractors.Guards and policemen were on the island, and they protested loudly when they discovered Mr. Doyle's purpose. Two of the policemen even fell into the water in an effort to reach him, said Mr. Doyle, but he stood in the bow of his vessel and read them the law, and then they let him alone.He planted his oysters around Lake Island in such position that the rival claimants can't even run out a pier without interfering with his seedlings. Doyle says they'll have to let things remain at a standstill until his oysters grow to full maturity, and that'll take about six months. Meantime Doyle hopes the courts will have decided in his favor or at any rate the Governor will interfere, for on Thursday several hundred Staten Islanders are going to Albany to ask Mr. Whitman to do just that.

456-> Americans Unchanged.
Readers of the papers and magazines published here and across the Atlantic during the last year have noted an occasional article, which has been read with intense annoyance and a feeling that patience was reaching the breaking point.

It is not a safe play like "The Merchant of Venice" or "As You Like It," nor a serious play like "Hamlet."

801-> LABOR'S PROPERTY.
Wage earners in general have so little property except their labor that it might be thought they would demand the rigor of the law for its protection as the first of their rights. So the courts have held uniformly, notably in the leading case of GIBBONS vs. OGDEN. In that decision, so often quoted, appears this passage: 
--------
802-> An Aid to the Paramount Duty.
Secretary Lansing in his recent note to Mexico said: "The first duty of any Government is the protection of life and property. This is the paramount obligation for which Governments are instituted; and Governments neglecting or failing to perform it are not worthy of the name." 
--------
803-> BUSINESS IN THE CAMPAIGN.
It cannot escape the attention of the Democrats that the Republicans are more aggressive upon business than upon any other subject which divides the parties. There are other topics more prominent, but the positions of the parties are much alike. So similar are the positions of all Americans upon preparedness. 
--------
804-> PUBLIC UTILITIES; Transactions In Stocks and Bonds ;- Quotations for Railway, Light and Power Issues.
The following range of prices and closing quotations were reported to THE NEW YORK TIMES yesterday by dealers in public utility securities. The trading in these securities is done privately over the counter, and this record gives only those trades which are reported by the dealers making them:

809-> USEFUL POINTERS ON SUMMER STYLES

For walking or motoring one chooses a band of vivid black and white stripes or large white scarf, ending in silk fringe and matching the silk sweater in color. 
--------
810-> How Gen. Lawton Regarded Services for Which It Was Awarded.
In your editorial "Legislative Powers Misused" in yesterday's TIMES you call attention to Section 122 of the Army bill which relates to a proposed "investigation concerning medals of honor." Very properly you see in this unjustified and mean fling at Major Gen. Leonard Wood an "obvious and contemptible" effort to discredit one of the ablest and most generally esteemed officers in the service of this country. 
--------
811-> URGE BILL FOR STADIUM; Athletic Organization Officials Before Congressional Committee.
WASHINGTON, May 12. -- Representatives of the Amateur Athletic Union, the Intercollegiate Athletic Association, the Navy League of the United States, and other organizations crowded the room of the House Committee on Appropriations today and urged a report on the Hulbert bill appropriating $1,435,000 for the construction of a stadium and athletic field in Washington.

--------
813-> London Expects Zeppelins.
LONDON, Monday, Jan. 24. -- The Times believes that Sunday's aeroplane raids were in the nature of scouting expeditions.

--------
814-> FREEDOM OF THE SEAS IN PEACE AND WAR.; A Doctrine Without Historical Validity -- Rights of Belligerents as Against Neutrals Are Being Extended.
There has been a great deal of complaint on the part of well-meaning theorists to the effect that the principle of the freedom of the seas has been overthrown by Great Britain to the deep injury of neutral rights and of that orderly enjoyment of the common heritage of States which the oceans symbolize. 
--------
815-> LAMAR MUST SERVE TWO-YEAR SENTENCE; " Wolf of Wall Street" Loses Appeal to Highest Court in Impersonation Case. CANNOT BE ARRESTED YET May Be Six Weeks Before Mandate for Him Is Issued -- His Whereabouts Unknown.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 31. -- David Lamar, the so-called "Wolf of Wall Street," must serve the two-year sentence of imprisonment imposed upon him for impersonating by telephone Representative A. Mitchell Palmer of Pennsylvania. Appeal was made to the Supreme Court on the principal ground that a member of Congress was not an officer of the Federal Government and the Federal District Court convicting Mr. Lamar was therefore without jurisdiction. 
--------
816-> BULGAR PREMIER THINKS WAR WON; Predicts a Few More Defeats of the Entente Allies Will Bring Peace. NOT WORRIED BY SALONIKI But Says Rumania's Position Will Have to be Made Clear in Near Future.

The lid was pried off the public links golf season yesterday when Commissioner Thomas N. Whittle of the Bronx Department of Parks drove a ball from the first tee at Van Cortlandt Park. It was a rash promise that the Commissioner made when he consented to send the first ball of the season on its way, and he realized it when he stood on the tee before the expectant multitude. 
--------
819-> "FATIGUE OF STEEL" IN OVERLOADED TRUCKS; Continued Overstrain Tells on Machine Just as It Does on a Team of Horses -- Overstressing Leads to Breakage of Parts.
There is a similarity between a motor truck and a team of horses not apparent in their great outward dissimilarity; both are subject to fatigue from overwork; steel gets tired as well as muscle -- this point of likeness is brought out in an address against the Overloading of trucks by Joseph Husson, a technical expert on the motor truck, delivered before the Motor Truck Club of New Jersey. 
--------

--------
821-> COLLEGE ENTRANCE TESTS.; Suffragist Complains That Her Son Is Required to be Ignorant.
Your editorial concerning the ignorance of college boys in regard to science, history, and literature interested me very much. It certainly is true; but I think you put the blame on wrong persons. The educators, who plan the education given, are to blame, not the boys. 
--------
822-> Submarine Deutschland Sails in Daylight; Has $2,000,000 Cargo; Crowds View Start

When the German Reichstag meets next week there will be a controversy between the true friends of Germany and those who, without meaning it, are her worst enemies.

--------
1397-> STATE AND FEDERAL TAX PROPOSALS.
There are on the statute books today sufficient tax laws which, properly amended and wisely administered, will give to the State as well as to the localities, if fairly distributed, sufficient revenue for all reasonable "purposes." Nothing more cheering than that has come from Albany since the direct tax was imposed. 
--------
1398-> TOPICS IN WALL STREET.
The market got away to an excellent start, so good, in fact, that numerous short sellers of Wednesday doubted their judgment. The Marine issues, Crucible Steel, American Can, and others looked for a time as though they might keep adding steadily to their initial advances.

1399-> GERMANY AND U.S. TEN YEARS FROM NOW; Gertrude Atherton Prophesies and Tells a Story Illustrating How the Fatherland Regards German-Americans
MISS JULIA T. WATERMAN'S letter, dated Territet and printed in THE TIMES, is a curious commentary on the distribution of news in Switzerland, neutral country.

The situation of Rumania is rapidly becoming critical. It is not so yet.

--------
1407-> GOLD AND TRADE.
The President of the nation's biggest bank is a banker who challenges the familiar gibe that the United States could have no truly national bank because it had no bankers of that calibre. That dates back no longer than to the time when it was thought that a bond-secured currency was an example for the world, and that the way to encourage trade was to impede imports.

1411-> COST OF UPKEEP SHOULD GOVERN ROAD BUILDING; An Important Factor in Main Highway Construction, Says Pennsylvania's Chief Engineer ;- Keystone State Lessons.
When the Pennsylvania State Highway Department was reorganized in 1911 the original plan was to lay out a State highway system which would connect the county seats by the most traveled, direct roads.

PAN-AMERICAN BACKS WILSON IN MEXICO
WASHINGTON, May 13. -- Should the attitude of the de facto Government of Mexico force the hand of the United States Government and compel American armed intervention in Mexican affairs, the United States would have the moral support of those Pan-American nations that participated in the joint appeal made last year to the Carranza and Villa factions to enter a peace conference for the adjustment of their differences. 
--------
1415-> Article 3 -- No Title
PETROGRAD, June 14, (Dispatch to The London Daily News.) -- In many places the Austro-Germans are retiring so quickly that it is impossible for the pursuing army to keep up with them. It is easy for a retiring army, intent on nothing but safety and throwing aside all impediments, to move faster than its conquerors, who, to insure continued success, cannot move faster than the various kinds of indispensable munitions. 
--------
1416-> THE CONVENTIONS' LABOR PLANKS
It is worth remarking how much better success Mr. GOMPERS has with Congress than with the conventions which he attends. He took little from the Republican Convention. It may be hoped that he will take less from the Democratic Convention, because he is asking things not good for the country at large, nor for "labor" in particular.

1430-> CAPITAL PUNISHMENT FILM PLAY'S THEME; ' The People vs. John Doe' a Terrific Indictment of Circumstantial Evidence. BASED ON STIELOW CASE Skilled Actors Make the Story So Vivid It Seems to be a Transcript from Real Life.
"The People vs. John Doe," a motion picture exhibited publicly for the first time last night at the Broadway Theatre, is the most effective propaganda in film form ever seen here. It is a plea for the abolition of capital punishment and it has the backing of the Humanitarian Cult, whose founder, Mischa Appelbaum, delivered an address after the exhibition, in which he supplemented with words the moral of the picture.The photodrama is a terrific indictment of a system that permits a man to be convicted and sentenced to death on purely circumstantial evidence. Its story is a composite of a number of celebrated murder cases, though the essentials of the plot have been taken from the Stielow case.The players have been chosen with such intelligent regard to their fitness, and such careful attention to atmospheric detail has been given that the tragedy, as it is unreeled, seems not to be a drama acted before the camera, but a transcript of life itself. It conveys the same feeling of reality and sincerity that the production of John Galsworthy's "Justice" did. For those interested in the development of film art whose emotions are a bit calloused this product of the Universal Company's studio offers an absorbing study.Marie Doro appeared on the screen of the Strand Theatre yesterday in the rôle of Oliver Twist, in a movie version of Dickens's great novel. The character was not new to Miss Doro; she showed what a charming boy she could be when she appeared several years ago in a revival of "Oliver Twist," whose cast also included Nat Goodwin, Constance Collier, and Lyn Harding. The movie version is greatly condensed, of course, but it sketches the main points of the life of the little boy who had such an unfair start. It is well acted by Hobart Bosworth as Bill Sykes, Tully Marshall as Fagin. Raymond Hatton as the Artful Dodger, and Elsie Jane Wilson as Nancy.Augustus Thomas's drama, "The Witching Hour," was the new offering at the Rialto. This drama, dealing with mental telepathy is well adapted to exposition through the medium of movies. It does not gain in probability, but that is the last thing a photoplay needs, and it abounds in dramatic situations, which is more to the point. C. Aubrey Smith and Marie Shotwell were the featured players of a cast reasonably competent but for one glaring exception."The Battle of Life," with Gladys Coburn as the star, was shown at the Academy of Music.
