299-> Fraternity Problems Are Reviewed
Let's not classify it as a cycle but last summer Twentieth Century-Fox diffused the idea, via "Take Care of My Little Girl," that college sororities were not always the epitome of sweetness and light. Now, Paul Henreid, in essaying the triple duties of producer, director and star, is indicating that life in fraternities could be improved in "For Men Only," the serious little item that came to Loew's State yesterday. Mr. Henreid's contribution is not a shatter-tering castigation, nor is it likely to cause sweeping reform, but it may embarrass some Greek letter institutions while entertaining the unlettered in fraternal matters.Mr. Henreid, it should be pointed out, is not crusading against the extra-curricular life but against the hazing in fraternity initiations. The pledges at Omega Nu in Wake College are, it must be admitted, the normal type of college youth seeking the conviviality of social brotherhood. But Russell Johnson, football star, pledgemaster and campus hero of Omega Nu, is, it is obvious, a bit too anxious to hate Robert Sherman, a prospective Omega Nu and a forthright student who flatly states, "I can take as much as he can dish out."Perhaps the case is an extreme but in the course of the yarn some pretty rough tactics are revealed in the name of fraternity. Our pledgee is made to swim in freezing water; is asked to shoot a dog, and after he refuses, is hounded from the college and ultimately to an automobile accident and his death. Since Mr. Henreid is an honest pathology professor, who advised the dead student's mother to allow him to go on with his initiation, it is not surprising that he will take up the good fight to clear the young man even though it means giving up his ambition to be dean of the school's medical school. It is, however, too melodramatic to include an alleged involvement with a co-ed to besmirch his good name. The woman spurned, whose fury incites her to perjury, seemingly is not the type to be believed.Paul Renreid's multiple chores have not dulled the edge of his acting. He is a convincing and unpedantic professor whose emoting is sincere and unrestrained. And, he has surrounded himself with enough young people to give his own portrayal the necessary maturity. Include among the earnest supporting players Robert Sherman, as the ill-fated pledge; Russell Johnson, as the villainous campus leader; Margaret Field, as Henreid's wife; Kathleen Hughes, as the femme fatale, junior grade, and Vera Miles, as the tragic pledge's girl friend.For all of Mr. Henreid's sincerity of purpose, however, "For Men Only" seems to be jousting against a terribly tiny dragon. The men in college must have more pressing problems these days. FOR MEN ONLY, screen play by Lou Morheim; from an original story by Mr. Morheim and Herbert Margolies; produced and directed by Paul Henreid and released by Lippert Pictures, Inc.Dr. Stephen Brice . . . . .

456-> ' Scandal Sheet,' With Broderick Crawford Playing Editor, New Bill at Paramount
The ruthlessness of tabloid journalism, as seen through the coolly searching eyes of Hollywood scriptwriters (who naturally shudder with shock at such a thing), is given another demonstration in Columbia's "Scandal Sheet," a run-of-the-press melodrama which came to the Paramount yesterday. But apart from a bit of tough discussion of the public's avid taste for thrills and chills and a few dubious hints at tabloid techniques, there is nothing very shocking in this film.The only character of any excitement in this hackneyed and lifeless display of a murderous editor's come-uppance is a briefly seen Bowery bum who withers the guilt-loaded editor with a scavenger's look in one scene. Only for a moment do we see him, holding behind his rheumy eyes the secret of damaging knowledge, but that's the one haunting moment in the film. The character is played by Jay Adler, Luther's brother—which gives you an idea of the general level of the writing and the acting possibilities in this film.For the rest Broderick Crawford does the old stuff of scowling and howling viciously as the hardboiled editor who has murdered his wife and then waits grimly while his well-trained scandal-chaser closes in; John Derek gives a likely imitation of a high-school-paper cub in the latter role, and Donna Reed watches on with dull disfavor as a Vassar girl who has stumbled into a tabloid job. As a former Pulitzer Prize winner, now gone to drink and seed, Henry O'Neill has to spout such flowery language as would put all schools of journalism to shame.The moral of all this dismal nonsense, we would gather, is meant to be that corruption breeds corruption. The moral is okay. Enough said.On the stage at the Paramount are the Ink Spots, featuring Billy Kenny; Stump & Stumpy, Sarah Vaughan and Erskine Hawkins and his orchestra. SCANDAL SHEET, screen play by Ted Sherdeman, Eugene Ling and James Poe, from the novel "The Dark Page" by Samuel Fuller; directed by Phil Karlson; produced by Edward Small.

544-> THE SCREEN IN REVIEW; Metro's 'It's a Big Country,' an Episodic Study of Life in the U. S. A., Has Premiere
A cheery, sentimental estimation of life in these United States, warmly wrapped up in the sort of optimism most familiar to Hollywood, is confidently offered to the public by Dore Schary and M-G-M in a prize-package called "It's a Big Country," which came to the Trans-Lux Fifty-second Street yesterday. Subtitled "an American anthology," this cozy bundle of folksiness contains six little short-story dramas of people in various walks of life, a comic dissertation on Texas and a montage tribute to Negroes, all snuggled in with a creamy narration that flows nicely in front of "God Bless America" and similar airs.That is one thing to say about this picture: it is not modest or subtle in the way it profeses a passion and devotion for the good old U. S. A. No writer of institutional advertising or Chamber of Commerce ballyhoo could be more facile with the verbiage than was the writer of the narration of this film. Such blushless enthusiasm, flowing as it does from the unmistakable voice of Louis Calhern, has a disquieting way of sounding like a rocks-and-rills "commercial." This is the chief flaw in the film.And it is the more distressing because the several vignettes contained, each written, directed and acted by different sets of artists and stars, are generally pleasant little items, not great or profound in any way but amusing and tolerably reflective of human foibles and attitudes.The first one, for instance, starts things humming when James Whitmore confronts William Powell on a train with the breezy observation that this is a great country, all right, and Mr. Powell politely invites him to specify just which country he means. Does he mean the country of the farmer, the laborer, the white collar man, the millionaire, the pauper—the country from whose point of view? As a matter of fact, to what instant in the country's ever-changing life does he refer? Mr. Whitmore, a plain, simple booster, goes away with his head in a whirl and the picture is off to an attractive and stimulating start.The second yarn follows in order. It is a wistful little tale of an old Irish lady in Boston whom the census-takers have missed and who wishes to be included in the country's census before she dies. Ethel Barrymore plays it sweetly, while George Murphy and Keenan Wynn turn in credible acting as embarrassed newspaper men. This is consistent with the promise to look at America from many sides.The third item—that which delivers a sketchy newsreel montage of the accomplishments of Negroes in American life—is a little too obvious and self-conscious and it has just the faintest air of segregation, since it is the only part of the picture in which Negroes appear. No doubt, this is unintentional, for other episodes in the film—a comedy skit in which Gene Kelly, Janet Leigh and S. Z. Sakali do an Abie's-Irish-Rose on Greeks and Hungarians, and a wistful bit in which Marjorie Main shows-the irony of anti-Semitism on the part of a mother who has lost a son in the Korean war—are clearly and successfully directed to point the moral of tolerance.Less effective as drama, however, are a stilted little sketch about a young pastor, played by Van Johnson, at the church of the President in Washington and a homely folk-comedy about a stubborn Italian papa who refuses to buy eye-glasses for his son. Fredric March as the papa is not at his best in this yarn. However, Gary Cooper delivers an amusingly sly speech on the modesty of Texas and that rounds out the show.At the end, of course, it is realized that the promised survey of American life has been rather limited and cautious, without reaching any points of critical controversy, and that the items as they flow are uneven and generally disjointed. However, they are diverting, by and large. If it weren't for the shallow chauvinism of the narration, this would be an easy film to watch and generally enjoy. It's a big country, all right. IT'S A BIG COUNTRY, written by William Ludwig, Helen Deutsch, Ray Chordes, Isobel Lennart, Allen Rivkin, Dorothy Kingsley, Dore Schary, George Wells; directed by Richard Thorpe, John Sturges, Charles Vidor, Don Weis, Clarence Brown, William A. Wellman and Don Hartman for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. At the Trans-Lux Fifty-second Street Theatre.Mrs. Brian Patrick Riordan . . . . . Ethel BarrymoreSgt. Maxle Klein . . . . .

It must be acknowledged, though, that Mr. Ryan and Mr. Hudson, as two brothers on either side of the law, bring some gritty muscularity to the familiar proceedings, particularly the former. As the disillusioned offspring of law-abiding ranchers who organizes a gang of renegade veterans, steamrolls himself an empire and pays the piper, Mr. Ryan labors, like the others, under hogtied conditions.Louis Stevens, who wrote the scenario from his own story, has piled on so many stray cliches and shoot-'em-up embellishments that neither his protagonist nor the film holds much punch or conviction. And while the director, Budd Boetticher, does keep the revolvers smoking and the citizens cringing, the cast is left to dodge bullets more or less on its own resources. True, the misgivings of a medium-budget horse opera aren't exactly tragic, but this one at least begins on the right hoof, as the two uniformed brothers and their foreman return home and consider their peacetime destinies. Miss Adams is sandwiched in briefly as the elegant belle whose widowhood, apparently, spurs Mr. Ryan on to further ruthlessness and mayhem. John McIntire and Raymond Burr are excellent in even smaller roles, and Judith Braun, Dennis Weaver, Jim Arness and Tom Powers fire and dodge as the case may be. But "Horizons West" bites the dust before anybody in it. The CastHORIZONS WEST; story and screen play by Louis Stevens; directed by Budd Boetticher; produced by Albert J.

1057-> ' The African Queen,' Starring Humphrey Bogart, Katharine Hepburn, at the Capitol; ' Navajo' Feature at the Baronet -- 'Paris Nights,' an Import, Opens at Rialto Theatre
Whether C. S. Forester had his salty British tongue in his cheek when he wrote his extravagant story of romance and adventure, "The African Queen," we wouldn't be able to tell you. But it is obvious—to us, at least—that Director John Huston was larking when he turned the novel into a film.His lively screen version of it, which came to the Capitol yesterday with Katharine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart in its two predominant roles, is a slick job of movie hoodwinking with a thoroughly implausible romance, set in a frame of wild adventure that is as whopping as its tale of off-beat love. And the main tone and character of it are in the area of the well-disguised spoof.This is not noted with disfavor. Considering the nature of the yarn, it is hard to conceive its presentation in any other way—that is in the realistic channels of the motion-picture screen. For Mr. Forester's fable of love suddenly taking bloom in the hearts of a lady missionary and a Cockney rumpot while they're trying to escape down a German East African river in a wheezy steam-launch during World War I is so personally preposterous and socially bizarre that it would take a lot of doing to be made convincing in the cold, clear light of day. In the brilliance of Technicolor and with adventure intruding at every turn, any attempt at serious portrayal would be not only incongruous but absurd.And so Mr. Huston merits credit for putting this fantastic tale on a level of sly, polite kidding and generally keeping it there, while going about the happy business of engineering excitement and visual thrills. His lady, played by Miss Hepburn with her crisp flair for comedy, is a caricature of a prissy female in her high choke collar, linen duster and limp cloth hat. And his man, played by Mr. Bogart, is a virtual burlesque of the tropical tramp, just one cut—and that a very thin one—above the ripe meatiness of the clown. Not since Elsa Lanchester and Charles Laughton appeared in a very similar picture, "The Beachcomber," several years ago, have the incongruities of social station and manners been so pointedly and humorously portrayed."Mr. Allnut—dear—what's your first name?" the lady politely inquires of her companion the morning after she has apparently submitted to him, in what is perhaps the screen's least lustful and least likely seduction scene. "Charlie," he beams, with melting coyness. It is that anomalous and droll.Not all of it, however. Mr. Huston and his writer, James Agee, who assisted him in the preparation of the deliberately wordy script, have let the yarn slide onto the mud flats of heavy drama that Mr. Forester laid down, and while it is in that situation, they have let it become soggy in plot and mood. After running impossible rapids, eluding a German fort and keeping the romance skipping nimbly on the surface of sly absurdity, they have grounded their picture on a barrier of sudden solemnity and sanded it in with emotions that are neither buoyant nor credible. No wonder the fantastic climax that is abruptly and sentimentally contrived appears the most fulsome melodrama, unworthy of Mr. Huston and this film.However, while it is skipping—and that is most of the time—there is rollicking fun and gentle humor in this outlandish "African Queen." There's nothing subtle or moralistic, mind you, outside of the jesting display that nature's most formidable creature is a serene and self-righteous dame.Without two accomplished players, Mr. Huston could never have achieved his highly audacious purpose of a virtually two-character film, but Miss Hepburn and Mr. Bogart are entirely up to their jobs, outside of their lack of resemblance to the nationals they're said to be. Robert Morley is briefly effective as the lady's missionary brother who conveniently dies, and Peter Bull struts and puffs for one sequence as the captain of a German gunboat on all African lake.For the rest, there is beauty and excitement in the lush and colorful scenes of a broad and forbidding African river, its foaming white rapids and falls, and the various birds and animals that live on the banks and in the stream. Mr. Huston went right to Africa for this genuine atmosphere. While the hardships were said to be oppressive, he and his producer, S. P. Eagle, have been repaid. Their picture is doubly provided with the insurance of popularity. THE AFRICAN QUEEN, adapted for the screen by James Agee and John Huston, from the novel. "The African Queen," by C. S. Forester; directed by Mr. Huston; produced by S. P. Eagle. A Horizon-Romulus Production released by United Artists. At the Capitol.Charlie Allnut . . . . . Humphrey BogartRose Sayer . . . . .

1059-> At the Park Avenue
"Faithful City," the new import from Israel which R. K. O. is releasing at the Park Avenue, traces the rehabilitation of a group of Jewish war orphans against the hectic background of the newborn state. Joseph Leytes, who wrote, directed and produced this picturesque and frequently compelling drama, using a small cast of non-professionals, with a few exceptions, deserves full credit on several counts. Excellently photographed and performed with restraint, here is a simple story of psychological readjustment, confined, for the most part, to a children's settlement in suburban Jerusalem and managing, nevertheless, to convey almost exactly the confused political turbulence of the entire area.Mr. Leytes is examining two methods of reconditioning war-hardened youngsters to paradoxically unsettled reality, as practiced by a kindly Viennese settlement worker, finely played by John Slater, and a brash young American, enacted by an amiable actor named Jamie Smith. Mr. Leytes has allowed the pace to lag occasionally, but his dialogue is imaginative. Two of the scenes are superb, one when the camera scours the numbed faces of the moppets after their bus has been stoned by Arabs. And there is a chilling midnight talkfest in the barracks as the little ones, cigarettes burning, discuss their own backgrounds and the altruistic elders. Dina Peskin, Israel Hanin, Juda Levi and Amnon Lifshitz, as the ringleaders of the gradually softened rebels, are painfully convincing troupers.Mr. Leytes' film stands out in part rather than on the whole, however, after thoroughly conveying the off-screen strife by suggestion, and a few good-and-bad encounters with the British, he has concocted a melodramatic climax that packs Mr. Smith, the children's idol by now, off to a trench skirmish against the Arabs and a last-minute rescue of a water supply truck. Having done such a good job on the fringe of the conflict, Mr. Leytes owes his own explanation to the spectator, as well as to the questioning children, about the real meaning of the shooting.

1357-> Carrier Pigeons Were Faster; A LIFE IN REUTERS. By Sir Roderick Jones. 496 pp. New York: Doubleday & Co. $7.
TITLES of books are often whimsical and so misleading. In this case the name is simple and completely justified. Partly an autobiography, Sir Roderick Jones' book is also, in greater measure, the chronicle of a famous professional house.

1361-> The Gypsy Painter; CHIAROSCURO. Fragments of Autobiography. By Augustus John. Illustrated. 285 pp. New York: Pellegrini & Cudahy. $5.
FOR many years Augustus John has been the artist-image among his countrymen. Academic? Not exactly. Profound? That is never a public question to be asked or answered about an artist.

1368-> Criminals at Large
THE creation of a series-character to run through all of an author's books has been, of course, a commonplace of the detective story from the beginning.

1371-> Stand on Candidates Queried; Position of Stevenson and Eisenhower Contrasted on Issues
Your editorial comments on Governor Stevenson's speech concerning "the one-party press in a two-party country" were most interesting. Neither your editorial nor Arthur Krock's column, however, adequately answers the Governor's perceptive remarks. There are several matters that (to paraphrase Mr. Krock) "especially THE NEW YORK TIMES should understand":
