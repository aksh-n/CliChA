From the deck of a Cape steamer, far out on the wastes of ocean, one of the first birds that obtrudes itself upon the notice of the passengers is the Cape petrel, (Procellaria capensis,) known generally as the "Cape pigeon," although the reason why it is called a pigeon is not very clear, as it has nothing to do with the family of the Columbidae.

4-> THE FRENCH AT BISERTA.
Our London correspondent has taken note of a general expectation in Europe that Lord Salisbury is likely to play an important part in the complicated questions that have accumulated there.

11-> Japan's Learned Soldiers.
It appears that notebooks are quite common in the Japanese Army among both soldiers and coolies; they keep regular diaries, and take copious notes of everything they see. "It is surprising," writes a war correspondent to The China Mail, "what a lot they know about the Great West. Several of them talk intelligently of Spartans and Persians, Napoleon and his march to Moscow, and even compare the abolition of feudalism in England and Japan.

21-> The Technique of Pen and Ink.
It is easy, of course, to understand how pen drawing should have come to be so largely employed and elaborated. It is a matter of reproduction for illustration. An etching will not print with type, nor with a steel engraving. This led in the early part of the century to the imitation of steel engravings by wood engravers, who did the business most skillfully with immense labor.

--------
31-> FASSET'S FIGHT IN CHEMUNG.
J. Sloat Fassett in his fight against Platt in Chemung County is hampered, somewhat as Coggeshall was hampered in Oneida, by the selfish personal element in the contest.

32-> THE CHICAGO MARKET.
CHICAGO, Nov. 20. -- Trading to-day was confined chiefly to Lake Street and West Chicago. In spite of the good showing made by the former yesterday in earnings, the stock declined on heavy selling by the bears. The short interest has undoubtedly been largely increased in the last day or two.

As guests of the Boston and Maine Road they will visit Bar Harbor, after which they will depart for their respective homes. 
--------
41-> A POPULAR COMPOSER.
The name of the late George Frederick Root will never be written large in the annals of music, because the writers of those annals, more than the writers of any other annals, are fastidious and discriminating. It is ever the regret of the ambitious musician and musical amateur that, because of the limitations of the English language, the word music stands for so much.

The only reasons given by Senator Lexow for reporting the Greater New-York bill with an amendment providing for a new commission are that it accords with the Governor's recommendation and that it meets the objections of the Brooklyn people by providing for a uniform tax rate.

--------
91-> CRUISER A NEW-YORK PRAISED; A Critic At the Opening of the Baltic Canal Admires Her Qualities.
From the Rurik and Dupuy de Lome I pass to another powerful armored cruiser, the American New-York. I believe the general opinion of naval critics is that, assuming this vessel to be sufficiently stoutly built -- a point on which I have heard some rather serious doubts expressed -- she is no unequal match for the Rurik. 
--------
92-> THOSE STIMULATED MINES.
Some of our Republican contemporaries which profess to be looking forward to a re-enactment of the McKinley tariff are now telling their readers that nothing but the election of a Democratic President in 1892 prevented the production of large quantities of tin, the metal, in American mines under the benign influence of the McKinley duty of 4 cents a pound.

112-> EXIT ADMIRAL MEADE.
As is his custom in such matters, the President has made a judicious and dignified disposition of the case of Rear Admiral Meade.

For weeks the streets have resounded with a nonsensical cry which has proved absolutely infectious, and "En voulez-vous des-z-homards?" has passed from lip to lip in almost every grade of society, and in endless variation has done journalistic duty over and over again. The phrase, bad French as it may be, has made all sorts of victims, and its constant reiteration has proved such a nuisance that it has become absolutely obnoxious. 
--------

CHICAGO, Nov. 8. -- Executive officers of the Western roads to-day ratified the new passenger agreement.

Since the navigation of the ocean with ships was first accomplished by man, it has been necessary or desirable at times for the occupants of vessels to communicate with each other, especially when sailing in fleets or squadrons; and, as the range of the human voice is confined to a limited area, it is not always practicable or convenient for conversation to be carried on through this medium. 
--------

--------
136-> ARGENTINE WHEAT COMPETITION.
When an attempt to measure the effect of the Argentine wheat surplus upon prices is made, the size of that surplus should be considered in connection with certain closely-related facts or indications, among which have been trading methods and the probability -- more impressive last year than it is at present -- that this surplus would continue to increase.

LONDON, Dec. 21. -- No one in the thick of events here and in a position to judge of public feeling can honestly affirm that the country is in the state of excitement over the difficulties which have arisen in connection with the Anglo-Venezuelan dispute that some of the newspapers represent.

Perhaps to his father also Leonardo owed his taste for and his sense of art.

--------
169-> NEW THEATRICAL BILLS; New Operetta Produced at the Garrick Theatre.
Mr. T. Pearsall Thorne is a persevering young man, and the copy book tells us that "Perseverance conquers all things." This may be true in some walks of life; but never yet has perseverance conquered a lack of natural gifts in music. If it had, Karl Klindworth would be a greater pianist that Joseffy, and Reinecke a better composer than Brahms. 
--------
170-> A BIG STEAMSHIP'S FATE; Now Only a Prey for Seaside Relic Hunters. THE GLUCKAUF AT FIRE ISLAND For Over Two Years a Plaything for the Surf and a Curiosity for Summer Strollers Along the Beach.

--------
179-> JUDGE GAYNOR AS A CANDIDATE.
We regret to say that it is becoming extremely difficult to avoid taking Judge Gaynor seriously.

WASHINGTON, March 20. -- The prospect of serious complication through European encroachment on Venezuela and Nicaragua caused a special Cabinet conference this afternoon.

Withdrawal of gold from the Sub-Treasury yesterday for export to-day amounted to only $150,000. A jeweler's firm took it for remittances.

--------
198-> GROUND FOR DEMOCRATIC HOPE.; Prospects Bright in Assembly and Senatorial Contests.
There is much hope for Democrats in the present situation, considering the possibilities in the Assembly and Senatorial contests. There are more Democrats in this city than Republicans even under the most adverse circumstances.

--------
205-> THE DEMOCRATIC CHOICE.
Although, as we have already pointed out, the action of the Democrats in conference on Monday was by no means conclusive of a favorable vote on the Carlisle-Springer currency measure, it is not absolutely discouraging as to the prospect of some legislation. So far as the Democrats in either the House or the Senate are concerned, it ought to be plain that they have a very serious situation to deal with. 
--------
206-> THE KATAHDIN REJECTED.; Congress Alone Can Provide for Acceptance of the Boat.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 21. -- The coast defense ram Katahdin, built by the Bath Iron Works of Bath, Me., has been rejected by President Cleveland.

Another important Republican dinner was given last night. Gen. Horace Porter was the host and Gov. McKinley of Ohio the guest of honor. It was not a harmony dinner.

--------
236-> A MANLY RETREAT.
This is not a college story, although its preparatory scenes take place at Pierson. Some preparatory scenes must occur at college; but the drama generally terminates on the broader stage of the world. Who cares for a rehearsal save those who have part in it? I vow, if I had never been at Pierson, I would skip the very mention of its name. 
--------
237-> The Last of the Garrison.
In the course of the giant struggle before Metz, a handful of chasseurs flung themselves into a small red-roofed farmhouse, determined to sell their lives dearly.

240-> EVADING THE CONSTITUTIONAL INTENT.
While the people of New-York who are in favor of municipal reform and the divorce of City Government from party politics are fighting against the bi-partisan Police Board scheme for keeping politics in its worst form in the most important department, the Legislature seems to be engaged in forcing it upon other cities without attracting much attention.

There was not a very large audience at the Metropolitan Opera House last night.

Those who stayed away, however, missed a rare treat.

--------
278-> THE FINANCIAL WORLD.

--------
279-> TIRED OF THEIR MARRIAGE TIES; Mrs. Eugene Devoe Sutton Asks for a Limited Divorce -- Her Husband Seeks an Absolute One.

--------
294-> Editorial Article 1 -- No Title
" Election to the Academy," says M. Anatole France, "Is a great thing for one of Coppee's age; at mine it is no longer a matter of any interest." As M. France is an old man of fifty-five and M.

--------
301-> There Were Less Mice and Sparrows.
The mice were unoffending, and there was a protest that was pathetic in the wave of the tail with which they went down; but the sparrows came of a bad race, and deserved their fate. They suffered assimilation in the cast-iron interior of the gull merely as a punishment for their temerity in coming to steal his dinner. We gave him a daily dinner of scraps, besides occasional delicate morsels such as worms and fishes.

--------
303-> Tyndall's Alpine Experiences.
I remember Prof. Tyndall describing one highly critical situation in which he found himself on the occasion of a solitary ascent of Monte Rosa.

The field has been regularly opened to the public at 3 o'clock, however, and a chance afforded for watching the second half of the practice against the "college," or scrub, eleven. The following men, comprising the team and two first substitutes, have gone to a special training table at the New-Haven House: 
--------
460-> MAY BRING A NEW RECORD HOME; The Arrival of the American Line Steamship Paris Awaited with More than Ordinary Interest.
More than usual interest will attend the arrival of the American Line steamship Paris, now on her way from Southampton, and due to arrive to-morrow.

It was a bad day for the favorites at the Brighton Beach track yesterday. Intermission and Corn Cob being the only ones to land the money in the six races. 
--------
463-> THE NEW APPELLATE COURT.
Bench and bar have but tardily realized how important a change was effected in the judiciary system of the State by the creation of the new Appellate Division of the Supreme Court. It is practically a new court, with broader functions than the General Term, with larger powers of direction and review over the work of the other courts, and in dignity and authority approximating to the Court of Appeals. 
--------
464-> MADE THE HOUSES QUAKE; Gas in a Sewer Exploded at Worth and Centre Streets. BUILDINGS SHAKEN, BUT NO ONE HURT Window Panes Shattered and Saloon Glasses Thrown About -- Girls Badly Frightened in a Factory -- Firemen Called Out.
An explosion of accummulated gas in a sewer at Centre and Worth Streets about 5 o'clock yesterday afternoon blew the cover of a manhole about fifty feet into the air and shook buildings for five and six blocks in the neighborhood. The explosion sounded as if a tall building had collapsed. Fortunately no one was injured. 
--------
465-> THE PROVISIONAL ESTIMATES.
While the provisional estimates for next year's city budget show an increase of something more than $5,000,000 over the final appropriations for the present year, by far the greater part of it appears in items regarding which the Board of Estimate and Apportionment had no discretion and was therefore absolutely unavoidable. 
--------
466-> RIVERSIDES AGAIN WIN.; Secured First Prize for Third Season in Morris and Essex Bowling League.
ORANGE, N.J., March 10. -- The Morris and Essex Bowling League tournament has been won by the Riverside Athletic Club. It is the third consecutive year this club has carried off first prize. The Roseville Athletic Association team is second. The standing of the clubs is as follows: 
--------
467-> SAYS SHERMAN IS WRONG; Gen. Howard Carroll Refutes Statements as to Gen. Garfield. HE WAS ALWAYS TRUE TO HIS PLEDGE Did Not Seek the Nomination for the Presidency in 1880 and Repulsed His Friends Who Favord It.
Senator Sherman's "Recollections," which he has just embodied in book form, are causing some angry discussion in New-York, especially the parts of the book which deal with the nomination of Gen. Garfield for the Presidency at the convention held in Chicago in 1880, and with the position of Roscoe Conkling in the campaign which followed. 
--------
468-> ROUSED TO BITTER FIGHT; Eager Brooklynites Will Not Stand Consolidation's Defeat. MANY LETTERS TO MAYOR SCHIEREN Active Preparation to Rouse Public Feeling Which Shall Force the Passage of the Greater New-York Bill.

--------
469-> ADDICKS MAKES A DECIDED GAIN; One of the Higgins Men Gives Him a Vote for Senator.
DOVER, Del., April 20. -- Addicks was the gainer in to-day's Senatorial ballot, and his followers were highly elated. Once more six votes are placed in his column, and his claims are that the total will be still further increased when the final breakup of the Higgins forces occurs. To-day he corraled Representative Money, a hitherto Higgins man. 
--------
470-> OLD BILL SMITH IS DEAD; Known for Many Years as the Giant Hermit of the Adirondacks. FAITHFUL DOGS HIS ONLY COMPANIONS A Tumble-Down Hut on the "Oregon Plains" His Home for More than Forty Years -- His Sudden Death.

--------
471-> GERMANY AND DENMARK AT WAR; BITTER RIVALRY BETWEEN THEM FOR THE TRADE OF THE NORTH SEA. Why the Kiel Canal Was Constructed -- Copenhagen's Marvelous Growth -- Resources of the Danes.
The war of 1895 between Germany and Denmark is for money, not blood. How bitter this war is can hardly be appreciated except by those who have recently visited Hamburg and Kiel, which are at opposite ends of the Baltic and North Sea Canal, and Copenhagen, which, the Germans say, is destined to be injured, if not destroyed by the canal. 
--------
472-> The Mary Arden House.
A certain honest farmer, one R. Lane, of Wilmcote, near Stratford-on-Avon, asks me to notify as many Shakespeare enthusiasts as possible, that the old Mary Arden house, at Wilmcote, is now open to the public. As he is offering a convenience that will be much appreciated by Shakespeare pilgrims, I think you might run him a line in The Times. 
--------
473-> HARVARD'S HASTY PUDDING DAY; The Celebration of the One Hundredth Anniversary of the Club Characteristically Opened.
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 22. -- The Hasty Pudding Club of Harvard began the celebration of its one hundredth anniversary to-day. From 2 o'clock on, the clubhouse was open to members past and present. During the afternoon there was a band concert, and free beer was on tap. Many old "grads" were out to renew old times and drink from their dusty, half-forgotten beer mugs. 
--------
474-> FOR FIRING BIG MORTARS; Plan Whereby One Operator Can Command a Group. WAR MACHINE FOR HARBOR DEFENSE Major Hatfield of the Engineer Corps Explains the System -- Observer Out of Sight May Direct the Shower of Projectiles.
That maxim, "When in peace prepare for war," is nowhere better understood than among those who are charged with the maintaining of one and the making of the other. Officers of the military and naval branches of the Government service are alive to the materialness of efficient means of offense and defense. 
--------
475-> KNOCK-OUT DROPS, HANSEN SAYS; A Philadelphia Jeweler Found in Sorry Plight -- Money and Diamonds Gone.
A middle-aged man was found sitting on the curbstone on Broadway, between Thirteenth and Fourteenth Streets, early yesterday morning. He had no hat, and his coat was covered with mud. He could give no account of himself, and a policeman took him to the Mercer Street Police Station. 
--------
476-> THE FINANCIAL WORLD
Last Thursday morning an editorial in The Times directed attention to the fact that within ten days there had been a rise in the prices of wheat, cotton, and petroleum, that is, "in our chief article of food product, our chief raw material exported, and one of our chief manufactured exports." It was further pointed out that the advance in each had extended to the European markets. 
--------
477-> LORD ROSEBERY.
The report to which our London cable letter refers of the approaching retirement of Lord Rosebery may or may not be authentic. It derives its currency evidently from its intrinsic probability. Lord Rosebery's present physical condition may have influenced his determination, but it might well have proceeded from his chronic intellectual and social condition. 
--------
478-> BROOKLYN ALDERMAN ARRESTED; John F. Roeder Forgot to Pay His Saloon License Fee.
Alderman John F. Roeder of the Fifteenth Ward, Brooklyn, who on frequent occasions at the meetings of the Brooklyn Board of Aldermen has called down his associates for their loss of memory, had the tables turned on him yesterday by being arrested because he had forgotten something of importance to the Federal Government. 
--------
479-> HARVARD, 4; MICHIGAN, 0.; The Westerners Played a Strong Game on Slippery Grounds.
CAMBRIDCE, Mass., Nov. 9. -- Harvard defeated Michigan at football this afternoon on Soldier's Field by the score of 4 to 0. The ground was wet, and it rained during the greater part of the game. In spite of the inclement weather 4,000 persons witnessed the game. The playing was not so closely contested as the score would seem to indicate. 
--------
480-> OLEOMARGARINE FOR THE TEXAS; Mercantile Exchange Alleges Government Is Buying It and Protests to President and Cabinet.
The New-York Mercantile Exchange held a special meeting yesterday to consider the question of the use of oleomargarine in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. It is alleged by the members that a quantity of oleomargarine was found at a freight depot marked "For the U.S. Steamship Texas, Brooklyn, N. Y." It is a matter of general knowledge, they say, that considerable quantities of these goods have been used at the navy yard. 
--------
481-> SANDERSON ACADEMY DINNER; Prof. Charles Eliot Norton Says There Is No Such Thing as Popular Education in the United States.
ASHFIELD, Mass., Aug. 22. -- The sixteenth annual dinner in aid of Sanderson Academy was given to-day in the Town Hall. Hundreds drove in from the surrounding towns, and many came a much longer distance. 
--------
482-> HER POINT OF VIEW.
The public prints have been full for the past three years of accounts of the developments in the study of tuberculosis, and, in particular, of the demonstration beyond a doubt of its contagious character, and papers have been read before many audiences on the same subject, yet with startling distinctness there come constantly evidences of how little the leaven has really worked. 
--------
483-> MONMOUTH TRACK SOLD; Bought In by Representatives of the Withers's Estate. LITTLE BIDDING FOR THE PROPERTY The Sale Under Foreclosure Proceedings by Farmers' Loan and Trust Company -- Four Lots Fetch Only $72,000.
FREEHOLD, N.J., March 21. -- The Monmouth Park race track, with the hotel and other property connected with the track was sold to-day.

SUMMIT, N.J., Oct. 12. -- The Ladies' Benevolent Society of the Springfield Presbyterian Church held an interesting meeting on Thursday afternoon, when some instructive papers were read. 
--------
485-> THE BICYCLE FESTIVAL.
Undoubtedly the present meet of the League of American Wheelmen at Asbury Park is the most impressive, if not the most important, event in the history of cycling in this country. This is because 1895 is by far the most important year thus far in the history of what is sometimes, but not very accurately, called the "sport." 
--------
486-> THEY STICK TO DAVE MARTIN.
Philadelphia lags woefully behind in municipal reform. She stands about where New-York did in the days of the unbroken Tweed domination. But she gives small evidence of that moral vigor and independence of party that enabled this city to shake off Tweed and from time to time its subsequent oppressors. 
--------
487-> FIRST DELEGATES ARRIVE; Syracuse Prepared to Entertain the Democratic Hosts. BUT FEW CONTESTS ARE EXPECTED Many Counties Hold Conventions and Select State Delegates -- The Erie County Disputes Not Renewed.
SYRACUSE, Sept. 21. -- Syracuse will put on its gala attire for the Democratic State Convention.

--------
488-> Sixty-Mile Ice Gorge in the Ohio.
JEFFERSONVILLE, Ind., Feb. 7. -- The ice in the Ohio has stopped, forming a gorge sixty miles long. Two million bushels of coal are in danger of being sunk the minute the gorge moves. The temperature is 8 below zero. 
--------
489-> GOOD PICKEREL FISHING NOW; When and How They May Be Caught in This Immediate Neighborhood.
It is fortunate that with the fast failing bass and trout fishing in this vicinity those fishermen of this city who are willing to try for less exalted prey can still find some good sport. In fresh water the game this month is the pickerel, and in a score of ponds less than two hours' journey from New-York royal fun can be had from now on until the ice shuts in the water. 
--------
490-> COMMANDER BOOTH'S PLAN; Many Propositions for the Increase of Salvation Army Work. MORE PUBLIC MEETINGS NEEDED Advantages of the New Building -- How It May Be Paid For -- The Slum Brigade and What It May Accomplish.
Commander Ballington Booth of the Salvation Army has issued a manifesto to his command, in which he makes many propositions, that, if adopted, will affect every department of the work in which the Army is engaged. 
--------
491-> The Manx Shearwater.

--------
494-> Deaths Caused by Gasoline.
Gasoline has cost four lives in Chicago within twenty-four hours. Four or five other persons have been badly burned. From Denver comes the report of the severe, perhaps fatal, burning of three women by the same agent. 
--------
495-> PLATT MEN WERE GUARDED; Warded Off Trouble at the County Committee Meeting. GEN. M'COOK READY FOR A FIGHT No Opportunity Arose, However -- Cold Shoulder for Milholland and His Late Associates Who Seek Recognition.
The volcano which is smoldering in the local Republican organization gave out a little extra smoke at the County Committee meeting last night, but there was no violent eruption. This was due in part to the precautions taken by the Platt men to avoid trouble. 
--------

WASHINGTON, March 21. -- Senior Muruaga, the Spanish Minister, is attesting to the accuracy of the statements in these dispatches that his career in Washington is drawing to a close by first denying, and then affirming, a report that he had resigned his position. A Madrid dispatch received here to-night said that Muruaga had tendered his resignation because of adverse criticisms in Havana papers, and that his Government had refused to accept it. 
--------
499-> FOX SHARK TAKEN IN SAN FRANCISCO BAY; Three Italian Fishermen Capture Him After a Hard Fight.
The Italian settlement at the foot of Franklin Street, Oakland, was agitated Wednesday morning by the capture of another monster of the deep.

LONDON, Feb. 19. -- In an interview with a reporter for the United Press to-day Mr. A.

--------
504-> BOTHERED BY ROUGH WATER.; But Columbia and Pennsylvania Crews Had Lots of Practice.
POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y., June 11. -- The water was fairly smooth this morning and the Columbia 'Varsity crew took full advantage of it and did not stop rowing until 12 o'clock. The Columbia oarsmen, both the freshmen and 'Varsity crews, are doing more work than the Quakers. If keeping everlastingly at it is merit, they ought to win the triangular race. 
--------
505-> LIVELY CONVENTION THIS; Republicans Nominate for the Supreme Court in the Second District. A FIGHT AGAINST HUGO HIRSH But Sheriff Buttling's Candidate Won -- The Other Nominees Col. W. B. Dickey and Judge Wilmot F. Smith.

506-> NOT ALLOWED TO SEE THE SULTAN.; A Request of the American Admiral Refused.
ROME, Dec. 1. -- A semi-official telegram from Constantinople says that the American Admiral, who is now at Smyrna, recently asked permission to visit the Sultan on board his flagship. The request was refused. 
--------
507-> Editorial Article 1 -- No Title
What a blessing and comfort the sheltered stations of the underground railway will be to the people of New-York! On the exposed platforms of the elevated roads they shiver, shake, turn blue, congeal, get chills, congestions, and rheumatism. There pneumonia stalks at noonday and dances with fiendish glee in the night time at the rich harvest of those wind-swept eminences. 
--------
508-> IN THE REAL ESTATE FIELD; Officers Chosen by the Exchange Directors -- Sales at Auction -- List of Offering for To-day.
Mr. Louis Wirth has bought the southeast corner of Fifth Avenue and One Hundred and Thirty-third Street, 75 by 135. It will be improved. 
--------
509-> THEIR AIM IS TO MISLEAD.
We have noticed recently in many of our Republican exchanges a tabular statement designed to show that the imports have been very much larger in the first year of the new tariff than they were under the McKinley tariff. This tabular statement appears to have been prepared in Washington by a McKinley "news bureau." 
--------
510-> LAVIGNE IS A CHAMPION.; Defeated Walcott in a Fifteen-Round Contest at Maspeth.
MASPETH, L.I., Dec. 2. -- "Joe" Walcott, O'Rourke's colored protege, and George Lavigne sparred before the Empire Athletic Club to-night.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 22. -- Although the outlook for currency legislation is not bright, individual Senators say they have not yet given up hope of such legislation, and that their efforts will be directed to the passage of some bill designed to relieve the Treasury.

MORRISTOWN, N.J., May 22. -- The Sahodalica Wheelmen had beautiful weather for their club road races to-day, but, owing to the "cakey" condition of the thoroughfares, occasioned by the rain of yesterday, the events were postponed until Friday. There will be two races, a five-mile run for novices and a handicap at the same distance, and pretty much all of Morristown will be out to cheer the winners, the weather favoring. 
--------
520-> "BILLY" FOWLER.

SING SING, N.Y., Aug. 13. -- A more delightful day for celebrating Children's Day in the Sing Sing Methodist Episcopal Camp Meeting could not have been desired than was had to-day.

--------
531-> READY FOR THE REGATTAS; Colonia and Vigilant May Meet in the Atlantic's Race. RUSHING WORK ON THE VIGILANT Hudson River Yachts to Race To-Day -- Four Events Scheduled for Next Saturday -- Brooklyn Club's Race Day.

--------
532-> A SERUM REMEDY FOR SMALLPOX?
We published two or three weeks ago the reports submitted to the Marine Hospital Bureau by Dr. Kinyoun concerning the use of the blood-serum remedy for diphtheria in Paris and Berlin, where he had pursued his investigations for three months.

--------
535-> THE HARRIS MURDER.
It seems strange that a week should have elapsed since the murder of the colored man Harris without the discovery of any clue tangible or promising enough to justify the police in holding any suspected person in custody. There have been several arrests, but every arrested person has been able to dispel the suspicion that attached to him.

Waring and his determined corps of assistants, the streets of New-York will never remain clean unless we good citizens of Manhattan do our part in aiding him.

541-> Wretched London Houses.
Houses are taken for their neighborhood, or their address, or for their pretty finish in the newest style.

It is not yet perceived that the majority of London houses are unfit to live in, quite apart from their defective drainage.

The first feeling of those who went to Poughkeepsie on Friday to see a boat race, and saw only a shell broken by the wash of a steamer, or, rather, of those who have read the accounts of the business, must be one of indignation against the boorish fool who brought about this lamentable result, and a desire to have him properly punished.

--------
694-> THE FINANCIAL WORLD
If it had not been for Chicago Gas, we might have shut up shop for all the market did certain days last week. Trading was horribly dull, and if prices have much more decline before the next big upward movement, it will certainly be mainly because holders of stocks get disgusted with waiting, and throw over their holdings. 
--------
695-> YALE'S INDOOR GAMES.; Hickok Put the Shot 46 Feet, but It Was Not Allowed.
NEW-HAVEN, Conn., March 22. -- The annual Yale indoor games were held to-night and attracted about 600 spectators.

NEW-LONDON, Conn., July 13. -- The easterly weather, that brought with it great banks of fog about the time the Summer hotels opened here, continued until this week, and deprived seaside residents of a great deal of pleasure.

--------
701-> THE ALASKA BOUNDARY LINE.
The inherent difficulties in tracing the boundary between British Columbia and Alaska, and marking it by posts or other visible bounds, would be enormous were there only physical obstacles to be overcome. But when, in addition, there exist radical differences in the interpretation of the treaty of 1825, made by Russia and Great Britain, from which our own territorial rights are derived, these obstacles become still graver. 
--------

--------
704-> EXTIRPATING HERESY.
The Presbyterian General Assembly has now completed the sequel of the Briggs trial by instructing the Presbytery of New-York not to receive or examine candidates for its ministry who have pursued or who mean to pursue their studies at the Union Theological Seminary. This is not altogether consistent, since the Assembly has already continued on its missionary boards men who had displayed offensive partisanship by supporting Dr. Briggs in his contumacy. 
--------

716-> NATIONAL GUARD NOTES
It was hoped General Headquarters of New-York would make an allowance of ammunition for revolver practice to officers, in order that they could properly perfect themselves in the use of this weapon, with which they have recently been supplied. General Headquarters has, however, refused to supply the needed ammunition, so revolver practice will hardly become a feature of instruction and competition at present.

--------
720-> THE CITY'S CYCLING STREETS.; Best Routes for Wheelmen -- Demand for Asphalt Pavements.
The only thing lacking to make the metropolis the greatest cycling city In the world is more and better asphalt and macadam streets. With anything like a direct route, suitably paved, on the west side, and another through the busier east side, thousands of clerks and others employed in the down-town districts would forsake the "L" and the cable as a means of transit for the more enjoyable bicycle. 
--------
721-> POMONA'S ELECTRIC PLANT; Power Brought from San Antonio Canon, Thirty Miles Away. THE FIRST LONG COMMERCIAL LINE When the Plant Was Installed, in 1891, Little Practical Work Had Been Done in This Direction -- Its Success.

CINCINNATI, Ohio, Nov. 23. -- According to most authorities, the Ohio River is a steady-going, reputable stream, free from many of the perversities which distinguish the Mississippi or the Missouri.

W.W. Whitney, had been dismissed for failure to print the record.

NEW-ORLEANS, La., March 11. -- To-day prize fighting again received encouragement from the New-Orleans judiciary.

ASBURY PARK, N.J., Nov. 11. -- The position of the Irrawaddy, which went ashore here in the fog of Saturday afternoon, remains unchanged.

Haddon Chambers is the most disappointing of all the contemporary English playmakers. Sydney Grundy does not surpass him in this respect.

It was expected that the Republican County Committee, at its meeting in the Johnston Building, Flatbush Avenue and Nevins Street, Brooklyn, last night, would have a jollification meeting over the recent election, but, strange to relate, they had a fight, and one that promises to become more bitter as time passes. 
--------

Hayward was at that time (1856) in the full swing of his society success, and quite a power in the London world. These were the days of dowagers. Viscount Palmerston was Premier, and old Lady Palmerston was a queen of society. 
--------
930-> SOUND MONEY IN KENTUCKY.
There are three candidates for the United States Senate in Kentucky. One of them, Senator Blackburn, supports the unlimited and independent coinage of silver at 16 to 1. Another of them, Congressman McCreary, does not go so far as this, but seems to think that it would be safe and wise to compromise by purchasing and coining silver. 
--------
931-> The Indiana Read for Transfer.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 12. -- The battleship Indiana, now at the Cramps' shipyard, Philadelphia, is ready for transfer to the Government by the contractors.

--------
940-> THE CARLYLE MEMORIAL.
The American committee for the purchase and preservation of Carlyle's house, in Chelsea, appeals for subscriptions to enable it to fulfill the purpose of its existence. It was tasteful and fitting of the English committee appointed for the same purpose to recognize that Carlyle belongs not to the British Islands, but to the English-reading world, and that readers of English throughout the world are its proper custodians. 
--------
941-> STATE CHARITIES AND POLITICS.
This State has acquired an honorable record in recent years of keeping the management of its public charities free from partisan control, but it looks as though the present Legislature was disposed to insert the political wedge into the charitable institutions, with a view to finding place for "spoils" again. 
--------

There is to be a hearing to-day on the bill to reorganize the school system of this city, before the Senate Committee on Cities, at Albany, and the officers of the various associations of teachers have signed a supplementary protest against the bill, ostensibly as a rejoinder to the reply of the Sub-Committee of Five of the Committee of Seventy to their first objections.

Man may talk to nature, which is, like him, a captive; like him, hungry for light and air; to the brook which would drink the sky, to stones which would move, to flowers whose crowns are avid lips.

TUESDAY -- P.M. Further weakness in the foreign exchange market was the interesting feature of the day. Rates are now well below the normal gold-shipping point, and, as the supply of bills in the market has increased to an amount sufficient to meet all ordinary demands for a fortnight, it may fairly be said that the outward movement of gold has ceased for the year. 
--------

--------
1014-> VOTE FOR CANAL IMPROVEMENT; An Appeal to Electors in Behalf of This Momentous Proposition.

--------
1023-> This Is Peculiar Snow.
ELVA, Ky., Jan. 12. -- When people in this locality arose this morning they found the ground covered with two inches of white snow, and this covered with a yellow-tinted stuff that would turn water inky black. There is no explanation of the phenomenon, and an analysis has been undertaken.

--------
1028-> WAR TIMES IN GEORGIA; LIFE IN DIXIE. During the War. By Mary A.H. Gray. Atlanta, Ga.: The Foote & Davis Company.
Joel Chandler Harris's brief introduction to Miss Gray's reminiscences of the civil war tell of the authenticity of this simple story, and how a book of this character is of that kind from whence "history will get its supplies." The dark days are described with absolute fidelity, and that is a quality we may look for in vain "in more elaborate and ambitious publications." 
--------
1029-> How Rochester Sees It.
THE NEW-YORK TIMES of yesterday contains a two and a half column letter from its special correspondent detailed to spend last Sunday in the little village of Herkimer, with a population of 4,000, overlooking which, on the top of a high hill, is the residence of Mr. Warner Miller, the champion of "maintenance of Sunday laws in the interest of labor and morality."

Miss Odette Tyler, well known and highly esteemed on the dramatic stage, has written a novel, and here it is. It is quite as good as most novels that are printed. It is a story of Southern life. The Colonel -- that everlasting Colonel, who is in every Southern novel or story -- is here as large as life. He drinks mint julep, has no sense of humor, but has fine ideas of honor. 
--------
1034-> COST OF CLEARING OFF THE SNOW; The City Would Have to Pay $4,000,000, Commissioner Waring Says -- Uptown Streets.

--------

WASHINGTON, Sept. 4. -- Solicitor Reeve of the Treasury has decided that the transfer of an employe of a firm doing business abroad to the American branch of the concern is a violation of the alien contract labor law.

--------
1041-> A Bowl of Kava.
Kava is the native drink, and its use and the manner and ceremony of its preparation being among the most ancient customs of Polynesia, it merits, I think, a short description. Kava is an indigenous tree, more or less plentiful throughout the South Sea Islands, the root of which is employed in the manufacture of the drink. 
--------

Queen Anne will have much to answer for if she is held accountable for all of the architectural abominations that have been erected in her name.

The race in which the judges were unable to separate the horses was the fourth event, a dash of five and one-half furlongs for two-yar-olds. Crimea, on her good performance on the preceding day, was an even-money favorite, with Yankee Doodle a heavily backed second choice. 
--------
1055-> THE ABUSED NIGHT AIR.; It Is Not Man's Enemy, but Warns Him of Lurking Danger.
A great deal of solemn nonsense has been talked and written about the "night air." Except that it is cooler, it is just like the day air. If it makes a man shiver and cough, he ought to be thankful, and not find fault. Nature is polite. She never strikes without warning, and the cough and chill are precautionary signals. 
--------
1056-> DR. LYMAN ABBOTT RETURNS; His Opinion of the Cause of the Defeat of the English Liberals -- Englishmen as Socialists.
The Rev. Dr. Lyman Abbott arrived from Europe on the steamship Spree Wednesday night, and yesterday morning started for his country home at Cornwall-on-the-Hudson.

--------
1057-> ANOTHER HEAVY DAY IN STOCKS; Bears Were Pleased to Speak of a Reaction, but Its Effect Was Slight -- The Strength of the Market.
The security market yesterday developed what the bears were pleased to call a reaction. This characterization did not displease those who believe that a bull market is at hand, for the decline averaged only fractions, after advances running into high units and tens. Any comfort to be derived from such a process of settling values was so far from being begrudged that it was extended smilingly. 
--------
1058-> A Lucky Maine Fur Dealer.
Most of you have read quotations of silver-fox skins and black-fox skins, but did you ever see one? The chances are that if you are not in the fur business you never did. Only 139 were taken in the whole world last season, and every year all of these go to Russia, where they are the fur of the royalty and the nobility. 
--------
1059-> THE WALLER CASE.
The State Department has not been aroused any too soon to the importance and the urgency of the case of ex-Consul Waller, an American citizen, condemned by a French court-martial to imprisonment for twenty years.

--------
1061-> Liberty of Costume.
An absurd idea has come into bloom, our colleagues say, in the mind of the Police Prefect -- the idea of regulating the costume of women who ride on bicycles -- or wish to look as if they did! Not that the idea is to select administratively the skirt dear to Americans or the trousers that are less dangerous to riders; true bicyclists would retain freedom in their preferences. 
--------
1062-> CORNELL'S MANY INTERESTS.; The New Psychological Laboratory -- A New Entrance to the Campus.
ITHACA, N.Y., Nov. 24. -- Early in the Summer the Board of Trustees decided to transfer the psychological laboratory from its old quarters in White Hall to the more spacious fourth floor of Morrill Hall.

" I am in too much grief to talk. What can I say? The work of half my lifetime, very nearly; all my mechanical instruments and scientific apparatus, that it has taken years to perfect, swept away in a fire that lasted only an hour or two. How can I estimate the loss in mere dollars and cents? Everything is gone. I must begin over again." 
--------
1067-> NEW-JERSEY'S FOREST FIRES; They Are Still Burning in the Vicinity of Egg Harbor City, Destroying Much Valuable Property.
EGG HARBOR CITY, Sept. 14. -- The forest fires are still raging in the vicinity of this place, but there has not been as much headway made by the flames as was feared last night, owing to the heoric efforts of the volunteers in fighting them.

--------
1367-> ENFORCING THE COPYRIGHT LAW; Excellent Work Done by the Post Office Authorities of Montreal.

--------
1374-> ALWAYS MISTRUSTED DREYFULS; How His Superiors Treated Him and How His Treason Was Disclosed.
The Paris correspondent of the Pall Mall Gazette declares that there can be no doubt about the guilt of Capt. Dreyfus. It seems that the man has never been a persona grata with his superiors, and that he never had any friends among his comrades; in fact, the only friendly laison he had formed was with a young actor, son of a celebrated ex-Societaire of the Comedie Francaise, (M. Jean Coquelin.) 
--------
1375-> A VACANCY MADE BY SHARP PRACTICE.
Judge HATCH of the Superior Court of Buffalo succeeded in providing a vacancy on the bench of the Supreme Court in the Eighth Judicial District for Gov.

1376-> HULL HOUSE WORK IN CHICAGO; HULL HOUSE MAPS AND PAPERS. A Presentation of Nationalities and Wages in a Congested District of Chicago. By Residents of Hull House. 8vo. New-York: Thomas Y. Crowell & Co. $2.50.
" Hull House," the Chicago variant of that movement which here resulted in the University Settlement, has now been in existence for six years. Its members, or, as they are called, its "residents," have tried the effect of personal association with that part of Chicago's population among whom wages are lowest, and where the vice which grows from poverty is most pronounced. 
--------

NEW-BRIGHTON, S.I., Dec. 15. -- The Richmond County Police force, which last Summer became affected by a sudden outbreak of zeal on the part of the heads of the department, and became famous a few weeks ago by arresting golf players on the grounds of the Richmond County Country Club, won fresh laurels in this direction today by making an arrest because electric cars were being drawn through the public streets.

--------
1379-> TO SEPARATE "CHARITIES AND CORRECTION."
The mere statement that on the 1st of January the separate departments of "Charities" and of "Correction" are to take the place of the old Department of "Charities and Correction" gives little idea of the full plan for simplifying the public service in relation to those branches, especially if we take into account that feature of it which contemplates turning over to the State the care of the insane. 
--------
1380-> EVILS OF THE EMPLOYMENT BUREAU; An Interesting Address Before the Orange Improvement Society.
ORANGE, N.J., May 25. -- The servant-girl problem is still being discussed with animation here, especially in view of the proposed establishment of a training school for domestics, as suggested by Mrs. Louis D.

--------
1383-> THE FINANCIAL WORLD
As an object of public attention the stock market has had to take second place the past week to the grain markets. July wheat over 81 cents at Chicago Thursday morning, with the whole West wildly trading in it, was a spectacle to wonder at.

--------
1391-> LIEUT. MOSES MAY FARE WORSE; Out of the Forney Smoke and Pushcart Inquiry May Come for Him a Bedstead Court-Martial.
Courts-of-inquiry indications, like signs in dry weather, frequently fail. It was thought yesterday and the day before that the Forney court of inquiry, now in session at the New-York Navy Yard, would have finished its labors on those respective days; but new witnesses were introduced by the prosecution and new testimony brought forward by Lawyer Stayton in rebuttal, and so the case has dragged to an unexpected length. 
--------
1392-> NEWFOUNDLAND'S COLONIAL SECRETARY; On a Mission to the United States -- Criticises Dominion Government.
MONTREAL, May 25. -- Robert Bond, Colonial Secretary of Newfoundland, says, regarding his mission to the States, that he cannot give details, but believes he will ultimately be successful in raising a loan.

1395-> SOME OF THE GOWNS SEEN.; The Duchess of Marlborough Wears Black Velvet and Lace.
The belles and beaus and matrons did not turn out in particularly large numbers yesterday afternoon at the Horse Show, and the attendance last evening was by no means as large as on Wednesday night.

Assemblyman Pavey of the Eleventh District, whom The Times has found opportunity to commend for intelligent and independent speech and action upon measures in which this city is deeply interested, would have been wiser if he had refrained from undertaking to instruct the President and the Secretary of State to "insure to the citizens and soldiers of Cuba the rights of belligerents under the rules of modern warfare."

HOBOKEN, N.J., May 3. -- The Rev. Adolph Gurschko of St. Matthew's Evangelical Lutheran Church caused the arrest of Charles Baumann of 154 Clinton Avenue last night. The pastor said Baumann was annoying him, and that he used a German expression, which meant, he thought, a threat to do him harm.

WASHINGTON, April 24. -- People who derive their knowledge of this town from magazine articles which deal chiefly with its praiseworthy features ought to know that there is a reverse side to the picture ordinarily presented.

The hardships which the Lenten fast imposes upon good church people in this country would fall very lightly upon the adherents of the Greek, Armenian, Coptic, and Abyssinian Churches in Palestine.

Mr. Howells declares in his new book that "the adoration which a young writer has for a great one is truly a passion surpassing the love of women."
