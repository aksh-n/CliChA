602-> MORE RUSSIAN PICTURES.; "The Fall of the Romanoffs" at the Broadway Theatre.
It was to be expected, of course, that the revolution in Russia would appeal strongly to the imaginations of the movie makers, and the second picture purporting to show the events which led up to it began a two weeks' engagement at the Broadway Theatre yesterday. "The Fall of the Romanoffs," like "Rasputin, the black Monk," is concerned largely with the life and misdeeds of Rasputin and his influence on the court. Whatever Rasputin's responsibility for the revolution in history, there is no doubt that his dramatic career lends itself excellently to the purposes and requirements of the movie director.Herbert Brenon, who produced "The Fall of the Romanoffs," quotes from various authorities from time to time to justify the insertion of several highly colorded episodes. Although many of these episodes savor rather strongly of the screen, the general effect is one of great realism, and the film as a whole is grippingly interesting. Even the allegorical scenes, strangely enough, are not without interest.The character of Rasputin is well drawn and well acted, and a lifelike figure of the ex-Czar also moves through the picture. Considerable use is also made of Sergius Trufanoff, who, as Father Iliodor, figured several times in Russian revolutionary news. Trufanoff, of course, portrays himself in the film, and is also said to havé been the authority for much of the story.Madge Kennedy made her first screen appearance at the Strand Theatre in the second of the Goldwyn films, a picturization of "Baby Mine." The picture has several hilarious moments, but its story is rather thin for screen purposes and requires a considerable amount of padding to make it the requisite length. Miss Kennedy, of course, is Zoie, the part created on the stage by Marguerite Clark, and takes to the screen quite naturally. John Cumberland, who played with Miss Kennedy in "Fair and Warmer," is another who makes his film début in the picture."Fools for Luck," with Taylor Holmes in the leading rôle, is the week's attraction at the Rialto.
