707-> Screen: 'Target Zero'; Korean Conflict Story Misses the Mark
IT took a slight stretch of plausibility to get a tooth-some and tight-sweatered blonde mixed up with a squad of American soldiers on a dangerous Korean war patrol. But the fellows who made "Target Zero," a Warner drama which came to the Paramount yesterday, have casually arranged the conjunction. They are responsible for what happens from this point on.Briefly, what happens is that the soldiers—an assortment of studied stereotypes, including three members of a British tank crew, who are also picked up along the way—push through to an isolated outpost where the remnants of their company are supposedly pinned, stopping at frequent intervals to make speeches to one another and eye the blonde. When they finally reach the outpost, they find all the company killed, but their own lieutenant—a devoted company-lover — finds something to take its place. Guess what—or who.Aside from the vague improbability of a courtship being carried on in foxholes, observation outposts and the deck of a moving tank, there are certain little things about this picture that cause it to ring a trifle untrue. One is the stubborn disposition of the characters to spout elaborate talk. Another is the easy, wholesale slaughter of North Koreans with which it is closed. And yet another is the mock heroic acting of Richard Conte, Peggie Castle and all hands.That sanguinary business in Korea was unquestionably grim and wearying. But it certainly was not wearying in the way that it is made to be in this film. The CastTARGET ZERO, screen play by Sam Rolfe, from a story by James Warner Bellah; produced by David Weisbart and directed by Harmon Jones for Warner Brothers. At the Paramount.Lieut.

789-> The Screen: Detoured; Double Bill Is Shown at Loew's Theatres
LOEW'S neighborhood theatres showed yesterday a new double-bill program in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's "Many Rivers to Cross"" and Columbia's "Pirates of Tripoli." A good look should tell any spectator why both detoured the first-run showcases in Manhattan.The first, made about the time of "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers," is as inane, raucous and clumsy an attempt at Western satire as has snaked out of the Hollywood brush in a long time. Photographed in color and CinemaScope, for no discernible reason, it co-stars Eleanor Parker and Robert Taylor. The story tells how a husband-craving tomboy of the Kentucky frontier literally exhausts a bold frontiersman into marriage and, after what seems years later, true love.The heavy-handed writing, directing and acting, especially that of Miss Parker and Victor McLaglen, as a hillbilly patriarch, all but nudges the customer into the aisle, in poking fun at buckskin horseplay, shotgun weddings and, as a climax, Shawnee warfare.James Arness and Rosemary DeCamp are effective in the picture's one thoughtful interlude, and Mr. Taylor looks miserable about the whole dismal cartoon.At least "Pirates of Tripoli" makes no pretenses, being a standard color salute to sixteenth-century swashbuckling, with pretty maidens, evil courtiers and lusty pirates thronging the usual overthrown kingdom. As a booted princess who enlists Mr. Henreid's band of rogues to oust suave John Miljan, Patricia Medina sets a wide-eyed, predictable pace. One or two of the sea battles, pasted against stock footage, are quite rousing. But the picture remains a pitiful throwback to the good old days of Douglas Fairbanks.

848-> The Screen in Review; 'Prince of Players' Bows at the Rivoli
THERE were no people like show people, even in the mid-nineteenth century, according to "Prince of Players." which came yesterday to the Rivoli.This booming and sentimental picture of the early career of Edwin Booth, the distinguished Shakespearean actor whose own life was a detailed tragedy, is, indeed, as much an appreciation of the strolling player in a plush, romantic age as it is a warm regard for one man's valor. And it is as such that it probably will be most enjoyed.For Moss Hart and Philip Dunne, who fetched it rather freely from Elizabeth Ruggles' book about the "mad Booths" of the nineteenth-century theatre, have got the most entertainment on the screen when they are filling the Cinema-Scope panel with lush description of old-time acting on the fustian-laden stage.Their film is at its best when it is showing Edwin's father, Junius Brutus Booth, played by Raymond Massey, howling the tormented lines of "King Lear" at a seething New Orleans audience, or when it is picturing Edwin going on in "Richard III" in place of his old, exhausted father before a mob of miners in the California hills.It is in the scenes of the picture wherein the "madness" of the Booths is visualized in bursts of tempestuous intemperance and thundering soliloquies that the nature of the old-time troupers' theatre is colorfully and excitingly recalled and the pathos and irony of the characters is conveyed most movingly. And it is in these scenes that Richard Burton is most impressive as Edwin Booth.For the fact is that the further endeavor to develop a tender personal romance between Edwin and a young lady of his acting company is mildly and conventionally contrived. In its performance neither Mr. Burton nor Maggie McNamara as the young lady are too happily inspired. Indeed, the bland Miss McNamara is almost pallid in the ornate surrounding frame, and the romance seems a milk-end-water cliché in the actor's extravagant career. It lacks the heat and conviction of the theatrical activity.However, the burst of excitement that comes with the horrible, bloody deed of Booth's wayward brother, John Wilkes, in which he assassinates President Lincoln in Ford's Theatre, yanks the picture right put of the wallow into which it has aimlessly got. It sets up a plush, heroic climax on which to take leave of Edwin's strange career. This most mad and dramatic incident in the whole tragic story of the Booths has been staged by Mr. Dunne with vivid clarity and historical accuracy, and John Derek's playacting as John Wilkes is aptly flashy and grandiloquent.Charles Bickford as Booth's life-long manager. Elizabeth Sellars as the strange sister, Asia Booth, and Eva Le Gallienne as the Queen in a scene from "Hamlet" add splashes of moderate color here and there.But it is when Mr. Massey and Mr. Burton are chewing the scenery that "Prince of Players" has a hefty, regal air. Then it does justice to a figure who looms larger in his biography than he does in this film.

1450-> At the Stanley
BILLED outside the Stanley Theatre as Russia's "East of Eden," which it isn't, "The Land" has one distinct advantage: simple clarity. As direct as the other is obtuse, this Kiev Studios production somberly recounts a Cain and Abel folk tragedy, supposedly true, and set in a Bucharinian farm village in 1864.Although the picture attains real emotional power toward the end, as greed provokes murder, not until mid-point do the incidents begin to balance the excellent color photography. Even with a generally uncluttered story line and sturdy performances by the six principals, it is the radiantly-caught rusticity of the backgrounds that most effectively underscores the theme, the deep-rooted peasant love of land.Furthermore, after the protagonists, including the antithetical brothers, their two mistresses and parents, are introduced, all six are shuffled around rather aimlessly. Whether this represents skittish directing, writing or even editing is not easy to say. However, this portion also widens to show how the good son undergoes incredibly brutal Army training under the Bolsheviks. And here, Artkino, the distributors, should have applied a sickle to the footage.With the recruit back home, though, the action slips into steady gear, under directors A. Buchma and A. Shvachko. The anguish, irony and subsequent tragedy of a house divided are conveyed squarely by the performers, and the picture concludes with its sole note of optimism.S. Feshenko plays the victim; P. Grubnik, his murderer brother; V. Bespolyotova, his gypsy mistress; V. Sokirko, the father. But N. Uzhvy, who played another unforgettable mother in "The Rainbow"; T. Alexeyeva, her would-be daughter-in-law, and the scenery itself walk off with an interesting but undistinguished import. THE LAND, screen play by A. Shvachko; directed by A. Buchma and A.
