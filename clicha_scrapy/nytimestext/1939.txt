104-> THE SCREEN IN REVIEW; Romance Item: 'When Tomorrow Comes,' With Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne, Shown at the Rivoli--'Island of Lost Men' Offered at Loew's Criterion
Universal's "When Tomorrow Comes," which was met by a solid phalanx of women at the Rivoli yesterday, is the rather somnolently told romance of a waitress, who was obviously meant for better things, and a world-famous pianist who sat before her one day and demanded American cheese without the apple pie when, as every one knew, the required dessert for Luncheon No. 4 was apple pie with American cheese. This is the facetious beginning of a tale which includes in its telling some passing mention of a strike, a hurricane and the pianist's deranged wife. It is the kind of tale made possible, but not excused, by the willingness of Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne to attempt to repeat, for the matinee trade, the type of star-crossed romance more happily expressed a few months back in "Love Affair."Hollywood, like any mental laggard, seems unable to understand that spontaneity is almost the first requirement of a picture, that almost nothing operates more deadeningly than the opportunist system of recalling the starring team of one of these spontaneous hits, hiring a writer to turn out a script along the lines of such-and-such and inviting a director to produce a second so-and-so. Mr. Boyer, with the charm that has made him one of our few authentic matinee idols, and Miss Dunne, always a pleasant and sincere performer, are unequal to the task of bringing life and conviction to James Cain's made-to-order script. Director John Stahl, a notorious softy, is no match for it himself. With due deference to the ardent ladies who come to warm themselves before the glowing Mr. Boyer yesterday, the drama they saw was tosh.It is a story of transparent fortuitousness. To free the waitress from her tray-carting duties, there is a strike. To provide the last touch of intimacy to her Long Island rendezvous with the pianist, there is a hurricane which isolates them in a church's organ loft. To present the one, unlooked-for barrier to their love, there is not merely the wife (for that is no real obstacle at all), but a wife who had become crazed when her child was still-born. To complete his cycle, Mr. Cain need only have killed off the wife either in the strike or in the hurricane. That he did not is a small point to his credit and one, we do not doubt, which will be held against him by 90 per cent of the film's feminine patrons. After all, if it must be tosh, why not a complete job of it? WHEN TOMORROW COMES, screen play by Dwight Taylor based on a story by James M. Cain: directed and produced by John M. Stahl for Universal.

Greta MeyerWhen there isn't a thing but scraps and oddments left in the cupboard, a thrifty housewife thinks of hash, and the boys in the Paramount script department, in similar intellectual emergencies, all look around at J. Carrol Naish with expressions much like those with which hungry derelicts adrift in a lifeboat contemplate the plumpest member of the party. This is probably what has given to Mr. Naish that hunted look he always wears, a look not so much fearful as fatalistic, although, of course, it may be merely a result of the sort of menacing roles he is continually being called upon to play.The kindliest thing one can say for "Island of Lost Men," at Loew's Criterion, is to point out that it is another Naish, only this time with a slant to Mr. Naish's villainous eyes, which, on the whole, is even more improbable than the one given to the story. In fact, the whole adventure smacks amusingly of a burlesque on the portentous "Sanders of the River" theme, with Mr. Naish playing a wicked exploiter of hunted men in a jungle setting which suggests that if the camera were swung no more than a frame or so to either side it would reveal a filling station, or a roadside food dispensary in the shape of a hot dog. Not to mention a couple of script writers, laughing up the sleeves of their respective sport shirts. At Loew's CriterionISLAND OF LOST MEN, screen play by William R. Lipman and Horace McCoy, based on a play by Norman Reilly Raine and Frank Butler; directed by Kurt Neumann for Paramount.

Thankful as we ever are for small favors, we must acknowledge our indebtedness to the Palace's "Sorority House" for a new word, dreep. It would be listed in the dictionary thus: "Dreep, n., colloq. A combination of dreary and weep; used to designate female students at Talbot University who have not been elected to membership in any of the sororities."Anne Shirley, fearful of becoming a dreep, (the fate worse than death), was mortified when her father, a humble grocer, called at the Gamma house on pledge night; but she recovered in time, proudly tore up the sorority bid and decided the Gammas were snobs anyway. Hoisting RKO by its own petard, "Sorority House" is a dreep.

445-> THE SCREEN; Fox Salutes the CAA in '20,000 Men a Year' at the Roxy--Dead End Kids on Parade at the Strand At the Strand At 86th Street Casino At the Teatro Hispano
Never more than a sleeper jump behind the times, the screen has hurried around to the Roxy with a melodramatic salute to the aviation training program instituted not so long ago by the Civil Aeronautics Authority. "20,000 Men a Year," which is a statistical reference to the number of civil pilots the CAA hopes to be turning out, is pat both as to title and in its reply to the worried Midwestern school teacher who tells the college flying instructor she has no objection to planes but thinks her kid brother is too young to be learning to fly one.The answer to that, in the customarily-suspect logic of the aviation melodrama, is the creation of a situation in which the kid brother has to fly a plane out of a mountain canyon and bring it down safely, in spite of its damaged landing gear, with the injured instructor and unconscious student pilot aboard. That, of course, convinces the school marm of her error, but wouldn't everyone have been just as happy if the CAA had never come to the campus and there had been no first crack-up to bring on the need for a mercy flight? (Just a rhetorical question, naturally.)At any rate the film has its moments, especially those involving Maxie Rosenbloom as the mechanic with a vacuum where his brain ought to be. The flying sequences are exciting to watch and Randolph Scott, Preston Foster, Robert Shaw, Margaret Lindsay and George Ernest have played it competently enough. That seems to entitle it to a rating of "fair" and a pair of wings from the CAA. 20,000 MEN A YEAR, screen play by Lou Breslow and Owen Francis from a story by Frank Wead; directed by Alfred E. Green; produced by Sol. M. Wurtzel for Twentieth Century-Fox. At the Roxy.Brad Reynolds . . . . . Randolph ScottJim Howell . . . . . Preston FosterAnn Rogers . . . . .

Edward GarganJoe Hungerford . . . . . Harry TylerIrving Glassman . . . . . Sidney MillerChief Pilot Lawson . . . . . Edwin StanleyIt is a steadying thought, in these days of qualified national emergency, to know that Warner Brothers are in such a splendid state of preparedness. In thrifty anticipation of some possible future crisis, they have sent the "Dead End Kids" off to military school and have watched them come marching back again—soldiers, from their bootstraps to the quivering brushes of their shakos. Six months ago, when the boys were still simmering down in Hell's Kitchen, there might have been some doubt of their attitude toward the patriotic platitudes of "Dress Parade," at the Strand. But now, it appears, the nation needs them, or if it doesn't (as the Warners seem to imply) very soon may.The fact remains, though, that we are not in a war yet, and that is why we feel that the Warners might at least have spared us "Spit." "Spit"—as he was known in the original production—was our baby—the littlest—the one most stunted by cigarette smoking—a venomous expectorater for whom the eye of an enemy was like a flying quail to a huntsman. They didn't have to take "Spit" away from us, and reform him from a delightful beer-drinking, pool playing, butt-shooting candidate for a James Farrell conclusion, into the Frank Merriwell of Washington Military Academy. We don't regret the others so keenly, but in the case of Leo Gorcey, we feel like exclaiming sadly: "Et tu, Spit?"The film itself is a mutually losing tussle between factual scenes of comparatively recent army games and a fictional plot of the type which is sometimes referred to as "the old army game." As entertainment, it is the kind of picture that is making it harder and harder for "Screeno."At 86th Street CasinoManufactured before the present European war, perhaps to promote the Nazi "back to the land" movement and to lure tourists to the Black Forest, "Heimatland" (Homeland), manages to amuse the patrons of the Eighty-sixth Street Casino Theatre mildly, without exciting them. A cast of popular players, including Hansi Knoteck, Wolf Albach-Retty, Ursula Herking, Christian Gollong, Flockina von Platen and Elga Brink, does what it can with the attenuated story. Ernst Martin, who directed the film for the UFA, uses enough lovely rural views in Winter and Spring to justify the ending.At the Teatro HispanoFortunio Bonanova, the Spanish actor and singer who made his Broadway debut with Katharine Cornell in "Dishonored Lady" almost ten years ago, does a good job in "La Inmaculada," a Mexican romantic tragedy now at the Teatro Hispano. Nevertheless, this well-made film, released by the Atalaya concern through United Artists, is so crowded with sadness that its entertainment value is limited to persons appreciative of pleasing singing, lots of "tristeza" and some excellent views of Mexico City and its two guardian volcanoes.

1011-> THE SCREEN; A Well-Played and Interestingly Told Drama Lurks Behind 'Those High Grey Walls' at Criterion
Warmth, simplicity and freshness are qualities so unusual to the prison film that their presence in the Criterion's "Those High Grey Walls" has all the surprise of a violet's growing in the gravel of a jailyard. Manfully resisting most of the theme's obvious lures, from clattering jute mills to chattering machine guns, the film has chosen to go its way as drama rather than melodrama. And, through the admirable performances of Walter Connolly, Onslow Stevens and a few others, it has gone that way with complete interest and plausibility.It is the story of a small-town doctor whose wisdom, tolerance and gentleness have grown through a score of years in the service of life. His prison offense was part of that tolerance: he had tended and shielded an outlaw simply because he knew the boy and his mother. And in prison, although the young doctor there derided his philosophy and tried to cure him of it, he still insisted that men remained men, whether murderers and thieves, and stood in dignity in the old, old relationship between doctor and patient. In time his philosophy has won another convert, for the young physician is healed of his bitterness and prepares to start afresh.Charles Vidor, who directed it from a story by William Ullman Jr., has spun the story smoothly, spotlighting the prison background in significant bits of action but never letting it overshadow its quiet central figure, the old country doctor. Mr. Connolly has played him wisely and well, with a good trouper's recognition of the faint line between mawkishness and sentiment. Mr. Stevens's portrayal of the taciturn, memory-ridden prison doctor is properly reticent, grave and sincere, and there are well-handled minor characterizations by Bernard Nedell and Paul Fix. Altogether it is far more than we had expected to find behind the Criterion's high grey walls. THOSE HIGH GREY WALLS, screen play by Lewis Meltzer and Gladys Lehman based on a story by William A. Ullman Jr.; directed by Charles Vidor for Columbia. At Loew's Criterion.Doctor MacAuley . . . . . Walter ConnollyDoctor Norton . . . . . Onslow StevensNightingale . . . . . Paul FixRedlands . . . . .

1346-> THE SCREEN IN REVIEW; Alexander Korda Brings a Remake of 'Four Feathers' in Technicolor to the Capitol--'In Name Only,' a Romantic Drama, at the Music Hall At the Palace
The news this morning—in spite of what you are reading about British colonial difficulties—is that Alexander Korda has retaken the Sudan. In fact, Mr. Korda, the Kipling of the kinema, has retaken the already twice-filmed "Four Feathers" of novelist A. E. W. Mason,—and a fine, stirring, gorgeously Technicolored, explosively cinematic job he has made of it, too. In a week rich in action epics. African locales, and good re-makes, Mr. Korda has managed to plant the British flag higher than all the rest. To "Four Feathers," therefore, we herewith tender in grateful acknowledgment a fifth feather—for Mr. Korda's cap.Mad and romantic and bombastically British as the story of "Four Feathers" undeniably is (it's about a neurotic scion who becomes a sort of Egyptian Lawrence to prove that he isn't a coward) it is also the most splendid spectacle that has happened on the screen this year. Even its plot machinery, usually so painfully creaky in circuses, works well—affording more admissible pretexts for color and action than we ever suspected could exist, even during Kitchener's campaign for the recapture of Khartum. Its strange and lovely backgrounds, inspiredly photographed in the Blue Nile country (including an Egyptian dawn and a flock of sacred ibises) are among those intangible assets of illusion which it is hardly possible to overvalue in a film. And the authenticity of the home backgrounds, Mr. Korda being the adoring Gothophil he is, may be taken for granted.Both when he is functioning on the grand scale, with all of Egypt at his feet, and when his cameras close in for after-dinner port at a country house back home, or for a scene in an officers' mess, Zoltan Korda, the producer's exotically named brother, directs in a way that makes nepotism seem outright attractive.Mr. Sherriff's play likewise is a tight and workmanlike piece of joinery, particularly in its handling of those gently satirical passages involving the priceless C. Aubrey Smith as a repetitious general, with his eternal story of how he, alone, won the Crimean War. And the entire cast, notably including Mr. Smith, has that air of well-bred just-rightness which only a carefully selected native English cast can have in pictures dealing with that curiously foreign race.But "Four Feathers," being essentially an eye-filling spectacle, after all, arranges itself finally not into incidents and characters so much as into pleasantly memorable scenes. Most memorable of all, by sheer weight of size and width of camera field, is the beautiful and terrifying charge of the dervishes and "Fuzzy-Wuzzies" into the muzzles of the immovable British rifles: the wild-haired, spear-waving "Fuzzy-Wuzzies" especially, Kipling's "fust class fightin' men." The strangely tortured British ruling-class ethics which motivate the plot are decently buried (thank goodness) in the picturesque confusion incident to the storming of Omdurman, or scenes like the mad Mahdi's savage extermination of Captain Ralph Richardson's reconnoitering force in the desert.Meanwhile, the continual marching, flag-waving, trumpeting, and regimental parading in the relatively quiet intervals are not aimless exercises merely, but significant and crackling dramatic counterpoint for an imperialist symphony. In spite of all the competition, there's no getting around it: the Capitol has the biggest and best show in town. FOUR FEATHERS, as adapted by Oliver H. P. Garrett from the novel by A. E. W. Mason; directed by Zoltan Korda; produced by Alexander Korda and released by United Artists. At the Capitol.John Durrance . . . . . Ralph RichardsonGen. Burroughs . . . . . C.

Major John KnottThere is nothing quite so conducive to boredom, even in an air-cooled theatre, as the old story about the up-and-coming District Attorney who unwittingly sends the innocent young girl up the river for a four-year stretch and atones for the mistake by marrying same after discovering her to be a victim of circumstantial evidence. This is especially true when the formula is served without regard for the dramatic possibilities still inherent in the old tale. A case in point is "The Forgotten Woman," which opened yesterday at the Palace.From a technical viewpoint the picture is all that one could expect a Class C film to be; the sets are delightfully modest and the photography is excellent. But the story and the characterizations of the players lack the spark of life so necessary to a drama of this type. As a result, we never felt any compassion for the plight of the beautiful Sigrid Gurie, who was widowed and sent to jail shortly before her baby was born. Nor could we get particularly interested in Donald Briggs as the noble D. A., who adopted the youngster and risked his chances of becoming Governor by exposing the political chicanery that caused Miss Gurie to be wrongfully jailed. The old formula may not have lost any of its synthetic nobleness, but it seems curiously unaffecting in "The Forgotten Woman."

Norman WillisFrank Lockridge . . . . . George WalcottLove and the eternal triangle are subjects toward which the movies have never been particularly averse, but upon which they have generally discoursed with prudent caution and romantic bubble-blowing. For this reason—this and the fact that love is more than just a smoke raised by the fume of a scriptwriter's sighs—it is particularly gratifying to encounter a film which does unblushingly tackle the hackneyed theme of husband, wife and other woman, which acknowledges by tactful implication a few of the facts of life, which penetrates with poignant directness into the reality of emotional torment and which permits the "other woman" a contrived but satisfactory victory. Such is the especial grace of "In Name Only," the new Cary Grant-Carole Lombard love story, now at the Music Hall.No one can expect a film to probe much deeper than that into the chemistry of love or into the social conventions which frequently cause it embarrassment, what with the Hays code and such. So an occasional cliché or recourse to symbolic manoeuvring can readily be forgiven. There is enough of the reticence, the slightly skeptical exaltation and the frightening, lonely despair which are usually experinced by mature lovers in this picture to give it superior quality. And it is magnificently done.The story, as remarked, is no bombshell. Alec Walker, played by Mr. Grant, is a Connecticut squire married to a heartless wife, who hooked him for his money and position. When he meets and falls in love with Julie Eden (Miss Lombard), a widowed artist, he asks his wife to divorce him and she agrees to go to Paris to do so. Confident of her word, Alec and Julie prepare for their life together. But the wife prolongs her stay in Paris, causing Julie understandable anguish, and finally returns home (on Christmas Eve), without a divorce and without any intention of getting one.Further, this vicious wife threatens to sue Julie for alienation of affections and to drag her young daughter into court as a witness if Alec attempts to divorce her. So Alec and Julie agree to part and the situation is wholly intolerable—until a convenient illness and a sick-bed crisis permit a happy solution.On the face of it, that sounds pretty bleak. But don't let it prejudice you. The story, while obvious, is thoroughly convincing, thanks to the "natural" attack which John Cromwell has taken upon it and to some delightfully pleasing dialogue. Mr. Grant is in top form as the done-wrong-by husband who—unlike the husband in Bessie Bruer's original novel—is a thorough gentleman, a surpassing wit and a charming fellow withal. Miss Lombard plays her poignant role with all the fragile intensity and contained passion that have lifted her to dramatic eminence. Kay Francis, on the other side of the fence this time, is a model cat, suave, superior and relentless. And a generally excellent cast contribute in making this one of the most adult and enjoyable pictures of the season.
