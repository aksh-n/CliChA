IT is a debatable question whether the lover and student of French literature will derive more enjoyment from the novels of Balzac by reading where chance or the advice of friends may take him, or by first preparing himself for a regular course of the "Comdie Humaine" by studying the author's scheme and reading the volumes in their integral sequence of this scheme.

With the Yale-Princeton game less than two weeks off and the Harvard-Yale game following the next week the football season may be said to have reached its final stage.

Mr. Meredith's poetry, more than many classics, gains by interpretation and annotation; in fact, demands them. 
--------

Owing to the great increase in demand and shortage in supply, the price of milk is being raised this week in Manhattan from 5 cents to 6 cents a quart.

281-> IDEAS AND FANCIES OF ARTHUR SYMONS.; The English Poet, and Follower of Walter Pater as Critic of Art, Literature and Life -- His "Spiritual Adventures" -- A Master of Harmonious Prose.*
TO criticise criticism is to deal with life at third remove. And of the criticism of critics there is seemingly no end. But in voyaging through the published criticism of Mr. Arthur Symons, the English poet, one feels in the thick of a reality far more tangible than is experienced when reading Mr. Symons's master, Walter Pater.

283-> WHEAT, SILVER, AND PRQSPERITY.
Wheat is falling and silver rising, amid world-wide prosperity. The combination is worth noting for remembrance when perhaps the old argument that such conditions are impossible may be revived. It may be that wheat is too low and that silver is too high, and their relation may be corrected by a reversal of the rise in silver and the fall in wheat, but that is not the point.

--------
285-> "THE DEATH RIDE."; II.
I'm surprised that you should call the author of "The Death Ride" at Balaklava "young Jewett"? Your correspondent Mr. Munn doesn't say so -- but that it was written by the son of a friend of Jewett. Perhaps Munn's closing remark that the author's name "should be known" tangled you up! Of course, there is neither coincidence nor plagiarism in the matter.

--------
292-> English and American Usage.
The letters in THE NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW are always interesting, though sometimes a little exasperating. It is well enough for "Englishman" to condemn American ways, for the real English are always charmingly insular, and one forgives their narrowness for the pleasure they afford.

293-> REAPPORTIONMENT LEGAL.; Appellate Division Refuses to Mandamus the Secretary of State.
SARATOGA, Sept. 26. -- The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court concluded its annual grand term here this afternoon. Before adjourning the Justices handed down a decision upholding the reapportionment plan adopted by the Legislature last year. The decision is as follows:

--------
297-> THE MONEY MARKET MYSTERY.
The cat is out of the bag regarding another spasm in the security and money markets. The topic is serious enough, and yet there is an irresistible temptation to discuss it with decorous levity, the facts are so different from the theories and the misinformation was so complete in the best-informed quarters. 
--------

--------
300-> News from Berlin
ONE might almost infer from the personal and formal indorsement of von Bulow's Chancellorship by the German Kaiser on Nov. 12 and the importance accorded by Government organs to the Chancellor's Reichstag speech two days later that Wilhelm II. had been perusing with profit Count Ernst Reventlow's book, "The Kaiser and the Byzantines," to which some attention was paid in these columns a week ago.

310-> MEAT FAMINE IN GERMANY.
BERLIN, Nov. 15. -- The Winter is fast approaching, but the cry of the high price of meat continues, and the German Government does nothing to relieve the situation.

--------
315-> MR. PARKER'S WINDFALL.; Vanderbilt May Buy Out the Negro Gardener If He Pays Enough.
A small investment made many years ago in real estate on the south side of Long Island may make James Parker, a colored man, residing in Flushing, wealthy. Parker is a modest property owner.

318-> DIRECT NOMINATIONS OPPOSED AT ALBANY; Up-State Republicans Do Not Want to Increase Expenses. PLAN TO STOP CORRUPTION Voters' Demands for Money Have Proved Too Great Even for the Corrupters.
ALBANY, Feb. 3. -- There is little likelihood of the passage of any bill providing for direct nominations. The sentiment of the up-State Republicans appears to be decidedly opposed to such legislation. They think President Parsons of the Republican County Committee of New York County showed bad judgment in having the problem put up to the Legislature. 
--------
319-> ROOSEVELT AND AIDES WILL VOTE IN NEW YORK; President Will Return to Washington to Get the Returns. MUCH ANXIETY AT CAPITAL Both Parties Expect to Get the Next House -- Interest Centres in New York.

THE French Government is reconstructing La Malmaison, that charming property close to Paris, where the First Consul and Mme.

322-> Article 8 -- No Title
ST. PETERSBURG, June 9. -- The report of the retirement of the Goremykin Ministry was definitely denied late to-night, when the Premier returned to St. Petersburg from Peterhof, where he went this afternoon for an audience of the Emperor.

324-> Burroughs and Dogs.
Perhaps I can best answer the questions of your correspondent, "One Who Loves Dogs" by telling briefly what is to be commended in Burroughs's book ways of nature." 
--------
325-> CONDITIONS OF TRADE.
Some falling off in the record-breaking buying movement of the past weeks is noted in the weekly reports of the leading commercial agencies. This is attributed in part to a natural reaction from the recent high pressure and partly to the unseasonable hot weather which has curtailed, temporarily, the demand for Fail goods, while at the same time materially aiding dealers to dispose of their surplus Summer stocks. 
--------
326-> NEGROES AND WHITES FIGHT.; Two Men Fatally Wounded In a Mississippi Race Riot.

The same encouraging report has been received from Olneyville, where more than 2,000 employes of the National and Providence worsted mills are carefully watched from day to day by an expert. 
--------
328-> VENDETTA BULLETS FLY.; An Italian Who Is Aiding the Police Goes Down In Busy Grand Street.
One of those shootings which give variety to life in the Italian quarter almost caused a riot last night at Grand and Elizabeth Streets. As usual it was followed by dark whispers of a "vendetta."

329-> Guide with Colored Pictures.
A new guide to Rome and its environs is being issued by the Macmillan Company in this country. It has been compiled by Eustace Reynolds-Ball, author of "Cairo of To-day," "Jerusalem," "Paris and It's Splendor," , and contains eight illustrations in color by Alberto Pisa and three plans.

A manufacturer in Mo. says he started out as a young man with almost perfect health, but that, "by the time I was 24 my digestive apparatus was so completely wrecked as to make my life a positive burden. 
--------
332-> THE FINANCIAL SITUATION
The foremost place in any summary of the events affecting the financial situation last week belongs very clearly to the movement of the stock market, in spite of the high importance properly attached to Secretary Shaw's announcement that on and after to-day the Treasury is prepared to facilitate gold imports through deposits of Government funds with importing banks.

Democrats who went through the National campaign of 1904, and know the inside history of that campaign, are recalling in these days of William Randolph Hearst's candidacy for the Governorship on the Democratic ticket, what Judge Alton B. Parker did for Hearst in that year and how Hearst rewarded him for what he did.

LONDON, Wednesday, Dec. 19. -- The British press editorially and through its correspondents in the United States is paying keen attention to American-Japanese relations, and Ambassador Aoki's speech at the American Asiatic Society, Secretary of Commerce and Labor Metcalf's report on the San Francisco dispute, and President Roosevelt's message on the Japanese school situation in California are discussed with some concern.

The plan for the retirement of the debenture bonds of the Wabash Railroad, which was definitely agreed upon some time ago between the Bondholders' Committee, the railroad, and the bankers who were to underwrite the new securities, is likely to be modified in some particulars before the official announcement of the plan, according to reports yesterday.

W.R. Hearst swept down into the east side last night on an automobile tour, spoke to some 5,000 in four hall meetings, bowed to unnumbered thousands that simply swirled around his machines amid the glare of red fire and rockets, and ended the campaign by going over to Brooklyn to attend a masked ball given by the employes of the manufacturing company run by "Nellie Ely."

--------
340-> A FIGHT SEVEN YEARS OLD.; Harahan, Harriman's Candidate, Opposed Fish's Omaha Extension.
CHICAGO, Nov. 5. -- It was learned hero to-day that the true origin of the differences between Mr. Fish on the one hand and Mr. Harriman, Mr. Harahan, and the other Directors, who seem now about to compass the downfall of the Illinois Central's President, on the other, date back seven years, to the time when the so-called "Omaha extension" from Fort Dodga, Iowa, to Omaha was projected.

--------
342-> TOPICS OF THE TIMES.
Hearing Is Not Enough. Indications multiply -- can, indeed, be found daily by anybody who looks for them -- that the spoken word has ceased to have any value except for what may be called conversational purposes, and that only the written or printed word really counts. 
--------
343-> MOODY SAW THE MOVE.; Block in Way of Prosecution Discussed with the President.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 11. -- The news from Findlay, Ohio, indicating that the trusts have found a way to evade hostile legislation by foreign ownership will be no surprise to the Administration. There is good reason to believe that this was brought to the attention of the President a week ago by Attorney General Moody. 
--------
344-> MORE "SOCCER" TEAMS.; Oxford and Cambridge and the Pilgrims to Play Here Next Fall.
Association football will receive a big boom in the United States next year, and every effort will be made to popularize the sport. England will be represented by two elevens, and important features will be arranged. Capt.

--------
346-> Editorial Article 3 -- No Title
An Atlanta correspondent of The Evening Post calls attention to a curious factor in the progress of the negroes reported in the recent business conference in that city.

--------
348-> IN THE REAL ESTATE FIELD
The general tenor of gossip in brokers and operators' offices is that so far as larger transactions are concerned the decline of the market toward the level of Sumner conditions has already set in, but judgment may be based on some of the transactions announced last week, one of the busiest of Spring seasons that New York real estate has ever experienced promises to die hard. 
--------
349-> Sir Oliver Lodge.
A few weeks ago there appeared in THE NEW YORK TIMES SATURDAY REVIEW OF BOOKS a most enthusiastic estimate of Sir Oliver Lodge's recent book, "Life and Matter." To many readers this book must prove disappointing. Lodge's idealism, which naturally makes him oppose the theories of Haeckel as likely to do harm to any but advanced students, leads him into some rather vague and wild suggestions and assertions.

--------
360-> THE FUTURE OF SAN FRANCISCO.
We have printed a letter from a special correspondent at San Francisco which may very well have seemed to many readers to give too gloomy an outlook for the future of that town. It is gratifying to observe that the letter has had the effect of eliciting indignant patriotic remonstrances from various San Franciscans, past, present, or future.

361-> LOBBYING FOR THE CONGO.; Consul General Whiteley's Effort to Prevent Investigation.
WASHINGTON, April 17. -- It developed to-day that Sir Chentung Liang-Cheng, the Chinese Minister, is not the only "international lobbyist" as one of the members of the House designated them to-day.

362-> BAD EFFECT OF COMMON SALT; Its Excessive Use a Fruitful Cause of Bright's Disease.
Apropos of the recent death of Charles Yerkes from Bright's disease of the kidneys, it seems a fitting time to say something of the danger attending the excessive use of common table salt, especially if one has an affection of the kidney. 
--------
363-> Wordsworth.
I have been much struck with the fact that after a half-century of semi-oblivion, during which another class or poets, typified by Tennyson and Longfellow, has occupied the thoughts and filled the imaginations of all English-speaking people, William Wordsworth has been, so to speak, resurrected, and has come to the front again and taken the place that of right belongs to him as a mighty master of poetic power.

In the Missouri Society, naturally, there are many members, perhaps a majority, who were not born in the State whose glories they assemble annually to celebrate, and all such members must have had a special appreciation for the picturesque phrase in which Attorney General HADLEY explained his own right to speak as a Missourian.

451-> SAYS MAXWELL'S A GREAT MAN; District Superintendent Then Takes a Fling at Bachelor Teachers.
If the ideas of Cornelius E. Franklin, Superintendent of Public Schools in Districts 41 and 42 in the Borough of Queens, were put into force, bachelors would be barred from being School Principals: only married men with children would be appointed members of the School Boards, and a handsome monument would be erected to William H.

Democrats who have resolved to vote for HUGHES are not by that fact debarred from enrolling for the Democratic primaries next year.

469-> "ARBITRATION" IN CUBA.
The suggestion of an "arbitration" between President PALMA and the rebels who have taken up arms against the Government is preposterous.

Reports on Republican conditions in the State, made to State Chairman Woodruff yesterday, continued to be very favorable, and these, added to Mr. Woodruff's analysis of the registration figures, caused considerable satisfaction at State headquarters yesterday. Mr. Woodruff, however, is anxious that no feeling of over-confidence become prevalent, as there are still two days for registration in the up-State towns, and it is important that the full number of voters be recorded.

676-> THE TASK OF FRANCE.
If all signs shall not fail, France will leave the conference at Algeciras with strengthened prestige and with greater security for her interests in North Africa, but also with a task which, if it be not wholly a new one, is more strictly defined, carries with it greater responsibility, and entails some risks not before encountered.

680-> TRADE AND SPECULATION.
It is much to be desired that our friends our foreign censors -- and some domestic critics, as well -- should look away from Wall Street when seeking a bird's-eye view of the situation. The interesting things are not happening upon the Stock Exchange just now. For weeks advances and declines have almost balanced each other within an unusually narrow, range, except for some specific changes with scant bearing upon the general situation.

Precisely at the moment when men's clubs are going to decay, when palatial mansions are closing, subscriptions falling off and members resigning, women's clubs are springing up in every direction with mushroomlike velocity and luxuriance. It is too early yet to predict the result on social life of these ventures, or their ultimate and enduring success, but, at any rate, they have already effected a vast revolution in woman's existence.

Your article of Friday about the prices of automobile supplies I am sure will have a wrong impression on your readers.

Amid excitement such as seldom has been witnessed on the Polo Grounds the champion New Yorks snatched victory from defeat yesterday and squared matters with the Pittsburgs by winning 5 to 4.

704-> IRON AND STEEL NOTES.; Famine in Bessemer Iron In Sight -- Small Relief from New Plant.
According to Pittsburg advices, the steel trade in that section is beginning to fear a famine in steel-making pigs.

708-> INDUSTRIAL CONCENTRATION.; Even Tariff Reform Seems Useless to One Observer.
In your issue of Aug. 27, in an editorial "Industrial Concentration," you express your approval of the Steel Trust for its success in preventing fluctuations of prices in the American market for its products, and, in the light of this achievement, you question the reality of the sentiment against the trusts in the country.

--------
711-> LABOR IN POLITICS.
There is nothing surprising or objectionable about the entrance of workmen into politics. It is not surprising, because there are so many instances of it, in other countries as well as in ours.

MR. REEVE'S book complements Henry George's. "Progress and Poverty" traced our economic ills to landlordism. Mr. Reeve traces them to commercialism. Mr. Reeve develops his theme with both ingenuity and fervor. There is no more doubt of his sincerity and conviction than there was of Mr. George's. 
--------
714-> TWO WRONGS AND NO RIGHT.
The coal strike controversy has now reached a stage where each of the disputants seems in the wrong to third parties, however they may justify their procedure logically and to themselves. Surely the miners have the right peaceably to lay down their tools, and the disturbances which have occurred, although indefensible, are not enough to destroy the plea that they have done so. 
--------
715-> Close Contests In Cathedral Games.
The annual indoor games of the Cathedral Club of St. Patrick's Cathedral, held last evening at the Seventy-first Regiment Armory, Fifty-ninth Street and Madison Avenue, resulted in several close competitions.

717-> GREENE AND GAYNOR.
The conviction and sentence of GREENE and GAYNOR concludes one of the most tedious, persistent, and important prosecutions the United States Government ever undertook. That a criminal who once gets away with half a million dollars of swag can nevertheless be brought to justice is a most gratifying, although to many it will unfortunately be a surprising, showing.

Evidence of the disturbed state of mind of the Tammany leaders since the break between Mayor McClellan and Charles F. Murphy was seen yesterday when the organization from Mr. Murphy down was thrown into a panic by hearing that letters had been written to two district leaders asking them to call on Fire Commissioner O'Brien immediately. The word quickly passed around was that Mayor McClellan had decided to back O'Brien for leader of Tammany.

--------
727-> THE SECRET BALLOT.
We should say that the workers for ballot reform might regard the present situation with much comfort. The main purpose of the reform was to make it practicable for any voter to record his own choice of candidates without interference from any one, and to secure this result the ballot was devised so that it could be marked and cast without the knowledge of any one but the voter.

KINEO, Moosehead Lake, June 16. -- Never has a larger company of early visitors been assembled here or the season opened with more promise.

736-> Editorial Article 2 -- No Title
Mr. HEARST files a statement showing that he spent $256,370 in his unsuccessful campaign for the Governorship. This is an individual, expenditure quite unequaled in the history of American politics.

After a short lull, simplified spelling, thanks to the President, is again the sensation of the day, and is booming. I gave three cheers right from the heart when I read his order. To my mind, a sensible alphabet joined with sensible spelling will be worth more to the myriads yet to come of English-using people than the Panama Canal or wireless communication with Mars. 
--------
743-> THE NEGRO PROBLEM.; Less Talk of Reprisal and More Preaching of Peace Suggested.
For some days past there has been a convention of negroes in New York, and I note that they now want the President to appoint a commission to go South and study the cause of the negroes. Some of the speeches were wild and ignorant and flavored with New England ideas.

LINCOLN J.

This Republic was until Saturday the embarrassed possessor of two mong -- , that is, it had one mongoose at the Bronx Zoological Park, and another mongoose at the Rock Creek Zoo.

In a recent issue of THE NEW YORK TIMES L.R. Whipple winds up an admirably penned rhymed criticism of modern magazine poetry thus: 
--------
900-> VIRGINIA JUMPER WON THE HARBOR HILL CUP; T.S. Martin Led All the Way for Young Steeplechasers Stakes. RUNNING WATER'S HANDICAP Filly, with Top Weight Up, Easily Took the Ramapo -- Four Belmont Park Choices First.
Record breaking has become so common since the opening of the Belmont Park Fall meeting that the crowd in attendance barely commented on the performance of Higginbotham, a maiden two-year-old, which ran down the straight five furlongs in 0:58 2-5, with half a gale blowing behind him, and cut three-fifths of a second from the Belmont Park track record. 
--------
901-> FROM READERS.; Music, Poerty and Prose--Still Seeking a Definition of Poetry.
IT seems strange that even a "Sphinx" should have failed to read a riddle as simple as mind, yet like others he has missed altogether the pith of what was puzzling a "Perplexed Subscriber." To discover what is essential in poetry -- that is, "significant" and "fine" -- would be a work or supererogation, as -- perhaps luckily for authors -- tastes differ quite as widely as do talents. 
--------
902-> HIGGINS FORCES READY FOR A SWING TO HUGHES; President Said to Be for Him, and Odell Would Consent. GOVERNOR READY TO RETIRE And If Odell Doesn't Name the Candidate He Would Be Content to See Another Run.
It was understood last night among well-informed Republicans that as a result of information which has come to the Parsons forces they are getting ready, in the event of a victory at the primaries on Sept. 18, to swing the Higgins delegates to Charles E. Hughes for Governor. 
--------
903-> 1,400 MORE TROOPS TO BE SENT TO CUBA; All but 400 or 500 of the Marines to be Withdrawn. PRESIDENT AND TAFT CONFER Secretary Says the Army Will Not Be Withdrawn Till There Is Ample Assurance of Fair Elections.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 18 -- President Roosevelt had a long conference to-day with Secretary Taft and Assistant Secretary Bacon, who made a full report of all that occurred in Cuba since the United States intervened. 
--------
904-> SHOT AS A TRAITOR.; Murder in Bath Beach and a Cry, "You Have Betrayed Our Cause."
There was another murder last night in the Italian settlement in Bath Beach, which has become so notorious for crimes of this sort that the police force in the neighborhood has been increased recently. This time a man was shot in the saloon of Pincencio Baracio, at 1,449 Sixty-sixth Street, and his assailant, who was accompanied by two men, escaped. 
--------
905-> DR.STIMSON CRITICISED.; His Quotations from "the Family" Questioned in Two Instances.
It is to be feared that the Rev. Dr. Stimson has involved the Sunrise Club in the "trial-marriage" controversy with only a very slight knowledge of the facts. The Sunrise Club has not "sent out a flaming notice commending" Mrs. Parsons's work, nor any other work, at any time. 
--------
906-> PROHIBITION IN MAINE.
Maine is endeavoring to explain itself to itself. Above the tumult and confusion timid truths emerge to the consternation of the faithful. Already it has been made known that Mr. GOMPERS and his Laborites were but futile whisperings in the fading Summer; already it has been revealed that Mr. STURGIS was the offense and the burden. 
--------
907-> AN EXCITING WEDDING.; Bride's Father Taken Ill and Her Hat Set on Fire.
NEW BRUNSWICK, April 4. -- Miss Wilhelmina Smalley and William Silzer were married to-day at the parsonage of the German Reformed Church in spite of the fact that just a few minutes before the ceremony the bride's father, William Smalley, who was to give his daughter away, was stricken with paralysis. 
--------
908-> POEMS OF NATURE, LOVE, AND MYSTERY.; A Glance at Newly Published Volumes by Housman, John Burroughs, Henry Nehemiah Dodge, and Others.*
HOUSMAN'S poetry comes with special charm into any collection of modern verse. It is intensely modern, with its undercurrent of poignant feeling expressed in dainty meters. The heart may not be worn upon the sleeve, but the sleeve, silken and diaphanous, stirs to the precise measure of its beating. The poet is never unconscious of the past or the future. 
--------
909-> THE AUTO RACE VICTIM.; Man Mr. Shepard Killed Was Prominent in Passaic.
PASSAIC, N.J., Oct. 6. -- Kurt L. Gruner, who was killed at East Norwich, L.I., in the Vanderbilt Cup race to-day, was 33 years old, and for several years had been Superintendent of the starching department of the mosquito netting mills here, which are owned by former Mayor Andrew McLean. 
--------
910-> TOPICS IN WALL STREET.
John Brain, the dean of the New Street put-'n'-call crowd, died yesterday. He was older than any surviving thing in New Street save the name.

BALTIMORE, May 24. -- J.W. Harriman of New York made an extraordinary effort this afternoon to capture the thousand-dollar challenge cup class for gig horses at the Baltimore Horse Show. 
--------
912-> PLAY OF PUPPY-LOVE AT DALY'S THEATRE; With Bits of Philosophy Thrown in for Good Measure. ROSENFELD AS OPTIMIST Defines the Word for Heroine; Also for Broadway Audience -- Some Very Bad Acting.
The fact that stands out most clearly after seeing Mr. Sydney Rosenfeld's play, "The Optimist," is that that peculiar and variable passion generally known under the head of "puppy love" is neither a very interesting nor a very sympathetic subject for treatment on the stage. Or better, perhaps, that it should provide only the secondary interest, if any, to the main theme. 
--------
913-> FATHER GAPON ARRESTED.; Timiriazeff Exonerates Him -- Anti-Jewish Proclamation.
ST. PETERSBURG, March 12. -- Father Gapon was arrested to-day on the eve of the inquiry demanded by him into the scandal involved in the charge that his labor organization was subsidized by the Government. 
--------
914-> NEW BOOKS ON ART AND ARTISTS.; Work of the Dutch Landscape Painters -- Titian's Pictures -- The Preraphaelites Again.
ART critics and connoisseurs are constantly amazed at the deplorable ignorance of theory in art, of its biographical, historical, and critical literature, displayed by men whose pictures are successfully exhibited and sold. The art schools in this country, and especially in Europe, do their best to remedy this defect, but the student, on leaving them, unless he have a literary inclination, usually confines his efforts to the purely practical and productive part of his work. 
--------
915-> PRESIDENT OF DOUMA RECEIVED BY THE CZAR; Ruler's Interest in Nation Impresses Mouromtseff. COSSACKS ASK FOR REFORM Will Insist on Deliverance from Their Peculiar Military Status -- New Upper House Meets.
ST. PETERSBURG, May 11. -- In striking the balance of yesterday's events the press almost unanimously concludes that the speech from the throne failed to justify the hopes and expectations it had aroused. Only the Slovo and Novoe Vremya regard it in a favorable light. 
--------
916-> THE RAILWAY RASCALS.
We take time by the forelock and assume that we are authorized in the name of the shippers who are ground under the heel of the railway trust to protest against the outrage which the Inter-State Commerce Commission exposed here yesterday. We also feel authorized to demand in the name of the downtrodden shippers aforesaid that all and sundry the accomplices and abettors of the crime alleged shall be punished along with the felon railways. 
--------
917-> TOPICS IN WALL STREET.
After having lost, piecemeal, in the bucket shop of his home town the surplus of many years' industry, a cattle raiser in the State of Illinois determined, if possible, to take the other end of the play. He desisted from speculation until, between seasons, he had three months of leisure for his experiment. 
--------
918-> STEEL TRADE POSITION.; Pittsburg Reports Sagging Prices in Spite of Activity.
The production of pig iron is increasing. The furnaces, according to The American Manufacturer, produced 2,095,797 gross tons during January, an increase of 43,931 tons the month previous. The largest output, according to the same authority, in any one district is in Pittsburg, where 43 out of 44 furnaces are in blast.

919-> CREDITORS PRESS SHIELDS.; Want the Subway Contractor Declared Personally Bankrupt.
TRENTON, March 23. -- Creditors of John Shields, a sub-contractor for the Rapid Transit Subway in New York, moved to-day to have him declared personally a bankrupt. Failure of the bankruptcy action against the John Shields Construction Company, which the Judge decided did not come within the Bankruptcy act, caused to-day's step. Shields is ordered to answer on April 2. 
--------
920-> DEAD AT 103.; " Aunt Ann" Betts Remembered Andrew Jackson and the War of 1812.
" Aunt Ann" Betts, one of the oldest women in New Jersey, died yesterday at the home of her granddaughter, Mrs. Chauncey Thornton, 10 Church Place, East Orange, of peritonitis. She was 103 years old on Oct. 6 last. 
--------
921-> SUBWAY SLIPS ENRAGE BLOCKED PASSENGERS; Supposed Transfers Fool Thousands Held Up by a Wreck. NOT GOOD ON THE ELEVATED Worthless for Getting Home Quickly -- Traffic Stopped an Hour for a Derailed Train at 96th Street. SUBWAY SLIPS ENRAGE BLOCKED PASSENGERS
Between four and five thousand persons, about half of them women and shop girls, were turned out into the rain from the Subway at Ninety-sixth Street and Broadway in the rush hour last evening, each with a little slip of white paper which most of them thought was a transfer from the Subway to the Sixth and Ninth Avenue elevated roads, but which, as it turned out, was nothing of the kind. 
--------
922-> SUBWAY PAY CAR IN A SMASH.; Four Hurt as it Strikes the Bumper at King's Bridge.
One man was seriously and three slightly injured yesterday morning in an accident to the pay car of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company at the King's Bridge (211th Street) station and terminal of the elevated structure of the Subway.

--------
924-> 170 PENSION BILLS PASSED.; Railroaded Through the House with Scarcely a Vote.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 17. -- This was pension day in the House, and in a little more than two hours 170 bills were jammed through, granting pensions to applicants who could not secure them through the regular channels at the Pension Office, or granting increase of pension to friends and constituents of Congressmen who are already on the rolls, either by legislative enactment or successful application to the Pension Office. 
--------
925-> TOPICS IN WALL STREET.
The stock market's stupid indifference to such an excellent crop report as the one published yesterday by the Government shows clearly enough that bullish speculation has been waiting upon something other than crops.

WASHINGTON, June 16. -- Senator Patterson to-day found in the bill incorporating the Lake Erie and Ohio River Ship Canal an encouragement to the advocates of the ownership of the public utilities. He spoke on the measure soon after the Senate convened and quoted a pamphlet issued by the company giving as an explanation for asking a Congressional charter the fact that the Government might ultimately become the owner of the proposed canal. 
--------
931-> The Modern "Uncle Tom's Cabin" Parade.
NOT long ago a tourist from the North, while stopping at a hotel in a little town somewhere south of Mason and Dixon's line, was surprised one morning to find that his repeated calls for a bellboy were not answered This seemed unusual from the fact that, owing to the Northerner's liberality in tids. here were generally several pickaninny "Boots" and "Buttons" lurking around the door of his room when not needed. 
--------
932-> HORSE FELL IN, TOO.; Reilly, at Work in a Manhole, Escaped With Slight Injury.
Barney Reilly of 228 East 118th Street, an employe of the Fire Department, squeezed himself back into a small corner of a manhole at the Bowery and Grand Street yesterday noon, and wondered whether or not the slashing ironshod feet of the horse that had fallen partly into the hole would kill him or only wound him. 
--------
933-> LAND OF MUMMIES.
TO understand Egypt, to describe in a single volume its past glories but in ruins, its present full of energy and work, its future of hope and promise, is humanly impossible. "A New Egypt" has not been written for my Egyptian friends, for those who know thoroughly this lovely land.

--------
937-> Princess Troubetskoy's Latest Poem; " Augustine the Man" Remarkable in Its Dramatic Appeal and Imagery -- The Conflict of Heart and Mind.
THE rank as a poet which her last book, "Selene," has given the Princess Amelie Rives-Troubetzkoy in American classics (for in spite of all enduring neglect, there is classical quality to be found in some native literature of our own period) makes it a matter of universal interest to know what she has accomplished in her new book.

--------
949-> Spelling Reform.
For more than forty years the writer has witnessed spasmodic attempts to simplify English spelling. The earlier ones were to destroy everything and begin anew, add fifteen or twenty new characters to the alfabet and do everything fonetically. Of course such efforts accomplished nothing. The advocates have learned, as all reformers must, that healthy and profitable changes are growths. Meantime there have been small changes for the better.

What Hughes finds and what his opponent finds show the difference between the two Men.

It was with pleasure that I read your editorial, "A Sensible Compromise."

One rather wishes that Bishop DOANE and the Rev. Dr. SLICER had foemen more worthy of their steel than the Rev. WILBUR F. CRAFTS.

A correspondent of The Sun contributes to that journal what it entitles an "able attempt" to show that the necessity for the Monroe Doctrine has passed away.

1284-> THE FINANCIAL MARKETS; Stocks Dull -- Banks Add $500,000 to Surplus. Market Sags in Spite of Favorable Bank Return -- Cotton Firm.
The stagnation of business in yesterday's short session of the Stock Exchange is illustrated by the fact that total transactions for the two hours were little more than 200,000 shares, while in only five stocks out of a list of fifty in which there was some trading were the day's changes equal to a point or more.

AS I sat in Albert Hall last Thursday night, one of the ten thousand who were waiting for Prime Minister Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman to appear and set forth the policy the new British Government had marked out for itself, the conviction gradually settled in my mind that it really would matter very little what Sir Henry should say to that great meeting.

The Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company is within its legal rights when it refuses to carry passengers to Coney Island for a single fare of five cents.

--------
1432-> A BANK OF BANKS.
The idea of a bank of banks is reminiscent of a deceased capitalist who took himself and his institution more seriously than others did. There are six thousand reasons to the contrary.

--------

--------
