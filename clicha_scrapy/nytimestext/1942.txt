33-> At Loew's Criterion
Another reminder that child actors are the world's No. 1 problem children arrived yesterday at the Criterion. For "Born to Sing" is a painful kindergarten caper which serves a useful purpose, no doubt, in breaking the assorted infants to klieg lights and camera, but otherwise results in an exercise which only their mothers can love. It has, to be sure, such promising little people as Virginia Weidler, who takes her thoughts very seriously, and Ray McDonald, who probably will be an accomplished dancing juvenile a few years from now, but most of "Born to Sing" is precocious without being entertaining. With the exception of the "Ballad for Americans," tagged on the end without much rhyme or reason, it is dull and not infrequently embarrassing.As usual in these infant epics, the plot hastily makes up for the limitations of the actors. Thus we have plots and counterplots, all of which combine to make this general exhibition of childish tricks necessary. An ex-convict's score for a musical show is cribbed by another producer, he is framed into an extortion plot because of his efforts to regain it, and is saved from "the rap" only when his daughter, a handy gangster and a band of neighborhood talents prove the songs are his. They kidnap a first-night audience and cart it to an ex-Bund hall for a musical production of which Busby Berkeley might well be proud. Ingenious children, and MGM should give each a gold star on the report card for deportment and this corner will applaud politely. But our heart isn't in it. BORN TO SING, screen play by Harry Clork and Franz G. Spencer; based on a story by Mr. Spencer; directed by Edward Ludwig; produced by Frederick Stephani for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer; music and lyrics by Lennie Hayton and David Snell; "Ballad for Americans," music and lyrics by Earl Robinson and John Latouche.Patsy Eastman . . . . .

276-> At the Capitol
Although musical comedies are as perishable as Spring hats, there are times when a shrewd producer and a dextrous director can trim them with enough fresh bunting to make them look like new. Take "Rio Rita," now on display at the Capitol. In the original version thirteen years ago, before the world burst its seams, the villain did nothing more dastardly than abduct the beauteous Bebe Daniels so that John Boles could save her amid a lot of brave songs about shootin' pals, hootin' pals, etc. Today, the rancho absolutely crawls with fifth columnists and the poor Texas Rangers are allowed to yodel only one stout-hearted refrain before they're given the hotfoot. Times change. And so, fortunately, has "Rio Rita." With a pair of hazardous buffoons and some fresh talents in the cast, it has been remade into a happy-go-lucky fiesta.A musical-comedy plot is worth only as many gags, songs and nonsensical merriment that you can pack into it. So perhaps it's just as well that Abbott and Costello, those lunatic tumbleweeds, should take almost complete charge. "Rio Rita" takes a comic spin when Costello is flung about on a garage turntable, is soundly scrubbed in a hotel laundry, or when he is discussing anxiously the symptoms of starvation. As usual, Abbott gets the breaks and Costello takes the bumps. Stealing a crate of apples, Abbott helps his pudgy conspirator through a window. "Why me?" asks Costello. "You wouldn't want anybody to catch me stealing, would you?" Abbott responds with sound wisdom.But if the two zanies tumble through the script, tearing great holes in the plot wherever they go, the rest of the cast has a few tricks of its own. Eros Volusia, for instance, is an electric dancer with a lot of savvy, as they may or may not say in Brazil; John Carroll brings a convincingly masculine baritone to such bravura stanzas as "The Rangers' Song" or the more dulcet message of "Rio Rita," and Kathryn Grayson warbles tunes like an angel who's been paying strict attention to her upper registers. Credit S. Sylvan Simon with a facile job of pasting together a footloose entertainment and call "Rio Rita" a likable, funny extravaganza. There's plenty of life in the old warhorse still. RIO RITA, screen play by Richard Connell and Gladys Lehman; special material for Abbott and Costello by John Grant; directed by S. Sylvan Simon; produced by Pandro S. Berman for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer; music and lyrics by Harry Tierney, Joseph McCarthy, Harold Arlen, E. Y. Harburg and Meyerbeer."Doc" . . . . . Bud Abbott"Wishy" . . . . .

532-> At the Capitol
Although gangster melodramas are not precisely the height of fashion right now, MGM's scenario tailors have done a consummate fitting job for Robert Taylor and Lana Turner in "Johnny Eager," now at the Capitol. As another case history of a relentlessly bad boy riding high and handsome "straight for judgment day" it is highly colored hokum in which women are "dames" and guns are "gats." But it has been made with a flourish. Under Mervyn LeRoy's keen directorial hand Mr. Taylor seems nearly as cold-blooded as he sounds and he is evenly matched by Miss Turner, still playing an ill-starred Isolde to lawless males. Among them they have turned "Johnny Eager" into a tight tale of underworld terror that drives hard—even in the clinches.It is box-office sugar, pure and simple, but by a sort of unwritten tradition it is inferred that Johnny is a misguided genius who could have scaled figurative mountains if he'd only had a warmer childhood. Maybe. As a cabbie who puts up a penitent front for the parole board but removes the drab in the plushy surroundings of his race-track hideaway, Johnny leads a charmed life, pure in its absolute selfishness. He bumps off pals with stern discipline. His alibis are airtight. When the District Attorney turns down the screws he frames the D. A.'s adopted daughter, who has fallen in love with him. But even Johnny has an Achilles heel of nobility. To clear the girl's mind of a crime she thinks she's committed, he dies at last in a grimy back alley under a fusillade of bullets.If this were serious drama one might complain that what makes Johnny tick remains a mystery, that lovely students of sociology aren't apt to embark on discussion with a parolee on Cyrano de Bergerac's apostrophe to a kiss. But as pure melodrama "Johnny Eager" moves at a turbulent tempo. Mr. Taylor and Miss Turner strike sparks in their distraught love affair. Van Heflin provides a sardonic portrait of Johnny's Boswell, full of long words and fancy quotations. Edward Arnold, Robert Sterling and Lou Lubin are excellent in lesser roles. The script is strongly worded; Mr. LeRoy has kept the production in key. Though "Johnny Eager" lacks purpose, it has a strong charge of shock and excitement. JOHNNY EAGER; screen play by John Lee Mahin and James Edward Grant; based on an original story by Mr. Grant; directed by Mervyn LeRoy; produced by John W.

980-> THE SCREEN; Lower Level, on Time
Armchair detectives who delight in spotting clues and following verbal deductions toward a tedious solution of a crime should find considerable pleasure in the "Grand Central Murder" now taking place at regular two-hour intervals on the screen of the Rialto. For this modest but precocious mystery-comedy, which comes from Metro's swank atelier, is simply a one-hour grilling of no less than ten suspects who might have bumped off the actress, Mida King, in her private car in the Grand Central yards. Alibis and testimony are conveyed through the routine device of the flashback, and the proceedings are considerably enlivened by the mutually insulting backchat of Sam Levene, a dumb police detective, and Van Heflin, a bland but cunning amateur sleuth.It's no great shakes of a picture—nor even of a mystery, withal. The most significant piece of evidence is withheld until pretty near the end, but smart and experienced deducers will catch it long before that. And the motive for the crime is very slim. However, the constant bickering between the Messrs. Heflin and Levene is more tart and tempestuous than usual, mainly because both boys are excellent actors, and the script is tight and logical, which is always a gratifying help. And Patricia Dane, as the victim, makes herself a proper subject for killing. "Grand Central Murder" is recommended as a pleasant diversion—say, between trains. Lower Level, on Time GRAND CENTRAL MURDER; screen play by Peter Ruric; based on the novel by Sue MacVeigh; directed by S. Sylvan Simon; produced by B. F. Zeidman for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.
