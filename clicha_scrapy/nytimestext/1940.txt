0-> THE SCREEN IN REVIEW; Zola's 'The Human Beast' Comes to 55th Street as a Somber and Powerful French Film by Jean Renoir--Laurel and Hardy in 'Chump at Oxford'
When a man goes mad, it must be to the beat of drums throbbing in his brain. Zola's drum in "The Human Beast" is the pounding of a locomotive on the rails, its swift, wailing rush into the blackness of a tunnel, the eldritch shriek of its whistle as it roars 'round a grade or past a crossing. Drums, or a locomotive's thunder, can set in sanity to rhythm and hammer out the tempo for a drama's march "The Human Beast," which came by way of France and Jean Renoir to the Fifty-fifth Street Playhouse yesterday, marches like an automaton to the beat of its steam-driven metronome, shrouded in the grayness of train smoke and mist shrouded in the grayness of madness and grief.It is hardly a pretty picture, dealing as it does with a man whose tainted blood subjects him to fits of homicidal mania, with a woman of warped childhood who shares her husband's guilty secret of murder. Nor is it prettier in its scene—the drab railroad yards at Havre, the bare ugliness of third-rate pension, the soot and grime of a locomotive's cab, the rouged façade of a cheap dance-hall. Its lack of prettiness is neither in its favor nor against it. A scene exists, a circumstance exists, and they happen to have been casually accepted, and as casually reproduced in film, by a writer, director and cast who seem quite content to regard them objectively, dispassionately, with no more show of sentiment than the characters had for themselves. It is simply a story; a macabre, grim and oddly-fascinating story.Sitting here, a safe distance from it, we are not at all sure we entirely approve of it or of its telling. Its editing could have been smoother—which is another way of saying that Renoir jerks his camera, jumps a bit too quickly from scene to scene, doesn't always make clear why his people are behaving as they do. But sitting here is not quite the same as sitting in the theatre watching it. There we were conscious only of constant interest and absorption tinged with horror and an uncomfortable sense of dread. And deep down, of course, ungrudged admiration for Renoir's ability to seduce us into such a mood, for the performances which preserved it.How closely it follows Zola we do not know. It is the story of a locomotive engineer of drink-sodden ancestry who has discovered in himself ungovernable impulses to strangle those he loves. Thus far he has committed no crime, either by denying himself love or by having something break his murderous spells in time. But then he meets, falls recklessly in love with the young woman whose husband has committed murder, whose life is forfeit to his jealousy and fear. She begs her lover to kill him so that she can be free. But he cannot, for he is no murderer—except of those he loves. No, not a pretty tale certainly, but a powerful one with memorable performances in it—that of Jean Gabin as the engineer, of Simone Simon as the wife, of Ledoux as her husband—and, through it all, the rhythmic beat of train-wheels drumming on their tracks and on a madman's brain. THE HUMAN BEAST, French film based on the novel "La Bete Humaine," by Emile Zola; directed by Jean Renoir; produced by Hakim Brothers with the cooperation of the French National Society of Railroads; distributed here by Juno Films, Inc.

BerliozEmploye . . . . . PerezCabuche . . . . . Jean RenoirLet's not mince words with custard pies—or what theoretically amounts to the same: The slapstick clowning of Laurel and Hardy in Hal Roach's "A Chump at Oxford," now showing at the Rialto, is about as silly and unintelligent as a lecture in double-talk, and also about as funny as clowns can be these days. After all, the secret of slapstick resides in incongruity, and what could be more incongruous than these dead-panned stumble-bums—ex-street cleaners in this case—turned loose amid the gray towers and ivy-covered walls of peaceful Oxford?Well, Laurel and Hardy being what they familiarly are, you should know what to expect and what not. What you can expect this time is a priceless burlesque of two tramps in quest of knowledge beside the Isis, caught upon their arrival by a group of prankish students and put through a running sequence of ribs. "You're dressed for Eton," says one student, referring to the dim-wits' garb. "That's swell," answers Stan, "we haven't eaten since breakfast." They get lost in a maze (for a haze), they are lodged in the dean's rooms while the old boy is out and battle with him upon his return. They squirt seltzer bottles, trip over furniture, get knocked in the head by window sashes and finally decide to go home.What you cannot expect is a story. But Laurel and Hardy have been managing for so long to get by without one of those that its absence is imperceptible. The idea is to laugh, not to think. You'll get the idea, all right.At the Cine RomaTaming one's tyrannical relatives by pretending to be a victim of amnesia is an ancient theme on stage and screen, but seldom are its possibilities exploited to the accompaniment of so much laughter by the audience as they are in "Lo Smemorato," the new Capitani production at the Cine Roma.Naturally, the late Angelo Musco, in the title role, carries most of the riotous comedy work, but he enjoys excellent support by a big company and fine direction by G. Righelli. As a wealthy former opera singer who really has lost her memory and imagines she has found her one-time fiancé in the person of a humble printer, Paola Borboni is first-rate.A minor love story, a couple of prizefight scenes and some droll incidents in the career of a crooked manager are added for good measure. The action is so simple that only a slight acquaintance with Italian is needed to follow it.

338-> THE SCREEN; At Loew's Criterion
This department has been noticing the surprising high order of social refinements which have been creeping into the run of women's-prison pictures of late. Conditions in the institutions seem definitely better than last year, even if the pictures themselves are not. And now, so genteel are most of the inmates in "Women Without Names," at Loew's Criterion, so chic are they in appearance and so eternally feminine in their deportment that one might vaguely suspect this film of being a disguised remake of "The Women" (without "names").But only in the quality of the ladies is there even a remote resemblance. For otherwise this is just a routine melodrama, lurid but completely implausible, about a girl and her boy friend who go to jail for murder on the flimsiest circumstantial evidence, undergo the customary mental anguish and finally obtain justice when another girl in the prison rats, as the saying is, on the true murderer. There is little to recommend it, save—as mentioned above—the pleasant company.Also on the bill at the Criterion is a one-reel short in which Bertrand Russell and the Rev. Dr. Stephen H. Wise, introduced by James A. Fitz Patrick, the travelogue man, discuss in most general terms the subjects of divorce and companionate marriage.

540-> THE SCREEN; "The Howards of Virginia," a Fine Historical Drama, at Music Hall--'Beyond Tomorrow' at Palace
In these times, when a great many people are talking loosely about American democracy, it is a very good thing to hark back occasionally to first principles. And this Frank Lloyd has done with remarkable clarity and penetration in "The Howards of Virginia," which opened yesterday at the Music Hall. Seldom do the films illuminate our fundamental ideals with such simple and straightforward analysis as that employed in the present instance; never, to our recollection, has the screen pictured in more magnificent detail the period in American history preceding and including the Revolution. As a record of social progression, this film is a master work.If, then, it may be for some deficient in dramatic action—if it flows in a narrative vein too deep for surface excitement—let's not charge that seriously against it. For the basic drama lies in the conflict of ideas—in the clash of entrenched conservatism with the ferment of true democracy, out of which the American ideal arose. And the result is a steadily absorbing play of intangible forces, never breaking out in visible physical conflict, but continuously exciting because of their effect on minds and souls.The story, which is taken from the first part of Elizabeth Page's novel, "The Tree of Liberty," is that of Matt Howard, a Virginia backwoodsman, who marries Jane Peyton, the daughter of an aristocratic Tidewater family, and of their life together during the years of this nation's birth. Jane has been bred to the conviction of her own superiority, to the selfish attitude that her own and her family's security is the only important thing; Matt is of democratic spirit, hot-blooded and passionate in his devotion to his fellow-man.The conflict, then, is between their divergent natures, manifest through the years as the struggle with England grows. "My fear is for us," says Jane. But Matt's concern is for the rights of himself and his neighbors. And when the war finally comes, when Matt insists on joining the army of Washington, the family is divided, and the breach between fundamental beliefs is made—until the end of the conflict and the victory of Matt's ideal.Incidental to this main theme of the picture is the story of life in Colonial Virginia—in Tidewater mansions and in the log houses of the frontier—and it is told with rich and colorful elaboration. Many of the backgrounds were actually filmed in restored Williamsburg, which factor imparts a substantial, authentic quality. The mellowness and urbanity of life in the colonial capital is vividly contrasted with the raw and rugged nature of the frontier.As the Tidewater aristocrat, Martha Scott is excellent, aloof yet warm of heart, dignified yet flexible. She should be the pet of every Colonial Dame in America. Sir Cedrio Hardwicke makes a superb Tory, adamant in his hatred of change and of Thomas Jefferson. Richard Carlson plays the latter with grace and credible zeal. The only disappointment—and it is a major one—is Cary Grant as Matt. There is a familiar comic archness about his style which is disquieting in his present serious role, and he never quite overcomes a bumptiousness which is distinctly annoying. However, we must say that he looks like the genuine article in the buff-and-blue of a Continental officer.But regardless of that and regardless of the film's two-hour running time, we think it one of the best historical pictures to date. As a stern and sobering reminder of our liberal tradition, it is more contemporary than a political speech.

Charles FrancisWe've never had any particular grudge against ghosts, but we're rapidly developing one. That goes too for the scenarists who insist on calling forth shades from the Stygian night. For when the ghosts come in, the plot usually goes out the window, and after that a mere film reviewer is apt to be as confused as if he were sitting at a séance with levitating tables, blurred apparitions and sepulchral voices. Take "Beyond Tomorrow" which opened yesterday at the Palace. For its first half it is a latter-day Christmas carol, told with a gamin tenderness and warming as a hot toddy. But when its three elderly good Samaritans return from a plane crash as celluloid chimeras, its mystical peregrinations are more preposterous than moving.So long as the story concerns itself with Christmas Eve, the three old codgers who toss their wallets into the snow in hope of finding company for dinner, and of the lonely boy and girl who return two of them, the film has charm and poignance. But when the scenarists don metaphysician's robes the boy becomes a famous radio singer and falls under the sway of the usual enchantress. The three old men, now literally ghosts of their former selves, labor frantically to save the happiness of the youngsters before each of them receives his respective summons from the "great beyond."All of it has been affectionately produced, handsomely photographed and sincerely performed by Charles Winninger, C. Aubrey Smith and Harry Carey as the three old codgers; Maria Ouspenskaya as their housekeeper, and Richard Carlson and Jean Parker as the pair of lonely waifs. It was in the story department that the ghosts played havoc with the script. "Beyond Tomorrow" should have gone no further than Christmas Eve. Even a hot toddy wears off when one travels into the chilly interstellar spaces.

Let's be grateful for small favors these days and speak a frankly encouraging word for "Alias the Deacon," an undistinguished but thoroughly genial little farce-comedy in which Bob Burns, Mischa Auer, Ed Brophy and a handful of lesser clowns are abetting the enjoyment of laughter at the Rialto Theatre. Goodness knows, it's nothing sensational; the story — a trifling something about an itinerant cardsharp who arrives in a small town and does much good through his questionable talents while posing as a sanctimonious deacon—is antimacassar in period and sags in spots like an old horse-hair sofa. It is straight from the cracker barrel—and from Universal's back lot.But the blank expressions and dry wit of Mr. Burns as the artful dodger, the saucer-eyed frenzies of Mr. Auer as a fastidious barber, the snorts of Mr. Brophy and the howling stupidities of Guinn Williams as a couple of drawbacks in the fight game, plus a slaughterous ring battle and a classic poker session, combine to make an hour of pleasing sport. In fact, this corner would be glad to recommend it for nothing more than the fun of hearing (and seeing) Mr. Burns inquire sweetly of an unsuspicious schemer out to fleece him, "Draw poker—what's that?"

831-> THE SCREEN; 'Maryland,' a 20th Century-Fox Hunting and Riding Film at Roxy--'My Love Came Back' at Strand
The personal affection which Darryl F. Zanuck is known to have for horses and "horsey" people—not to mention the United States—has certainly proven an asset to his studio, Twentieth Century-Fox. There is no doubt that it contributed very much to the charm and liveliness of "Kentucky" a couple of years ago, and now again Mr. Zanuck is obviously mixing business and pleasure to a profitable degree in his sleek and colorful production "Maryland," which came steeplechasing into the Roxy yesterday.The steady hand of a devoted horseman is easily recognized throughout the film. And, speaking as an old 'county" boy, this critic will testify that the story, plus some magnificent Technicolor photography, has richly captured the spirit and beauty of that horse-loving world which is confined within the gentle hills and valleys northward of Baltimore. It is a luxurious little world which has been brought within the range of the camera—a world of stately mansions and neat horse-barns, where people who live mostly in riding clothes talk of blood-lines and stamina as much, if not more, than they do of their children. And, as pictured in "Maryland," it is also a very exciting and pulse-quickening place to be when there is a fox-hunt hallooing across the hills or a steeple-chase sweeping up the valley.Although the story does possess a few of the anticipated clichés, it runs a true and plausible course. Charlotte Danfield has sold all her fine horses and forbidden her son Lee to ride because her husband was killed when thrown in a fox-hunt. But young Lee has a Marylander's blood, and when old Uncle Will Stewart, the finest trainer in the county, grooms a dandy new horse for the Maryland Hunt Cup race, the lad insists upon riding it. Mother says no and comes up with some sizeable opposition, but Lee rides anyhow—and you can imagine what happens.Better than the story, however, are the incidents which make it up. Some one was smart enough to know that, next to horses, one of the most affectionate indulgences of a Maryland squire is colored folks. And plenty of these dusky worthies have been scattered all around. The funniest sequence in the picture is that of a Negro revival meeting, at which Shadrach, Uncle Willie's groom, gets all filled up with religion. And Shadrach, next to the horses, is the best thing in the show. Ben Carter, who plays the part, is a priceless find.Very good, too, are Walter Brennan as Uncle Willie, Fay Bainter as Mrs. Danfield, John Payne as Lee and Hattie McDaniel as a mammy. But best of all are those beautiful scenes of red-coated huntsmen topping timber, with the hounds baying up ahead, and the glorious (and authentic) sequence of the running of the Maryland Hunt, with the bright silks flashing in the sunlight and stout-hearted horses clearing the jumps. You'll probably gather than "Maryland" put us in a very pleasant state. It should put you in one, too.

Madame Sul-te-wanCupid, stout fellow, must have had a twinkle in his eye when Warners were setting the stage for "My Love Came Back" which romped into the Strand yesterday. Maybe he was bored with the routine, straight-laced sequence of boy-gets-girl and decided to let loose a sheaf of arrows to see what happens. We needn't tell you that when one of the bowman's barbs pierces the motor organ of Charles Winninger, changing him from a kindly family man to an aging but agile Leander, the crossing of the Hellespont is apt to be a comic affair.To tell the truth, it is. Out of Mr. Winninger's Indian Summer—or should we say Spring?—the producers have concocted and set to music a featherlight frolic, a rollicking roundelay of deliciously pointed nonsense. If it is neatly tucked at the edges, credit Kurt Bernhardt who has directed it in a spirit of pure delight. If it is effervescently written, give a hand to the Messrs. Goff, Buckner and Baldwin. And if the members of the cast give a gayly scampering performance, credit them for catching the point of a jest when they play one. For their masquerade is as refreshing as a gin fizz on a hot day.Don't expect us to explain everything. The story itself is but a series of explanations, each, alas, calling for a new one. They certainly were in order on that evening that Olivia De Havilland, prize violinist of the Brissac Academy of Music, arrived at the concert just in time to play the solo passage of the concerto. And what about that scholarship which Mr. Winninger begins to pay out of his private purse at the same time that he takes up rhumba lessons? How is it that the same expenditure is suspiciously listed on the expense account of Jeffrey Lynn, the vice president of Mr. Winninger's phonograph factory? And why, finally, does Mendelssohn "get hot" every time the academy's director turns his back? That it's all unraveled in time is due to the good sense of Spring Byington, the neglected wife.As the compromised young heroine of the show, Miss De Havilland plays the part with pace and wit. Mr. Lynn is briskly present, Eddie Albert is practically perfect as the young zany of swing who intermittently thinks of suicide. The rest of the cast is in excellent order. But as the elderly gentleman who feels his youth coming back Mr. Winninger almost steals the show. He's an innocent at heart, even in a naughty escapade. We're sure his wife forgave him and he promised never to skip leash again. But the cherubic marksman set a mischievous precedent with all those arrows.

1320-> At the Capitol
Since one series-musical always invites comparison with others of the same chronological category, it may be helpful to declare at once that, merely by the addition of Fred Astaire and some sparkling Cole Porter tunes, "Broadway Melody of 1940" (at the Capitol) becomes appreciably superior to the last edition. The staples notably El anor Powell and a sumptuous Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer production, are still there and so is the customary hypocritical plot, comfortably designed with large gaps into which carefully prefabricated "production numbers" may duly be fitted. The job of joinery this time is workmanlike and not too colossal for comfort, and Mr. Astaire's rhythmic arabesques, incidentally, seem even more fascinatingly intricate than ever before.Miss Powell, formerly a soloist herself, blends in beautifully with the inexorably logical Astaire patterns, especially in the most ambitious number, in which Mr. Porter's already familiar song, "Begin the Beguine," is elaborately translated into dance terms. On the other hand, even the small demands made on her talents by the film's few dramatic passages continue to be too much for her, and the final impression of her characterization continues to be the memory of a professional smile, turned on and off, like an essentially unamused neon. Mr. Astaire, realizing its epic unimportance, manages his part more gracefully, pretending to be a cheap dance-hall hoofer or the greatest tripper in the world with equally good-humored nonchalance.The parade of production numbers this time is agreeably and plausibly lightened with interpolated specialty acts, a bit of inspired jugglery from Trixie Firschke, and a burlesque prima-donna who is so bad, in an amusing way, that she succeeds in screaming herself right out of the official cast of characters. George Murphy as Astaire's loyal partner of dance-hall days, Frank Morgan as a theatrical producer who specializes in discovering a rather specialized form of talent, Ian Hunter as his worried junior partner, and Florence Rice as a decorative damsel are all according to the best Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer specifications.It may be just another "Broadway Melody," but with the Messrs. Astaire and Porter to give it wit and point, it seems much more convincingly Broadway, and much more than usually melodious. BROADWAY MELODY OF 1940, screen play by Leon Gordon and George Oppenheimer from a story by Jack McGowan and Dore Schary; music and lyrics by Cole Porter; directed by Norman Taurog; produced by Jack Cummings for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.Johnny Brett . . . . .
